Thu Dec 05 2024 02:07:57 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	South Koreas National Assembly To Vote on President Yoons Impeachment on 07 Dec 19:00 	The Democratic Party of Korea has decided to push for a plenary vote on the impeachment bill of President Yoon Seok-yeol on 07 Dec. According to Yonhap, 'the requirement for passing an impeachment bill is the approval of more than two-thirds of the registered members, so 200 of the 300 registered members must vote in favor. Considering that there are 192 pan-opposition seats, at least 8 votes from the ruling party must be cast for it to be passed.' Once Yoon is impeached, he will be immediately stripped of his presidential powers, and power over the country will be transferred to South Korea's prime minister, Han Duck-soo, a member of Yoon's political party. 	https://img4.yna.co.kr/photo/yna/YH/2024/12/05/PYH2024120500030001300_P4.jpg	Reliable	Confirmed	DPRK & Korean Peninsula	Yonhap News	https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20241205050551001	Tanner Porter		***Test Group***	4 | ðŸŸ¢ Low-Risk Incident	37.54947601873481, 126.98955285945631	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Thu Dec 05 2024 04:48:03 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Assad Forces Withdraw From Hama	Assad's General Command of the Army and Armed Forces announced that they're withdrawing from the city of Hama in order to 'preserve the lives of civilians.' The city has effectively fallen to HTS forces, paving the way for rebel forces to begin their offensive towards Homs and secure the Western coast of Syria. According to the announcement 'Over the past few days, our armed forces have fought fierce battles to repel and thwart the violent and successive attacks launched by terrorist organizations on the city of Hama from various axes and in huge numbers, using all means and military equipment and using the immersive groups. During the past hours, with the intensification of confrontations between our soldiers and the terrorist groups and the rise of a number of martyrs among our forces, those groups were able to penetrate several axes in the city and enter it, despite suffering heavy losses in their ranks. In order to preserve the lives of civilians in Hama and not to involve them in battles inside the cities, the military units stationed there redeployed and repositioned themselves outside the city. The General Command of the Army and Armed Forces affirms that it will continue to carry out its national duty in reclaiming the areas that terrorist organizations have entered.'	https://s.france24.com/media/display/8e7a362e-b285-11ef-9224-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000_36PE8MB.jpg	Fairly Reliable	Confirmed	MENA Regional Tensions	General Command of the Army and Armed Forces	https://t.me/aleamaliaat_aleaskaria/222	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	4 | ðŸŸ¢ Low-Risk Incident	35.13953766008716, 36.75470687170444	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg
Thu Dec 05 2024 05:51:02 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Syrian Rebels Likely to Push for Homs	Following the fall of Hama within the past hours to Syrian Rebels, pro-Assad media outlets are now reporting that HTS is bringing heavy reinforcements towards Hama, likely in preparation for a possible offensive to Homsâ€”a move that would see the rebels within striking distance of Damascus. Earlier today, it was reported that HTS was asking their fighters to leave Aleppo to focus on fighting in the frontlines. In context, 'HTS has a rule where they don't place armed men in cities, they're only positioned at military posts, checkpoints, or the frontlines. They believe that having armed men walking around in heavily populated areas needlessly scares people.'	https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241204-hama-tanks-wc-0957-1e6657.jpg	Fairly Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	Rerum Novarum Intel	https://t.me/rnintel/22482	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	4 | ðŸŸ¢ Low-Risk Incident	35.125142043152046, 36.74848237799119	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg
Sat Dec 07 2024 22:11:25 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	After 53 Years of Power in Syria, the Assad Family Loses Its Grasp on the Country	Damascus has fallen to anti-Assad rebels, and Bashar al-Assad himself has fled the country. This comes just 10 days after the Syrian civil war reignited, and HTS forces began making advances towards Damascus, quickly capturing Aleppo, and ultimately marching through Hama and Homs before other rebel groups rose up throughout Syria and began mopping up pro-Assad forces. SAA soldiers have been seen through numerous online videos blending back into the civilian populations, and deserting their units to Iraq. The last strongholds of Assad's forces light in Western Syria, near Russia's military base in Tartus. As of now, Russia is evacuating its forces from the region, and the area will likely be brought under the control of the HTS within the coming days. The Syrian Army Command has also notified its officers that the regime has collapsed. Syria's Prime Minister appears to still be in power, as he has stated that ' he was ready to support the continuity of governance and prepared to cooperate with any leadership chosen by the Syrian people.'	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Syrian_Civil_War_map.svg/800px-Syrian_Civil_War_map.svg.png	Reliable	Confirmed	MENA Regional Tensions	Reuters	https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-rebels-celebrate-captured-homs-set-sights-damascus-2024-12-07/	Tanner Porter		Global Intelligence, Conflict Zones - Middle East	3 | ðŸŸ¡ Moderate-Risk Incident	33.50433535310968, 36.277606011395015	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg
Sat Dec 07 2024 22:33:55 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Israeli Forces Enter Syria, May Potentially Occupy the U.N.D.O.F. Zone	As Damascus falls, and rebel groups assume control over Syria, Israel has strengthened its deployments in the Golan Heights, with a released assessment indicating that the IDF has pushed into the Qunetira area of the U.N.D.O.F. zone between the Golan Heights and Syria to 'strengthen the defense of the border.' It is unclear whether the IDF intends to assume control of the entire U.N.D.O.F. zone, but has stated that 'the IDF has deployed troops in the buffer zone and in a number of areas that are necessary to defend, in order to ensure the security of the communities in the Golan  Heights and the citizens of Israel,' and that the move comes following the determination that a risk exists of the 'the possibility of gunmen entering the buffer zone.' The IDF has also 'decided that in the four Druze settlements in the Golan Heights there will be no school classes today' and has deployed 'roadblocks along the Golan Heights.' 'Agricultural areas adjacent to the Syrian border have been declared a closed military area.' The IDF has clarified they are not intervening in the events ongoing in Syria.	https://i.ibb.co/MD7n2jt/image.png	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	Times of Israel	https://t.me/manniefabian/49785	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	3 | ðŸŸ¡ Moderate-Risk Incident	33.12401609123752, 35.82489502346681	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg
Sun Dec 08 2024 00:14:29 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	SNA Announces Manbij Operation Targeting Kurdish-held Regions Bordering Turkey	The Syrian National Army (SNA) announced the beginning of Operation Manbij, an operating designed to target Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) control on the area. The SDF is the Kurdish Autonomous Region military force, currently backed by the United States, where as the SNA is a Turkish-backed rebel force that has been cooperating with the HTS for the ouster of Assad. The SNA has specifically attempted to target the SDF over the past 10 days as the Syrian Civil War reignited. The statement released by the SNA explicitly announced that its goal is to 'eliminate the separatist project in Northern Syria.' It is likely that despite the coming conclusion of the rebellion against Assad, and the establishment of a new government, that fighting will continue in Northern Syria between Kurdish forces and Turkish backed elements. The HTS has not directly targeted SDF troops.	https://i.ibb.co/9HtjSNk/image.png	Usually Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	MN Intel	https://x.com/mintelworld/status/1865662888213393451	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	4 | ðŸŸ¢ Low-Risk Incident	36.52790424480788, 37.955016582683015	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Regardless of the veracity of the reports, Manbij is currently seeing extensive levels of fighting, including shelling by Turkish forces as they target PKK/YPG forces, elements of the SDF. This comes as fighting against the remnants of Assad forces is expected to be completed in the coming days, with the political aftermath becoming increasingly uncertain, as rebel groups seek to consolidate power.	https://i.ibb.co/2WRyWkk/Screenshot-2024-12-08-034629.png	Fairly Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	RN Intel	https://t.me/rnintel/22903	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	4 | ðŸŸ¢ Low-Risk Incident	36.526527187743234, 37.95158339721685	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Just as Latakia is announced to be under the control of Syrian rebels, it appears that Russian forces are evacuating the city. Only the Tartus naval base and  Latakia airfield, including neighboring Jablah appear to still be under any semblance of control by pro-Assad forces.	https://i.ibb.co/Xb3PBJK/GSOCIsrael-Daily-1000x600.png	Usually Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	OSINT Technical	https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1865720658409431386	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	4 | ðŸŸ¢ Low-Risk Incident	34.90834015389691, 35.87909451022576	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

At the same time, Israeli forces have officially moved to occupy and station forces along the boundaries of the U.N.D.O.F. zone along the Golan Heights. The move is reportedly being made in cooperation with the U.N. station forces there as a persistent threat has emerged from rebel groups in the area. According to the WSJ, Israel's primary concern, and likely purpose of the strikes, is to prevent Iran from reviving its influence in the country, and remove potential threats to Israel.	https://i.ibb.co/DrZXbWw/GSOCIsrael-Daily-1000x600.png	Reliable	Confirmed	MENA Regional Tensions	Wall Street Journal	https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/syria-civil-war-damascus/card/israel-seeking-to-keep-iran-out-of-syria-GS1oq9JUsGkp8pfjwzRe	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	3 | ðŸŸ¡ Moderate-Risk Incident	33.51243005236734, 36.2778002159454	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg
