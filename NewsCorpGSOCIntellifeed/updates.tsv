Fri Oct 25 2024 20:30:41 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	Israel Concludes Attacks Against Iran	Following three waves of attacks, targeting Air Defense sites, missile warehouses, and drone production facilities, Israel has concluded its retaliation against Iran for its ballistic missile strikes undertaken several weeks ago. Israel has dubbed the operations 'Days of Repentance.' The first wave of the strikes specifically targeted Iranian air defense systems as well as radar sites throughout Syria and Iraq involving over 100 Israeli fighter jets, including F-35's. The second and third wave of attacks targeted the missile launch sites, missile, and drone production facilities within Iran, and reportedly included Israeli UAV's. Iran initially downplayed the attacks before subsequently vowing a retaliation against Israel. The scope and scale of the attacks are unknown at this time.	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1160439467669192745/1299523557465915392/GaxkAeDWoAACnVT.png?ex=671d8320&is=671c31a0&hm=744d53d874b6979f339d920f1c1026468c7c517b3c6124e89332fa1399f443f4&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=705&height=469	Reliable	Confirmed	MENA Regional Tensions	IDF	https://t.me/idfofficial/11775	Tanner Porter	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg
Sat Oct 26 2024 14:32:56 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	Plausible Iranian Response	Following Israel's overnight attack yesterday morning, Iran has held several high-level meetings in Tehran to determine the scope of Iran's response against Israel. Reports on the damage wrought on Iran vary, with some assessments indicating minimal damage, with other pointing to extensive damage over Iran's missile and drone production capabilities, as well as the crippling of their air defense network over Western Iran. According to Israeli intelligence, 12 'planetary mixers' were attacked in the retaliation strikes, facilities which create the critical fuel components of Iran's ballistic missile program. These mixers cannot be independently developed within Iran, and mujst be imported from China. Replacement of the facilities could take at least a year, Additionally, Israeli intelligence pointed to four S300 (Russian-supplied) air defense batteries that were struck during the assault. The defense batteries specifically protected Iran's nuclear and energy facilities, opening up areas for future Israeli attacks should Iran respond.	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1160439467669192745/1299742150635950160/image0.jpg?ex=671e4eb4&is=671cfd34&hm=7315a6591036348f0ef321f4eb399ee7971710347d752193ef0fa48f155d681b&=&format=webp&width=705&height=822	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/25/world/israel-lebanon-gaza-iran	Tanner Porter	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg
