Reports on the damage wrought on Iran vary, with some assessments indicating minimal damage, with other pointing to extensive damage over Iran's missile and drone production capabilities, as well as the crippling of their air defense network over Western Iran. According to Israeli intelligence, 12 'planetary mixers' were attacked in the retaliation strikes, facilities which create the critical fuel components of Iran's ballistic missile program. These mixers cannot be independently developed within Iran, and mujst be imported from China. Replacement of the facilities could take at least a year, Additionally, Israeli intelligence pointed to four S300 (Russian-supplied) air defense batteries that were struck during the assault. The defense batteries specifically protected Iran's nuclear and energy facilities, opening up areas for future Israeli attacks should Iran respond.	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1160439467669192745/1299742150635950160/image0.jpg?ex=671e4eb4&is=671cfd34&hm=7315a6591036348f0ef321f4eb399ee7971710347d752193ef0fa48f155d681b&=&format=webp&width=705&height=822	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/25/world/israel-lebanon-gaza-iran	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Sat Oct 26 2024 17:33:20 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	Iranian Response To Israel Almost Certain	Despite U.S. hopes that Israel's recent strikes will lead to the end of direct exchanges between Israel and Iran, and allow efforts to focus solely on Gaza and Lebanon, Iran has sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, stating that 'Iran has the legal and legitimate right to respond to the Zionist Aggression.' Israel itself is of the firm belief that an Iranian response is assured, that it is 'impossible for [Iran] to do nothing after attack in Tehran.' Israeli officials also noted that the circumstances of a subsequent Israeli retaliation would be different, stating that the 'US election will be over and the IDF closer to achieving its objectives in Lebanon, giving Israel more flexibility to hit a wider scope of Iranian assets.' While Iran is attempting to downplay the sope of the 26 Oct strikes, Israel believe the true scope of the attack was much more severe.	https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2024/08/07/07c7ac31-e53c-4726-aab0-5502acf68e3c/07c7ac31-e53c-4726-aab0-5502acf68e3c_16x9_1200x676.jpg	Usually Reliable	Possibly True	MENA Regional Tensions	Iran Radar	https://twitter.com/IsraelRadar_com/status/1850302884560429423	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

The facility was reportedly part of an effort to develop the nuclear weapons, but appeared outwardly to only be conducting nuclear research for civilian purposes only. Officials stated that the site was so top secret that only 'a small part of the Iranian government knew about this, but most of the government did not.' The nuclear site that was struck was only discovered by Israeli and U.S. intelligence in early 2024, and the site was not part of Iran's 'declared' nuclear program, and thus they could not acknowledge the attack without admission to violating their nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The Israeli attack on the facility was apparently meant to send more of a warning than to actually disrupt their program, sending a message that Israel knew of their Iran's most top secret projects.	https://images.axios.com/gH4X1K-oIprjiT-hu9XR3KmCtT8=/0x0:8000x4500/1920x1080/2024/11/15/1731648571408.jpg?w=1920	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	Axios	https://www.axios.com/2024/11/15/iran-israel-destroyed-active-nuclear-weapons-research-facility	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Tue Nov 19 2024 10:03:43 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Russia Prepares Nuclear Defense Mobile Shelters	Russia is making nuclear preparations following todays escalation in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, when Ukraine launched six ATACAM Ballistic missiles at a Russian ammunition depot, with Russia reporting they intercepted five of the missiles. The U.S. policy change which enabled the strikes came two days ago, and since then Russia has made renewed threats of nuclear retaliation, and going so far as to revises its nuclear doctrine to essentially allow Putin to retaliate with nuclear strikes under any scenario he sees fit, according to Hans Kristensen, the Director of the Nuclear Information Project, Federation of American Scientists. In light of the change, EurAsia Daily has reported that Russia has begun mass production of mobile shelters capable of withstanding nuclear strikes. The shelters allow occupants to stay inside for up to 48 hours, and can fit 54 people inside. The shelter can be transported either by road or rail to any location Russia requires, and takes less than 3 months to manufacture. The step may indicate Russia is increasingly embracing an eventual use of nuclear weapons, and the consequences that would almost certainly result.	https://img6.eadaily.com/r650x650/o/d48/2cb9f09b2a16b0128b42a5f3f0148.jpeg	Reliable	Probably True	Russia-Ukraine Conflict	EurAsia Daily	https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/11/19/is-russia-preparing-to-defend-against-a-nuclear-strike-mass-production-of-mobile-shelters-has-begun	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

The initial warning had masqueraded as Ukrainian military intelligence and was spread throughout messengers such as telegram, and other social networks. The message specifically warned of a 'threat of a particularly massive missile and bomb strike on Ukrainian cities' occurring on 20 Nov. The message apparently contained a number of grammatical errors that Ukraine associates with Russian information and psychological operations. While yesterday's missile strike by Kyiv using U.S. provided ATACAM missiles against Russian military sites will likely spark some degree of escalatory response from Russia; it is likely that this warning and disinformation attempt is not it, but an attempt to spread hysteria.	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gc0_Pu5XAAArPJ_?format=jpg&name=small	Reliable	Probably True	Russia-Ukraine Conflict	Reuters	https://www.reuters.com/world/live-updates-ukraine-russia-us-embassy-kyiv-shuts-down-2024-11-20/	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

On Thursday, 'the IAEA Board of Governors censured Iran for failing to fully cooperate with the IAEA.' Today, the Khorasan reported that Iran will be activating the additional centrifuges which has been installed in August. This increases the total amount of operating centrifuges in Iran to 40,000. According to the most recent analysis, Iran has 182.3 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent, enough for four nuclear bombs. From 60 percent to weapons-grade, it could take Iran as little as a week to create its first nuclear bomb, a pace that would likely see its creation before Western intelligence services are able to find out, and respond. Additionally, 'the Iranian Parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Committee chairman threatened to withdraw from the nuclear weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty,' which would effectively pave the way for Iran to detonate a nuclear bomb and become a nuclear power.	https://www.fdd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Memo_HowCongressShouldRespondtoanInterimIranDeal_Infographics_v13_2-2-1024x819.jpg	Reliable	Confirmed	MENA Regional Tensions	Institute for the Study of War	https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-november-23-2024	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East, ***Test Group***			/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Currently, a massive wave of attacks is ongoing in Beirut, with large smoke clouds propagating from struck areas throughout the Southern suburbs, known to be Hezbollah's stronghold within the capital.	https://i.imgur.com/xFihMKl.jpeg	Fairly Reliable	Confirmed	Israel-Hezbollah Conflict	Rerum Novarum Intel	https://t.me/rnintel/20964	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East			/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

The ceasefire calls for an initial two month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance.

The base, located in Tartus, currently has five naval ships based there, but on the morning of 02 Dec, one of the vessels was seen departing the base, with other information reportedly stating that the other vessels have also left the base. Given Russia's active role in supporting Assad's regime against the rebels, they may likely become a target by the rebel groups. With its war in Ukraine, Russia is at a key disadvantage to support Assad's forces. According to the report 'it now appears possible that the port will eventually be attacked or abandoned. Certainly it appears likely that Russian warships are leaving the once safe port. It is expected that the warships will sail from the Mediterranean to the Baltic.
