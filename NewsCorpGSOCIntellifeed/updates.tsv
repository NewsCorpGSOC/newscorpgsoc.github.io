The second and third wave of attacks targeted the missile launch sites, missile, and drone production facilities within Iran, and reportedly included Israeli UAV's. Iran initially downplayed the attacks before subsequently vowing a retaliation against Israel. The scope and scale of the attacks are unknown at this time.	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1160439467669192745/1299523557465915392/GaxkAeDWoAACnVT.png?ex=671d8320&is=671c31a0&hm=744d53d874b6979f339d920f1c1026468c7c517b3c6124e89332fa1399f443f4&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=705&height=469	Reliable	Confirmed	MENA Regional Tensions	IDF	https://t.me/idfofficial/11775	Tanner Porter	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Reports on the damage wrought on Iran vary, with some assessments indicating minimal damage, with other pointing to extensive damage over Iran's missile and drone production capabilities, as well as the crippling of their air defense network over Western Iran. According to Israeli intelligence, 12 'planetary mixers' were attacked in the retaliation strikes, facilities which create the critical fuel components of Iran's ballistic missile program. These mixers cannot be independently developed within Iran, and mujst be imported from China. Replacement of the facilities could take at least a year, Additionally, Israeli intelligence pointed to four S300 (Russian-supplied) air defense batteries that were struck during the assault. The defense batteries specifically protected Iran's nuclear and energy facilities, opening up areas for future Israeli attacks should Iran respond.	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1160439467669192745/1299742150635950160/image0.jpg?ex=671e4eb4&is=671cfd34&hm=7315a6591036348f0ef321f4eb399ee7971710347d752193ef0fa48f155d681b&=&format=webp&width=705&height=822	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/25/world/israel-lebanon-gaza-iran	Tanner Porter	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Sat Oct 26 2024 17:33:20 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	Iranian Response To Israel Almost Certain	Despite U.S. hopes that Israel's recent strikes will lead to the end of direct exchanges between Israel and Iran, and allow efforts to focus solely on Gaza and Lebanon, Iran has sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, stating that 'Iran has the legal and legitimate right to respond to the Zionist Aggression.' Israel itself is of the firm belief that an Iranian response is assured, that it is 'impossible for [Iran] to do nothing after attack in Tehran.' Israeli officials also noted that the circumstances of a subsequent Israeli retaliation would be different, stating that the 'US election will be over and the IDF closer to achieving its objectives in Lebanon, giving Israel more flexibility to hit a wider scope of Iranian assets.' While Iran is attempting to downplay the sope of the 26 Oct strikes, Israel believe the true scope of the attack was much more severe.	https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2024/08/07/07c7ac31-e53c-4726-aab0-5502acf68e3c/07c7ac31-e53c-4726-aab0-5502acf68e3c_16x9_1200x676.jpg	Usually Reliable	Possibly True	MENA Regional Tensions	Iran Radar	https://twitter.com/IsraelRadar_com/status/1850302884560429423	Tanner Porter	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

(2) All Israeli aircraft returned safely, contrary to claims made in Iranian media that they successfully shot down aircraft. (3) Israel laid the groundwork for future strike should Iran respond. The achievements of the strikes has left Iran extremely vulnerable to future attacks. The scope of the strikes themselves will likely be viewed internationally as a minor escalation.
