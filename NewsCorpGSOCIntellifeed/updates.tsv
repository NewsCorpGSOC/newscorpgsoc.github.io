Reports on the damage wrought on Iran vary, with some assessments indicating minimal damage, with other pointing to extensive damage over Iran's missile and drone production capabilities, as well as the crippling of their air defense network over Western Iran. According to Israeli intelligence, 12 'planetary mixers' were attacked in the retaliation strikes, facilities which create the critical fuel components of Iran's ballistic missile program. These mixers cannot be independently developed within Iran, and mujst be imported from China. Replacement of the facilities could take at least a year, Additionally, Israeli intelligence pointed to four S300 (Russian-supplied) air defense batteries that were struck during the assault. The defense batteries specifically protected Iran's nuclear and energy facilities, opening up areas for future Israeli attacks should Iran respond.	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1160439467669192745/1299742150635950160/image0.jpg?ex=671e4eb4&is=671cfd34&hm=7315a6591036348f0ef321f4eb399ee7971710347d752193ef0fa48f155d681b&=&format=webp&width=705&height=822	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	New York Times	https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/25/world/israel-lebanon-gaza-iran	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Sat Oct 26 2024 17:33:20 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	Iranian Response To Israel Almost Certain	Despite U.S. hopes that Israel's recent strikes will lead to the end of direct exchanges between Israel and Iran, and allow efforts to focus solely on Gaza and Lebanon, Iran has sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, stating that 'Iran has the legal and legitimate right to respond to the Zionist Aggression.' Israel itself is of the firm belief that an Iranian response is assured, that it is 'impossible for [Iran] to do nothing after attack in Tehran.' Israeli officials also noted that the circumstances of a subsequent Israeli retaliation would be different, stating that the 'US election will be over and the IDF closer to achieving its objectives in Lebanon, giving Israel more flexibility to hit a wider scope of Iranian assets.' While Iran is attempting to downplay the sope of the 26 Oct strikes, Israel believe the true scope of the attack was much more severe.	https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2024/08/07/07c7ac31-e53c-4726-aab0-5502acf68e3c/07c7ac31-e53c-4726-aab0-5502acf68e3c_16x9_1200x676.jpg	Usually Reliable	Possibly True	MENA Regional Tensions	Iran Radar	https://twitter.com/IsraelRadar_com/status/1850302884560429423	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

The facility was reportedly part of an effort to develop the nuclear weapons, but appeared outwardly to only be conducting nuclear research for civilian purposes only. Officials stated that the site was so top secret that only 'a small part of the Iranian government knew about this, but most of the government did not.' The nuclear site that was struck was only discovered by Israeli and U.S. intelligence in early 2024, and the site was not part of Iran's 'declared' nuclear program, and thus they could not acknowledge the attack without admission to violating their nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The Israeli attack on the facility was apparently meant to send more of a warning than to actually disrupt their program, sending a message that Israel knew of their Iran's most top secret projects.	https://images.axios.com/gH4X1K-oIprjiT-hu9XR3KmCtT8=/0x0:8000x4500/1920x1080/2024/11/15/1731648571408.jpg?w=1920	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	Axios	https://www.axios.com/2024/11/15/iran-israel-destroyed-active-nuclear-weapons-research-facility	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Tue Nov 19 2024 10:03:43 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Russia Prepares Nuclear Defense Mobile Shelters	Russia is making nuclear preparations following todays escalation in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, when Ukraine launched six ATACAM Ballistic missiles at a Russian ammunition depot, with Russia reporting they intercepted five of the missiles. The U.S. policy change which enabled the strikes came two days ago, and since then Russia has made renewed threats of nuclear retaliation, and going so far as to revises its nuclear doctrine to essentially allow Putin to retaliate with nuclear strikes under any scenario he sees fit, according to Hans Kristensen, the Director of the Nuclear Information Project, Federation of American Scientists. In light of the change, EurAsia Daily has reported that Russia has begun mass production of mobile shelters capable of withstanding nuclear strikes. The shelters allow occupants to stay inside for up to 48 hours, and can fit 54 people inside. The shelter can be transported either by road or rail to any location Russia requires, and takes less than 3 months to manufacture. The step may indicate Russia is increasingly embracing an eventual use of nuclear weapons, and the consequences that would almost certainly result.	https://img6.eadaily.com/r650x650/o/d48/2cb9f09b2a16b0128b42a5f3f0148.jpeg	Reliable	Probably True	Russia-Ukraine Conflict	EurAsia Daily	https://eadaily.com/en/news/2024/11/19/is-russia-preparing-to-defend-against-a-nuclear-strike-mass-production-of-mobile-shelters-has-begun	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

The initial warning had masqueraded as Ukrainian military intelligence and was spread throughout messengers such as telegram, and other social networks. The message specifically warned of a 'threat of a particularly massive missile and bomb strike on Ukrainian cities' occurring on 20 Nov. The message apparently contained a number of grammatical errors that Ukraine associates with Russian information and psychological operations. While yesterday's missile strike by Kyiv using U.S. provided ATACAM missiles against Russian military sites will likely spark some degree of escalatory response from Russia; it is likely that this warning and disinformation attempt is not it, but an attempt to spread hysteria.	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gc0_Pu5XAAArPJ_?format=jpg&name=small	Reliable	Probably True	Russia-Ukraine Conflict	Reuters	https://www.reuters.com/world/live-updates-ukraine-russia-us-embassy-kyiv-shuts-down-2024-11-20/	Tanner Porter					/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

On Thursday, 'the IAEA Board of Governors censured Iran for failing to fully cooperate with the IAEA.' Today, the Khorasan reported that Iran will be activating the additional centrifuges which has been installed in August. This increases the total amount of operating centrifuges in Iran to 40,000. According to the most recent analysis, Iran has 182.3 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent, enough for four nuclear bombs. From 60 percent to weapons-grade, it could take Iran as little as a week to create its first nuclear bomb, a pace that would likely see its creation before Western intelligence services are able to find out, and respond. Additionally, 'the Iranian Parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Committee chairman threatened to withdraw from the nuclear weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty,' which would effectively pave the way for Iran to detonate a nuclear bomb and become a nuclear power.	https://www.fdd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Memo_HowCongressShouldRespondtoanInterimIranDeal_Infographics_v13_2-2-1024x819.jpg	Reliable	Confirmed	MENA Regional Tensions	Institute for the Study of War	https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-november-23-2024	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East, ***Test Group***			/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Currently, a massive wave of attacks is ongoing in Beirut, with large smoke clouds propagating from struck areas throughout the Southern suburbs, known to be Hezbollah's stronghold within the capital.	https://i.imgur.com/xFihMKl.jpeg	Fairly Reliable	Confirmed	Israel-Hezbollah Conflict	Rerum Novarum Intel	https://t.me/rnintel/20964	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East			/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

The ceasefire calls for an initial two month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance.

The base, located in Tartus, currently has five naval ships based there, but on the morning of 02 Dec, one of the vessels was seen departing the base, with other information reportedly stating that the other vessels have also left the base. Given Russia's active role in supporting Assad's regime against the rebels, they may likely become a target by the rebel groups. With its war in Ukraine, Russia is at a key disadvantage to support Assad's forces. According to the report 'it now appears possible that the port will eventually be attacked or abandoned. Certainly it appears likely that Russian warships are leaving the once safe port. It is expected that the warships will sail from the Mediterranean to the Baltic.

The stoppage of the attacks are also reportedly tied to the ongoing Hezbollah ceasefire.

According to Iran's foreign ministry, the cooperating agreement is expected to be signed during a 'bilateral visit.' Since the beginning of its war in Ukraine, Russia has rapidly expanded its cooperation with adversaries of the United States, specifically North Korea and Iran. Over the past year, its relationship with North Korea has developed to such a point that a military alliance was declared, and North Korean troops sent to fight Ukraine in Russia. This specific cooperation agreement is likely to involve the creation of a free trade zone between Iran and Russia, and see Iran's closer involvement with the Eurasian Economic Union. The agreement also comes in light of recent efforts by Iran to enrich its uranium stockpile to weapons grade, and speculation it may push for a nuclear weapon as Trump assumes office in the United States.	https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BC3KPERAPRJOVJV7EW7QNTKC7Q.jpg?auth=e8c25a95469b9f69c5a4f7ae0d7a2286be0ed1b332be6c03ea685a307615224e&width=640&quality=80	Reliable	Probably True	MENA Regional Tensions	Reuters	https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-delegation-arrives-iran-meeting-with-president-2024-12-23/?taid=676a7a6b7b2ec40001a68f7f&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter	Tanner Porter		Global Intelligence, Conflict Zones - Middle East	4 | 🟢 Low-Impact Incident	35.665057441213406, 51.28519735995994	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Thu Dec 26 2024 21:17:40 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Ukrainian Military Captures North Korean Soldier, Confirming DPRK Presence	Ukrainian special operation forces (SOF) battling in Kursk released a photo today via telegram of a 'suspected North Korean prisoner' captured during fighting in Russia. Evidenced by the photo, 'It is highly likely that the Ukrainian Defense Forces have captured the first North Korean soldier who fought on the side of the Russian military.' Also today, the Ukrainian National Intelligence Service stated 'We have confirmed through real-time information sharing with intelligence agencies of allied countries that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured.' Despite Western countries widely announcing that North Korea has sent ~11,000 soldiers into Russia to battle in against Ukraine in Kursk, both nations still deny the presence of North Korean troops on the battle field. The capture of the soldier follows a slate of recent videos depicting drones strikes attacking North Korean positions. On 23 Dec, Zelensky announced that more than 3,000, or ~30% of North Korean soldiers have already been killed or injured in fighting. The Ukrainian General Directorate of Intelligence noted that the North Korean Soldiers fighting against Ukraine 'have little experience with modern warfare, especially drones, and are using primitive tactics reminiscent of World War II.' This is despite claims that the North Korean soldiers sent to Russia were among the 'most elite' forces of North Korea.	https://www.chosun.com/resizer/v2/3K6BDE5L75GSPMYJYZQSBN7HLI.png?auth=26c0f36fce17961438a4a91cdcfc333424dd3435c5a3567e8f87e8ea44965d66&width=616	Fairly Reliable	Probably True	Russia-Ukraine Conflict	Chosun	https://www.chosun.com/international/international_general/2024/12/27/CHKODOFXMZASFL2CBMTMBYEXWM/	Tanner Porter		Global Intelligence, Conflict Zones - Ukraine	4 | 🟢 Low-Impact Incident	51.34251862281077, 35.23644451064624	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Fri Dec 27 2024 01:19:13 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Israel Strikes Beqaa Valley, Threatening Ceasefire Stability	The IDF confirmed the launching of airstrikes earlier today against targets in the Beqaa Valley. The targets were reportedly Hezbollah infrastructure, used to 'smuggle' arms between the Syria-Lebanon border at the Janta crossing. The IDF specifically stated 'These efforts are led by Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, which is responsible for smuggling weapons into Lebanese territory from Iran and its proxies and increasing Hezbollah's stockpile of weapons as much as possible . . . Since its establishment, Unit 4400 has constructed numerous strategic routes along the Syria-Lebanon border. During the war and as part of Operation Northern Arrows, the IAF conducted extensive intelligence-based strikes and eliminations targeting Hezbollah's Unit 4400 and various smuggling routes. These efforts included the elimination of the commander of Unit 4400 Muhammad Ja’far Qasir, in early October in Beirut, and his designated successor, Ali Hassan Gharib, a few weeks later in Damascus. With them, a number of senior terrorists from the unit were also eliminated.' The IDF has indicated that they will continue to conduct airstrikes so long as a threat of smuggling operations from Syria into Lebanon exists.	https://i.ibb.co/5shbDVz/image.png	Reliable	Confirmed	Israel-Hezbollah Conflict	Israel Defense Forces - Telegram	https://t.me/idfofficial/13301	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	4 | 🟢 Low-Impact Incident	33.85590740147274, 36.10307250949953	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Thu Jan 16 2025 06:14:34 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Possibility of Gaza Ceasefire Muddied After Israel Accuses Hamas of Last-Minute Changes	As the Israeli Cabinet was set to meet and vote on the earlier announced Gaza ceasefire, a list minute claim that Hamas 'backtracked on key understandings, including Israel’s veto over the identity of released prisoners,' has resulted in the delay of the vote. Netanyahu has 'accused Hamas of ''last-minute blackmail'', stating the deal cannot proceed until all terms are approved by mediators.' Israel reportedly plans to not schedule a government meeting until Hamas 'complies' with the announced agreement terms. The development comes as members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Ben Gvir and Smotrich, have attempted to gather support amongst the Israeli Knesset to cancel the announced agreement, and the delay may likely point to continued infighting within Netanyahu's cabinet. Should Ben Gvir and Smotrich choose to leave the Cabinet over the ceasefire, then Netanyahu's coalition will collapse, and elections triggered. Additionally, Hamas itself has denied the claims set forth by Netanyahu that they have reneged on any parts of the ceasefire agreement. The United States also announced that envoys from both Biden and Trump are currently in Doha working with Qatari and Egyptian mediators to resolve last minute issues and secure the agreement.

Thu Jan 23 2025 05:35:17 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	U.S. Private Security Contractors to Operate Within Gaza Netzarim Corridor Checkpoint	According to Axios, U.S. private security contractors will begin operating a key Gaza checkpoint, along the Netzarim Corridor, this week, deploying their personnel within the enclave. This will be the first deployment of U.S. private security personnel to Gaza in decades, and will operate as part of a multinational consortium that was established under the Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal. 'The role of the U.S. contractors will be to inspect Palestinian vehicles that move from southern Gaza to northern Gaza and make sure no rockets or other heavy weapons are being transferred.' According to the ceasefire deal, one of the demands was for 'all the Palestinians who will move north will go through security checks at the Netzarim corridor,' and that all vehicles traveling to Northern Gaza must go through only a single road that that must be inspected by a 'third party.' In this case, the U.S. private security contractors. The risk is significant for those deployed to that area.	https://images.axios.com/ppJ_iyfjQF8vd0jMFcns1Tn3jhg=/0x217:5760x3457/1920x1080/2025/01/23/1737636011746.jpg?w=1920	Reliable	Probably True	Israel-Hamas Conflict	Axios	https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/us-private-security-contractors-will-operate-key-gaza-checkpoint	Tanner Porter		Conflict Zones - Middle East	6 | ⚪ Negligible-Impact Incident	31.491004021529964, 34.452612247216116	/profileimages/Tanner_Porter_profile.jpg

Consequently, more civil unrest is possible if the decision is overturned by the Supreme Court. 	https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2022/12/08/ap_was_there_same_sex_marriage_62908_c0-128-3045-1903_s885x516.jpg?510293e20fe291e63ecb102f8354e22e7ca7db43	Reliable	Confirmed	Americas Conflict, Politics	ABC News 	https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/idaho-republican-legislators-call-scotus-reverse-same-sex/story?id=118217747	Diana Galindo		Conflict Zones - Americas	4 | 🟢 Low-Impact Incident	43.61562958026154, -116.20624763799786	/profileimages/Diana_Galindo_profile.jpg
Wed Jan 29 2025 12:04:43 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)	Trump Signs Laken Riley Act, A Law Making it Easier to Detain People in the US Illegally	President Donald Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law as his administration’s first piece of legislation. Under this law, people who are in the United States illegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes would have to be detained and potentially deported even before a conviction. The ACLU says the act can allow people to be “mandatorily locked up — potentially for years — because at some point in their lives, perhaps decades ago, they were accused of nonviolent offenses.” To critics, the measure has taken advantage of a tragedy (the death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student) and could lead to chaos and cruelty while doing little to fight crime or overhaul the immigration system.	https://www.youtube.com/live/6f_sRalAtqE	Reliable	Confirmed	Politics	PBS News	https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-signs-laken-riley-act-law-making-it-easier-to-detain-people-in-u-s-illegally	Jordy Magallanes		Global Intelligence	6 | ⚪ Negligible-Impact Incident	38.89785996964683, -77.03654053089572	/profileimages/Jordy_Magallanes_profile.jpg
