With all its militant struggle, the Yemeni resistance aims to do whatever 
it takes to stop the aggression against Gaza. Recently, the southern port 
of Eilat in occupied Palestine declared bankruptcy, made possible by 
Yemen's continued efforts to turn another ship around.

Their commitment to Palestinian liberation has been unceasing, despite the 
zionist entity's bombing of Hodeidah with US-manufactured F-35 warplanes. 
Responding to this attack that killed six and injured several more, Yemenis 
emerged with massive demonstrations and proclaimed, "No matter how much 
strike us... no matter what, we will not back down."

Yemen is proving to the world that they will never abandon Gaza. From Gaza 
to Yemen to Lebanon to Iraq, our enemies are the same: the zionist entity 
and the US empire! ?????

?Make no mistake, no matter who runs in the election, the Democratic Party 
and Biden will always have blood on their hands. He will go down in history 
as the President who killed more Palestinians than anyone else. And whoever 
they replace him with, enabled that same violence.? @ NerdeenKiswani (X)

Just two weeks ago, The Lancet revealed the shocking estimate that 186,000 
Palestinians have been killed in Gaza by direct fire, enforced starvation, 
and rampant spread of diseases.

In the face of the accelerating atrocities in Gaza, and rising fascist 
repression across Turtle Island, we must continue to organize and mobilize 
for an end to the genocide and for a free Palestine, from the river to the 
sea.

?Flood CUNY for Gaza!?

?? FBI: Most Wanted, a CBS show, is filming a fake encampment at Queens 
College to demonize the student intifada and manufacture consent for the 
genocide of Palestine.

CUNY4Palestine, Within Our Lifetime, and National Students for Justice in 
Palestine call for a Week of Rage to protest the filming of an FBI: Most 
Wanted episode at CUNY Queens College featuring a fictionalized Gaza 
Solidarity Encampment scene, complete with tents, a "chase and arrest" 
scene, and a mock-explosion.

This is a clear attempt to simultaneously demonize and profit from the 
Student Movement against the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This episode 
obfuscates the concrete demands of the Student Intifada: our universities 
must divest from settler colonialism and genocide and cut all ties with 
Israeli academic institutions.
