Terrorists with blood on their hands will be released to Gaza, Turkey, or Qatar. Stage 2: Release of all remaining living hostages in exchange for permanent ceasefire. The IDF will not fully withdraw troops from Gaza until the last remaining hostage is released.

Here’s what we know so far about the two-stage deal.Stage 1: Release of 33 hostages held in Gaza (dead and alive) based on the list Israel provided including female IDF soldiers, children, women, elderly men (above age 50), and men in the humanitarian category below the age of 50. Throughout the 42 days there will be partial withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza. The IDF will allow Palestinian civilians to return to their homes in northern Gaza starting on day 22 but returning vehicles will be inspected.

Following reports of a potential deal to secure the freedom of Israeli hostages while pausing military activity in Gaza and freeing Palestinian terrorists, the people of Israel are once again being tested, enduring the pain of loss and the hope for life. Our hearts are, as they have been since October 7, 2023, with the families of the hostages and those who have suffered the loss of their loved ones. The crimes against humanity that Hamas perpetrated on October 7 continue to reverberate, and we pray for the health, wellbeing and freedom of all the hostages. There are understandably many difficult emotions and responses at this time. We embrace all Israelis with love and solidarity, standing firm in the belief that the strength, humanity and resilience of the State of Israel will prevail!
