His partner, Efrat Katz, was tragically murdered that day. Efrat’s daughter and grandchildren—Doron Katz, Raz, and Aviv Asher—were also kidnapped but were released in the November 2023 hostage-ceasefire deal. Gadi, an avid potato farmer, was known for being like a grandfather to all who knew him.In addition to the three Israeli hostages expected to be released tomorrow, five Thai hostages kidnapped from southern Israel are also expected to be released after more than 480 days in Hamas captivity in Gaza.While the condition of the hostages remains unknown, and given Hamas' history of breaking agreements and undermining ceasefires, we approach this news with both hope and cautious optimism. We pray for the release of all 90 hostages held by Hamas and for their safe return to their families.🎗️💔	https://t.me/StandWithUsBreakingNews/5571	2025-01-29T07:43:17-08:00
