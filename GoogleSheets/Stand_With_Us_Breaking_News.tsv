Awarding this prize to an agency that employs individuals with blood on their hands, who took part in the Hamas October 7th massacre, would be a grave injustice to the victims of these crimes and to the legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize itself.	https://t.me/StandWithUsBreakingNews/4935	2024-10-10T12:30:07-07:00
