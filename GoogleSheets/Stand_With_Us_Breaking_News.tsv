It is set to begin tomorrow - 10 am (local time), Wednesday, November 27, 2024.🚨The war involved the firing of thousands of Hezbollah rockets, mortar shells, explosive drones, and more, causing devastating destruction. Over 60,000 people were displaced from northern Israel, and more than 70 civilians were murdered.In response, the IDF achieved significant military successes, including the elimination of Hezbollah’s top leadership, such as Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. The IDF also destroyed Hezbollah’s infiltration tunnels to Israel and neutralized most of the group’s rocket arsenal and many of its military assets. All of these and more led to Hezbollah to accept a ceasefire while disconnecting itself from the ongoing war in Gaza.	https://t.me/StandWithUsBreakingNews/5265	2024-11-26T11:51:56-08:00
