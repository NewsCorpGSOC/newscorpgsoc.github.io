Israel’s war is just, and it follows the law, unlike its enemies. The ICC’s pursuit of Israeli leaders undermines democracies fighting terrorism. We call for a review of Prosecutor Khan and for the US and its allies to sanction the ICC. The ICC is unfit for purpose.	https://t.me/StandWithUsBreakingNews/5223	2024-11-21T04:31:58-08:00
