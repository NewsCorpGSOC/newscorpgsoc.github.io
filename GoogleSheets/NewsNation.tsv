UN spokesman: 'We need diplomacy' after Lebanon explosions	(NewsNation) — Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, is urging diplomacy amid reports of more device detonations in Lebanon. Dujarric released a statement on behalf of Guterres requesting 'all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation.' The statement concluded saying the U.N. 'supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region.' Federal Reserve cuts interest rate for first time in 4 years Walkie-talkies and solar equipment exploded in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon on Wednesday, in an apparent second wave of attacks targeting devices a day after pagers used by Hezbollah blew up, state media and officials for the militant group said. At least 20 people were killed and more than 450 wounded in the second wave, the Health Ministry said. The attacks — which were widely believed to be carried out by Israel and targeted Hezbollah but also killed civilians — have increased fears that the simmering conflict could escalate into all-out war. Speaking to Israeli troops Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance.' He made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel’s army and security agencies, saying 'the results are very impressive.' Ozempic not only affects muscle mass but also bone density The new blasts hit a country still roiling with confusion and anger after Tuesday’s pager bombings, which killed at least 12 people, including two children, and wounded some 2,800 others. The second wave also deepens concern over the potentially indiscriminate casualties caused in the attacks, in which hundreds of blasts went off wherever the holder of the pager happened to be — in homes, cars, at grocery stores and in cafes, often with family or bystanders nearby.

Trump to New York: 'I'm asking for your vote'	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump returned to his home state to hold a rally in Long Island, New York, with 48 days left until Election Day. Trump, for his part, leaned heavily on his alarmist message about immigration at the rally in Uniondale, focusing the bulk of his remarks on the subject. 'We’re just destroying the fabric of life in our country. And we’re not going to take it any longer. And you got to get rid of these people. Give me a shot,' Trump said. In his nearly 90-minute address, Trump confirmed plans to visit Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, following unsubstantiated claims about Haitian migrants. He also campaigned for New York Republicans in crucial congressional races. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Trump addressed the recent decision by the Teamsters union not to endorse him, stating he was 'honored to receive the endorsement of rank and file Teamsters' despite the lack of official union backing. The former president accused Iran of hacking his campaign and providing materials to the Biden campaign, calling it 'foreign election interference.' Focusing on crime, Trump promised to 'stop the Kamala crime wave,' referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. He criticized the current administration's border policies, stating, 'I want to be known as your border president. Kamala will be known as your invasion president.' The former president also announced plans to officially designate the ground zero site at the World Trade Center as a national monument 'so the heroes there will be preserved for all time.' He ripped into Democratic leadership in New York City and state, blaming them for homeless people living in what he called 'horrible, disgusting, dangerous, filthy encampments,' and even the conditions on the New York City subway, which he called 'squalid and unsafe' and promised to renovate. 'What the hell do you have to lose?' he said in asking for their votes. Before heading out to the suburbs, Trump stopped at a Bitcoin cafe in New York City. Trump has recently embraced cryptocurrency and helped launch his family’s new cryptocurrency venture Monday night. While New York is generally considered to be a reliably blue state, the former president has said a few times over the last few months that he believes New York and neighboring New Jersey could be in play this year. There's not a lot of polling data coming out from the state, but a recent poll from Siena College taken in late July and early August gave Vice President Kamala Harris a 14-point advantage. In hopes of swaying voters, he's planning on focusing on key issues, including the cost of living in New York and how it's soared in recent years. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider On the border issue, Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, 'When they got in, they let everybody pour into our country. When I got elected, I believe it was the border that was the biggest thing and I fixed it and I did a great job,' Trump said. 'I wanted to mention it in 2020 and my people would say, 'Sir, nobody cares about the border.' They don't care because I had it fixed. Now I got to fix it again.' There hasn't been a lot of attention paid to New York, with pollsters focusing on major battleground states, but Trump is still doing his best to pitch his message to voters. That's especially true after 2022, when Republicans made some gains during the midterm election. However, one of those districts flipped back to Democrats after the resignation of GOP Rep. George Santos. But Republicans are still emphasizing the area, including Long Island, in hopes of retaining control of the House of Representatives and potentially picking up some new seats for the party. By holding a rally in Uniondale, Trump was focusing on an area that could be key to Republicans maintaining control of the House. His party is trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts that Joe Biden carried in 2020, particularly in coastal New York and California, and going on offense to challenge Democrats elsewhere. Long Island in particular features one of the most closely watched races, between first-term Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito and Democrat Laura Gillen. D’Esposito is a former New York police detective who won in 2022 in a district that Biden won by about 15 percentage points in 2020. Trump posted Tuesday on his Truth Social platform that the GOP has 'a real chance of winning' New York 'for the first time in many decades.' In that same post, Trump also pledged that he would 'get SALT back,' suggesting he would eliminate a cap on state and local tax deductions that were part of tax cut legislation he signed into law in 2017. The so-called SALT cap has led to bigger tax bills for many residents of New York, New Jersey, California and other high-cost, high-tax states, and is an important campaign issue in those states, particularly among those New York Republicans serving in districts Biden won.

Live: Fed cuts interest rate for first time in 4 years	(NewsNation) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, something it hasn't done in more than four years. Federal Reserve officials were able to do this as the post-pandemic spike in U.S. inflation eased further last month. Year-over-year price increases reached a three-year low. The White House has been feeling hopeful about the state of the current economy, with officials maintaining that America can pull off a 'soft landing' from inflation. The Fed's impact on the economy Whether this will affect Americans’ perception of the economy remains to be seen. With the election now less than 50 days away, the rhetoric on the campaign trail continues to ramp up around what voters are saying is their No. 1 issue. The economy has been one of the first topics to come up at both Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s rallies as they campaign for the presidency. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider Asked about it Tuesday during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Harris said she wants to deal with the economy 'head-on.' To do this, Harris said, she wants to employ and engage the private sector with tax credits, particularly homebuilders, to give them incentives to create new housing. Current President Joe Biden’s economic advisers wrote in a blog post published Tuesday night that the economic and job growth under his administration has 'surpassed projections.' Trump, meanwhile, has blamed Biden for what he calls a 'failed' economy. He's said that he wants to get people's energy bills down by 50% within 12 months if he wins the 2024 election. In addition, Trump wants to work with farmers, who he says are being 'decimated' right now. However, Trump has previously said that he disagrees with the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates and that it is 'something that they know they shouldn't be doing' ahead of the election in November. Inflation show signs of easing Last week's report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier. That's down from 2.9% in July and marked the fifth straight annual drop since February 2021. Between July and August, prices only rose by 0.2%. Cooling inflation has given American consumers some relief after price surges in food, gas and rent over the last three years. In mid-2022, inflation peaked at 9.1%, which marked the highest rate in four decades. A big factor in this was a third drop in gas prices in just four months. Average gas prices for August fell 0.6% from where they were in July and are 10.6% less than they were a year ago. Although they are still higher than they were three years ago, grocery prices remained unchanged from July to August. Grocery prices in the last year have only gone up by 0.9%, which is a pace they were at before the COVID-19 pandemic. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits People's paychecks have also risen steadily, though they are still growing at a solid pace that reduces inflationary levels. For the past 18 months, their overall incomes have outpaced inflation. According to the Census Bureau, the median inflation-adjusted household income rose 4% last year to above $80,000. Trends suggest inflation will keep slowing down, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell saying in a speech last month that it was coming under control.

Where is Diddy currently being held after arrest?	(NewsNation) — After being arrested Monday on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges, music producer Sean 'Diddy' Combs will likely be held in Manhattan's Metropolitan Detention Center, according to multiple media reports. A law enforcement official told CNN that Combs will likely be held by himself in a special housing unit inside the Brooklyn jail until his court appearance Wednesday afternoon. The Metropolitan Detention Center has been the primary federal detention center since 2021, when the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan closed after a number of issues that were exposed after Jeffrey Epstein's death. Problems plaguing the facility included lax security and crumbling infrastructure, the Associated Press reported. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Federal prosecutors Tuesday indicted Combs, alleging he abused, threatened and coerced women to fulfill his sexual desires. A federal judge ruled Combs will remain in custody while he awaits trial. Combs pleaded not guilty, and his attorney Marc Agnifilo said the defense team would appeal the bail decision during court Wednesday. Diddy at MDC Brooklyn There are 1,218 people at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is located in the Eastern New York Judicial District, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Like the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the MDC is also 'plagued by chronic understaffing, constant lockdowns, outbreaks of violence, delayed access to medical care, and a rash of suicides and death,' The Daily Beast reported. 'Several courts in this District have recognized that the conditions at Metropolitan Detention Center are not fit for pre-trial detention,' Combs' lawyers said in a motion they filed for bail Tuesday, per the news outlet. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? Mentioned by Combs' attorneys in their filing was a June 7 incident where Uriel Whyte, a man who had been at MDC for gun charges, was stabbed to death in the facility. Spectrum News New York reported that Whyte was awaiting trial on gun charges for two years. A second man named Edwin Cordero died after being injured in a jail fight in August. Cordero's lawyer, The New York Times reported, wrote about the 'awful' conditions his client faced in a June letter to a federal judge. The prison, Cordero's lawyer said, is 'an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.' Along with the deaths this past summer, suicides and an electrical fire in 2019 that caused those in the prison to be without heat and power for days have been reported at MDC. Despite objections from Combs lawyers, Magistrate Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky ordered Combs to be held in custody. 'I don’t know that I think you can trust yourself,' Tarnofsky was quoted by the NYT as saying in court Tuesday, mentioning his history of alleged violence and citing his flight risk.

Euthanasia, pronouns, sports betting: Intriguing 2024 ballot meas...	(NewsNation) — While voters may expect to see former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on their ballots along with other prominent names, voters in several states should expect to see ballot measures that will decide important issues. In 10 states, voters will decide whether to preserve or restrict abortion access, an issue that motivates voters to show up on Election Day, as evidenced in 2022. Meanwhile, eight states will choose whether or not to ban noncitizen voting in state-level elections, and an additional 10 states will decide on adopting or banning electoral systems like ranked-choice voting. But some ballot measures in 2024 will deal with somewhat lighter issues. Voters in Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Dakota and West Virginia will have some interesting decisions to make come Election Day, from legalizing sports betting to changing the design of the state flag. Breaking down the policies and issues that matter in 2024 Here's a look at five intriguing ballot measures that will be decided in November: Maine: New state flag design Voters in the Pine Tree State will decide whether they support replacing the existing state flag with a flag consisting of a pine tree and the North Star on a buff (light tan) background, often called the Pine Tree Flag, according to Ballotpedia. You can view the proposed design here. The current flag was established in 1909 and features the Maine coat of arms on a blue background. The coat of arms includes a moose and pine tree with a farmer and sailor on either side, with the North Star and a ribbon with the Latin phrase Dirigo, which means 'I direct.' The current Maine State Flag. (Photo By Encyclopaedia Britannica/UIG Via Getty Images) Ahead of the ballot measure coming to voters, the state held a design contest that received more than 400 submissions. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced the winning design by Adam Lemire, of Gardiner, in an August news release. She described it as a 'beautiful, faithful representation of an Eastern White Pine tree proper.' The measure has sparked debates about state identity, with supporters claiming the new design better represents Maine's heritage and natural beauty, while those opposed say changing the flag is unnecessary. Read more about Maine's State Flag Referendum here. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Massachusetts: Regulating access to psychedelic substances Massachusetts voters will consider whether to regulate access to five psychedelic substances for mental health treatment. The measure would allow a licensed 'facilitator' to prescribe the natural psychedelics as part of a mental health treatment. The natural psychedelic substances in question include plants and fungi that contain the following substances: dimethyltryptamine, mescaline, ibogaine, psilocybin and psilocin. The Drug Enforcement Administration classifies these psychedelics as Schedule I drugs, with 'high abuse potential with no accepted medical use.' Cannabis, which has been legalized for medical and recreational use in more than a dozen states, is still also classified as a Schedule 1 drug. In 2020, Oregon decriminalized the use of psychedelics and the first psychedelic treatment centers opened in 2023, according to Axios. In 2022, Colorado voters decriminalized the same five psychedelic chemicals as those on the ballot this year in Massachusetts. When does early voting begin in my state? Proponents argue that naturally occurring psychedelics have shown promise in treating depression, PTSD and anxiety. They claim regulation would ensure safe access for those who could benefit medically while maintaining controls to prevent misuse. Adam Zaffuto, a veteran from Pittsburgh, told 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that psychedelics dramatically improved his recovery. 'The side effects for me were immense amounts of self-love, immense amounts of self-transformation, an ability to be a better husband and a much more engaged father and to provide my daughter with the father that she deserves,' Zaffuto told NewsNation last year. 'My wife got her husband back and got the man that she married back.' Critics are concerned about the potential public health and safety risks, arguing more research is needed before such substances are made more widely available. 'We need larger studies. We need to see more long-term effects,' Virginia state Del. Wren Williams said last year. Missouri: Legalize and regulate sports betting NewsNation affiliate WDAF reported that a Missouri judge ruled a sports betting ballot initiative up for a vote in November would remain on state ballots. The constitutional amendment would permit the Missouri Gambling Commission to allow in-person and online sports wagering. Under the proposed initiative, at least $5 million annually in licensing fees and taxes would go toward problem gambling programs, with remaining tax revenues going toward elementary, secondary and higher education. 38 states and D.C. have legalized sports betting, according to Ballotpedia. Several neighboring states, including Illinois, Arkansas and Kansas, have already legalized sports betting. Without legalization, Missouri risks losing potential revenue from those who cross state borders to place bets. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day With strong support among Missouri’s professional sports teams, some are confident the measure could pass and pave the way to legal sports wagering in the state. One reporter told WDAF that Missourians regularly drive to neighboring states to place bets. 'Going to parking lots in kind of random industrial areas in Kansas City, Kansas and you look and you see the parking lots are just in and out with people with Missouri plates stopping on their phones maybe there for 5-10 minutes,' Ryan Butler, a Covers.com senior editor told WDAF. 'Every Sunday its lined up here,' said Austin Lewis, a Liberty, Missouri, man who drives to Kansas to place sports bets. 'Thirty-minute drive everyday, it's pretty much ready for it to be legal in Missouri.' Opponents are concerned about the potential for increased gambling addiction. Other opponents say the amendment provides greater financial benefit for out-of-state funders. One committee, called Missourians Against Deceptive Online Gambling, has earned support from nearby Missouri casinos and Caesars Entertainment. A new Emerson College/The Hill poll found that 52% of the respondents said they would support a sports betting measure in Missouri, 25% plan to oppose it and 23% were unsure. South Dakota: Amend constitution to remove male pronouns South Dakotans will decide whether to remove male-specific pronouns from the state constitution and replace them with gender-neutral language. This would involve changing words like 'he' and 'his' to terms like 'the person' or 'the governor's.' Nine state constitutions — California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont — use gender-neutral language, according to Ballotpedia. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues Proponents argue that this change is long overdue and would make the constitution more inclusive, reflecting the reality that women can and do hold all offices in state government. They say the amendment is about accuracy and equal representation, not political correctness. Critics argue the change is unnecessary. Some also express concerns about preserving the historical integrity of the document. West Virginia: Ban people from participating in euthanasia A controversial amendment to prevent physician-assisted suicide will be up for voters in November to decide. If this is approved, West Virginia would be the first state in the nation to formally do so. NewsNation affiliate WOWK reported that House Joint Resolution 28 proposes amending West Virginia’s constitution to prevent any medical professional from committing euthanasia, or from helping a patient commit suicide. Critics say current law already makes it illegal, but supporters argue it adds additional safeguards. 'It’s to help protect some of the most vulnerable people in our state. Those are individuals who have illnesses, that are going through a lot. And this will protect them from being encouraged to commit suicide,' said bill co-sponsor Del. Chris Pritt (R) Kanawha. 'Restoring Reproductive freedom, we should be voting on that. But the Republicans won’t let us vote on it because they know what the outcome will be, just like in every other state. So, instead, they put this meaningless Constitutional Amendment on that’s banning something that’s already banned,' said Del. Mike Pushkin, chair of the state Democratic Party.

It also passed the Senate by a similar margin. Even if physician-assisted suicide is outlawed, it will not prevent patients from choosing to stop taking lifesaving medications or stop them from enforcing DNR orders. At least 12 states currently have bills that would legalize physician-assisted death. Eight states and Washington, D.C., already allow it, but only for their own residents. Vermont and Oregon permit any qualifying American to travel to their state for the practice. Patients must be at least 18 years old, within six months of death and be assessed to ensure they are capable of making an informed decision. Two states including West Virginia have gone in the opposite direction. Kansas has a bill to criminalize further those who help someone with their physician-assisted death.

Explosions witnessed at Beirut funeral for Hezbollah members and ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s health ministry says one person was killed and over 100 were wounded on Wednesday by exploding electronic devices in multiple regions of country. The explosions came a day after an apparent Israeli attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah killed at least 12 and wounded nearly 3,000. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIRUT (AP) — Multiple explosions went off Wednesday at the site of a funeral for three Hezbollah members and a child killed by exploding pagers the day before, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported explosions in multiple areas of Lebanon, and a Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that walkie-talkies used by the group exploded as part of blasts heard in Beirut. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. There was no immediate detail on casualties. The new blasts come with Lebanon still thrown into confusion and anger after the Tuesday's pager bombings, which appeared to be a complex Israeli attack targeting Hezbollah members. At least 12 people were killed, including two children, and some 2,800 people wounded as hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members began detonating in several parts of Lebanon and in Syria. New details on the operation began to emerge. The pagers were made by a company based in Hungary, another firm said Wednesday. An American official said Israel briefed the United States after the attack, in which small amounts of explosive had been hidden in the pagers. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The attack, which Israel has not commented on, renewed fears that the simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into all-out war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the U.S. is still assessing how the attack could affect efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel began moving more troops to its border with Lebanon on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, according to an official with knowledge of the movements who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged fire almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led assault in southern Israel triggered the war. Since then, hundreds have been killed in the strikes in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, while tens of thousands on each side of the border have been displaced. Hamas and Hezbollah are allies and both are supported by Iran. Israeli leaders have issued a series of warnings in recent weeks that they might increase operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, saying they must put a stop to the exchanges to allow people to return to homes near the border. The AR-924 pagers used in Tuesday's attack were manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, which is based in the Hungarian capital of Budapest, according to a statement released by Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese firm that authorized the use of its brand on the pagers. Gold Apollo's chair, Hsu Ching-kuang, told journalists Wednesday the firm has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years. 'According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,' Gold Apollo said in a statement. BAC Consulting Kft. was registered as a limited liability company in May 2022, according to its records. It has 7,840 euros in standing capital, the records showed, and had revenue of $725,768 in 2022 and $593,972 in 2023. At the headquarters of a building in a residential neighborhood of Budapest, the names of multiple companies, including BAC Consulting, are posted on pieces of paper on a window. A woman who emerged from the building and declined to give her name said the site provides headquarter addresses to various companies. BAC's parent company is registered to Cristiana Rosaria Bársony-Arcidiacono, whose describes herself on her LinkedIn page as a strategic advisor and business developer. Among other positions, Bársony-Arcidiacono says on the page that she has served on the board of directors of the Earth Child Institute, a sustainability group. The group does not list Bársony-Arcidiacono as among its board members on its website. The Associated Press has attempted to reach Bársony-Arcidiacono via the LinkedIn page and has been unable to establish a connection between her or BAC and the exploding pagers. The attack in Lebanon started Tuesday afternoon, when pagers in their owners' hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that most of those hit were members or linked to members of Hezbollah — whether fighters or civilians — but it was not immediately clear if people with no ties to Hezbollah were also hit. The Health Ministry said health care workers and two children were among those killed. In the village of Nadi Sheet in the Bekaa Valley, dozens gathered to mourn the death of one of the children, 9-year-old Fatima Abdullah. Her mother, wearing black and donning a yellow Hezbollah scarf, wept alongside other women and children as they gathered around the little girl’s coffin before her burial. Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would continue its normal strikes against Israel as part of what it describes as a support front for its ally, Hamas, and Palestinians in Gaza. 'This path is continuous and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday,' it said. 'This is another reckoning that will come, God willing.' At hospitals in Beirut on Wednesday, the chaos of the night before had largely subsided, but relatives of the wounded continued to wait. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told journalists during a tour of hospitals Wednesday morning that many of the wounded had severe injuries to the eyes, and others had limbs amputated. Journalists were not allowed to enter hospital rooms or film patients. Abiad said the wounded had been sent to various area hospitals to avoid any single facility being overloaded and added that Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Egypt offered to help treat the patients. Earlier Wednesday, an Iraqi military plane landed in Beirut carrying 15 tons of medicine and medical equipment, he said. Experts believe explosive material was put into the pagers prior to their delivery. The AR-924 pager, advertised as being 'rugged,' contains a rechargeable lithium battery, according to specifications advertised on Gold Apollo’s website before they were removed after the attack. It claimed to have up to 85 days of battery life. That would be crucial in Lebanon, where electricity outages have been common after years of economic collapse. Pagers also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, making them more resilient in emergencies — one of the reasons why many hospitals worldwide still rely on them. For Hezbollah, the pagers also provided a means to sidestep what’s believed to be intensive Israeli electronic surveillance on mobile phone networks in Lebanon. 'The phone that we have in our hands — I do not have a phone in my hand — is a listening device,' warned Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a February speech. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said from the beginning of 2022 until August 2024, Gold Apollo has exported 260,000 sets of pagers, including more than 40,000 sets between January and August of this year. The ministry said that it had no records of direct exports of Gold Apollo pagers to Lebanon. ___ This story has been updated to correct the age of one of the children killed.

Senator demands debate communication between Harris, ABC	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Claiming ABC News was blatantly partisan in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris going into the presidential debate, a Republican senator is demanding the network turn over any communications it exchanged with Harris’ campaign before she took the stage with former President Donald Trump. 'On debate night, it became abundantly clear that ABC News and its respective moderators had a biased agenda,' Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, wrote in a letter to ABC News President ​​Almin Karamehmedovic and Harris’ campaign manager, Julie Chávez Rodriguez. 'Over 67 million Americans watched as a policy exchange between two presidential candidates quickly turned into a three-on-one debate against the Republican nominee,' Marshall added in the letter first reported by NewsNation. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Trump and allies have roundly complained that ABC News fact-checked the former president several times during the live broadcast while letting Harris go unchallenged. Some Trump supporters have gone further, alleging ABC News tipped Harris off to questions and treated her with kid gloves in the matchup. ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Marshall’s request for documents carries no force of law and so far does not have the support of fellow Republicans. Marshall’s letter seeks the ABC News turn over and publicly release any texts and emails with the Harris team to clear up any concern about coordination.

Here's what to consider	(NewsNation) — The recent decline in mortgage rates has more Americans looking to refinance, and the Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts could make refinancing even more attractive heading into 2025. In early August, refinance applications were up nearly 60% versus the same period a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The chance to refinance at a lower rate may be especially appealing for those who bought homes in 2023 when mortgage rates surged above 7%. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits 'If you've purchased a home in the past couple of years, you may want to take a look at where rates are today. That door to refinancing may well have opened up for you,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. However, the Fed's interest rate decision isn't the only factor that will influence your decision to refinance. Here's what else to consider. What is a refinance? Refinancing is when you replace your current mortgage with a new one, often with the goal of lowering your interest rate and monthly payments. Others may refinance to shorten the length of their mortgage or tap into their equity to raise money for a major purchase. There are two primary options for refinancing your mortgage. No-cash-out refinance: This is the most common option. It's for borrowers who want to refinance their existing mortgage at a lower interest rate and potentially get a better monthly payment. Those looking to move from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage might also consider a no-cash-out refinance. Cash-out refinance: If you've built up considerable equity in your home, this option allows you to get part of your equity back in cash. With a cash-out refinance, you're refinancing your mortgage for more than you currently owe. Generally, that means a higher mortgage rate, but cash-out refinances could make sense for those looking to make home improvements. Home loans: What are the differences and which one is right for me? Is it a good time to refinance? Whether or not it's a good idea to refinance will depend on your current loan and your reason for doing so. Generally, you'll want to wait until market rates have fallen below your existing mortgage rate to make sure you can get a better deal. While the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has dropped to 6.2% — the lowest level in 19 months — it's still more than double what it was three years ago. A recent Redfin analysis found that 86% of homeowners paying a mortgage had an interest rate below 6%, which means most homeowners may have a hard time getting a better rate if they refinanced today. For others, like those who bought homes last year when rates were above 7%, refinancing may be worth considering. What is mortgage insurance and why would you need it? As a general rule, refinancing could be worthwhile if you're able to reduce your mortgage rate by at least 1 percentage point, said Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com. At that point, the monthly savings start to look more attractive than the closing costs, which, according to Freddie Mac, average $5,000 on a refinance. McBride said homeowners with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) that's scheduled to reset in the next year may also want to consider refinancing sooner rather than later. 'You take advantage of the fact that fixed rates have come down, but you also lock in that certainty in terms of rate and monthly payment for years to come,' he said. Should I wait for interest rates to drop further to refinance? The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates multiple times before the end of the year, which could send mortgage rates lower into 2025. 'If you're just trying to refinance for rate and term, to get a lower rate, it might pay to wait here another six to nine months,' said McLaughlin. With that said, McLaughlin pointed out that timing the market is difficult because the Fed's benchmark interest rate isn't the only variable that affects home loans. Close Thank you for signing up!

'The risk in sitting back and waiting for rates to fall further before refinancing is that there are no guarantees,' McBride said. 'We'd expected mortgage rates to come down in the first half of this year and it didn't happen.' According to Fannie Mae's August housing forecast, the average mortgage rate is projected to be 6.2% in the first quarter of 2025 before gradually declining to 5.9% by the last quarter of the year. Even if mortgage rates continue to fall, both experts expect them to settle closer to 5% rather than the 2% to 3% rates seen during the pandemic. Remember, you can refinance as often as you want, but you'll usually have to pay closing costs each time. What should I consider before refinancing? There are several factors you should consider before refinancing. How much equity you have If your house is worth less than what you paid for it, then you might struggle to refinance your mortgage. Lenders often want applicants to have at least 20% equity before they consider refinancing a loan, according to Bankrate. Calculate your break-even point The break-even point is how long it will take to recoup your refinance closing costs. The bigger the rate drop, the shorter the break-even period. For example, if your refinance costs $5,000 and you are saving $100 per month compared to your previous loan, it will take 50 months to cover your costs. How long you'll be in the home If you plan to stay in the home long enough to recover the closing costs, then refinancing could make sense, but think twice if you intend to sell soon. Your debt situation If your personal credit history has become worse since you took out your initial mortgage, your refinanced rate could be higher than you expect. Improving your credit score from Bad (under 600 FICO) to Very Good (750–800) can lower your mortgage rate by 39 basis points, according to a recent Realtor.com report. Finding the best rate Shopping around can have a major impact on your mortgage rate with an average difference of 86 basis points between the least expensive and most expensive lenders, Realtor.com found.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/should-refinance-your-mortgage/	2024-09-18T07:30:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2155785262.jpg?w=900
Galaxy Gas: What is it and what are the dangers of misuse?	(NewsNation) — It started with a video of a man in a fast-food restaurant taking a hit from a flavored whipped cream canister called Galaxy Gas. He showed off how deep the can made his voice, racking up millions of views and shares as others followed. Now, when you search 'Galaxy Gas' on TikTok you’re met with a warning that some substances can be dangerous when misused. The app has scrubbed many of the viral clips, but that was after hundreds of thousands of similar videos were posted of people 'whiffing' Galaxy Gas to get high. The cans are easily available online or at big brand-name stores. When you visit Galaxy Gas’ website, you now must agree to a disclosure statement before scrolling. The company sent NewsNation a statement saying its products are for culinary use only, and misuse of any kind is prohibited. Indiana police seize nearly 124 kilos of cocaine in traffic stop What is Galaxy Gas? Nitrous oxide is so-called laughing gas. Dentists and doctors use it for procedures but say it’s not safe for teens to use without medical assistance because it could be deadly. 'These children have underdeveloped brains,' Dr. Sulagna Misra, founding physician at Misra Wellness, told NewsNation. 'They're getting instant gratification high, and there's no oversight. … You can die from one use of this. One prolonged, abnormal, wrong misuse, no supervision — you can die.' Titan submersible CEO was ‘a murderer’: Titanic expedition leader What are the long-term effects? A U.S. substance abuse study suggests that about 13 million Americans ages 12 and older had misused nitrous oxide in their lifetime. Misra said it’s all about reminding teens the short-term high isn’t worth the potential long-term brain damage. In the United States, the misuse of nitrous oxide is rising rapidly. 'People have this sort of super hero syndrome where they think nothing's going to affect them until they wind up in a hospital sick,' psychotherapist Dr. Lisa Palmer said. Misuse of nitrous oxide can impair the body’s metabolism of vitamin B12, which is essential for maintaining the insulation and protection of nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Long-term misuse can lead to range of neurological, blood-related and psychiatric complications, including nerve damage and psychosis, according to a January study from the Yale School of Medicine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/galaxy-gas-what-is-it-dangers/	2024-09-18T05:16:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1815420415.jpg?w=900
Pregnant migrants balance journey to childbirth, asylum	(NewsNation) — Leticia Alvarez didn’t realize she was pregnant when she left Venezuela, determined like millions of other asylum-seekers to trade the political persecution and hardships for new opportunities elsewhere. Alvarez learned she was 13 weeks pregnant in Panama after she developed intense belly pain early in her family’s trek to the Mexico-U.S. border. The news pushed the 25-year-old into a population of migrant women who navigate the already stressful process of giving birth while also seeking asylum in a new country. Abbott announces Texas crackdown on Venezuelan gang In 2021, President Joe Biden reversed a Trump-era policy that allowed pregnant women or nursing mothers to be detained by border officials. Despite the change, the American Civil Liberties Union submitted a petition with more than 900 signatures that called for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to change its policy to minimize harm to women who are pregnant, postpartum, or nursing, saying that mothers-to-be continue to be mistreated. Yet for Alvarez, pregnancy and migrant-related challenges pale to what she would have faced had she remained home. 'If I would have been pregnant in my country, I would be dead with my baby,' Alvarez told NewsNation in Spanish. Searching for a new life across the border Alvarez and her family needed 15 days to reach the U.S., traveling mainly by bus thanks to money she and her husband, Lisandro Escola, saved. But the couple, along with Alvarez’s sister, niece and niece’s father, also walked for two days, including through the treacherous jungles of the Darien Gap, a 60-mile stretch of rainforest that sits on the border of Colombia and Panama and connects Central and South America. The area is known to be dangerous, considering its tough terrain and steep mountains, but it has become a main thoroughfare for migrants making the journey to the southern border. 'It was exhausting because you fight to get out of the jungle, and (it was) traumatic because you see infinite amounts of things that are not told but are carried in the mind,' said Alvarez, who fell several times in the jungle. 'Once you start the trip, you don’t stop walking.' Anxiety filled Alvarez once she learned she was expecting, including fears she could lose her baby. Leticia Alvarez gave birth to her first child, Sophie, at Cook County Hospital in Chicago after making the journey from Venezuela. (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) She and Escola were separated from her relatives, who remained in Mexico City after they ran out of money. Alvarez and Escola crossed near McAllen, Texas, and surrendered to border officials. Alvarez was immediately released but said Escola was held at the Joe Corley Detention Center for seven months. She says she doesn’t know why. In late January, the Venezuelan government announced that it would halt repatriation flights from the U.S. as of Feb. 13 in response to the economic sanctions that the United States reimposed on Venezuela after previously lifting them in 2023, according to information provided by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. With her husband in federal custody, Alvarez flew to Chicago and then traveled by car to Indianapolis, where she worked a construction job. She says she worked from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, cleaning and helping lay ceramic tiles and flooring in a newly constructed building along with other duties. She saw a doctor only once in three months, fearing the cost. Alvarez saw her first Chicago doctor in early January. Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl, Sophia, who entered the world at 8 pounds, 9 ounces. Leticia Alvarez and her husband Lisandro Escola have been married since 2021 but were separated nearly all of Alvarez's pregnancy (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) Two weeks after that, Escola was freed from detention, but by then, Alvarez was carrying the emotional toll. 'Going through the pregnancy alone is very hard and very sad,' Alvarez told NewsNation. 'All you want is to be accompanied at that moment, and I was alone.' The costs of migrant pregnancy Over the past two years, the health system for Illinois’ largest county has treated more than 35,000 patients, including 670 pregnant women. The health system connects women to prenatal care and since 2022 has spent more than $30 million on migrant medical care, a spokeswoman for Cook County Health told NewsNation. Like Chicago-area locals facing economic hardship, migrants are eligible for financial assistance. Of those who apply, 99.5% receive a 100% discount, with the health system’s operating budget absorbing the costs, the spokeswoman said.

(Sandra Sanchez/Border Report Photo) In New York, which has processed more than 225,000 migrants, NYC Health + Hospitals assisted 300 babies born to asylum-seekers in 2023 while also contributing 2.1 million baby wipes, 400,000 diapers and 100,000 bottles of baby food and formula, National Public Radio reported last year. Border arrests rose slightly in August; Encounters at ports of entry hold steady In Denver, city officials have spent $90 million on migrants this year, some new arrivals who have given birth find difficulty adjusting. Denver Health, the city's safety net hospital, lost about $2 million in 2023, according to The Denver Post, which reported that the facility provided about $136 million in care it didn't receive compensation for. In the past year, the hospital provided medical care for 8,000 migrants from Central America, which made 20,000 visits to the hospital for care, including childbirth, the report said. The hospital's CEO told the newspaper that the facility isn't reimbursed by the state or federal government to cover the cost of migrant health care, which runs into the millions. Hospital officials did not immediately return an email from NewsNation seeking details on migrant childbirth costs absorbed by the health system. Ivanni Herrera was eight months pregnant when her family’s shelter assignment in Denver ended. She was told she could seek care at a local hospital, where the costs of her appointments and the baby’s delivery would be covered by Medicaid, according to The Associated Press. She declined the help. 'How could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?' she told the AP. Denver city officials have committed to keeping families off the streets and, in turn, have helped thousands of migrants gain work authorization. As she waits, Herrera has no means of regular income. She told the AP she owes $18,000 in medical bills because she forgot to sign up for Medicaid. 'I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,' she said. What Chicago migrant care looks like Doctors working within Illinois’ Cook County Health System say they strive to provide the same care to migrants and asylum-seekers as anyone else. The biggest challenge, however, is higher levels of fractured care experienced by migrants because of the countries from where they came from and the amount of time that may have passed since their last appointment. 'A pregnancy really can’t wait for you to be in the best possible place to get your care,' Dr. Mary Arlandson, an attending physician and OBGYN at Chicago’s Stroger Hospital, told NewsNation. Mexican drug cartels are operating in Southern Colorado, DEA says Doctors are not able to make up for lost time. But they can assess what care a woman needs at the time and help them navigate a pregnancy that is stressful even without challenges like learning a new city, a lack of work and finding transportation to appointments. 'The type of person who would take that journey is probably categorically different than the person who decides they’re not up for that,' Arlandson said. Since Sophia’s birth, Alvarez has struggled at times with postpartum depression. The family resides in a rented room as they await permanent living conditions. While Alvarez remains home with the couple's daughter, Escola said that her husband works construction from time to time and handles all of the young family's expenses. Alvarez says Sophia is adjusting as her parents wait for necessities like work authorizations and immigration court appearances. She says that ever since she learned she was pregnant, she has only thought about the opportunities that await her daughter if she and her husband can do their part. For now, things are as good as they can be. 'The baby is fine, thank God,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/pregnant-migrants-childbirth-asylum/	2024-09-18T03:00:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/LeticiaAlvarez.jpg?w=715
Hezbollah is hit by a wave of exploding pagers that killed at lea...	BEIRUT (AP) — Pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded near-simultaneously Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding several thousand, officials said. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. An American official said Israel briefed the United States on Tuesday after the conclusion of the operation, in which small amounts of explosive secreted in the pagers were detonated. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The Israeli military declined to comment. Among those wounded was Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon. The mysterious explosions came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. The pagers that blew up were apparently acquired by Hezbollah after the group’s leader ordered members in February to stop using cellphones, warning they could be tracked by Israeli intelligence. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the pagers were a new brand, but declined to say how long they had been in use. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the AR-924 pagers used by the Hezbollah militant group, but the devices were produced and sold by a company called BAC. At about 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, as people shopped for groceries, sat in cafes or drove cars and motorcycles in the afternoon traffic, the pagers in their hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that many of those hit were members of Hezbollah, but it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the exploding pagers. The blasts were mainly in areas where the group has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon, as well as in Damascus, according to Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official. The Hezbollah official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. The explosions came hours after Israel’s internal security agency said it had foiled an attempt by Hezbollah to kill a former senior Israeli security official using a planted explosive device that could be remotely detonated. The United States 'was not aware of this incident in advance' and was not involved, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. 'At this point, we’re gathering information.' Experts said the pager explosions pointed to a long-planned operation, possibly carried out by infiltrating the supply chain and rigging the devices with explosives before they were delivered to Lebanon. Whatever the means, it targeted an extraordinary breadth of people with hundreds of small explosions — wherever the pager carrier happened to be — that left some maimed. One online video showed a man picking through produce at a grocery store when the bag he was carrying at his hip explodes, sending him sprawling to the ground and bystanders running. At overwhelmed hospitals, wounded were rushed in on stretchers, some with missing hands, faces partly blown away or gaping holes at their hips and legs, according to AP photographers. On a main road in central Beirut, a car door was splattered with blood and the windshield cracked. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told Qatar's Al Jazeera network at least nine people were killed, including an 8-year-old girl, and some 2,750 were wounded — 200 of them critically — by the explosions. Most had injuries in the face, hand, or around the abdomen. It appeared eight of the dead belonged to Hezbollah. The group issued a statement confirming at least two members were killed in the pager bombings. One of them was the son of a Hezbollah member in Parliament, according to the Hezbollah official who spoke anonymously. The group later issued announcements that six other members were killed Tuesday, though it did not specify how. 'We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians,' Hezbollah said, adding that Israel will 'for sure get its just punishment.' Iranian state-run IRNA news agency said that the country’s ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, was superficially wounded by an exploding pager and was being treated at a hospital. Previously, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track and target them. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said videos of the blasts suggested a small explosive charge — as small as a pencil eraser — had been placed into the devices. They would have had to have been rigged prior to delivery, very likely by Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, he said. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based senior political risk analyst, said he spoke with Hezbollah members who had examined pagers that failed to explode. What triggered the blasts, he said, appeared to be an error message sent to all the devices that caused them to vibrate, forcing the user to click on the buttons to stop the vibration. The combination detonated a small amount of explosives hidden inside and ensured that the user was present when the blast went off, he said. Israel has a long history of carrying out deadly operations well beyond its borders. This year, separate Israeli airstrikes in Beirut killed senior Hamas official Saleh Arouri and a top Hezbollah commander. A mysterious explosion in Iran, also blamed on Israel, killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ supreme leader. Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby-trapped cellphones and it’s widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. The pager bombings are likely to stoke Hezbollah's worries about vulnerabilities in security and communications as Israeli officials are threaten to escalate their monthslong conflict. The near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have killed hundreds in Lebanon and several dozen in Israel, and have displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, deplored the attack and warned that it marks 'an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context.' On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel’s north and that time is running out for a diplomatic solution with Hezbollah. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Hezbollah lawmaker’s son killed by a pager blast. ___ Associated Press writers Hussein Malla, Hassan Ammar, Fadi Tawil and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran; Michael Biesecker in Washington; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Zeke Miller in Washington; and Edith M.

Titan submersible CEO was 'a murderer': Titanic expedition leader	(NewsNation) — The founder of OceanGate, who died in the Titan submersible implosion, was called a 'murderer' by a Titanic expedition leader after testimony revealed new details about the implosion. G. Michael Harris, founder of RMS Titanic, said Tuesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush was 'a complete, unequivocal narcissist, and in the end, a murderer.' 'He killed those people. He knew better,' Harris said, referring to the five individuals who died when the Titan imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreckage in June 2023. Titan implosion hearing: Key witness testifies on Day 2 The comments came as the U.S. Coast Guard conducted hearings into the disaster. Former OceanGate employees have testified about alleged mismanagement and safety lapses in the Titan's construction. One employee described Rush as more focused on making money than science, saying they had 'no confidence whatsoever' in the way the submersible was being built. Harris claimed that industry professionals had long harbored concerns about the Titan. 'We all knew about this. We all tried to reach out to him,' he said. The expedition leader also questioned why regulatory agencies hadn't intervened, calling it 'the biggest clown show in history.' Diddy indictment: Music mogul denied bail following indictment The hearings, which began this week, are expected to continue for 10 days. They include testimony from former employees and examinations of OceanGate's practices. Coast Guard investigators have released new evidence, including a photo of the Titan's wreckage on the ocean floor and an animation of its final journey. The submersible's last communication, sent moments before losing contact, indicated it was 'dropping two weights.' Harris speculated that this action was likely to slow the Titan's descent rather than attempt an emergency ascent as previously thought. He added that the victims likely died instantly.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/titan-submersible-ceo-murderer-titanic/	2024-09-17T16:11:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/snapshot-2-2.jpg?w=900
Samantha Tapp left a strange trail years after she vanished	Go behind the headlines as NewsNation’s 'Missing' investigates missing person cases from across the country, from cold cases to the latest developing stories. Tune into our latest case’s digital show each Friday where we speak to loved ones and examine the case. Subscribe to our newsletter here. (NewsNation) — The family of a missing teenager has searched for 20 excruciating years as a trail of secrets and sightings has failed to result in finding their daughter. The beauty of small-town Burleson, Texas, is that it's the ideal place to grow up and build a foundation ... at least for most. Samantha Tapp's sister said life in their home was rough. Samantha Tapp had difficult time at home Kendale Wyatt said life in the suburbs of Fort Worth, Texas, wasn't easy due to their adoptive mother. Mother-to-be Mischa Johnson vanished in Hawaiian paradise 'There obviously was abuse. She definitely believed in corporal punishment,' Wyatt said. 'It did tend to spiral out of control. Where she used to just use the paddle, she then would just lash out and smack us [with] whatever she had: phone cord, hanger, shoe.' Unmoored, the sisters were split up to live with relatives. It took an especially hard toll on 16-year-old Tapp. '[She was] hanging out with boys all the time. I know that she stole the car,' Wyatt said. Tapp, known to her friends and family by her nickname Sam, was eventually brought to live with Wyatt and their grandparents. Samantha Tapp was 16 when she disappeared.

(Kendale Wyatt)There were possible sightings of Samantha Tapp years after she disappeared. (Kendale Wyatt)Samantha Tapp's sister wants her to know any trouble she was in is long past. (Kendale Wyatt) She began working hard to keep getting good grades at Burleson High School. Still, she had struggles, in part because of challenges with her mental health. 'She was not on her medication anymore. She was on medication for bipolar disorder, but when she came to live with us, she wasn't on it anymore,' Wyatt said. 'But I also wasn't having to get her dressed in the morning and drag her to school. She seemed like she was thriving for a while.' As things were improving, Wyatt moved across town to live with her boyfriend and his family. That's where she was when she was surprised by a knock on the door. It was Tapp. 'She wanted to stay there. She said that she had gotten in an argument with my grandfather, and she didn't want to stay there anymore,' Wyatt said. 'I told her that she was going to have to go back, at least for now, until I could figure out a way for her to legally stay with me.' Asha Degree case: Police now believe missing NC girl was killed But what Wyatt didn't know at the time was that she'd never see her little sister again. 'I figured she would come back, but she didn't. I wish that I could have ran after her right away and just for her to stay because she didn't feel like she had to run away from me,' Wyatt said. Samantha Tapp disappears Private investigator Jason Watts says Tapp didn't vanish without a trace. A few days after she went missing in October of 2004, some of her clothing was taken from her grandparents' home. Cigarette butts were left behind. 'When I first began looking into the case, there was nothing,' Watts said. 'I mean, all you had was a flyer on the internet. That's it. No podcast, no news article online, nothing.' Tapp was classified as a runaway. Weeks passed, then months, and still, there was no word from the teenager. Watts wants to know why. 'What has become of her? Why has she not made contact with any family in almost 20 years?' Watts asked. Have a question about the case? Join the conversation by submitting it on this page, and we may answer it on the show.

He was brought on the case years later and says Burleson police did not get information on crucial sightings in real-time over the years. Clues left behind in search for Samantha Tapp NewsNation was told that Tarrant County deputies, who cover the area around Fort Worth, ran Tapp's name through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. So did the police in Copperas Cove, Texas. One intriguing hit came in June of 2014 at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, where customs ran Tapp's name and birthdate. It happened nearly a decade after she disappeared. 'We ran these possible sightings down as far as we reasonably could. But unfortunately, just like with the Burleson PD, by the time we got to them, any records as to why these hits occurred has been lost,' Watts said. Remains identified as missing 3-year-old Elijah Vue In 2007, an uncle said Tapp called, asking if she could come live with him in San Antonio, Texas. 'Then, at some point, she called back and said never mind, she wasn't coming there, that she had met some man and was moving to Melbourne, Florida,' Wyatt said. 'Which is weird.' That story changed in 2015 when it was relayed to authorities again. In the later version, Tapp had actually shown up at her uncle's home with an infant in tow. But the uncle's wife didn't recognize her and reportedly turned her away. Those bits of information add up to a trail that's been difficult to follow. 'You could treat these things sort of like breadcrumbs, perhaps,' Watts said. 'The problem is, we are unable to verify them or confirm them, so we don't know that they are, in fact, breadcrumbs of Samantha Tapp.' Asking Samantha Tapp to come home Age-progressed photos show what Tapp might look like today as a woman in her 30s. Investigators and Wyatt are also working to let Tapp know that any trouble she might have been in as a minor has long passed. 'She is not wanted or being sought after for any reason,' Watts said.

Kamala Harris criticizes Trump rhetoric in NABJ interview	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris took questions Tuesday from the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia and addressed the controversial things her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has said on various issues. Among other topics, she talked about the threats of violence residents of the city of Springfield, Ohio, have faced after Trump made false claims about immigrants there kidnapping and eating people's pets. 5 takeaways from Harris’s interview with NABJ Saying 'there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,' Harris also referenced Project 2025, which conservative organizations created as a blueprint for the next Republican presidential administration, as well as GOP-led efforts to restrict abortion access. Addressing the second assassination attempt against Trump, Harris said in the NABJ interview she feels safe under Secret Service protection. While she spoke with Trump on Tuesday and said he was glad he's safe, she added that his rhetoric on certain topics should be disqualifying. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrested in New York after indictment 'When you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a deep level that your words have meaning,' Harris said. 'Let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.' Ashley Davis, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, and NewsNation political contributors A. Scott Bolden, Kurt Bardella and Denise Gitsham joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' to discuss harmful rhetoric. Bardella, a Democratic strategist, called out JD Vance for his misinformation about Haitian immigrants, pointing the finger at Republicans. 'This is not a both-sides issue,' he said. 'You don't get to lecture Democrats about rhetoric when you are the one advancing dangerous and disproven claims in Springfield that is resulting in people not being able to go to school because of bomb threats,' Bardella added. Davis countered that both sides have a responsibility to tone down their talking points, adding, 'I refuse to go on TV shows that argue, and we don't usually do this. I don't think it's right. ... I will never criticize Joe Biden, Barack Obama as a sitting president.' The economy and the Israel-Hamas war were also mentioned during the discussion. While Harris didn't say specifically how she would end it, she said the hostages need to come home, and there needs to be a path toward peace for Palestinians and Israel. This interview comes as the Harris campaign is spending time reaching out to both Black and young voters. Polls indicate that they feel energized about the Harris nomination. When surveyed by the NAACP, 78% of Black people said they felt as excited as they did when former President Barack Obama first ran for office. About 56% said they felt even more excited, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Still, that same poll showed that over a quarter of younger Black men said they would support Harris' opponent, Republican Donald Trump, in this year's U.S. presidential election. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day When it comes to reaching out to younger voters, the Harris-Walz campaign and Democratic National Convention are launching a weeklong effort to engage them. This includes going to college campuses. Obama even took to TikTok to talk with social media influencers about the importance of getting out there to register and vote. Pennsylvania, where the NABJ conference is being held, is also important to candidates running in the presidential election. Decision Desk HQ polling shows that Harris holds a small lead of 48.1% to Trump's 47.4%, making it a tight race.

Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation?	(NewsNation) — A federal prosecutor said more people may be charged in connection to a federal indictment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, saying that 'nothing is off the table.' 'We are not done,' U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a news conference Tuesday where he shared more details on Combs’ indictment. 'I can't take anything off the table. Anything is possible,' he said in response to a question about the possibility of more charges and defendants. 'Our investigation is very active and ongoing … developments are certainly foreseeable.' Combs was arrested in New York Monday and faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. 'We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,' Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo said in a statement Monday. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Prosecutors allege Combs used the resources of his music empire to create 'a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.' They also accuse him of having used his employees to help him engage in these activities. 'I definitely think more is coming,' Richard Schoenstein, a trial attorney and legal analyst, told NewsNation. 'The indictment said he did all these things in conjunction with other people, but it doesn’t name them, it does not name the co-conspirators … so there has to be more down the road.' 'It will be interesting to see who will become a defendant, who becomes a witness and who comes forward as a witness cooperating,' he said. Schoenstein added that Combs’ associates should be very concerned right now. 'The indictment alleges his associates helped him commit heinous crimes,' he said. 'If you're one of those associates, you have a lot to think about' on how you will go about participating in this investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/who-else-charged-diddy-investigation/	2024-09-17T10:27:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/664e237f8bd428.09397242.jpeg?w=900
‘Consequential presidents get shot at’: Trump at Michigan town ha...	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump campaigned Tuesday in Michigan, marking his first public event since an apparent second assassination attempt at his Florida golf course. Trump attended a town hall at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan. His former press secretary and current Arkansas governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, moderated the conversation. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day The event comes two days after police say a man pushed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle through the fence perimeter of Trump’s Palm Beach golf course near where the former president was playing Sunday. A Secret Service agent saw the rifle and shot at the man, who fled the scene, leaving behind the firearm, a GoPro camera and two backpacks. No one was injured in the shooting, which took place about 5 miles away from the president’s Mar-a-Lago residence.

Addressing the dangers of the presidency, Trump stated, 'Only consequential presidents get shot at,' suggesting the attempts on his life validate his impact. There was an electric atmosphere inside the standing-room-only sports arena, where thousands of Trump supporters greeted the former president with a deafening roar when he took the stage. The overflowing crowd interrupted Trump’s discussion with Sanders with chants of 'God bless Trump!' and 'Fight, fight, fight' at various times. 'A lot of love in this room,' Trump remarked. Trump said he had a call with Vice President Kamala Harris and described it as 'very, very nice.' He did not provide details about the conversation's content. Trump, speaking for an hour, said, 'Secret Service did a hell of a job. Now, they do need more people, and they've been complaining about that for a long time.' Chris Cuomo called Donald Trump after second attempt on his life 'It’s a dangerous business, however, being president. It’s a little bit dangerous,' he said. Trump predicted dire consequences for the auto industry if he loses the upcoming election, claiming, 'If a tragedy happens and we don't win, there will be zero car jobs.' Throughout the town hall, he praised women's intelligence while recounting how a female witness spotted an armed individual.
