Harris debate performance falls short of moving the needle in swi...	Vice President Harris was widely seen by voters as the clear winner of her debate against former President Trump, but that sentiment has failed to move the needle in key battleground states where the presidential nominees are still neck-and-neck heading into November. Harris’s debate performance has been hailed in the nearly two weeks since it occurred, with voters in several surveys, including those conducted that evening, believing she is better at staying calm under pressure, more intelligent and has higher moral integrity than Trump. But in the nearly two dozen polls conducted since the match-up, Harris’s slight lead over Trump nationally and in swing states grew by less than one percentage point and, in some states, Trump’s lead grew, albeit by razor-thin margins. Harris currently holds a 3.6 percentage point lead over Trump nationally, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate polling, which has grown just slightly since the day before the debate, when she had a 3.2 percentage point lead. Surveys in battleground states tell a similar story. Harris saw slight spikes in her lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin in the weeks since the debate but her lead remained the same in Michigan, which makes up part of the blue wall. Trump has a 0.1 lead over Harris in Arizona and Georgia, two other key states a candidate needs to proclaim victory. 'While it's true that the battleground states remain on a knife's edge, that was always going to be the case in a country as split along partisan lines as we are right now, and no debate performance was going to shift those state numbers significantly,' said John LaBombard, former communications director to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.). Harris is up 1.2 percentage points in Michigan, the aggregate polling shows, which is the same lead she had the day before the debate. Harris is up 1.1 percentage point in Pennsylvania, which is a minor increase from the 0.7 percentage point lead she had pre-debate. And, in Nevada, Harris has a 1.2 percentage point lead, which is an uptick from the 0.5 percentage point lead she had pre-debate. Her biggest lead is in Wisconsin, by 2 percentage points, but that’s a decline from the 3 percentage point lead she had on Sept. 9. Meanwhile, in Arizona, the aggregation shows Trump with a 0.1 percentage point lead over Harris, which is a flip from the 0.1 percentage point lead Harris had over him before the debate. Trump has a 0.1 percentage point lead in Georgia, which is a decease from his 0.3 percentage point lead he had before the debate. Strategists don’t see much in the way of either candidate coming out that far ahead in key battleground states where the margins are so thin. 'Anyone who is expecting the polling to break open one way or the other will be sorely disappointed,' said Clayton Cox, former Democratic National Committee (DNC) national finance director, noting what he called a 'calcified electorate.' 'What matters now is ground game, enthusiasm and ability to motivate a volunteer army. On that basis, I would rather be Harris over Trump any day of the week,' Clayton said. Democrats since the debate have been cautious to claim victory just yet and are painting Harris, as she herself often does on the campaign trail, as the underdog in the race. 'We are still in a margin of error race. It’s a tie,' Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said at a fundraising event with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday. 'We’ve got to go persuade those people who don’t know enough about the vice president and her vision for the future…have those hard conversations in big and small ways, we’re going to inch our way over the finish line.' Republicans, too, see the race as too close to call. Stewart Verdery, who served in former President George W. Bush’s administration, expects there won’t be a big, game-changer moment before November. 'When Trump has a bad debate or there’s a new oddball poll, it’s treated as a game-changer. But the simple truth is that two parties are within 2 to 3 points of each other nationally so there will never be a definitive moment in the campaign,' he said. 'But within those slim margins, Harris has improved her odds considerably since the debate and now appears to be going into the old basketball ‘four corners’ to run out the clock.' To that point, individual polls also paint varying pictures of the state of the race. An Emerson College and The Hill poll on Thursday found Trump edging out Harris in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all by just one point, and edging out Harris in Georgia by 3 points. Harris edged out Trump in Michigan by 2 points, North Carolina by 1 point and the two candidates were tied in Nevada. Harris and Trump were tied in Pennsylvania in a Marist poll released on Thursday. That poll found that Harris edged out Trump by five points in Michigan and by 1 point in Wisconsin. A Quinnipiac University poll on Wednesday found Harris leading Trump by 6 points in Pennsylvania, 5 points in Michigan, and by 1 point in Wisconsin. Democrats still, however, are optimistic that the groundwork Harris has put into the swing states will pay off by election day, despite the lack of movement in the polls after the debate. 'It's still a close, competitive election, but we are in a stronger position than they are… we have more money, more volunteers, we have more enthusiasm. There's a lot of optimism on our side that we're in a stronger position today, and we have a much stronger capacity to close,' said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. 'There is no good news for Trump in the battlegrounds.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-debate-performance-falls-short-of-moving-the-needle-in-swing-states/	2024-09-21T14:20:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/harriskamala_trumpdonald_092024gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Top Hezbollah leader was among the 37 people killed in an Israeli...	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire on Saturday as rescue crews in Beirut searched the rubble of an apartment building that was leveled by an Israeli airstrike that killed at least 37 people, including one of the militant group's senior leaders as well as women and children. The Israeli government braced for an expected surge in Hezbollah rocket attacks by setting new caps on the size of gatherings and other restrictions in the north of the country, near Israel's border with Lebanon, that led to schools in some communities canceling classes on Sunday. The airstrike Friday took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in southern Beirut as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group’s special forces unit the Radwan Force. Also killed was Ahmed Wahbi, a top commander in the group’s military wing, the Israeli military said. Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said the attack, which came days after devastating coordinated attacks on Hezbollah that used exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, thwarted the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths and who was on the U.S. wanted list for years. 'This is our commitment to the fallen and their loved ones. This is our commitment to the residents of the north. And this is a clear message to all those who seek to harm us,' he posted on X. Lebanon’s health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said. Hezbollah confirms more than a dozen operatives were killed Akil, the main target, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. The U.S. State Department last year announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called Akil’s death 'a good outcome' and said he had 'American blood on his hands' for the embassy attack. 'You know, 1983 seems like a long time ago,' Sullivan said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' Wahbi was described as a commander who played major roles within Hezbollah for decades and was imprisoned in an Israeli jail in southern Lebanon in 1984. Hezbollah said he was one of the 'field commanders' during a 1997 ambush in southern Lebanon that left 12 Israeli troops dead. Hezbollah announced overnight that 15 of its operatives had been killed by Israeli forces, but it didn’t how or where they died. Meanwhile, the Israeli army spokesperson, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said Saturday 16 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Friday’s strike. Israel airstrikes and Hezbollah rocket attacks continue It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on Saturday. The Israeli military confirmed that about 90 rockets had been fired at northern Israel and that Israel had struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon during the day. Expecting a surge in rocket attacks, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli defense spokesman, announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces. Work and school can continue if people can reach protected areas in a timely manner. But since students and teachers in some places wouldn’t be able reach shelters in the required time, Sunday classes were canceled in at least two border regions within an hour of the announcement. Earlier this week, Israel’s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah’s attacks on the country’s north, which would allow displaced residents to return to their homes, is now an official war goal, as Israel considers a wider military operation in Lebanon that could spark an all-out conflict. Israel has since sent a powerful fighting force to its northern border. Hezbollah has maintained that it will halt its strikes only when a cease-fire is reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. But previous cross-border attacks have largely struck areas in northern Israel that had been evacuated and less-populated parts of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah bombardments preceded the Israeli strike Friday's strike came hours after Hezbollah launched one of its most intense bombardments of northern Israel in nearly a year of fighting, largely targeting Israeli military sites. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the Katyusha rockets. The militant group said its latest wave of rocket salvos was a response to Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon. However, it came days after mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies killed at least 37 people, including two children, and wounded roughly 3,000 others. Abiad, the Lebanese health minister, said Saturday that hospitals across the country were filled with the wounded. The pager and walkie-talkie attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied involvement. They marked a major escalation in the past 11 months of simmering conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Jeffery and Natalie Melzer in Jerusalem, White House correspondent Zeke Miller in Wilmington, Delaware, and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-the-death-toll-from-israeli-airstrike-on-a-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31/	2024-09-21T13:30:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24265302346271.jpg?w=900
Harris accepts invitation to second debate, urges Trump to join	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN to participate in a debate on Oct. 23, her campaign said on Saturday. 'Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules, and ratings,' campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/harris-accepts-invitation-to-second-debate-urges-trump-to-join/	2024-09-21T09:51:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24255043023737_fc8275.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr., Gabbard eye top roles in possible Trump administration	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard are angling for positions in a possible Trump administration, hoping to help spark an anti-establishment surge in Washington post-November. The two former Democrats, who have enthusiastically endorsed Trump’s Republican nomination for the White House, want to influence American policy issues ranging from health care and the environment to national security. They jumped on board with the former president after moving rightward following their own quixotic runs — Gabbard’s in 2020 and Kennedy’s in 2024. Gabbard, a military veteran who served as a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii before retiring, said this week that she would 'be honored to serve' under a second Trump term. She told Fox News that she’s hoping for a role working on foreign policy while stumping for him in Georgia. Kennedy, meanwhile, wants to help Trump dismantle and rebuild the public health care system and said his former rival has asked him to 'be involved in the administration at a high level.' The two are now headed for Nevada this weekend, hitting a third battleground after Arizona and Georgia, in the hopes that they will elevate Trump’s chances of success with voters in Las Vegas. The positive expectation-setting from Trump himself has excited Kennedy and Gabbard allies, who see them already helping to form a non-traditional coalition they hope can win less than two months from Election Day. 'I truly believe [Trump] will keep his word and not hose Kennedy,' said Eric Jackman, a senior adviser for the newly formed Kennedy-aligned Make America Healthy Again PAC, modeled after Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. 'He understands he will need much better people around him, should he win. Having experienced hands like Bobby and Tulsi in Trump’s corner is an immense advantage and asset to his campaign and future administration,' he said. Jackman, a friend of Gabbard’s who has worked on issues supporting Kennedy this cycle, sees the former independent candidate’s strength now as guiding Trump to reach new audiences, including skeptical voters and independents. 'It’s been very exciting and encouraging to see how MAGA crowds are responding to Kennedy’s call for cleaning up our food, environment and government,' he said. Trump has famously attracted non-conformist characters into his orbit, many of whom have right-leaning sympathies. Kennedy and Gabbard’s swift emergence on the Republican scene is the latest extension of that. The two have bonded over anti-interventionism that also extends to what they perceive as other kinds of excessive government reach. For Gabbard, the military industrial complex is a particular focus, while Kennedy has channeled his advocacy against vaccines and modern science into a war on the nation’s disease crisis. Kennedy hasn’t explicitly said which position, if any, he would want the most if Trump wins, but those close to him, including his former vice-presidential nominee Nicole Shanahan, have suggested Health and Human Services as a possibility. 'They are helping to create a bridge for Independents and unhappy Democrats to the Trump campaign,' said Larry Sharpe, a political consultant with knowledge of Kennedy’s campaign. 'Many voters who are unhappy with the establishment have hope that both RFK and Gabbard will be able to make changes,' Sharpe said. Like others in Kennedy’s orbit, he suggested there’s a suitable place for them ahead of a possible government change-over, when Trump would theoretically usher in his own bench. 'Many hope that they both are on the transition team so they can make many changes to permanent Washington,' he said. The Hill reported earlier this month that nominating Kennedy for any Cabinet position would likely come with inherent challenges, especially tough battles for confirmation in the Senate if Democrats hold onto the upper chamber. Some Democratic strategists see the chances that either politician would make it to Washington as increasingly unlikely, given the fickle nature of Trump’s promises and personal alliances. There’s a growing disbelief among liberals that he would stay true to his word and offer top positions to the two ex-candidates. 'I don’t think it takes an advanced degree in psychology to observe that when it comes to Donald Trump loyalty is a one-way street. And his word is about as valuable as one of his bankrupt casinos,' said Doug Gordon, a Democratic strategist. 'The most likely outcome here is that Tulsi and RFK are simply the latest examples of people becoming useful idiots for Trump with nothing to show for it,' Gordon said. Kennedy and Gabbard have also faced scrutiny since taking on roles on the campaign. Ahead of the debate between Trump and Vice President Harris, the former president’s campaign commissioned Gabbard to prepare him with a mock performance, something that drew negative attention after the former president’s rocky debate. Gabbard delivered what supporters considered to be a blow to Harris in 2019, early into the last presidential campaign cycle, when both candidates competed in a debate in Michigan. Gabbard challenged Harris on her criminal justice record and was seen as putting Harris, a former prosecutor and California’s top cop as attorney general, on her toes at the time. She’s since taken an even more adversarial posture towards Harris while promoting Trump’s candidacy. 'President Trump did in his last administration what President Obama refused to do, what President Biden refused to do, what Kamala Harris has made clear she refuses to do — which is to go out and do that tough work that a president and commander in chief has to do in diplomacy,' Gabbard told Fox News, where she is a frequent guest. Trump’s debate performance, while widely perceived as poor, has seemingly done little to move the needle ahead of November. New polls released over the past few days show a close, if not statistically tied, race in almost all of the important swing states. Kennedy’s Democratic name also doesn’t appear to be hurting Trump. Post-endorsement, he has stayed within the margin of error against Harris. One Trump ally argued Kennedy is especially valuable because he has a built-in following and is the type of add-on who can single-handedly draw a crowd and media attention. He also follows the same adage as Trump that all press is good press. 'This is another interesting thing that the Trump team has going for them that I don’t think Team Kamala has going for them: Multiple people who can draw earned media,' the ally to the former president said. 'RFK is going to be on the trail. It wasn’t just an endorsement,' the source said.

Ex-Bad Boy Records rapper says Diddy 'destroyed' his life	(NewsNation) — A former Bad Boy Records rapper turned Belizean politician responds to the arrest of his former mentor and associate, Sean 'Diddy' Combs, with a harsh reality: 'This is someone that destroyed my life.' Moses 'Shyne' Barrow was 21 years old when he went to a New York City nightclub with Combs, who signed the up-and-coming rapper to his record label upon meeting in 1998. About a year later, Barrow was with Combs when his new boss and another man were arguing. Shots rang out, injuring three bystanders. Barrow was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Upon his release, he was deported to his native country of Belize. Barrow spoke to the media at a press conference on Sept. 18 in Belize when he made the comments in response to Diddy’s arrest two days prior. 'He pretty much sent me to prison,' he said at the conference. Ray J says industry still trying to ‘digest’ Diddy news The now-45-year-old is the Leader of the Opposition for the Belize House of Representatives, first becoming a member of the House in 2020. Born Jamal Michael Barrow, the rapper’s stage name was Shyne. A native of Belize, he moved to New York City with his mother as a child, and that’s where he met Diddy when his rap career took off in the late 1990s. 'Shyne' wrote and performed on several popular albums including Usher’s 'Confessions,' Lil Wayne’s 'Carter IV,' Notorious B.I.G’s 'Born Again' and Diddy’s (at the time Puff Daddy’s) 'Forever' (released three months before the 1999 shooting). In previous interviews, Barrow has said he was the 'fall guy' for the shooting but clarified that he doesn’t blame Combs. At the September press conference, he says he’s forgiven his former mentor, who he says he was never close enough to consider a 'brotherhood' with him.

(Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage via Getty Images) 'This is someone who, in a sense, testified against me when I was on trial, when I was an 18-year-old kid, just wanting to do nothing other than make my mom proud …' said Barrow, who has maintained his innocence from the start. 'This is someone who destroyed my life and who I forgave.' Combs’ then-girlfriend singer and actress Jennifer Lopez was with him the night of the shooting, and both were soon arrested after fleeing the scene. Neither were charged in connection to the shooting. Weighing in on Comb’s recent arrest, Barrow said, 'One of the things I would never wish on my worst enemy is to be incarcerated … so I take no joy in anyone’s challenges whether with the criminal justice system or otherwise.' J-Lo’s mom didn’t like Diddy: Video resurfaces 'Do I take satisfaction in what he is going through? Absolutely not,' he continued. Natania Reuben, one of the shooting victims, told NewsNation in March that she has spent the past 25 years trying to clear Barrow’s name.

Harris sees reasons for cautious optimism in Pennsylvania	Vice President Harris is seeing encouraging signs in Pennsylvania, a state that many see as the key battleground in the fight for the White House in November. Many recent polls have shown Harris holding a slim lead over former President Trump in the Keystone State, and she has a 53 percent chance to win the state in Decision Desk HQ and The Hill’s election forecast. But some polls also underscore just how close the race in Pennsylvania will be, with multiple surveys in recent days showing Harris and Trump tied there — underscoring how fierce the battle for the state’s 19 electoral votes will be. 'I would rather be where we are than where they are,' said Joe Corrigan, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist. 'But nothing is over. It’s just all gas and no breaks until Nov. 5.' On Thursday, a Washington Post poll showed Harris ahead of Trump by 1 point, with a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points. A Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll released the same day found Harris leading Trump 49 percent to 46 percent, with a 4.1 point margin of error. Meanwhile, a Quinnipiac University poll out Thursday showed Harris up by 6 points in Pennsylvania with a margin of error of 2.7 points. The poll marks the first time either candidate has surpassed the 50 percent mark in the state this cycle. But a Marist survey out the same day showed the candidates deadlocked in the state with a margin of error of 3.1 points. Both campaigns are crisscrossing the state this weekend, with Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) attending events in Leesburg and Hershey on Saturday. On Sunday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff will travel to Bucks County, one of the state’s swing areas. David Urban, who was a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign in 2016, sounded an optimistic note about the former president’s chances in the Keystone State, but he acknowledged the closeness of the race. 'It is neck and neck,' Urban said. 'I like our chances still better than her chances in the state. I think if the election were held today, Trump would win, but again, I’m talking about win by 75,000 votes, win by 100,000 votes.' Urban noted that on the ground, the race feels more like it did in 2016 than in 2020, noting President Biden’s close ties to the state. And he pointed to questions about Harris’s policy stances as a weakness for her. 'You can say I am not going to ban fracking once, but you need to say it 300 times to kind of counter the 300 times you said it before,' Urban continued, referring to Harris’s reversal on the issue from when she ran for president in 2020. Fracking in Pennsylvania has been a particular focal point for Republicans in their attacks against Harris, particularly in the southwestern region, where it is a major industry. Harris told CNN last month her values 'have not changed' and that a thriving, clean energy economy can be achieved without banning fracking. 'People, when they come into new information, can come to conclusions that are different from the conclusions that they’ve held in the past,' Corrigan said, regarding Harris’s reversal. Democrats say they are cautiously optimistic about Harris’s standing in the polls and point to her favorability ratings over Trump. A Suffolk University poll found that 49 percent of likely Pennsylvania voters had a favorable view of Harris, while 47 percent said they had an unfavorable view. Trump, on the other hand, had a 43 percent favorability rating and a 54 percent unfavorable rating. 'If you look at the vice president’s favorability numbers in Pennsylvania, I think the fact she’s still above water speaks to the fact that people trust her more on any number of issues,' Corrigan said. Harris’s allies also tout what they say is a strong campaign infrastructure and presence in the state. The vice president made headlines last week when she made a campaign stop in Johnstown in the western portion of the state. The town is not considered as deeply red as the region it’s in, but it still underscores Harris’s strategy of seeking to chip away at Trump’s margins in Republican strongholds. The move is reminiscent of the 2022 midterms, when Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) waded into more rural, conservative parts of the state. 'Vice President Harris and Governor Walz would do well spending a few days in the interior of the Commonwealth,' said former Rep. Chris Carney (D-Pa), a senior policy adviser at Nossaman. 'There are gettable independent and blue dog votes there, but those voters need to see Harris and Walz, assess them up close, and develop some comfort with them. The voters there need to hear directly that a Harris administration will not end fracking, will not take away guns and will keep the nation secure.' Republicans argue the strategy employed by Shapiro and Fetterman in the state’s rural counties won’t play the same way two years later, noting Shapiro’s weak Republican opponent in state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) and Fetterman’s connections with rural voters in the western part of the state. 'She can go to every rural community in the state and, bluntly, it’s not going to make much of a difference. She doesn’t connect with them. They don’t trust her,' a Pennsylvania-based GOP strategist and former gubernatorial candidate. Trump will seek to run up the margins in the state’s conservative and rural strongholds, while Harris will seek to maximize turnout in the state's most populated regions in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas. The race could come down to a handful of counties that voted for former President Obama in 2012 but flipped for Trump. Those counties include Erie, Luzerne, and Northampton. Trump retained Luzerne County in 2020, but lost Northampton and Erie in 2020. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released earlier this week showed Harris leading Trump 50 percent to 45 percent in Northampton and 48 percent to 44 percent in Erie. While the poll numbers looks good for her, many Republicans are still expressing skepticism that she will resonate with voters in the Keystone State. 'With Kamala Harris, there’s lots of question marks,' said Urban, the GOP strategist. 'What people know of her is what they saw in the 2020 campaign.'

Trump's shutdown push falls flat with Republicans	House Republicans are overwhelmingly dismissing former President Trump’s calls for a government shutdown in the absence of a proof-of-citizenship voting bill being signed into law, a public break from the GOP presidential nominee in the lead-up to the November election. A group of Republicans this week rejected a bill that combined a six-month continuing resolution (CR) with the Trump-backed voting bill, tanking the legislation in a move that thwarted Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) funding strategy. Now, as the Speaker prepares to defy Trump’s wishes and stage a vote on a 'clean' three-month stopgap, rank-and-file Republicans are expected to back it — balking at the former president’s request. Republicans almost universally support the voting bill, but they say pushing the issue so intensely that it results in a shutdown would backfire on the party. 'Everybody wants to go home and campaign, and there are some, particularly that want to go home and campaign, because they're in really tough races,' Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) said. The Alabama Republican, who currently serves as policy chair of the House GOP conference, also pointed to national security concerns. 'A government shutdown would embolden our enemies, further undermine our reliability and respect among our allies,' Palmer said. 'So, I don't think a shutdown is good for anybody.' Trump for weeks has urged House Republicans to pair government funding with a conservative voting bill. Johnson fulfilled that request with his opening salvo in the government funding talks. The former president, however, amped up his request last week, urging Republicans to shut down the government if they did not secure 'absolute assurances on Election Security.' And he reiterated that position Wednesday, hours before the House rejected the six-month stopgap-plus-SAVE Act. 'If Republicans don’t get the SAVE Act, and every ounce of it, they should not agree to a Continuing Resolution in any way, shape, or form,' Trump posted on Truth Social, adding: 'BE SMART, REPUBLICANS, YOU’VE BEEN PUSHED AROUND LONG ENOUGH BY THE DEMOCRATS. DON’T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. Remember, this is Biden/Harris’ fault, not yours!' Trump’s pleas contrasted with the strategy among GOP lawmakers, who saw the CR-plus-SAVE Act as an opening offer — and a way to play into Trump’s past false stolen election claims and repeated skepticism of the voting system — but knew it would not be the measure that prevented a shutdown. Even if the lower chamber passed it, the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House — which point out that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote and expressed concern about burdening eligible voters — never would have accepted it. Republicans believe the blame for any shutdown would be placed on their own shoulders, not the Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for example, called a government shutdown at this juncture 'politically beyond stupid' and predicted the GOP would bear responsibility for allowing the lights to turn off in Washington. House Republicans are echoing that sentiment. 'I don't know that a shutdown really helps us right now, and what we're trying to accomplish — keep the majority, win the White House,' said Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), chair of the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus in the House. Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), a subcommittee chair on the House Appropriations Committee, sounded a similar note while zeroing in on the looming election. 'Closing down the government during this process is not a good idea for anyone involved, certainly for our government, certainly for momentum going into an election,' Joyce said. 'I think it's important that we stay open and get through this election and then make decisions in November and December.' The insistence from Trump, nonetheless, is complicating the GOP’s path to averting a shutdown at the end of the month as House GOP leaders move on to their plan B: A clean, short-term stopgap until December. Johnson is now in the delicate position of managing the expectations of the former president, with whom he has kept a good relationship — and whose support he will likely need to remain Speaker next year if Republicans win the House. The Speaker has spoken to Trump about the current government funding fight, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to The Hill. Punchbowl News first reported the conversations. Johnson met with Trump in Washington on Thursday night — the second gathering of the two leaders in a week. The Speaker would not detail their discussion, but he did say the former president 'understands the situation' House Republicans are currently in. 'I’ve had a lot of conversations with President Trump, and I won’t divulge all of them, but he understands the situation that we’re in, and he is doggedly determined to ensure that election security remains a top priority,' Johnson told reporters Friday. 'And I am as well, which is why I put the SAVE Act with CR.' 'We want to make sure that everybody understands, it is illegal to vote if you’re a noncitizen,' he continued. 'And we’re gonna press that at every opportunity, we’ll use every vehicle coming out of this chamber and every platform that we have to make this message loud and clear.' Johnson’s office, meanwhile, has continued to put out messaging on the SAVE Act vote, noting that 206 House Democrats voted against the bill requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. Friday morning, he posted a photo of Trump’s Truth Social message that read: 'IF YOU VOTE ILLEGALLY, YOU’RE GOING TO JAIL.' Asked about Trump’s shutdown calls or the prospects of a funding lapse, the Speaker has sought to tamp down concern. In a CNBC interview Wednesday before the failed six-month CR vote, Johnson said 'no one needs to worry' about a shutdown. Later in the day on Fox News after the vote failed, Johnson said: 'I don't think it's going to come to a shutdown. I believe we can get this job done.' Not every Republican, however, is resistant to a shutdown, with some fiscal hawks wishing the Speaker would have used the threat of a shutdown as a real leverage point to pressure Democrats to swallow the SAVE Act. 'He still has an aversion to any kind of shutdown,' Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said of Johnson. 'Trump is saying, have a shutdown. And just hadn't happened. We got to fight at some point.' Norman added that he did not 'buy' the idea that vulnerable House Republicans could be threatened by a government shutdown. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), lead sponsor of the SAVE Act and major proponent of pairing it with a stopgap, also said Republicans should not shy away from a shutdown. 'Everybody knows that I’m certainly comfortable with fighting and having a shutdown to force the question on whether or not we’re gonna fund government at the right levels, which means cutting spending, and make sure that we ensure that only citizens vote,' said Roy, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. 'I’d be happy to do that. But you got to have the votes to go do it.' But those most involved with the intricacies of government funding strongly disagree. 'We can't have a shutdown,' said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), another appropriator. 'A shutdown would be catastrophic for our national defense, for our economy.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-shutdown-push-falls-flat-with-republicans/	2024-09-21T04:40:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/trump-shutdown_brooks_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Trump says 'Jewish people would have a lot to do' with his loss '...	Former President Trump, speaking at two events raising awareness for combating antisemitism, is telegraphing that a loss in the 2024 presidential election largely would be blamed on the American Jewish vote. The Republican presidential nominee lashed out at what he said is 40 percent support among the Jewish American community in the U.S., saying the 60 percent polled who favor Kamala Harris are voting for the 'enemy.' 'In my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss, if I’m at 40 percent,' Trump said during a campaign event at an event called 'Fighting Antisemitism' and hosted by Israeli American Republican mega-donor Miriam Adelson, at the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. After the event, Trump was the keynote speaker at the Israeli American Conference, also a beneficiary of Adelson, where he repeated similar comments. 'If I don’t win this election — and Jewish people would have a lot to do with that, 60 percent are voting for the enemy — Israel will cease to exist in two years,' Trump said to a favorable and receptive crowd. 'I believe I’m 100 percent right. … If I do win, Israel will be safe and secure, and we’ll stop the toxic poison of antisemitism.' The comments drew quick criticism from supporters of Vice President Harris and raised warnings among leaders in the Jewish community. 'Treating Jews and Israel as political footballs makes Jews, Israel, and all of us less safe,' Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement to The Forward. 'Dividing Jews into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ camps and engaging in dual loyalty tropes further normalizes antisemitism. Anyone who cares about Jewish safety should call it out,' she added. 'This is not partisan politics — it’s about the fundamental safety of the Jewish community.' 'If any other national politician said: 'the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss' - to preemptively blame Jews for a potential loss- their career &amp; candidacy would be over. How people continue to ignore this is scary,' Alyssa Farah Griffin, a onetime Trump administration official who has become an outspoken critic of the former president, posted on the social platform X. 'Donald Trump is now saying that the ‘Jewish people’ will be to blame if he loses this election. This is vile and dangerous and should be condemned by all Americans. Antisemitic rhetoric like this makes Jews less safe,' Andrew Weinstein, a Jewish Democrat from South Florida who served as a delegate to the United Nations for the Biden administration, posted on X. Likewise, Common Defense, a grassroots organization of U.S. military veterans, described Trump’s remarks as 'antisemitic rhetoric' that 'puts Jewish lives at risk.' 'Donald Trump is now saying the 'Jewish people' will be to blame if he loses the election. This is disgusting and, more importantly, dangerous. Antisemitic rhetoric like this puts Jewish lives at risk, and all Americans should be outraged,' the group said in a statement on X.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-jewish-people-would-have-a-lot-to-do-with-his-loss-if-that-happens/	2024-09-20T17:23:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24256801720496-e1726180709936.jpg?w=900
Kentucky sheriff who shot judge 'angry' in deposition: Lawyer	(NewsNation) — Sheriff Shawn M. Stines allegedly shot and killed District Judge Kevin Mullins in Letcher County, Kentucky, on Thursday. As the rural community processes the incident, more details are emerging about Stines' ongoing legal battles and his disposition in the days leading up to the shooting. Stines faces a civil lawsuit, filed by lawyer Ned Pillersdorf, alleging he ignored one of his subordinate's sexual abuse toward women on house arrest. The suit accuses Stines of 'deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train and supervise' the deputy, Ben Fields, CBS reports. Body found off Kentucky interstate identified as Joseph Couch 'In return for not reporting them for violating the terms of their probation, they would give sexual favors. Fields did that to approximately three women,' Pillersdorf said. Some of the abuses happened in Mullins' chambers, according to the attorney's client. 'The tie-in to Judge Mullins is, according to the plaintiff ... the sexual encounters occurred in the judge's chambers,' he said, later clarifying that at least one sexual encounter happened in the chambers itself and another in its bathroom. Earlier this year, Fields left the department, pleaded guilty to rape among other counts and was sentenced to six months in jail followed by 6 1/2 years on probation. The judge in that case was not Mullins but rather a judge from nearby Pike County. 84-year-old Mississippi minister robbed, beaten with rifle When asked if the civil suit has anything to do with Thursday's incident — or whether Judge Mullins knew about the abuse in his chambers — Pillsersdorf said there is no way to know right now. 'Pure speculation. I don't know ... whether the lawsuit we filed had anything to do with the bizarre encounter and shocking killing, no telling,' he told NewsNation. 'There's certainly been a lot of social media chatter, but no telling.' Pillersdorf confirmed that during Stines' eight-hour deposition Monday, just days before the shooting, the sheriff appeared to be angry, agitated and defensive. How was Kevin Mullins killed? This undated photo provided by Kentucky Court of Justice shows slain District Judge Kevin Mullins. (Kentucky Court of Justice via AP) Stines allegedly walked into the judge’s outer office, then told court employees and others gathered there that he needed to speak with Mullins alone, according to The Mountain Eagle. Shortly after the two walked into the judge’s chambers, shots were heard. Then, Stines walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police. State police say measures were made to attempt to save Mullins’ life, but none were successful. No other injuries were reported, according to NewsNation local affiliate WJHL.

Robinson won't be at Trump's North Carolina rally Saturday	North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson (R) will not be in attendance when former President Trump rallies supporters in the state Saturday, a source told The Hill. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Wilmington, two days after a bombshell CNN report about posts Robinson made on an online pornography forum between 2008 and 2012, including that he supported slavery and called himself a 'Black Nazi.' The former president has endorsed Robinson, who has vowed to stay in the race despite widespread criticism over his past remarks. Trump himself has not yet weighed in on Robinson since the latest report on his incendiary past remarks. The former president previously compared Robinson to Martin Luther King Jr., and Robinson was given a prominent speaking slot at July's GOP convention. Robinson attended a Trump rally in North Carolina in August. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign issued a statement that did not mention Robinson but called North Carolina a 'vital part' of the plan for winning the White House. 'We are confident that as voters compare the Trump record of a strong economy, low inflation, a secure border, and safe streets, with the failures of Biden-Harris, then President Trump will win the Tar Heel State once again. We will not take our eye off the ball,' national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Republicans had already expressed concerns about Robinson’s viability as a candidate given the many controversial and derogatory statements he has made about various groups, including women and Jewish people. But the newest allegations further mire Robinson in controversy, with polls already showing him down by double digits to Democratic candidate Josh Stein, the state's attorney general. North Carolina will also be a pivotal state in determining the outcome of November's presidential election. Trump narrowly carried the state in 2020, but a Decision Desk HQ/The Hill average of polls from the state show Vice President Harris leading by 3.6 percentage points.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/robinson-wont-be-at-trumps-north-carolina-rally-saturday/	2024-09-20T12:46:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Robinson-Trump-09.20.png?w=900
RFK Jr., Olivia Nuzzi's reported relationship reviewed by NY Mag	(NewsNation) — New York Magazine has confirmed Washington correspondent Olivia Nuzzi is on leave after admitting to a 'personal relationship' with a previous subject she covered. In a statement to its readers Thursday night, New York Magazine said the relationship was with an individual 'relevant to the 2024 campaign.' 'Recently our Washington Correspondent Olivia Nuzzi acknowledged to the magazine’s editors that she had engaged in a personal relationship with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign, a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures,' the statement read. 'Had the magazine been aware of this relationship, she would not have continued to cover the presidential campaign. An internal review of her published work has found no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias. She is currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review. We regret this violation of our readers’ trust.' Secret Service details failures preceding July Trump shooting Reporter Olivia Nuzzi arrives for the White House Correspondents' Association dinner at the Washington Hilton in Washington, DC, April 29, 2023. Nuzzi provided a statement of her own to Status, who first broke the news. It reported former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the subject with whom Nuzzi allegedly had a personal relationship. She told The New York Times on Thursday that 'some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal' earlier in 2024. 'During that time, I did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source,' Nuzzi told the outlet. 'The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. 'I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I’ve disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York.' A Kennedy representative has told multiple outlets, including the Times, 'Mr. Kennedy only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ny-mag-relationship-reporter-rfk-jr/	2024-09-20T10:50:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci_2a0d9a-e1725643840297.jpg?w=900
Live: Secret Service update on July Trump assassination attempt	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Communication breakdowns with local law enforcement hampered the U.S. Secret Service's performance ahead of the July attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life, according to a new report that lays out a series of missed opportunities to stop the gunman who opened fire from an unsecured roof. A five-page document summarizing the Secret Service report's key conclusions finds fault with both local and federal law enforcement, underscoring the cascading and wide-ranging failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at a Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally where Trump was wounded in the ear by gunfire. What went wrong? The report details a series of 'communications deficiencies' before the shooting by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot by a Secret Service counter-sniper after firing eight rounds in Trump's direction from the roof of a building less than 150 yards from where Trump was speaking. It makes clear that the Secret Service knew even before the shooting that the rally site posed a security challenge. Among the problems: Some local police at the site were unaware of the existence of two communications centers on the grounds, meaning officers did not know that the Secret Service was not receiving their radio transmission. Law enforcement also communicated vital information outside the Secret Service's radio frequencies. As officers searched for Crooks before the shooting, details were being transmitted 'via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion' instead of through the Secret Service's own network. What is the Secret Service doing about it? The report's executive summary does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame nor does it indicate whether any staff members have been disciplined, though The Secret Service's investigation is one of numerous inquiries, including by Congress and a watchdog probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/secret-service-update-on-july-trump-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-20T09:52:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66953219a7aff4.02450292.jpeg?w=900
$100 million judgment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs set aside	(NewsNation) — A $100 million judgment against hip-hop mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs was set aside by a Michigan judge this week after it was determined that a lawsuit claiming Combs sexually assaulted a man in 1997 was not properly served. The judge set aside the judgment against Combs — who remains behind bars on sex trafficking and racketeering charges in New York — after also ruling the man who brought it would likely not prevail due to the statute of limitations on sexual assault. The Michigan case stems from a 1997 incident that led Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith to file a civil lawsuit against Combs in June. Cardello-Smith is currently serving up to 75 years in prison after he was sentenced in 2008 on first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping charges, the Detroit Free Press reported. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is ‘on suicide watch’: Former inmate The lawsuit claims Combs drugged and then sexually assaulted Cardello-Smith as other consensual sex involving women was taking place, according to media reports. Cardello-Smith claims Combs sexually assaulted him during a party at a hotel in 1997 before the two men, along with high-ranking Michigan law enforcement officials and other police officers, conspired not to prosecute Combs for the assault. The newspaper reported that Cardello-Smith would go to prison for 14 sexual assaults allegedly committed by Combs to protect his family from harm by Combs’ representatives or law enforcement. Earlier this month, a judge awarded Cardello-Smith the $100 million judgment against Combs after the rap mogul didn't show up in court to contend the case. The judge also issued a temporary restraining order that prevented Combs from selling any personal assets that he could use to pay for the judgment. However, this week, the judge ruled the lawsuit was not properly served. The lawsuit was mailed to a home that Combs owns in Los Angeles, but the judge ruled it was not mailed in compliance with court rules, the Free Press reported. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? The law does not require lawsuits to be delivered to a potential defendant’s primary address but does require the sender to mail the lawsuit for restricted delivery. In court this week, Cardello-Smith, who is representing himself in the case, told Combs’ lawyer to tell his client that the matter was not resolved. According to Metro Times in Detroit, Cardello-Smith told the court he would file a motion to reconsider this week’s ruling. The judge has set a Nov. 4 hearing in the case.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/100-million-judgment-diddy-aside/	2024-09-20T08:57:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-1780945546_5cf865.jpg?w=900
House unanimously passes bill to bolster Trump’s security after a...	The House unanimously passed a bill on Friday that seeks to bolster former President Trump’s security, the first legislative move the chamber has made in response to the second apparent assassination attempt against the Republican presidential nominee. The House cleared the legislation — titled the Enhanced Presidential Security Act — in a bipartisan 405-0 vote, sending it to the Senate for consideration. It's unclear if the upper chamber plans to consider the measure, though similar legislation has been proposed by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). House Republican leadership staged a vote on the legislation less than one week after a Secret Service spotted a gunman — later identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58 — hiding among trees and sticking a rifle through the fence at the Trump International Golf Club, where the former president was playing. A security team conducting a screening of the holes Trump was approaching spotted the gunman and fired shots at Routh, who fled the scene and was later arrested by local authorities. It was the second attempt on Trump’s life within 60 days. In July, a gunman opened fire at the former president’s rally in Butler, Pa., piercing Trump’s ear and leaving him bloodied on stage. The bill — introduced by Reps. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) and Ritchie Torres (R-N.Y.) after the first assassination attempt — requires the Secret Service to 'apply the same standards' for determining how many agents should be used to protect the president, vice president, and those running for those offices. The Secret Service has not commented on the pending legislation, but the purpose of the bill seems to clash with their own contention that Trump and Harris now have the highest levels of security. 'President Biden made it clear that he wanted the highest levels of protection for former President Trump and for Vice President Harris. Secret Service moved to sustain increases in assets and the level of protection … and those things were in place yesterday,' acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters Monday. 'The President is aware that he has the highest levels of protection that Secret Service is providing him. …There’s a lot of tactical assets in place, things that have been put in place as a result of what happened 60 days ago. Those elements are working,' he added. The sitting president has the support of a vast infrastructure that includes the military to support the Secret Service posture. Candidates, meanwhile, have their Secret Service protection supplemented by local law enforcement. Trump has the same counter surveillance and counter sniper teams afforded to sitting presidents, along with protective intelligence and drone teams. Still, the president travels with other non-Secret Service assets, including those related to the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. The House voted on the legislation Friday as Congress continues to debate to provide the Secret Service with additional funding following the pair of assassination attempts. While some leaders have floated a funding increase, other lawmakers — including Johnson — have suggested that the issue is one of manpower allocation and not funding. The Speaker did, however, say he would be prepared to provide the agency with more money if deemed necessary. 'We have got to get down to the bottom of this. We got to ensure that this doesn't happen again,' Johnson said this week. 'If they need additional funding, Congress will supply that. But we're told it's a manpower problem.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-unanimously-passes-bill-to-bolster-trumps-security-after-apparent-assassination-attempt/	2024-09-20T08:30:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/trumpdonald_091924gn07_w.jpg?w=900
Three governors races to watch this November	(NewsNation) — As the 2024 general election comes into view, there are three gubernatorial races Americans should keep their eyes on: New Hampshire, North Carolina and Washington State. The incumbent governors in all three states have decided not to seek reelection this fall, leaving their seats wide open for a new name and potential party upset. In each of the three states, the close governor races could determine which way the state leans politically. When does early voting begin in my state?

(DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) New Hampshire's Republican Gov. Chris Sununu has chosen not to seek a fifth term as governor, with the state being one of two where a governor is elected every two years. As a result, the seat is now up for grabs and has morphed into one of the few competitive governor races this year. The state has historically voted blue, with Democrats making up all four members of its Congressional delegation. But Republican Sununu also scored four terms as governor and Republicans hold the edge in the state legislature. The outgoing governor backed former Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat in 2016 to Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte will face Democrat Joyce Craig, who served as mayor of Manchester and was backed by Hassan and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey.

(Photo by Grant Baldwin/Getty Images) A potentially historic governor’s race pits North Carolina’s centrist tendencies against the rise of populist conservatism in the era of former President Donald Trump's Republican party. The Republican nominee is Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a 55-year-old who, if he wins, would be the state’s first Black governor. Democrats have chosen Attorney General Josh Stein, a 57-year-old who is trying to keep the office in his party’s control after two terms under outgoing Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Most polls in recent months have shown Stein leading Robinson, an ally of Trump who has drawn criticism for his past rhetoric on everything from abortion to the civil rights movement. Some Republicans fear Robinson’s controversial persona could cost them the governor’s mansion — and the challenge will be even tougher for him as Vice President Harris has seemingly made inroads in the state as well. Meanwhile, the state is also a must-win for Trump if he is to make it back to the White House in January. On Thursday, Robinson continued to come under fire after CNN published an article claiming he made disturbing racial and sexual comments on a pornography forum. Amid calls for him to step out of the race, Robinson defiantly announced in a video on X that he planned on staying in the race and denied the claims made in the article.

(Photo by Scott J. Ferrell/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images) Washington has voted Democrats into the governor’s mansion since the mid-1980s, but this year, the race for Washington state's governor has emerged as unexpectedly competitive. Gov. Jay Inslee’s decision to retire attracted a crowded field of candidates for the state’s nonpartisan primary, from which Washington's Democratic Attorney General Bob Ferguson and former Republican Rep. Dave Reichert advanced to the November ballot. Ferguson, who’s been the state’s top attorney for more than a decade, has Inslee’s endorsement to succeed him. Reichert, a former sheriff, snagged recognition among constituents for helping catch Washington State’s 'Green River Killer.' Cook Political Report shifted the seat from 'solid' to 'likely' Democrat in February, and then again to 'lean' Democrat in June. After the primary, and after Harris launched her campaign, the race shifted back to 'likely' blue. But the election handicapper noted Reichert 'still has a path' to flipping the state. One Cygnal poll from late August found Ferguson up just three points.

Live: Titan hearing resumes with mission specialist testimony	(NewsNation) — The Titan submersible hearing is scheduled to resume Friday with testimony from another mission specialist who went on a dive aboard the OceanGate vessel that imploded last year while on its way to the wreckage of the Titanic. Mission specialist Fred Hagen is scheduled to be the first to testify Friday. Other witnesses have characterized mission specialists as people who paid a fee to play a role in OceanGate’s underwater explorations. The Coast Guard's investigatory panel has listened to three days of testimony that raised questions about the company’s operations before the doomed mission. The public hearing is part of a high-level investigation into the cause of the implosion. OceanGate co-founder and CEO Stockton Rush was among five people who died when the submersible imploded en route to the site of the Titanic wreck in June 2023. Earth will soon have a 'second moon' — sort of What has been learned so far? Mission specialist Renata Rojas was the latest person to testify before the investigatory panel Thursday. Rojas refuted testimony from previous witness David Lochridge regarding the OceanGate mission to the wreck of the Andrea Doria. She said that while the submersible did crash into the side of the wreck, there was no panicking or crying from passengers as Lochridge described. Lochridge labeled the experimental submersible unsafe before its last, fatal voyage. During questioning about her role in various dives, Rojas described the role she and other passengers played. She also likened the project to NASA's Apollo program of the 1960s, saying it was 'testing by doing.' In an emotional closing statement, Rojas said the loss of her friends was still very raw but 'exploration takes risks' and she hopes the implosion does not dampen innovation or other projects involving citizen scientists. On Monday, witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident sparked a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. The Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021. OceanGate Scientific Director Steven Ross also testified before the hearing wrapped Thursday. More witnesses are expected to testify with the hearing set to continue into next week.

As an international group of agencies investigates why the Titan submersible imploded while carrying five people to the Titanic wreckage, U.S. maritime officials say they'll issue a report aimed at improving the safety of submersibles worldwide. (AP Photo/Anjum Naveed) The Titan, owned by OceanGate, made its last dive June 18, 2023. The craft lost contact with its support vessel an hour and 45 minutes into the dive. Five people were on board, diving 12,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. The loss of communication launched a four-day search for the vessel, which ended when evidence of an implosion was found on the ocean floor. Officials concluded that the craft had been destroyed and all five people on board were killed. Few vessels dive that deep into the ocean, and engineers and experts in the field noted previous problems with the Titan as well as warnings that the submersible was unsafe. The search-and-recovery mission is estimated to have cost up to $1.6 million. The Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation into what happened. Concerns leading up to the investigation included the Titan’s unconventional design and its creator’s decision to forgo standard independent checks. The investigation into the Titan implosion originally had a 12-month timeline but has been extended multiple times. In addition to Rush, the implosion killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.

Who is Judge Kevin Mullins?	(NewsNation) — A longtime judge in a rural county courtroom that deals with mostly minor crimes, Kevin Mullins was killed by the sheriff of the county they both served, according to the Kentucky State Police. Here is what we know. What was Mullins' background? Kevin R. Mullins, 54, had been a District Judge in Letcher County, Kentucky for 15 years. Before that, he was a prosecutor in Letcher County, starting in 2001. The official title is assistant commonwealth’s attorney. He was a graduate of the University of Kentucky and the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law at the University of Louisville. As a district judge of the 47th Judicial District, Mullins handled juvenile cases, misdemeanors, issues involving city and county ordinances, traffic offenses, probate of wills, arraignments, small claims, civil cases involved $5,000 or less, mental commitments and cases involving domestic violence. Diddy’s ‘life’ potentially at risk at Brooklyn jail: Former warden How was Mullins killed? Stines allegedly walked into the judge’s outer office, then told court employees and others gathered there that he needed to speak with Mullins alone, according to The Mountain Eagle. Shortly after the two walked into the judge’s chambers, shots were heard. Then Stines walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police officers. State police say measures were made to attempt to save Mullins' life but none were successful. No other injuries were reported, according to NewsNation affiliate WJHL. Who is Mickey Stines? Shawn M. 'Mickey' Stines, 43, the sheriff in Letcher County, was first elected in 2018, then reelected in 2022. His department was hit with a scandal in 2022 when a former deputy, Ben Fields, pleaded guilty to raping two women who were on home arrest, according to The Mountain Eagle. In a pending civil suit against the former deputy, the home monitoring service that employed him and Sheriff Stines, the women say that Stines did not sufficiently train and supervise Fields. In August, Fields was sentenced to serve six months in the same jail where he used to work. The judge in that case was not Mullins, but rather a judge from nearby Pike County. Florida sheriff fed up with school shooting hoaxes posts boy’s mugshot to social media When did Mullins become a judge? Mullins was appointed in 2009 by Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, and was elected in his own right a year later, according to The Mountain Eagle. He has been reelected ever since. Mullins’ death was confirmed by the current governor, Andy Beshear, son of Steve Beshear. Beshear posted on X that there is 'far too much violence in this world, and I pray there is a path to a better tomorrow.' Where did Kevin Mullins die?

North Carolina lt. gov. vows to stay in governor’s race	(NewsNation) — North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, who is also the Republican nominee in the governor’s race, is strongly denying allegations about his character, but he did not specify which allegations he disputes. 'Well, guys, the news media is at it again. My opponent is at it again,' Robinson said in a post on his X page. 'Our opponents are desperate to shift the focus from the substantive issues … to salacious tabloid trash.' CNN first reported Thursday that Robinson made a series of inflammatory comments on a porn site’s message board more than 10 years ago, referring to himself as a 'black NAZI!' He also, according to CNN, 'expressed support for reinstating slavery.' Trump vows to travel to Springfield following false pet-eating claims Later Thursday, Politico reported that an email address belonging to Robinson was registered on Ashley Madison, the dating website for married people. Politico said that an adviser to Robinson confirmed that the address belonged to the lieutenant governor, who is married. 'The things that you will see in that story, those are not the words of Mark Robinson,' he continued in his X post. 'You know my words. You know my character. And you know that I have been completely transparent in this race and before.' In response to questions from NewsNation local affiliate WNCN posed before the CNN report, Robinson spokesperson Mike Lonergan wrote in an email, 'Where on earth did you hear this absurd nonsense? Is the press just making stuff up out of whole cloth now?' 13 US Senate races that will determine the balance of power in 2024 Robinson is facing Democrat Josh Stein, North Carolina’s attorney general, in the race for the governorship.

Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson staying in North Carolina race amid bombsh...	RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) is facing pressure from within the Republican Party to suspend his campaign for governor. The pressure began in anticipation of a story that would expose a series of controversial comments made by Robinson on a pornographic website. The comments, which were reported first by CNN, were posted prior to Robinson's time in politics to a website called 'Nude Africa.' As the report shows, the comments were lewd and sexual in nature and included a reference to himself as a 'black NAZI!' Trump vows to travel to Springfield following false pet-eating claims Comments from the account that's been linked to Robinson in several ways also said 'slavery is not bad' and 'I would certainly buy a few.' Further comments such as 'I like watching tranny on girl porn!' and 'I'm a ‘perv’ too!' were also found in the CNN investigation linking the comments to the gubernatorial candidate. Robinson had campaign events scheduled on Thursday but they were cancelled. He also did not attend Wednesday’s rally with Sen. JD Vance in Raleigh. Ballots are scheduled to begin being mailed out to military and overseas voters on Friday. In response to questions from CBS 17 about the status of Robinson’s campaign—and before the CNN report—spokesman Mike Lonergan wrote in an email, 'Where on earth did you hear this absurd nonsense? Is the press just making stuff up out of whole cloth now?' Teamsters skip presidential endorsement for first time since 1996 Sources who’ve spoken to CBS 17 say it’s unclear what Robinson will do, but Republicans are discussing what will happen in the event he does indeed exit the race. In response to mounting pressure, the following video was put out by Mark Robinson on X. In it, he vows to stay in the race. He also calls the news media his 'opponent,' and refers to the expected story coming out about him as 'salacious tabloid trash.' 'The things that you will see in that story—those are not the words of Mark Robinson. You know my words, you know my character, and you know that I have been completely transparent in this race and before,' Robinson added. Under state law, if Robinson were to drop out and his name remained on the ballot, any votes cast for him would go to the person chosen by the state’s executive committee. CBS 17 also learned Thursday that the lieutenant governor’s office at the state legislative building had been cleared out. A spokesperson for Republican Senate leader Phil Berger’s office said the lieutenant governor’s staff had been notified of that 'weeks ago.' Harris, Trump neck and neck in 7 swing states: Poll 'As part of the preparations for the next biennium, Senate leadership is evaluating the space allocations in both the Legislative Building and the Legislative Office Building. Since the Lt. Governor has a formal office within walking distance of the legislature, it was determined that his designated space in the Legislative Building could be converted to a meeting space for legislators. The Lt. Governor’s staff was notified weeks ago and did not raise any concerns about the space being repurposed,' wrote Lauren Horsch in an email. NC Republican reaction In an interview with NewsNation, Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) was asked if he was concerned about Robinson. 'The allegations are concerning but we don't have any facts,' Budd said. 'We're going to wait through the weekend and get everything together.' A statement has also been released by NC Senate nominee Scott Lassiter, formally calling for Robinson to suspend his campaign. Voters weigh switch to open primaries amid concerns over political polarization 'As a proud Republican, I stand for hard work, fiscal responsibility, and liberty. But no one should feel obligated to support a candidate solely due to party affiliation,' Lassiter stated, 'Wrong is still wrong, and if the recent allegations against Robinson are true, combined with his previous public rhetoric, I believe it’s time for him to step aside. North Carolinians deserve a viable choice in this election.' Robinson's endorsement from Trump Earlier this year, on March 3, Former President Donald Trump endorsed Robinson in his hometown, Greensboro. In that speech, he compared him to Martin Luther King, Jr. In response, a statement from the Robinson campaign said, 'I look forward to partnering with him take on the failed Biden-Stein agenda, lead our united Republican ticket to victory in November, and get our state and country back on track.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/north-carolina-lt-gov-mark-robinson/	2024-09-19T13:41:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/801F721F5EF52BDA1790C0940FF7196B_3.jpg?w=900
Teamsters skip presidential endorsement for first time since 1996	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters will not issue an endorsement in the presidential election for the first time since 1996 and for only the third time since 1960. Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said, 'Neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business. 'We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges,' O’Brien said. Voters weigh switch to open primaries amid concerns over political polarization The Teamsters endorsed President Biden during the 2020 election and has consistently supported Democratic presidential nominees in recent election cycles. Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt noted in an emailed statement that more than three dozen retired Teamsters spoke last month in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention, having endorsed Harris. Their pensions were saved through the 2021 passage of the Butch Lewis Act that President Joe Biden and Harris championed. 'While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,' Hitt said. 'The Vice President’s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her — alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor.' Democrats bullish on flipping New Hampshire governor’s mansion The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of members showed Trump with an advantage over Harris, a fact that the Republican's campaign immediately seized upon by sending out an email that said the 'rank-and-file of the Teamsters Union supports Donald Trump for President.' Trump called the Teamsters’ decision not to endorse 'a great honor.' 'It’s a great honor,' he said. 'They’re not going to endorse the Democrats. That’s a big thing.'

Texas pipeline explosion investigators find human remains	(NewsNation) — Texas authorities investigating a pipeline explosion near Houston this week have found human remains inside a white vehicle that traveled through a white fence and struck an above-ground valve and are treating the matter as a criminal investigation, officials said Thursday. The Deer Park Fire Department said investigators were able to access the site of the explosion and remove the vehicle that was involved. Investigators found human remains inside the vehicle and have started the identification process. Officials said that the process will take time. Would-be Florida car burglar gets trapped in Corvette, video shows Deer Park officials said Wednesday that police and local FBI agents initiated investigations and found no preliminary reports that would suggest a coordinated or 'terrorist' attack and that 'this appears to be an isolated incident,' The Associated Press reported. The probe included efforts to learn more about the driver of a vehicle that was incinerated by the explosion as flames scorched the ground across a wide radius, severed adjacent power transmission lines and ignited homes at a distance. Before Thursday's announcement, officials said they did not know the condition of the driver. An evacuation area included nearly 1,000 homes, and initial shelter orders included schools. Utility workers and others shut off the flow of natural gas liquids in the pipeline, but so much remained in the miles of tubing that firefighters could do nothing but watch and hose down adjacent homes, according to the AP. Investigators said they would release more information about the matter as more information became available. The investigation into the explosion remains active.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-pipeline-explosion-human-remains/	2024-09-19T11:08:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24260652632793.jpg?w=900
Diddy again denied bail as lawyers decry conditions at NYC jail	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — After another unsuccessful attempt to keep Sean 'Diddy' Combs out of jail after his sex trafficking arrest, the music mogul’s lawyers say the federal detention center he’s being housed in has a track record of horrific conditions and rampant violence. Combs, 54, was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Tuesday — a place that’s been described as 'hell on earth' — after pleading not guilty in a case that accuses him of physically and sexually abusing women for more than a decade. 'The food is inedible, from what I've been told,' Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters. 'It's way too hot in summer; sometimes there's no heat at all. In the winter, the toilet water has been known to freeze. It's violent. Someone like Mr. Combs might be a target for certain things. We can't let that happen.' What we know about the Diddy investigation The facility, the only federal jail in New York City, has been plagued by problems since it opened in the 1990s. In recent years, its conditions have been so stark that some judges have refused to send people there. It has also been home to a number of high-profile inmates, including R. Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) In a statement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said: 'We also take seriously addressing the staffing and other challenges at MDC Brooklyn.' An agency team is working to fix problems, including by adding permanent correctional and medical staff, remedying more than 700 backlogged maintenance requests and answering judges' concerns. A judge on Wednesday denied a request by Combs' lawyers to let him await trial under house arrest at his $48 million mansion on an island in Miami Beach, Florida. Past violence at MDC Brooklyn Detainees have long complained about rampant violence, dreadful conditions, severe staffing shortages and the widespread smuggling of drugs and other contraband, some of it facilitated by employees. At the same time, they say they’ve been subject to frequent lockdowns and have been barred from leaving their cells for visits, calls, showers or exercise. In June, Uriel Whyte, 37, was stabbed to death at the jail. A month later, Edwin Cordero, 36, died after he was hurt in a brawl. At least four people detained at the jail have died by suicide in the last three years. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? At least six MDC Brooklyn staff members have been charged with crimes in the last five years. Some were accused of accepting bribes or providing contraband such as drugs, cigarettes, and cellphones, according to an Associated Press analysis of agency-related arrests. As of last November, according to court filings, MDC Brooklyn was operating at about 55% of full staffing, which was taxing to employees and added to its security woes.

Vince McMahon lawsuit remains paused ahead of Netflix documentary	(NewsNation) — Lawyers representing a former employee who sued World Wrestling Entertainment founder and former CEO Vince McMahon for alleged sex trafficking and abuse will be providing an update Thursday on the legal case, which had been paused for a federal investigation. The legal update is coming ahead of the release of a new Netflix docuseries on the rise and fall of McMahon called 'Mr. McMahon.' Janel Grant filed suit against McMahon in January but agreed to temporarily 'stay her case' in May at the request of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York 'pending a non-public investigation,' Ann Callis, a lawyer for Grant, said in a statement at the time. Grant said McMahon allegedly sexually exploited her and attempted to traffic her to other WWE employees, according to her suit. She said McMahon allegedly abused her and that she was allegedly forced to have sex with WWE’s former head of talent relations, John Laurinaitis — all while working for the company. WWE star’s widow: ‘Not surprised’ by McMahon lawsuit At the time of the filing, McMahon resigned as executive chairman of WWE parent TKO Group. The lawsuit names the company, McMahon and Laurinaitis as defendants. McMahon has denied the allegations. 'We remain confident the evidence will prove Ms. Grant’s allegations are false and her complaint is nothing more than a fabricated, vindictive narrative from a disgruntled former girlfriend,' McMahon’s attorney has said. Federal authorities are currently investigating sexual assault and sexual trafficking allegations against McMahon. The investigation stems from sexual misconduct accusations against McMahon by a number of women. The Netflix series is set to premiere next Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/vince-mcmahon-lawsuit-pause-netflix-doc/	2024-09-19T10:24:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/07/VinceMcMahonGettyImages-90070808.jpg?w=900
Would-be Florida car burglar gets trapped in Corvette, video show...	(NewsNation) — Julio Solano received a surprise recently when he returned to his car after breakfast to find a would-be thief trapped inside the vehicle, unable to get out. Solano’s Corvette was parked in a Miami Beach, Florida, parking garage when its owner returned from breakfast to find the man inside. When Solano told the man to leave the car, the stranger informed him he was locked inside. Solano captured the exchange on video from his cellphone, including the moment when the alleged burglar asked Solano for assistance in exiting the vehicle. Texas dogfighting ring case: Hearing for suspects delayed 'My brother,' Solano told the man. 'This is not your car. This is my car.' The stranger popped up into view in a way that Solano described as being like a move executed by World Wrestling Entertainment’s Undertaker. 'He was helpless, he looked embarrassed,' Solano told NewsNation. Police arrived shortly and ordered the man out of the car. Again, he claimed he was stuck inside and pleaded for Solano to free him. 'No, you can’t get out, ‘cause we’re calling the cops,' Solano is heard telling the man on the video. Solano said that if the car is unlocked, it is possible to get in from the outside. However, if an occupant is inside and doesn’t have the keys, the lock won't work unless the person picks at the master lock, which is located underneath the seat. The man eventually found himself out of the car and was taken into custody by local police. The suspect faces burglary charges. 'I’m still in shock,' Solano said. 'We laugh about it — my family and friends — my dad, my wife, my son. We just can’t believe it,' Solano said. 'Thank God we’re safe and (that) no one got harmed.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/would-be-florida-car-burglar-trapped-corvette/	2024-09-19T09:02:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/GettyImages-2062171492.jpg?w=900
Iranian hackers tried to give stolen Trump info to Biden campaign...	(NewsNation) — Iranian hackers obtained and sent stolen information from former President Donald Trump’s campaign and sent it to people affiliated with President Joe Biden’s campaign in an effort to disrupt the 2024 election, U.S. intelligence officials confirmed, substantiating claims made by Trump's campaign last month. Federal agencies, including the FBI, have disclosed that Iran gained possession of sensitive campaign information tied to Trump’s reelection campaign and sent it to people with ties to Biden’s campaign, as well as to several American news agencies. On August 10, the Trump campaign announced it had been hacked, claiming Iranian actors had stolen sensitive campaign materials. On Wednesday, U.S. intelligence officials announced their findings, which seem to confirm the Trump campaign’s allegations it had been hacked. Where are Trump, Harris, Vance and Walz campaigning today? Officials said the Iranian hackers are continuing to share the sensitive information with American media outlets, raising concerns among the intelligence community regarding foreign influences on U.S. elections. 'Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,' officials from the FBI, U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement issued Wednesday. The campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris has publicly condemned the data breach, saying the campaign was never directly sent any hacked materials and that emails were ignored as spam by campaign staffers. The hacking activity took place before Biden ended his campaign for a second term in the White House, officials said. According to several reports, at least three U.S. news organizations received hacked materials, including Politico, The New York Times and Washington Post. However, intelligence officials said none of the media outlets published what they were sent. The Associated Press reported that none of the organizations were willing to reveal what materials they received. However, Trump has continued to claim the White House is colluding with Iran to interfere with the November election, which remains a neck and neck race between Trump and Harris. RFK Jr. says he’s helping Trump pick leaders of FDA, NIH, CDC 'Biden is working with Iran, and Iran doesn’t exactly like me,' Trump said. 'They were ready to make a deal, except we had an election that was rigged and stolen. And look at what’s happening to our world now. But no, Iran hacked into my campaign.' 'But they gave it to the Biden campaign. I can't believe it,' Trump continued. 'Oh yes, I can. But this is really foreign election interference, this is real election interference. Not the phony crap they’ve been trying to pin on me.' On Wednesday, U.S. intelligence officials said the attacks are Iran’s 'multi-pronged approach' to undermine democracy and said it is in retaliation for the death of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated during Trump’s term in the White House. The hacks are likely to escalate tensions between the U.S. and Iran and raise questions about the United States’ election security as voters prepare to go to the polls in November.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/iranian-hackers-tried-to-give-stolen-trump-info-to-biden-campaign-fbi/	2024-09-19T05:55:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2170581623.jpg?w=900
Live: Titan submersible hearing resumes Thursday	(NewsNation) — The Coast Guard's investigative hearing into the 2023 Titan submersible implosion continues Thursday with anticipated testimony from an OceanGate mission specialist. Renata Rojas is the latest person to testify who is connected to Titan owner OceanGate after an investigatory panel has listened to two days of testimony that raised questions about the company’s operations before the doomed mission. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among five people who died when the submersible imploded en route to the site of the Titanic wreck in June 2023. Earlier this month, the Coast Guard opened a public hearing that is part of a high-level investigation into the cause of the implosion. The public hearing began Tuesday, and some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. Also expected to testify Thursday is former OceanGate scientific director Steven Ross. The hearing is expected to run through Friday with more witnesses still to come. Physicist: Space objects appeared, disappeared years before first satellites What has been learned so far? A key employee who labeled the experimental submersible unsafe before its last, fatal voyage testified Tuesday. David Lochridge was one of the most anticipated witnesses to appear before the commission. Lochridge is the former operations director for OceanGate, the company that owned the Titan and brought it on several dives to the Titanic going back to 2021. Per his testimony, Rush — who piloted the Titan — previously crashed another sub off the coast of Massachusetts in 2016. Rush refused to hand over the control panel before eventually doing so after shipwrecking the vessel, according to Lochridge. On Monday, witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident sparked a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration.

(AP Photo/Anjum Naveed) The Titan, owned by OceanGate, made its last dive June 18, 2023. The craft lost contact with its support vessel an hour and 45 minutes into the dive. Five people were on board, diving 12,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. The loss of communication launched a four-day search for the vessel, which ended when evidence of an implosion was found on the ocean floor. Officials concluded that the craft had been destroyed and all five people on board were killed. Few vessels dive that deep into the ocean, and engineers and experts in the field noted previous problems with the Titan as well as warnings that the submersible was unsafe. The search-and-recovery mission is estimated to have cost up to $1.6 million. The Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation into what happened. Concerns leading up to the investigation included the Titan’s unconventional design and its creator’s decision to forgo standard independent checks. The investigation into the Titan implosion originally had a 12-month timeline but has been extended multiple times. In addition to Rush, the implosion killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.

UN spokesman: 'We need diplomacy' after Lebanon explosions	(NewsNation) — Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, is urging diplomacy amid reports of more device detonations in Lebanon. Dujarric released a statement on behalf of Guterres requesting 'all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation.' The statement concluded saying the U.N. 'supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region.' Federal Reserve cuts interest rate for first time in 4 years Walkie-talkies and solar equipment exploded in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon on Wednesday, in an apparent second wave of attacks targeting devices a day after pagers used by Hezbollah blew up, state media and officials for the militant group said. At least 20 people were killed and more than 450 wounded in the second wave, the Health Ministry said. The attacks — which were widely believed to be carried out by Israel and targeted Hezbollah but also killed civilians — have increased fears that the simmering conflict could escalate into all-out war. Speaking to Israeli troops Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance.' He made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel’s army and security agencies, saying 'the results are very impressive.' Ozempic not only affects muscle mass but also bone density The new blasts hit a country still roiling with confusion and anger after Tuesday’s pager bombings, which killed at least 12 people, including two children, and wounded some 2,800 others. The second wave also deepens concern over the potentially indiscriminate casualties caused in the attacks, in which hundreds of blasts went off wherever the holder of the pager happened to be — in homes, cars, at grocery stores and in cafes, often with family or bystanders nearby.

Iranian hackers tried but failed to interest Biden's campaign in ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Iranian hackers sought to interest President Joe Biden's campaign in information stolen from rival Donald Trump's campaign, sending unsolicited emails to people associated with the then-Democratic candidate in an effort to interfere in the 2024 election, the FBI and other federal agencies said Wednesday. There’s no indication that any of the recipients responded, officials said, and several media organizations who have said they also were approached with stolen material did not publish it. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign called the emails from Iran 'unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity' that were received by only a few people who regarded them as spam or phishing attempts. The emails were received before the hack of the Trump campaign was publicly acknowledged, and there’s no evidence the recipients of the emails knew their origin. The announcement is the latest U.S. government effort to call out what officials say is Iran’s brazen, ongoing work to interfere in the election, including a hack-and-leak campaign that the FBI and other federal agencies linked last month to Tehran. U.S. officials in recent months have used criminal charges, sanctions and public advisories to detail actions taken by foreign adversaries to influence the election, including an indictment targeting a covert Russian effort to spread pro-Russia content to U.S. audiences. It's a stark turnabout from the government's response in 2016, when Obama administration officials were criticized for not being forthcoming about the Russian interference they were seeing on Trump's behalf as he ran against Democrat Hillary Clinton. In this case, the hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Biden's campaign before he dropped out. The emails 'contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,' according to a statement released by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The agencies have said the Trump campaign hack and an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign are part of an effort to undermine voters’ faith in the election and to stoke discord. The FBI informed Trump aides within the last 48 hours that information hacked by Iran had been sent to the Biden campaign, according to a senior campaign official granted anonymity to speak because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. The Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets — Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post — were leaked confidential material from inside the Trump campaign. So far, each has refused to reveal any details about what it received. Politico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source — an AOL email account identified only as 'Robert' — passed along what appeared to be a research dossier that the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. In a statement, Harris campaign spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement since learning that people associated with Biden’s team were among the recipients of the emails. 'We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,' Finkelstein said. 'We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the effort to dangle stolen information to the Biden campaign 'further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election' to help Harris. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposes Trump’s reelection, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. Iran’s intrusion on the Trump campaign was cited as just one of the cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns identified by tech companies and national security officials at a hearing Wednesday of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Executives from Meta, Google and Microsoft briefed lawmakers on their plans for safeguarding the election, and the attacks they’d seen so far. 'The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the election,' Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers during the hearing, which focused on American tech companies’ efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation and cyberattacks. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-fbi-says-iranian-hackers-sent-unsolicited-stolen-trump-info-to-people-associated-with-biden-campaign/	2024-09-18T19:02:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66eb874de28ec4.11009877.jpeg?w=900
Body found near site of Kentucky highway shooting believed to be ...	LONDON, Ky. (WDKY) — Authorities believe the body of a man suspected of shooting and wounding five people on a Kentucky interstate highway has been found. Kentucky State Police Commissioner Phillip Burnett Jr. said during a press conference that the body found Wednesday is believed to be Joseph Couch, of Woodbine, Kentucky. Burnett said accessories found with the body have led them to conclude it is him. A weapon was also found at the site. He said the cause of death will be determined in an autopsy. Authorities hoped the discovery would end an intense, nearly two-week search that had area residents on edge. 'People have been in fear,' Laurel County Sheriff John Root said during the press conference. 'That’s not the normal here in Laurel County. So now that this has been discovered, I hope that our county can get back to what’s normal.' Who is Joseph Couch? Alleged I-75 shooter warned he was going to ‘kill a lot of people’ Kentucky State Police said on X that troopers located the body near Exit 49 on Interstate 75, just outside of the small town of London. Burnett said troopers had been in contact with a couple, Fred and Sheila McCoy, who were also searching the area with a group at the time. A live stream video posted to the couple's YouTube channel, Hatfield McCoy Museum Adventures, showed them tracking vultures Wednesday afternoon near the interstate. At one point during their search, they started to pick up on the smell of decaying flesh, which led them to the body. The livestream, which lasted around 30 minutes, ended about one minute after they found the body and called out to the rest of their search group. 'You know, I want to recognize the McCoys because they've been very cooperative with our troopers and provided troopers with relevant information,' Burnett said. Video below: Previous coverage on search for suspect following shooting along I-75 in Kentucky The discovery comes 12 days after five people were injured in a highway shooting in the area. On Sept. 7, five people were injured and 12 vehicles were damaged in a shooting near Exit 49 on I-75 near London. Authorities quickly identified a person of interest, 32-year-old Joseph Couch, after finding a vehicle registered in his name nearby. The next day, Couch was named a suspect. As WDKY previously reported, authorities had been alerted hours before the shooting that Couch had texted a woman saying he was going to 'kill a lot of people.' An emergency cell site tracker was placed on his cellphone, which pinged near Exit 49 just over an hour after shots were fired. Couch had purchased a rifle and 1,000 rounds of ammunition the same day of the shooting, investigators determined. A rifle case was found in his abandoned vehicle, as well as a semi-automatic weapon. While Couch was named a suspect, authorities warned they had not determined who had fired the weapon. Laurel County, located in southeastern Kentucky, remained on edge for days as authorities searched the heavily wooded area near Exit 49 for Couch. On Tuesday, searchers were pulled from the woods to bolster patrols in nearby communities as schools reopened. 'We feel like we’ll be better off to protect our communities by moving those personnel,' Kentucky State Police Commissioner Phillip Burnett, Jr. said. 'This is the best plan that we have going forward. We have looked at every possible scenario. We’ve looked at every piece of equipment, technology that we can utilize, and this, from what we have discovered so far in this search, this is the best plan moving forward.' Authorities said Monday they had searched and cleared over 28,000 acres of land in the Daniel Boone National Forest while searching for Couch. Cameras were placed in the woods to continue monitoring for activity. Kentucky State Police Trooper Scottie Pennington previously told reporters that he hoped Couch would run out of resources and 'walk out of the woods.' Pennington also noted that if Couch had died, buzzards could gather overhead, which could be a sign for searchers. 'And some people say, ‘Well, what if he’s not alive anymore?’ Well, we’re going to stay in the woods till we find him,' Pennington said last week. 'And, you know, that’s our job. If he’s dead or alive. It’s our job to try to find him.'

Trump to New York: 'I'm asking for your vote'	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump returned to his home state to hold a rally in Long Island, New York, with 48 days left until Election Day. Trump, for his part, leaned heavily on his alarmist message about immigration at the rally in Uniondale, focusing the bulk of his remarks on the subject. 'We’re just destroying the fabric of life in our country. And we’re not going to take it any longer. And you got to get rid of these people. Give me a shot,' Trump said. In his nearly 90-minute address, Trump confirmed plans to visit Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, following unsubstantiated claims about Haitian migrants. He also campaigned for New York Republicans in crucial congressional races. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Trump addressed the recent decision by the Teamsters union not to endorse him, stating he was 'honored to receive the endorsement of rank and file Teamsters' despite the lack of official union backing. The former president accused Iran of hacking his campaign and providing materials to the Biden campaign, calling it 'foreign election interference.' Focusing on crime, Trump promised to 'stop the Kamala crime wave,' referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. He criticized the current administration's border policies, stating, 'I want to be known as your border president. Kamala will be known as your invasion president.' The former president also announced plans to officially designate the ground zero site at the World Trade Center as a national monument 'so the heroes there will be preserved for all time.' He ripped into Democratic leadership in New York City and state, blaming them for homeless people living in what he called 'horrible, disgusting, dangerous, filthy encampments,' and even the conditions on the New York City subway, which he called 'squalid and unsafe' and promised to renovate. 'What the hell do you have to lose?' he said in asking for their votes. Before heading out to the suburbs, Trump stopped at a Bitcoin cafe in New York City. Trump has recently embraced cryptocurrency and helped launch his family’s new cryptocurrency venture Monday night. While New York is generally considered to be a reliably blue state, the former president has said a few times over the last few months that he believes New York and neighboring New Jersey could be in play this year. There's not a lot of polling data coming out from the state, but a recent poll from Siena College taken in late July and early August gave Vice President Kamala Harris a 14-point advantage. In hopes of swaying voters, he's planning on focusing on key issues, including the cost of living in New York and how it's soared in recent years. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider On the border issue, Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, 'When they got in, they let everybody pour into our country. When I got elected, I believe it was the border that was the biggest thing and I fixed it and I did a great job,' Trump said. 'I wanted to mention it in 2020 and my people would say, 'Sir, nobody cares about the border.' They don't care because I had it fixed. Now I got to fix it again.' There hasn't been a lot of attention paid to New York, with pollsters focusing on major battleground states, but Trump is still doing his best to pitch his message to voters. That's especially true after 2022, when Republicans made some gains during the midterm election. However, one of those districts flipped back to Democrats after the resignation of GOP Rep. George Santos. But Republicans are still emphasizing the area, including Long Island, in hopes of retaining control of the House of Representatives and potentially picking up some new seats for the party. By holding a rally in Uniondale, Trump was focusing on an area that could be key to Republicans maintaining control of the House. His party is trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts that Joe Biden carried in 2020, particularly in coastal New York and California, and going on offense to challenge Democrats elsewhere. Long Island in particular features one of the most closely watched races, between first-term Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito and Democrat Laura Gillen. D’Esposito is a former New York police detective who won in 2022 in a district that Biden won by about 15 percentage points in 2020. Trump posted Tuesday on his Truth Social platform that the GOP has 'a real chance of winning' New York 'for the first time in many decades.' In that same post, Trump also pledged that he would 'get SALT back,' suggesting he would eliminate a cap on state and local tax deductions that were part of tax cut legislation he signed into law in 2017. The so-called SALT cap has led to bigger tax bills for many residents of New York, New Jersey, California and other high-cost, high-tax states, and is an important campaign issue in those states, particularly among those New York Republicans serving in districts Biden won.

Live: Fed cuts interest rate for first time in 4 years	(NewsNation) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, something it hasn't done in more than four years. Federal Reserve officials were able to do this as the post-pandemic spike in U.S. inflation eased further last month. Year-over-year price increases reached a three-year low. The White House has been feeling hopeful about the state of the current economy, with officials maintaining that America can pull off a 'soft landing' from inflation. The Fed's impact on the economy Whether this will affect Americans’ perception of the economy remains to be seen. With the election now less than 50 days away, the rhetoric on the campaign trail continues to ramp up around what voters are saying is their No. 1 issue. The economy has been one of the first topics to come up at both Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s rallies as they campaign for the presidency. Should you refinance your mortgage? Here’s what to consider Asked about it Tuesday during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Harris said she wants to deal with the economy 'head-on.' To do this, Harris said, she wants to employ and engage the private sector with tax credits, particularly homebuilders, to give them incentives to create new housing. Current President Joe Biden’s economic advisers wrote in a blog post published Tuesday night that the economic and job growth under his administration has 'surpassed projections.' Trump, meanwhile, has blamed Biden for what he calls a 'failed' economy. He's said that he wants to get people's energy bills down by 50% within 12 months if he wins the 2024 election. In addition, Trump wants to work with farmers, who he says are being 'decimated' right now. However, Trump has previously said that he disagrees with the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates and that it is 'something that they know they shouldn't be doing' ahead of the election in November. Inflation show signs of easing Last week's report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier. That's down from 2.9% in July and marked the fifth straight annual drop since February 2021. Between July and August, prices only rose by 0.2%. Cooling inflation has given American consumers some relief after price surges in food, gas and rent over the last three years. In mid-2022, inflation peaked at 9.1%, which marked the highest rate in four decades. A big factor in this was a third drop in gas prices in just four months. Average gas prices for August fell 0.6% from where they were in July and are 10.6% less than they were a year ago. Although they are still higher than they were three years ago, grocery prices remained unchanged from July to August. Grocery prices in the last year have only gone up by 0.9%, which is a pace they were at before the COVID-19 pandemic. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits People's paychecks have also risen steadily, though they are still growing at a solid pace that reduces inflationary levels. For the past 18 months, their overall incomes have outpaced inflation. According to the Census Bureau, the median inflation-adjusted household income rose 4% last year to above $80,000. Trends suggest inflation will keep slowing down, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell saying in a speech last month that it was coming under control.

Where is Diddy currently being held after arrest?	(NewsNation) — After being arrested Monday on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges, music producer Sean 'Diddy' Combs will likely be held in Manhattan's Metropolitan Detention Center, according to multiple media reports. A law enforcement official told CNN that Combs will likely be held by himself in a special housing unit inside the Brooklyn jail until his court appearance Wednesday afternoon. The Metropolitan Detention Center has been the primary federal detention center since 2021, when the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan closed after a number of issues that were exposed after Jeffrey Epstein's death. Problems plaguing the facility included lax security and crumbling infrastructure, the Associated Press reported. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Federal prosecutors Tuesday indicted Combs, alleging he abused, threatened and coerced women to fulfill his sexual desires. A federal judge ruled Combs will remain in custody while he awaits trial. Combs pleaded not guilty, and his attorney Marc Agnifilo said the defense team would appeal the bail decision during court Wednesday. Diddy at MDC Brooklyn There are 1,218 people at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is located in the Eastern New York Judicial District, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Like the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the MDC is also 'plagued by chronic understaffing, constant lockdowns, outbreaks of violence, delayed access to medical care, and a rash of suicides and death,' The Daily Beast reported. 'Several courts in this District have recognized that the conditions at Metropolitan Detention Center are not fit for pre-trial detention,' Combs' lawyers said in a motion they filed for bail Tuesday, per the news outlet. Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation? Mentioned by Combs' attorneys in their filing was a June 7 incident where Uriel Whyte, a man who had been at MDC for gun charges, was stabbed to death in the facility. Spectrum News New York reported that Whyte was awaiting trial on gun charges for two years. A second man named Edwin Cordero died after being injured in a jail fight in August. Cordero's lawyer, The New York Times reported, wrote about the 'awful' conditions his client faced in a June letter to a federal judge. The prison, Cordero's lawyer said, is 'an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.' Along with the deaths this past summer, suicides and an electrical fire in 2019 that caused those in the prison to be without heat and power for days have been reported at MDC. Despite objections from Combs lawyers, Magistrate Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky ordered Combs to be held in custody. 'I don’t know that I think you can trust yourself,' Tarnofsky was quoted by the NYT as saying in court Tuesday, mentioning his history of alleged violence and citing his flight risk.

Euthanasia, pronouns, sports betting: Intriguing 2024 ballot meas...	(NewsNation) — While voters may expect to see former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on their ballots along with other prominent names, voters in several states should expect to see ballot measures that will decide important issues. In 10 states, voters will decide whether to preserve or restrict abortion access, an issue that motivates voters to show up on Election Day, as evidenced in 2022. Meanwhile, eight states will choose whether or not to ban noncitizen voting in state-level elections, and an additional 10 states will decide on adopting or banning electoral systems like ranked-choice voting. But some ballot measures in 2024 will deal with somewhat lighter issues. Voters in Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Dakota and West Virginia will have some interesting decisions to make come Election Day, from legalizing sports betting to changing the design of the state flag. Breaking down the policies and issues that matter in 2024 Here's a look at five intriguing ballot measures that will be decided in November: Maine: New state flag design Voters in the Pine Tree State will decide whether they support replacing the existing state flag with a flag consisting of a pine tree and the North Star on a buff (light tan) background, often called the Pine Tree Flag, according to Ballotpedia. You can view the proposed design here. The current flag was established in 1909 and features the Maine coat of arms on a blue background. The coat of arms includes a moose and pine tree with a farmer and sailor on either side, with the North Star and a ribbon with the Latin phrase Dirigo, which means 'I direct.' The current Maine State Flag. (Photo By Encyclopaedia Britannica/UIG Via Getty Images) Ahead of the ballot measure coming to voters, the state held a design contest that received more than 400 submissions. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced the winning design by Adam Lemire, of Gardiner, in an August news release. She described it as a 'beautiful, faithful representation of an Eastern White Pine tree proper.' The measure has sparked debates about state identity, with supporters claiming the new design better represents Maine's heritage and natural beauty, while those opposed say changing the flag is unnecessary.

Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Massachusetts: Regulating access to psychedelic substances Massachusetts voters will consider whether to regulate access to five psychedelic substances for mental health treatment. The measure would allow a licensed 'facilitator' to prescribe the natural psychedelics as part of a mental health treatment. The natural psychedelic substances in question include plants and fungi that contain the following substances: dimethyltryptamine, mescaline, ibogaine, psilocybin and psilocin. The Drug Enforcement Administration classifies these psychedelics as Schedule I drugs, with 'high abuse potential with no accepted medical use.' Cannabis, which has been legalized for medical and recreational use in more than a dozen states, is still also classified as a Schedule 1 drug. In 2020, Oregon decriminalized the use of psychedelics and the first psychedelic treatment centers opened in 2023, according to Axios. In 2022, Colorado voters decriminalized the same five psychedelic chemicals as those on the ballot this year in Massachusetts. When does early voting begin in my state? Proponents argue that naturally occurring psychedelics have shown promise in treating depression, PTSD and anxiety. They claim regulation would ensure safe access for those who could benefit medically while maintaining controls to prevent misuse. Adam Zaffuto, a veteran from Pittsburgh, told 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that psychedelics dramatically improved his recovery. 'The side effects for me were immense amounts of self-love, immense amounts of self-transformation, an ability to be a better husband and a much more engaged father and to provide my daughter with the father that she deserves,' Zaffuto told NewsNation last year. 'My wife got her husband back and got the man that she married back.' Critics are concerned about the potential public health and safety risks, arguing more research is needed before such substances are made more widely available. 'We need larger studies. We need to see more long-term effects,' Virginia state Del. Wren Williams said last year. Missouri: Legalize and regulate sports betting NewsNation affiliate WDAF reported that a Missouri judge ruled a sports betting ballot initiative up for a vote in November would remain on state ballots. The constitutional amendment would permit the Missouri Gambling Commission to allow in-person and online sports wagering. Under the proposed initiative, at least $5 million annually in licensing fees and taxes would go toward problem gambling programs, with remaining tax revenues going toward elementary, secondary and higher education. 38 states and D.C. have legalized sports betting, according to Ballotpedia. Several neighboring states, including Illinois, Arkansas and Kansas, have already legalized sports betting. Without legalization, Missouri risks losing potential revenue from those who cross state borders to place bets. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day With strong support among Missouri’s professional sports teams, some are confident the measure could pass and pave the way to legal sports wagering in the state. One reporter told WDAF that Missourians regularly drive to neighboring states to place bets. 'Going to parking lots in kind of random industrial areas in Kansas City, Kansas and you look and you see the parking lots are just in and out with people with Missouri plates stopping on their phones maybe there for 5-10 minutes,' Ryan Butler, a Covers.com senior editor told WDAF. 'Every Sunday its lined up here,' said Austin Lewis, a Liberty, Missouri, man who drives to Kansas to place sports bets. 'Thirty-minute drive everyday, it's pretty much ready for it to be legal in Missouri.' Opponents are concerned about the potential for increased gambling addiction. Other opponents say the amendment provides greater financial benefit for out-of-state funders. One committee, called Missourians Against Deceptive Online Gambling, has earned support from nearby Missouri casinos and Caesars Entertainment. A new Emerson College/The Hill poll found that 52% of the respondents said they would support a sports betting measure in Missouri, 25% plan to oppose it and 23% were unsure. South Dakota: Amend constitution to remove male pronouns South Dakotans will decide whether to remove male-specific pronouns from the state constitution and replace them with gender-neutral language. This would involve changing words like 'he' and 'his' to terms like 'the person' or 'the governor's.' Nine state constitutions — California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont — use gender-neutral language, according to Ballotpedia. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues Proponents argue that this change is long overdue and would make the constitution more inclusive, reflecting the reality that women can and do hold all offices in state government. They say the amendment is about accuracy and equal representation, not political correctness. Critics argue the change is unnecessary. Some also express concerns about preserving the historical integrity of the document. West Virginia: Ban people from participating in euthanasia A controversial amendment to prevent physician-assisted suicide will be up for voters in November to decide. If this is approved, West Virginia would be the first state in the nation to formally do so. NewsNation affiliate WOWK reported that House Joint Resolution 28 proposes amending West Virginia’s constitution to prevent any medical professional from committing euthanasia, or from helping a patient commit suicide. Critics say current law already makes it illegal, but supporters argue it adds additional safeguards. 'It’s to help protect some of the most vulnerable people in our state. Those are individuals who have illnesses, that are going through a lot. And this will protect them from being encouraged to commit suicide,' said bill co-sponsor Del. Chris Pritt (R) Kanawha. 'Restoring Reproductive freedom, we should be voting on that. But the Republicans won’t let us vote on it because they know what the outcome will be, just like in every other state. So, instead, they put this meaningless Constitutional Amendment on that’s banning something that’s already banned,' said Del. Mike Pushkin, chair of the state Democratic Party.

It also passed the Senate by a similar margin. Even if physician-assisted suicide is outlawed, it will not prevent patients from choosing to stop taking lifesaving medications or stop them from enforcing DNR orders. At least 12 states currently have bills that would legalize physician-assisted death. Eight states and Washington, D.C., already allow it, but only for their own residents. Vermont and Oregon permit any qualifying American to travel to their state for the practice. Patients must be at least 18 years old, within six months of death and be assessed to ensure they are capable of making an informed decision. Two states including West Virginia have gone in the opposite direction. Kansas has a bill to criminalize further those who help someone with their physician-assisted death.

Explosions witnessed at Beirut funeral for Hezbollah members and ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s health ministry says one person was killed and over 100 were wounded on Wednesday by exploding electronic devices in multiple regions of country. The explosions came a day after an apparent Israeli attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah killed at least 12 and wounded nearly 3,000. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIRUT (AP) — Multiple explosions went off Wednesday at the site of a funeral for three Hezbollah members and a child killed by exploding pagers the day before, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported explosions in multiple areas of Lebanon, and a Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that walkie-talkies used by the group exploded as part of blasts heard in Beirut. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. There was no immediate detail on casualties. The new blasts come with Lebanon still thrown into confusion and anger after the Tuesday's pager bombings, which appeared to be a complex Israeli attack targeting Hezbollah members. At least 12 people were killed, including two children, and some 2,800 people wounded as hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members began detonating in several parts of Lebanon and in Syria. New details on the operation began to emerge. The pagers were made by a company based in Hungary, another firm said Wednesday. An American official said Israel briefed the United States after the attack, in which small amounts of explosive had been hidden in the pagers. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The attack, which Israel has not commented on, renewed fears that the simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into all-out war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the U.S. is still assessing how the attack could affect efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel began moving more troops to its border with Lebanon on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, according to an official with knowledge of the movements who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged fire almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led assault in southern Israel triggered the war. Since then, hundreds have been killed in the strikes in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, while tens of thousands on each side of the border have been displaced. Hamas and Hezbollah are allies and both are supported by Iran. Israeli leaders have issued a series of warnings in recent weeks that they might increase operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, saying they must put a stop to the exchanges to allow people to return to homes near the border. The AR-924 pagers used in Tuesday's attack were manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, which is based in the Hungarian capital of Budapest, according to a statement released by Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese firm that authorized the use of its brand on the pagers. Gold Apollo's chair, Hsu Ching-kuang, told journalists Wednesday the firm has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years. 'According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,' Gold Apollo said in a statement. BAC Consulting Kft. was registered as a limited liability company in May 2022, according to its records. It has 7,840 euros in standing capital, the records showed, and had revenue of $725,768 in 2022 and $593,972 in 2023. At the headquarters of a building in a residential neighborhood of Budapest, the names of multiple companies, including BAC Consulting, are posted on pieces of paper on a window. A woman who emerged from the building and declined to give her name said the site provides headquarter addresses to various companies. BAC's parent company is registered to Cristiana Rosaria Bársony-Arcidiacono, whose describes herself on her LinkedIn page as a strategic advisor and business developer. Among other positions, Bársony-Arcidiacono says on the page that she has served on the board of directors of the Earth Child Institute, a sustainability group. The group does not list Bársony-Arcidiacono as among its board members on its website. The Associated Press has attempted to reach Bársony-Arcidiacono via the LinkedIn page and has been unable to establish a connection between her or BAC and the exploding pagers. The attack in Lebanon started Tuesday afternoon, when pagers in their owners' hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that most of those hit were members or linked to members of Hezbollah — whether fighters or civilians — but it was not immediately clear if people with no ties to Hezbollah were also hit. The Health Ministry said health care workers and two children were among those killed. In the village of Nadi Sheet in the Bekaa Valley, dozens gathered to mourn the death of one of the children, 9-year-old Fatima Abdullah. Her mother, wearing black and donning a yellow Hezbollah scarf, wept alongside other women and children as they gathered around the little girl’s coffin before her burial. Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would continue its normal strikes against Israel as part of what it describes as a support front for its ally, Hamas, and Palestinians in Gaza. 'This path is continuous and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre on Tuesday,' it said. 'This is another reckoning that will come, God willing.' At hospitals in Beirut on Wednesday, the chaos of the night before had largely subsided, but relatives of the wounded continued to wait. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told journalists during a tour of hospitals Wednesday morning that many of the wounded had severe injuries to the eyes, and others had limbs amputated. Journalists were not allowed to enter hospital rooms or film patients. Abiad said the wounded had been sent to various area hospitals to avoid any single facility being overloaded and added that Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Egypt offered to help treat the patients. Earlier Wednesday, an Iraqi military plane landed in Beirut carrying 15 tons of medicine and medical equipment, he said. Experts believe explosive material was put into the pagers prior to their delivery. The AR-924 pager, advertised as being 'rugged,' contains a rechargeable lithium battery, according to specifications advertised on Gold Apollo’s website before they were removed after the attack. It claimed to have up to 85 days of battery life. That would be crucial in Lebanon, where electricity outages have been common after years of economic collapse. Pagers also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, making them more resilient in emergencies — one of the reasons why many hospitals worldwide still rely on them. For Hezbollah, the pagers also provided a means to sidestep what’s believed to be intensive Israeli electronic surveillance on mobile phone networks in Lebanon. 'The phone that we have in our hands — I do not have a phone in my hand — is a listening device,' warned Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a February speech. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said from the beginning of 2022 until August 2024, Gold Apollo has exported 260,000 sets of pagers, including more than 40,000 sets between January and August of this year. The ministry said that it had no records of direct exports of Gold Apollo pagers to Lebanon. ___ This story has been updated to correct the age of one of the children killed.

Senator demands debate communication between Harris, ABC	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Claiming ABC News was blatantly partisan in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris going into the presidential debate, a Republican senator is demanding the network turn over any communications it exchanged with Harris’ campaign before she took the stage with former President Donald Trump. 'On debate night, it became abundantly clear that ABC News and its respective moderators had a biased agenda,' Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, wrote in a letter to ABC News President ​​Almin Karamehmedovic and Harris’ campaign manager, Julie Chávez Rodriguez. 'Over 67 million Americans watched as a policy exchange between two presidential candidates quickly turned into a three-on-one debate against the Republican nominee,' Marshall added in the letter first reported by NewsNation. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Trump and allies have roundly complained that ABC News fact-checked the former president several times during the live broadcast while letting Harris go unchallenged. Some Trump supporters have gone further, alleging ABC News tipped Harris off to questions and treated her with kid gloves in the matchup. ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Marshall’s request for documents carries no force of law and so far does not have the support of fellow Republicans. Marshall’s letter seeks the ABC News turn over and publicly release any texts and emails with the Harris team to clear up any concern about coordination. 'The American people deserve transparency and accountability from the mainstream media and a full accounting of whether ABC News coordinated with the Harris campaign to skew the debate’s questions and fact-checking in favor of the Vice President,' Marshall says in the letter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/senator-demands-debate-communication-between-harris-abc/	2024-09-18T07:59:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2170581764_ce0738.jpg?w=900
Should you refinance your mortgage? Here's what to consider	(NewsNation) — The recent decline in mortgage rates has more Americans looking to refinance, and the Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts could make refinancing even more attractive heading into 2025. In early August, refinance applications were up nearly 60% versus the same period a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The chance to refinance at a lower rate may be especially appealing for those who bought homes in 2023 when mortgage rates surged above 7%. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits 'If you've purchased a home in the past couple of years, you may want to take a look at where rates are today. That door to refinancing may well have opened up for you,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. However, the Fed's interest rate decision isn't the only factor that will influence your decision to refinance. Here's what else to consider. What is a refinance? Refinancing is when you replace your current mortgage with a new one, often with the goal of lowering your interest rate and monthly payments. Others may refinance to shorten the length of their mortgage or tap into their equity to raise money for a major purchase. There are two primary options for refinancing your mortgage. No-cash-out refinance: This is the most common option. It's for borrowers who want to refinance their existing mortgage at a lower interest rate and potentially get a better monthly payment. Those looking to move from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage might also consider a no-cash-out refinance. Cash-out refinance: If you've built up considerable equity in your home, this option allows you to get part of your equity back in cash. With a cash-out refinance, you're refinancing your mortgage for more than you currently owe. Generally, that means a higher mortgage rate, but cash-out refinances could make sense for those looking to make home improvements. Home loans: What are the differences and which one is right for me? Is it a good time to refinance? Whether or not it's a good idea to refinance will depend on your current loan and your reason for doing so. Generally, you'll want to wait until market rates have fallen below your existing mortgage rate to make sure you can get a better deal. While the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has dropped to 6.2% — the lowest level in 19 months — it's still more than double what it was three years ago. A recent Redfin analysis found that 86% of homeowners paying a mortgage had an interest rate below 6%, which means most homeowners may have a hard time getting a better rate if they refinanced today. For others, like those who bought homes last year when rates were above 7%, refinancing may be worth considering. What is mortgage insurance and why would you need it? As a general rule, refinancing could be worthwhile if you're able to reduce your mortgage rate by at least 1 percentage point, said Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com. At that point, the monthly savings start to look more attractive than the closing costs, which, according to Freddie Mac, average $5,000 on a refinance. McBride said homeowners with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) that's scheduled to reset in the next year may also want to consider refinancing sooner rather than later. 'You take advantage of the fact that fixed rates have come down, but you also lock in that certainty in terms of rate and monthly payment for years to come,' he said. Should I wait for interest rates to drop further to refinance? The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates multiple times before the end of the year, which could send mortgage rates lower into 2025. 'If you're just trying to refinance for rate and term, to get a lower rate, it might pay to wait here another six to nine months,' said McLaughlin. With that said, McLaughlin pointed out that timing the market is difficult because the Fed's benchmark interest rate isn't the only variable that affects home loans. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } In fact, since the Fed's rate cuts are widely expected, the market has already started pricing them in, which means further mortgage rate drops will likely have much more to do with the overall health of the economy. 'The risk in sitting back and waiting for rates to fall further before refinancing is that there are no guarantees,' McBride said. 'We'd expected mortgage rates to come down in the first half of this year and it didn't happen.' According to Fannie Mae's August housing forecast, the average mortgage rate is projected to be 6.2% in the first quarter of 2025 before gradually declining to 5.9% by the last quarter of the year. Even if mortgage rates continue to fall, both experts expect them to settle closer to 5% rather than the 2% to 3% rates seen during the pandemic. Remember, you can refinance as often as you want, but you'll usually have to pay closing costs each time. What should I consider before refinancing? There are several factors you should consider before refinancing. How much equity you have If your house is worth less than what you paid for it, then you might struggle to refinance your mortgage. Lenders often want applicants to have at least 20% equity before they consider refinancing a loan, according to Bankrate. Calculate your break-even point The break-even point is how long it will take to recoup your refinance closing costs. The bigger the rate drop, the shorter the break-even period. For example, if your refinance costs $5,000 and you are saving $100 per month compared to your previous loan, it will take 50 months to cover your costs. How long you'll be in the home If you plan to stay in the home long enough to recover the closing costs, then refinancing could make sense, but think twice if you intend to sell soon. Your debt situation If your personal credit history has become worse since you took out your initial mortgage, your refinanced rate could be higher than you expect. Improving your credit score from Bad (under 600 FICO) to Very Good (750–800) can lower your mortgage rate by 39 basis points, according to a recent Realtor.com report. Finding the best rate Shopping around can have a major impact on your mortgage rate with an average difference of 86 basis points between the least expensive and most expensive lenders, Realtor.com found.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/should-refinance-your-mortgage/	2024-09-18T07:30:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2155785262.jpg?w=900
Galaxy Gas: What is it and what are the dangers of misuse?	(NewsNation) — It started with a video of a man in a fast-food restaurant taking a hit from a flavored whipped cream canister called Galaxy Gas. He showed off how deep the can made his voice, racking up millions of views and shares as others followed. Now, when you search 'Galaxy Gas' on TikTok you’re met with a warning that some substances can be dangerous when misused. The app has scrubbed many of the viral clips, but that was after hundreds of thousands of similar videos were posted of people 'whiffing' Galaxy Gas to get high. The cans are easily available online or at big brand-name stores. When you visit Galaxy Gas’ website, you now must agree to a disclosure statement before scrolling. The company sent NewsNation a statement saying its products are for culinary use only, and misuse of any kind is prohibited. Indiana police seize nearly 124 kilos of cocaine in traffic stop What is Galaxy Gas? Nitrous oxide is so-called laughing gas. Dentists and doctors use it for procedures but say it’s not safe for teens to use without medical assistance because it could be deadly. 'These children have underdeveloped brains,' Dr. Sulagna Misra, founding physician at Misra Wellness, told NewsNation. 'They're getting instant gratification high, and there's no oversight. … You can die from one use of this. One prolonged, abnormal, wrong misuse, no supervision — you can die.' Titan submersible CEO was ‘a murderer’: Titanic expedition leader What are the long-term effects? A U.S. substance abuse study suggests that about 13 million Americans ages 12 and older had misused nitrous oxide in their lifetime. Misra said it’s all about reminding teens the short-term high isn’t worth the potential long-term brain damage. In the United States, the misuse of nitrous oxide is rising rapidly. 'People have this sort of super hero syndrome where they think nothing's going to affect them until they wind up in a hospital sick,' psychotherapist Dr. Lisa Palmer said. Misuse of nitrous oxide can impair the body’s metabolism of vitamin B12, which is essential for maintaining the insulation and protection of nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Long-term misuse can lead to range of neurological, blood-related and psychiatric complications, including nerve damage and psychosis, according to a January study from the Yale School of Medicine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/galaxy-gas-what-is-it-dangers/	2024-09-18T05:16:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1815420415.jpg?w=900
Pregnant migrants balance journey to childbirth, asylum	(NewsNation) — Leticia Alvarez didn’t realize she was pregnant when she left Venezuela, determined like millions of other asylum-seekers to trade the political persecution and hardships for new opportunities elsewhere. Alvarez learned she was 13 weeks pregnant in Panama after she developed intense belly pain early in her family’s trek to the Mexico-U.S. border. The news pushed the 25-year-old into a population of migrant women who navigate the already stressful process of giving birth while also seeking asylum in a new country. Abbott announces Texas crackdown on Venezuelan gang In 2021, President Joe Biden reversed a Trump-era policy that allowed pregnant women or nursing mothers to be detained by border officials. Despite the change, the American Civil Liberties Union submitted a petition with more than 900 signatures that called for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to change its policy to minimize harm to women who are pregnant, postpartum, or nursing, saying that mothers-to-be continue to be mistreated. Yet for Alvarez, pregnancy and migrant-related challenges pale to what she would have faced had she remained home. 'If I would have been pregnant in my country, I would be dead with my baby,' Alvarez told NewsNation in Spanish. Searching for a new life across the border Alvarez and her family needed 15 days to reach the U.S., traveling mainly by bus thanks to money she and her husband, Lisandro Escola, saved. But the couple, along with Alvarez’s sister, niece and niece’s father, also walked for two days, including through the treacherous jungles of the Darien Gap, a 60-mile stretch of rainforest that sits on the border of Colombia and Panama and connects Central and South America. The area is known to be dangerous, considering its tough terrain and steep mountains, but it has become a main thoroughfare for migrants making the journey to the southern border. 'It was exhausting because you fight to get out of the jungle, and (it was) traumatic because you see infinite amounts of things that are not told but are carried in the mind,' said Alvarez, who fell several times in the jungle. 'Once you start the trip, you don’t stop walking.' Anxiety filled Alvarez once she learned she was expecting, including fears she could lose her baby. Leticia Alvarez gave birth to her first child, Sophie, at Cook County Hospital in Chicago after making the journey from Venezuela. (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) She and Escola were separated from her relatives, who remained in Mexico City after they ran out of money. Alvarez and Escola crossed near McAllen, Texas, and surrendered to border officials. Alvarez was immediately released but said Escola was held at the Joe Corley Detention Center for seven months. She says she doesn’t know why. In late January, the Venezuelan government announced that it would halt repatriation flights from the U.S. as of Feb. 13 in response to the economic sanctions that the United States reimposed on Venezuela after previously lifting them in 2023, according to information provided by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. With her husband in federal custody, Alvarez flew to Chicago and then traveled by car to Indianapolis, where she worked a construction job. She says she worked from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, cleaning and helping lay ceramic tiles and flooring in a newly constructed building along with other duties. She saw a doctor only once in three months, fearing the cost. Alvarez saw her first Chicago doctor in early January. Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl, Sophia, who entered the world at 8 pounds, 9 ounces. Leticia Alvarez and her husband Lisandro Escola have been married since 2021 but were separated nearly all of Alvarez's pregnancy (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) Two weeks after that, Escola was freed from detention, but by then, Alvarez was carrying the emotional toll. 'Going through the pregnancy alone is very hard and very sad,' Alvarez told NewsNation. 'All you want is to be accompanied at that moment, and I was alone.' The costs of migrant pregnancy Over the past two years, the health system for Illinois’ largest county has treated more than 35,000 patients, including 670 pregnant women. The health system connects women to prenatal care and since 2022 has spent more than $30 million on migrant medical care, a spokeswoman for Cook County Health told NewsNation. Like Chicago-area locals facing economic hardship, migrants are eligible for financial assistance. Of those who apply, 99.5% receive a 100% discount, with the health system’s operating budget absorbing the costs, the spokeswoman said.

(Sandra Sanchez/Border Report Photo) In New York, which has processed more than 225,000 migrants, NYC Health + Hospitals assisted 300 babies born to asylum-seekers in 2023 while also contributing 2.1 million baby wipes, 400,000 diapers and 100,000 bottles of baby food and formula, National Public Radio reported last year. Border arrests rose slightly in August; Encounters at ports of entry hold steady In Denver, city officials have spent $90 million on migrants this year, some new arrivals who have given birth find difficulty adjusting. Denver Health, the city's safety net hospital, lost about $2 million in 2023, according to The Denver Post, which reported that the facility provided about $136 million in care it didn't receive compensation for. In the past year, the hospital provided medical care for 8,000 migrants from Central America, which made 20,000 visits to the hospital for care, including childbirth, the report said. The hospital's CEO told the newspaper that the facility isn't reimbursed by the state or federal government to cover the cost of migrant health care, which runs into the millions. Hospital officials did not immediately return an email from NewsNation seeking details on migrant childbirth costs absorbed by the health system. Ivanni Herrera was eight months pregnant when her family’s shelter assignment in Denver ended. She was told she could seek care at a local hospital, where the costs of her appointments and the baby’s delivery would be covered by Medicaid, according to The Associated Press. She declined the help. 'How could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?' she told the AP. Denver city officials have committed to keeping families off the streets and, in turn, have helped thousands of migrants gain work authorization. As she waits, Herrera has no means of regular income. She told the AP she owes $18,000 in medical bills because she forgot to sign up for Medicaid. 'I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,' she said. What Chicago migrant care looks like Doctors working within Illinois’ Cook County Health System say they strive to provide the same care to migrants and asylum-seekers as anyone else. The biggest challenge, however, is higher levels of fractured care experienced by migrants because of the countries from where they came from and the amount of time that may have passed since their last appointment. 'A pregnancy really can’t wait for you to be in the best possible place to get your care,' Dr. Mary Arlandson, an attending physician and OBGYN at Chicago’s Stroger Hospital, told NewsNation. Mexican drug cartels are operating in Southern Colorado, DEA says Doctors are not able to make up for lost time. But they can assess what care a woman needs at the time and help them navigate a pregnancy that is stressful even without challenges like learning a new city, a lack of work and finding transportation to appointments. 'The type of person who would take that journey is probably categorically different than the person who decides they’re not up for that,' Arlandson said. Since Sophia’s birth, Alvarez has struggled at times with postpartum depression. The family resides in a rented room as they await permanent living conditions. While Alvarez remains home with the couple's daughter, Escola said that her husband works construction from time to time and handles all of the young family's expenses. Alvarez says Sophia is adjusting as her parents wait for necessities like work authorizations and immigration court appearances. She says that ever since she learned she was pregnant, she has only thought about the opportunities that await her daughter if she and her husband can do their part. For now, things are as good as they can be. 'The baby is fine, thank God,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/pregnant-migrants-childbirth-asylum/	2024-09-18T03:00:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/LeticiaAlvarez.jpg?w=715
Hezbollah is hit by a wave of exploding pagers that killed at lea...	BEIRUT (AP) — Pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded near-simultaneously Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding several thousand, officials said. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. An American official said Israel briefed the United States on Tuesday after the conclusion of the operation, in which small amounts of explosive secreted in the pagers were detonated. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly. The Israeli military declined to comment. Among those wounded was Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon. The mysterious explosions came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. The pagers that blew up were apparently acquired by Hezbollah after the group’s leader ordered members in February to stop using cellphones, warning they could be tracked by Israeli intelligence. A Hezbollah official told The Associated Press the pagers were a new brand, but declined to say how long they had been in use. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the AR-924 pagers used by the Hezbollah militant group, but the devices were produced and sold by a company called BAC. At about 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, as people shopped for groceries, sat in cafes or drove cars and motorcycles in the afternoon traffic, the pagers in their hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding — leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that many of those hit were members of Hezbollah, but it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the exploding pagers. The blasts were mainly in areas where the group has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon, as well as in Damascus, according to Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official. The Hezbollah official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. The explosions came hours after Israel’s internal security agency said it had foiled an attempt by Hezbollah to kill a former senior Israeli security official using a planted explosive device that could be remotely detonated. The United States 'was not aware of this incident in advance' and was not involved, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. 'At this point, we’re gathering information.' Experts said the pager explosions pointed to a long-planned operation, possibly carried out by infiltrating the supply chain and rigging the devices with explosives before they were delivered to Lebanon. Whatever the means, it targeted an extraordinary breadth of people with hundreds of small explosions — wherever the pager carrier happened to be — that left some maimed. One online video showed a man picking through produce at a grocery store when the bag he was carrying at his hip explodes, sending him sprawling to the ground and bystanders running. At overwhelmed hospitals, wounded were rushed in on stretchers, some with missing hands, faces partly blown away or gaping holes at their hips and legs, according to AP photographers. On a main road in central Beirut, a car door was splattered with blood and the windshield cracked. Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told Qatar's Al Jazeera network at least nine people were killed, including an 8-year-old girl, and some 2,750 were wounded — 200 of them critically — by the explosions. Most had injuries in the face, hand, or around the abdomen. It appeared eight of the dead belonged to Hezbollah. The group issued a statement confirming at least two members were killed in the pager bombings. One of them was the son of a Hezbollah member in Parliament, according to the Hezbollah official who spoke anonymously. The group later issued announcements that six other members were killed Tuesday, though it did not specify how. 'We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians,' Hezbollah said, adding that Israel will 'for sure get its just punishment.' Iranian state-run IRNA news agency said that the country’s ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, was superficially wounded by an exploding pager and was being treated at a hospital. Previously, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track and target them. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordnance disposal expert, said videos of the blasts suggested a small explosive charge — as small as a pencil eraser — had been placed into the devices. They would have had to have been rigged prior to delivery, very likely by Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, he said. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based senior political risk analyst, said he spoke with Hezbollah members who had examined pagers that failed to explode. What triggered the blasts, he said, appeared to be an error message sent to all the devices that caused them to vibrate, forcing the user to click on the buttons to stop the vibration. The combination detonated a small amount of explosives hidden inside and ensured that the user was present when the blast went off, he said. Israel has a long history of carrying out deadly operations well beyond its borders. This year, separate Israeli airstrikes in Beirut killed senior Hamas official Saleh Arouri and a top Hezbollah commander. A mysterious explosion in Iran, also blamed on Israel, killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ supreme leader. Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby-trapped cellphones and it’s widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. The pager bombings are likely to stoke Hezbollah's worries about vulnerabilities in security and communications as Israeli officials are threaten to escalate their monthslong conflict. The near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have killed hundreds in Lebanon and several dozen in Israel, and have displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, deplored the attack and warned that it marks 'an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context.' On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel’s north and that time is running out for a diplomatic solution with Hezbollah. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Hezbollah lawmaker’s son killed by a pager blast. ___ Associated Press writers Hussein Malla, Hassan Ammar, Fadi Tawil and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran; Michael Biesecker in Washington; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Zeke Miller in Washington; and Edith M.

Titan submersible CEO was 'a murderer': Titanic expedition leader	(NewsNation) — The founder of OceanGate, who died in the Titan submersible implosion, was called a 'murderer' by a Titanic expedition leader after testimony revealed new details about the implosion. G. Michael Harris, founder of RMS Titanic, said Tuesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush was 'a complete, unequivocal narcissist, and in the end, a murderer.' 'He killed those people. He knew better,' Harris said, referring to the five individuals who died when the Titan imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreckage in June 2023. Titan implosion hearing: Key witness testifies on Day 2 The comments came as the U.S. Coast Guard conducted hearings into the disaster. Former OceanGate employees have testified about alleged mismanagement and safety lapses in the Titan's construction. One employee described Rush as more focused on making money than science, saying they had 'no confidence whatsoever' in the way the submersible was being built. Harris claimed that industry professionals had long harbored concerns about the Titan. 'We all knew about this. We all tried to reach out to him,' he said. The expedition leader also questioned why regulatory agencies hadn't intervened, calling it 'the biggest clown show in history.' Diddy indictment: Music mogul denied bail following indictment The hearings, which began this week, are expected to continue for 10 days. They include testimony from former employees and examinations of OceanGate's practices. Coast Guard investigators have released new evidence, including a photo of the Titan's wreckage on the ocean floor and an animation of its final journey. The submersible's last communication, sent moments before losing contact, indicated it was 'dropping two weights.' Harris speculated that this action was likely to slow the Titan's descent rather than attempt an emergency ascent as previously thought. He added that the victims likely died instantly.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/missing-titanic-tourist-submarine/titan-submersible-ceo-murderer-titanic/	2024-09-17T16:11:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/snapshot-2-2.jpg?w=900
Samantha Tapp left a strange trail years after she vanished	Go behind the headlines as NewsNation’s 'Missing' investigates missing person cases from across the country, from cold cases to the latest developing stories. Tune into our latest case’s digital show each Friday where we speak to loved ones and examine the case. Subscribe to our newsletter here. (NewsNation) — The family of a missing teenager has searched for 20 excruciating years as a trail of secrets and sightings has failed to result in finding their daughter. The beauty of small-town Burleson, Texas, is that it's the ideal place to grow up and build a foundation ... at least for most. Samantha Tapp's sister said life in their home was rough. Samantha Tapp had difficult time at home Kendale Wyatt said life in the suburbs of Fort Worth, Texas, wasn't easy due to their adoptive mother. Mother-to-be Mischa Johnson vanished in Hawaiian paradise 'There obviously was abuse. She definitely believed in corporal punishment,' Wyatt said. 'It did tend to spiral out of control. Where she used to just use the paddle, she then would just lash out and smack us [with] whatever she had: phone cord, hanger, shoe.' Unmoored, the sisters were split up to live with relatives. It took an especially hard toll on 16-year-old Tapp. '[She was] hanging out with boys all the time. I know that she stole the car,' Wyatt said. Tapp, known to her friends and family by her nickname Sam, was eventually brought to live with Wyatt and their grandparents. Samantha Tapp was 16 when she disappeared.

(Kendale Wyatt)There were possible sightings of Samantha Tapp years after she disappeared. (Kendale Wyatt)Samantha Tapp's sister wants her to know any trouble she was in is long past. (Kendale Wyatt) She began working hard to keep getting good grades at Burleson High School. Still, she had struggles, in part because of challenges with her mental health. 'She was not on her medication anymore. She was on medication for bipolar disorder, but when she came to live with us, she wasn't on it anymore,' Wyatt said. 'But I also wasn't having to get her dressed in the morning and drag her to school. She seemed like she was thriving for a while.' As things were improving, Wyatt moved across town to live with her boyfriend and his family. That's where she was when she was surprised by a knock on the door. It was Tapp. 'She wanted to stay there. She said that she had gotten in an argument with my grandfather, and she didn't want to stay there anymore,' Wyatt said. 'I told her that she was going to have to go back, at least for now, until I could figure out a way for her to legally stay with me.' Asha Degree case: Police now believe missing NC girl was killed But what Wyatt didn't know at the time was that she'd never see her little sister again. 'I figured she would come back, but she didn't. I wish that I could have ran after her right away and just for her to stay because she didn't feel like she had to run away from me,' Wyatt said. Samantha Tapp disappears Private investigator Jason Watts says Tapp didn't vanish without a trace. A few days after she went missing in October of 2004, some of her clothing was taken from her grandparents' home. Cigarette butts were left behind. 'When I first began looking into the case, there was nothing,' Watts said. 'I mean, all you had was a flyer on the internet. That's it. No podcast, no news article online, nothing.' Tapp was classified as a runaway. Weeks passed, then months, and still, there was no word from the teenager. Watts wants to know why. 'What has become of her? Why has she not made contact with any family in almost 20 years?' Watts asked. Have a question about the case? Join the conversation by submitting it on this page, and we may answer it on the show.

He was brought on the case years later and says Burleson police did not get information on crucial sightings in real-time over the years. Clues left behind in search for Samantha Tapp NewsNation was told that Tarrant County deputies, who cover the area around Fort Worth, ran Tapp's name through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. So did the police in Copperas Cove, Texas. One intriguing hit came in June of 2014 at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, where customs ran Tapp's name and birthdate. It happened nearly a decade after she disappeared. 'We ran these possible sightings down as far as we reasonably could. But unfortunately, just like with the Burleson PD, by the time we got to them, any records as to why these hits occurred has been lost,' Watts said. Remains identified as missing 3-year-old Elijah Vue In 2007, an uncle said Tapp called, asking if she could come live with him in San Antonio, Texas. 'Then, at some point, she called back and said never mind, she wasn't coming there, that she had met some man and was moving to Melbourne, Florida,' Wyatt said. 'Which is weird.' That story changed in 2015 when it was relayed to authorities again. In the later version, Tapp had actually shown up at her uncle's home with an infant in tow. But the uncle's wife didn't recognize her and reportedly turned her away. Those bits of information add up to a trail that's been difficult to follow. 'You could treat these things sort of like breadcrumbs, perhaps,' Watts said. 'The problem is, we are unable to verify them or confirm them, so we don't know that they are, in fact, breadcrumbs of Samantha Tapp.' Asking Samantha Tapp to come home Age-progressed photos show what Tapp might look like today as a woman in her 30s. Investigators and Wyatt are also working to let Tapp know that any trouble she might have been in as a minor has long passed. 'She is not wanted or being sought after for any reason,' Watts said. 'If that is the reason she is scared to come forward, she does not need to worry about that anymore.' YouTuber in court after allegedly violating order filed by mother of Sebastian Rogers What is waiting for Tapp is a loving sister. 'I missed having her present. Having been adopted and her being the only family that I had as a constant, it's hard not to have that now,' Wyatt said. NewsNation reached out to the Burleson Police Department but did not receive a response. Tapp would be 36 today and is described as a white woman with brown hair, likely between 5 feet, 4 inches and 5 feet, 6 inches in height.

Kamala Harris criticizes Trump rhetoric in NABJ interview	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris took questions Tuesday from the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia and addressed the controversial things her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has said on various issues. Among other topics, she talked about the threats of violence residents of the city of Springfield, Ohio, have faced after Trump made false claims about immigrants there kidnapping and eating people's pets. 5 takeaways from Harris’s interview with NABJ Saying 'there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,' Harris also referenced Project 2025, which conservative organizations created as a blueprint for the next Republican presidential administration, as well as GOP-led efforts to restrict abortion access. Addressing the second assassination attempt against Trump, Harris said in the NABJ interview she feels safe under Secret Service protection. While she spoke with Trump on Tuesday and said he was glad he's safe, she added that his rhetoric on certain topics should be disqualifying. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs arrested in New York after indictment 'When you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a deep level that your words have meaning,' Harris said. 'Let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.' Ashley Davis, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, and NewsNation political contributors A. Scott Bolden, Kurt Bardella and Denise Gitsham joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' to discuss harmful rhetoric. Bardella, a Democratic strategist, called out JD Vance for his misinformation about Haitian immigrants, pointing the finger at Republicans. 'This is not a both-sides issue,' he said. 'You don't get to lecture Democrats about rhetoric when you are the one advancing dangerous and disproven claims in Springfield that is resulting in people not being able to go to school because of bomb threats,' Bardella added. Davis countered that both sides have a responsibility to tone down their talking points, adding, 'I refuse to go on TV shows that argue, and we don't usually do this. I don't think it's right. ... I will never criticize Joe Biden, Barack Obama as a sitting president.' The economy and the Israel-Hamas war were also mentioned during the discussion. While Harris didn't say specifically how she would end it, she said the hostages need to come home, and there needs to be a path toward peace for Palestinians and Israel. This interview comes as the Harris campaign is spending time reaching out to both Black and young voters. Polls indicate that they feel energized about the Harris nomination. When surveyed by the NAACP, 78% of Black people said they felt as excited as they did when former President Barack Obama first ran for office. About 56% said they felt even more excited, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Still, that same poll showed that over a quarter of younger Black men said they would support Harris' opponent, Republican Donald Trump, in this year's U.S. presidential election. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day When it comes to reaching out to younger voters, the Harris-Walz campaign and Democratic National Convention are launching a weeklong effort to engage them. This includes going to college campuses. Obama even took to TikTok to talk with social media influencers about the importance of getting out there to register and vote. Pennsylvania, where the NABJ conference is being held, is also important to candidates running in the presidential election. Decision Desk HQ polling shows that Harris holds a small lead of 48.1% to Trump's 47.4%, making it a tight race.

Who else could be charged in the Diddy investigation?	(NewsNation) — A federal prosecutor said more people may be charged in connection to a federal indictment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, saying that 'nothing is off the table.' 'We are not done,' U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said during a news conference Tuesday where he shared more details on Combs’ indictment. 'I can't take anything off the table. Anything is possible,' he said in response to a question about the possibility of more charges and defendants. 'Our investigation is very active and ongoing … developments are certainly foreseeable.' Combs was arrested in New York Monday and faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. 'We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,' Combs attorney Marc Agnifilo said in a statement Monday. Timeline: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits Prosecutors allege Combs used the resources of his music empire to create 'a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.' They also accuse him of having used his employees to help him engage in these activities. 'I definitely think more is coming,' Richard Schoenstein, a trial attorney and legal analyst, told NewsNation. 'The indictment said he did all these things in conjunction with other people, but it doesn’t name them, it does not name the co-conspirators … so there has to be more down the road.' 'It will be interesting to see who will become a defendant, who becomes a witness and who comes forward as a witness cooperating,' he said. Schoenstein added that Combs’ associates should be very concerned right now. 'The indictment alleges his associates helped him commit heinous crimes,' he said. 'If you're one of those associates, you have a lot to think about' on how you will go about participating in this investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/who-else-charged-diddy-investigation/	2024-09-17T10:27:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/664e237f8bd428.09397242.jpeg?w=900
What we know about the Diddy investigation	(NewsNation) — Months after two homes belonging to hip-hop mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs were raided, he has been charged with federal racketeering and sex trafficking. Department of Homeland Security agents conducted the raids March 25 at Combs’ multimillion-dollar mansion in Los Angeles and his Miami waterfront home. The raids came as the producer faces a mounting list of civil lawsuits that allege abuse and sexual assault by multiple victims spanning over 30 years. Combs was arrested Monday and the grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday. Combs has denied all the allegations. Combs is being held in custody after being denied bail twice. Diddy indicted on sex trafficking, racketeering charges Diddy faces multiple charges Prosecutors laid out the case against Combs in a grand jury indictment. He is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. The indictment says Combs often lured victims by promising a romantic relationship before using threats, intimidation and abuse to get them to engage in various sexual activities. Those included so-called 'Freak Offs' where victims were directed to engage in extended sex acts with male sex workers on film. Prosecutors allege Combs drugged victims during those sessions and sometimes kept the footage without the victim being aware he was doing so. They also say the physical exertion was such that Combs and victims often required IV fluids afterward. Diddy arrested Following his arrest, Combs' attorney, Marc Agnifilo, issued a statement asking the public to reserve judgment until all the facts are in and noting that Combs has cooperated with the investigation. 'Sean 'Diddy' Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the Black community. He is an imperfect person but he is not a criminal,' Agnifilo said. Suge Knight: FBI gave Affleck tapes of J-Lo from Diddy raids . Why were Diddy's homes raided? While federal authorities had given sparse public comment as to what prompted the raids, NewsNation affiliate WPIX reported at the time they were part of an ongoing sex trafficking investigation. Authorities had also reportedly widened their probe to include potential witness intimidation, sexual assault and firearms violations, according to a New York Post report.

Combs’ sons, Justin and Christian 'King' Combs, were handcuffed during the raid at their father’s Los Angeles home. Justin's mother, Misa Hylton, said she has retained high-profile attorney Jeffrey Lichtman to look into the 'excessive use of force' used on Justin and Christian during the raid, which she called 'unnecessary and certainly not required by this search warrant,' in an Instagram post April 2. '(The force) used against my sons Justin and Christian is deplorable. If these were the sons of a non-Black celebrity, they would not have been handled with the same aggression,' she wrote. 'The attempt to humiliate and terrorize these innocent young BLACK MEN is despicable!' Hylton also posted security footage from the raid showing heavily armed federal agents entering Combs’ home and pushing Christian, who had his hands above his head, against a wall while handcuffing him.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) Law enforcement arrested Combs’ alleged drug 'mule,' Brendan Paul, 25, who was traveling with the producer at the Miami-Opa locka Executive Airport the same day the raids took place. Paul, a former Syracuse University basketball player, was arrested on felony charges of possession of suspected cocaine and possession of suspected marijuana candy, per an arrest affidavit. The affidavit adds that officers found cocaine and edibles in Paul's travel bags. What accusations is Diddy facing? In addition to the indictment, the music producer has been slapped with multiple civil suits in the last year, each containing a multitude of disturbing accusations. Much of the content in the lawsuits matches with the case prosecutors have laid out against Combs. Singer Casandra 'Cassie' Ventura, who had been in a decadelong relationship with Combs in the early 2000s, filed a lawsuit in New York federal court last November alleging sex trafficking, human trafficking, sexual battery, sexual assault and gender-motivated violence, among other causes of action. ’19 Kids and Counting’ star accused of fraud, posing as licensed contractor Ventura alleged that she became lured into and eventually trapped in a pattern of abuse involving forced drug use, rape, battery and forced sex acts with male sex workers. She settled the lawsuit with her former partner one day later, but her suit spawned several more alleged victims to come forward. Hotel surveillance video from 2016 obtained by CNN appeared to show Combs violently attacking, kicking and shoving Ventura at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in the Century City neighborhood of Los Angeles. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. In the video, Combs is seen running in a towel after Ventura who is seen standing in front of an elevator bank. He aggressively grabs and drags her down and then kicks her before picking up her luggage. He is then seen dragging her on the floor back to a hotel room as she braces her head. Two days later, Combs released an apology video admitting he beat Ventura in the hotel hallway. Combs said in the video, which he posted to Instagram and Facebook, that he was 'truly sorry' and that his actions were 'inexcusable.' 'I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now,' the music mogul said. 'It’s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,' Combs said, adding, 'I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I’m so sorry.' Ventura broke her silence almost a week after the release of the video saying she 'will always be recovering from my past,' in an Instagram post. 'It takes a lot of heart to tell the truth out of a situation that you were powerless in,' she said. 'I offer my hand to those that are still living in fear. Reach out to your people, don’t cut them off. No one should carry this weight alone.' She also asked that everyone 'open your heart to believing victims the first time' and that 'Domestic Violence is THE issue.' TMZ reported Ventura worked with federal investigators for weeks, potentially even before the raids. The outlet reported that she may have helped investigators establish probable cause to obtain search warrants. In February, music producer Rodney Jones filed a lawsuit alleging Combs coerced him to solicit prostitutes and pressured him to have sex with them. In other lawsuits, a woman said the rap producer trafficked and raped her two decades ago when she was 17. Another woman said Combs filmed his sexual assault on her and later used it as 'revenge porn' when she was a student at Syracuse University. Combs was also sued by Dawn Richard, a member of his former band Danity Kane, for sexual assault and years of 'inhumane working conditions.' In her suit, Richard says that Combs withheld her earnings and subjected her to 'years of inhumane working conditions which included groping, assault, and false imprisonment, among other violations.' Combs' lawyers filed a motion to dismiss some claims filed by the former Syracuse students April 26, stating that he cannot be sued because certain laws didn't exist when the 1991 allegations were made against him. He also filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old in 2003. Combs and his attorneys have denied all of the lawsuits’ allegations. Kate Middleton and King Charles ‘not doing very well’: Sources In September, Combs was hit with a massive $100 million default judgment after failing to dispute sexual assault allegations made in lawsuit by a Michigan inmate, Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith, 51. Cardello-Smith filed a lawsuit accusing Combs of drugging and sexually assaulting him at a party in Detroit in 1997. Combs was due to appear in Lenawee County Circuit Court for a virtual hearing on but when he failed to show up, a judge awarded Cardello-Smith a multi-million default judgment. Roger Bands, who worked as Combs' head of security from 2003 to 2012, said during an appearance on NewsNation’s 'CUOMO' that his ex-boss flew women across state lines for parties and invited men he’d 'never seen before' into the hotel rooms. In a documentary on the allegations surrounding the music producer that was released by TMZ, former Danity Kane singer Aubrey O’Day said Combs' 'mistreatment was enough to have changed the course and direction of my entire life.' Despite the disturbing allegations, BET News host Marc Lamont Hill noted in the documentary that the entertainment industry has been 'eerily and noticeably quiet' during the investigation into Combs. Music producer Suge Knight, who co-founded rival label Death Row Records and is serving a 28-year prison sentence, offered support to the embattled music mogul, saying he felt bad for Combs' family. Upon first hearing the allegations, Knights said he felt that it was 'a bad day for hip-hop, a bad day for the culture,' and that 'it makes us all look bad.' Diddy has been implicated by Tupac's alleged killer The man charged in rapper Tupac Shakur's 1996 killing, Duane 'Keefe D' Davis, claimed Combs allegedly offered $1 million for Shakur's murder. Davis has made allegations against Combs for over 15 years, but he has not been named in any investigation connected to Shakur's killing Court papers filed in the case against Davis include several interviews of Davis conducted by law enforcement in the last two decades. Prosecutors included a transcript of a 'Surreptitiously Recorded Interview' with Davis by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police in 2009 where he repeated his claims about Combs' alleged connection to the murder. Davis claims Combs allegedly disliked Shakur because the rapper called him out on his songs.

The outlet initially reported the aircraft was on the ground in Antigua. It’s unknown if Combs was on the plane. 'Antigua, as we know, is an extradition country, so probably not the best place to flee to if Diddy was indeed on that plane if that’s where he is,' former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said during an interview on 'Banfield.' Weeks after, Combs was reportedly spotted at Topgolf in Miami with his 17-year-old daughters. One day later, fitness coach Wes Watson posted a picture of himself and Combs at the Pura Vida restaurant in Miami. 'Came to just GRAB a SHOT of ESPRESSO and I Ran into DIDDY‼️,' Watson wrote. On Easter Sunday, Combs posted a picture of his daughter, writing, 'HAPPY EASTER from Baby Love' as the caption. Combs shared a cryptic video on his social media in early May, which shows him standing on an overcast beach with heavy winds over a narration saying, 'Steady in the storm. Looks bad, looks tough, but remains steady in the storm.' The video also showed the camera moving down a white hallway, with scenes of him hugging someone and praying in a group circle. 'Not hysterical. Not frantic. Not anxious. Not fretful,' a voice states over the scenes. He lost the honorary 'Sean Diddy Combs Day' once proclaimed by the Miami Beach Commission in light of a turbulent few months. A resolution stated that the city commission and mayor were rescinding the proclamation as it was 'no longer in harmony with the City’s values of safety, community well-being, and respect.' On Sept. 16, Combs was taken into custody in New York. Diddy denied bail Combs will stay in jail as he awaits trial. After having it denied on Tuesday, Sept. 17, lawyers for Combs offered a new judge a $50 million bail package that included GPS monitoring and strict limitations on visitors. That was rejected Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter, who ruled Combs’ plan was 'insufficient' to ensure the safety of the community and the integrity of his case. Carter concurred with prosecutors who found that 'no condition or set of conditions' governing his release could guard against the risk of Combs threatening or harming witnesses — one of the other central charges in his case.
