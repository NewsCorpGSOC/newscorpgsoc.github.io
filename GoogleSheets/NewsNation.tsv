Judge won't halt Trump, Musk federal worker buyout program	A federal judge declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole had extended the time frame for federal employees to decide whether to take the unusual offer, which gives employees eight months of pay and benefits if they wish to depart government. Democrats target Musk in first DOGE hearing on ‘war on waste’ In a Wednesday ruling, O’Toole found that the unions who had sued over the directive did not have standing to do so. 'The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork Directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees. This is not sufficient,' O’Toole wrote. The decision allows the Trump administration to close a window to accept the deal that the government originally planned to end on Feb. 6. That deadline was extended while O’Toole weighed a bid by unions to temporarily block the Office of Personnel Management from carrying out the program entirely. The White House previously said at least 40,000 federal employees had taken the deal, roughly 2 percent of the 2 million federal workers. While O’Toole’s ruling spells trouble for the broader challenge from unions to the buyout program, he did not otherwise delve deeply into the legal arguments presented by them in determining they did not have standing. Unions have cautioned employees against taking the offer. Numerous provisions in the accompanying contract contradict promises made by OPM, leaving unclear whether employees will not have to report to work and will be free to seek outside employment as the agency has claimed. Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE? The offer also comes with legal and logistical challenges. The government is currently only funded through March, raising concerns over whether funding needed to back commitments to employees will materialize. That dynamic could violate the Antideficiency Act, which bars the government from spending beyond what is dictated in its budget and requires it to use federal funding as intended. OPM and the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions suing over the deal, did not immediately respond to request for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-worker-buyout-program/	2025-02-12T15:26:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25034695240560_27d640.jpg?w=900
Nonviolent, low risk migrants being sent to Guantanamo Bay	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration is not just detaining violent gang members and high-threat migrants in Guantanamo Bay, they are also holding nonviolent migrants in the high-security facility, NewsNation has learned. A senior Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to NewsNation that 'low risk' migrants are being held at the facility and that all have a final deportation order. 'All these individuals committed a crime by entering the United States illegally,' the official said. Federal prisons being used to detain people arrested in Trump’s immigration crackdown High risk detainees, including criminals, are being detained in the base's maximum-security prison, while other migrants with final removal orders are being held in the Migrant Operations Center. The president in late January signed a memo directing the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to prepare a 30,000-person migrant facility at Guantánamo Bay, a facility in Cuba that has been used to house military prisoners, including several al Qaeda operatives linked to the 9/11 attacks. Trump initially said it would house only the 'worst' migrants and 'provide additional detention space for high priority criminal aliens.' Since announcing the move, the Pentagon has transported less than 100 detainees to Guantanamo Bay and there have been eight flights in eight days, according to the official. While Defense Department and Homeland Security officials have worked to put the infrastructure in place to meet the demands of Trump’s order, officials have been less clear about the long-term prospects of using Guantánamo Bay as a migrant facility.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/nonviolent-low-risk-migrants-guantanamo-bay/	2025-02-12T11:56:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6762eee7404f61.88475748.jpeg?w=900

MOSCOW (AP) — President Donald Trump says he and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to begin 'negotiations' on ending Ukraine war. The Republican said in a social media post Wednesday disclosing a call between the two leaders that they would 'work together, very closely.' The call followed a prisoner swap that resulted in Russia releasing American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, of Pennsylvania, after more than three years of detention. Close Thank you for signing up!

Alexander Vinnik, a convicted Russian criminal, is being freed as part of a swap that saw Moscow’s release of American Marc Fogel, two U.S. officials confirmed Wednesday. Vinnik was arrested in 2017 in Greece at the request of the U.S. on cryptocurrency fraud charges and was later extradited to the United States where he pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is currently in custody in California awaiting transport to return to Russia, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the swap. The Kremlin said Wednesday that a Russian citizen was freed in the United States in exchange for Fogel but refused to identify him until he arrives in Russia. President Donald Trump welcomed Fogel, who's from Pennsylvania, at the White House Tuesday evening after his return to U.S. soil. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin said Wednesday that a Russian citizen was freed in the United States in exchange for Moscow’s release of American Marc Fogel, but refused to identify him until he arrives in Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the unidentified individual would return to Russia 'in the coming days,' and his name would be revealed when he returns home — unlike during past prisoner exchanges between Moscow and Washington, when Russians and Americans were released simultaneously and their identities were revealed right away. 'Recently, work has been intensified through the relevant agencies, there have been contacts,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'And these contacts have led to the release of Fogel, as well as one of the citizens of the Russian Federation, who is currently being held in custody in the United States. This citizen of the Russian Federation will also be returned to Russia in the coming days.' US defense chief Hegseth calls NATO membership for Ukraine unrealistic Asked by reporters if the Russian released as part of the deal could be Alexander Vinnik, Peskov said that the name of the man being freed would be announced upon his return. Vinnik, arrested in 2017 in Greece at the request of the U.S. on cryptocurrency fraud charges. was later extradited to the United States where he pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov demurred when asked to elaborate on the deal that led to Fogel's release, saying that such contacts 'love silence' and deploring that Washington rushed to announce Fogel's release. 'Our American colleagues have chosen to announce the results, we have a different approach to the agreements reached,' he said. 'For efficient diplomacy, we prefer to observe confidentiality agreements.' Fogel, an American history teacher who was deemed wrongfully detained by Russia, has been released and was returned to the U.S. on Tuesday in what the White House described as a diplomatic thaw that could advance negotiations to end the fighting in Ukraine. Fogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for U.S. President Donald Trump, left Russia with Fogel and brought him to the White House, where Trump greeted him. Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was expected to be reunited with his family. Trump declined to say if he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Fogel and didn't say what the United States provided in exchange for Fogel’s release. Russia releases imprisoned American Marc Fogel in what US calls a step toward the end of Ukraine war Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump suggested that Fogel's release could help anchor a peace deal on Ukraine, saying: 'We were treated very nicely by Russia, actually. I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war.' The Kremlin was more cautious, but it also noted that the deal could help strengthen mutual trust. 'Such agreements can hardly serve as a turning point, but they are little steps toward building mutual confidence, which is at its lowest level,' Peskov said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-russian-citizen-freed-in-us-in-exchange-for-moscows-release-of-american-marc-fogel/	2025-02-12T09:08:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66d0d9924ff640.92504182.jpeg?w=900
Senate confirms Gabbard to serve as nation’s top intelligence chi...	The Senate voted largely along party lines Wednesday to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to serve as the director of national intelligence, the nation’s top intelligence official, despite strong objections from Democrats and initial misgivings from Republicans who questioned her experience and judgment. The 52-48 vote caps two months of deliberations in the Senate over whether Gabbard, a former House Democrat from Hawaii, is qualified to lead the nation’s 18 intelligence agencies and prepare President Trump’s daily intelligence brief. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was the only GOP 'no' vote. Republican senators had raised concerns about her views of the expanded surveillance authority granted by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which Gabbard sought to repeal when she served in the House, and her past statements about deposed Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Democratic and Republican senators, including Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), grilled Gabbard about whether she viewed former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden as a traitor. She refused to call him that, despite his theft of 1.5 million classified documents, which left Republican senators frustrated. Republican senators also said Gabbard struggled to answer their questions in their private meetings, and some GOP lawmakers, notably Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), initially questioned whether she had really come to accept and support the powers authorized by FISA’s Section 702, which provides about 60 percent of the intelligence in the president’s daily brief. Yet, Republicans rallied behind Gabbard in recent weeks thanks to the intervention of Vice President Vance, who helped reassure Young about her nomination, and the steadfast support of Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Gabbard is seen as a 'disruptor' in the mold of other Trump nominees, such as Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed last month to lead the Pentagon. Trump allies say she will shake up the nation’s intelligence community, which they claim has become 'weaponized' against Trump. Trump allies have repeatedly pointed to the open letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials who claimed that a report about incriminating information found on Hunter Biden’s laptop during the 2020 presidential campaign was likely the product of a 'Russian influence operation.' Vance held multiple conversations with Young, a former Marine intelligence officer, between Gabbard’s rocky confirmation hearing and her vote in committee. Every Republican on the Intelligence panel voted to send her nomination to the floor, giving it strong momentum. That set up a 52-46 vote Monday to tee up a final confirmation vote, with all Republicans present voting to advance her. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) hailed Gabbard as a 'patriot, motivated by service' who has served her country and community since age 21 when she was elected to the Hawaii state Legislature. 'Tulsi Gabbard has worn the uniform of our country for the last 22 years, leading American soldiers in some of the most dangerous parts of the world,' he said, also noting her eight years of service in Congress as a member of the House Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees. Democrats argued that Gabbard is not qualified to serve as the nation’s top intelligence boss and has shown tremendous lapses in judgment by disputing a finding by the U.S. intelligence community that Assad, the former Syrian president, had used chemical weapons against his own people and by echoing Putin’s rationale for invading Ukraine. 'By any objective measure and by every objective measure as well, she is not qualified. From the moment she was nominated, both Democrats and Republicans were puzzled by the choice,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) said on the floor before her vote. 'Of all people Donald Trump could have picked to oversee national intelligence, he picked someone known for repeating Russian propaganda and getting duped by conspiracy theories,' he said. Schumer said Gabbard would likely only get 10 votes in the Senate if her confirmation vote was held by secret ballot. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, said Gabbard had 'demonstrated she’s not up to the task' of representing tens of thousands of intelligence officials around the world, pointing to her support of Assad’s claim that he didn’t use chemical weapons despite U.S. intelligence findings to the contrary. He argued that she 'knowingly met with the Syrian cleric who threatened to conduct serial bomb attacks against the United States' and 'sought to blame the United States and NATO' for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, by asserting the Biden administration failed to take seriously Putin’s concern about Ukraine joining NATO. Republican senators have come under tremendous pressure to support Trump’s most controversial nominees, such as Gabbard, Hegseth, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom the Senate will vote on this week to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday called Gabbard’s nomination 'part of a pattern of unilateral disarmament by the Trump administration against Russia.' He cited a Washington Post article from November that reported Gabbard’s appointment as head of national intelligence had 'elicited the most excitement in Russia because she has long been regarded as a darling of the propagandist Russian R.T. network.' 'Russian TV has called Ms. Gabbard ‘our friend Tulsi.’ [A] Russian newspaper published an op-ed, and it was titled the CIA and FBI are trembling [that] Trump protégé Tulsi Gabbard will support Russia,' he said on the floor. But Cotton, one of the most respected voices on national security in the Senate GOP conference, pushed back on criticism and warned colleagues at her confirmation hearing not to question her patriotism or integrity. 'Let me remind everyone that Ms. Gabbard has served in our Army for more than two decades, she has multiple combat tours, and she still wears the uniform today. She has undergone five FBI background checks,' he said at the start of her hearing. One of the biggest obstacles to Gabbard’s nomination was her sponsorship of legislation during her final year in the House to repeal FISA’s Section 702, which grants intelligence agencies broad powers to eavesdrop on foreign targets. Gabbard in past called the expanded authority an 'overreach.' But she changed her characterization of the law in private meetings with GOP senators, explaining that her position had changed because of reforms made to the program. Lankford, a member of the Intelligence panel, told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' last month that he decided to support Gabbard after she clarified to him that she would now support Section 702 authority in light of recent changes. She pledged to maintain the program, calling it a 'vital' national security tool.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-confirms-gabbard-to-serve-as-nations-top-intelligence-chief/	2025-02-12T08:54:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Leadding-Gabbard_013025_AP_John-McDonnell.jpg?w=900
US defense chief Hegseth calls NATO membership for Ukraine unreal...	BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and in sweeping remarks suggested that the way forward for Ukraine was for the country to abandon hopes of a return to its pre-2014 borders and prepare for a negotiated settlement with Russia — one that should be backed up with an international force of troops. Hegseth made the comments Wednesday during the first trip to NATO and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group by a member of the new Trump administration. Allies have been waiting to hear how much continued military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine’s government. What they heard was that President Donald Trump is intent on getting Europe to assume the majority of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine — to include a possible peacekeeping force that would not include U.S. troops — and that Hegseth said should not have Article Five protections if those troops end up in contact with Russian forces.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine’s government. Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth’s predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022. Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States. No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called. Hegseth wasn’t expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine. His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won’t stop at Ukraine’s borders if he wins, and that Europe’s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He’s complained that it’s costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources. House DOGE subcommittee to hold first hearing Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren’t favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine’s security going forward. Washington’s 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump’s new administration has in store for the world’s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn’t meet NATO guidelines for military spending. NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it’s one that Ukraine is trying to secure. Ukraine’s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product. However, a third of members still haven’t reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far — not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year. Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn’t commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and 'should not go lower than 3 percent.' Audio from Titan submersible implosion released by NOAA He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that 'we live in fiscally constrained times' and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense. NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26. ___ Lolita C.

Fogel release a sign of Trump, Putin's 'great friendship': Witkof...	(NewsNation) — Special envoy Steve Witkoff said the return of American Marc Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since 2021, could be a sign of the future working relationship between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump and Putin had a 'great friendship, and I think now it's going to continue,' Witkoff told NewsNation on Wednesday. 'I think that getting Marc Fogel out was critical, and the Russians were very, very helpful in that effort and very accommodating,' Witkoff said. In a live interview on NewsNation's 'Morning in America,' Witkoff said Fogel was 'exultant' to be back in the United States. Once Vogel was told he was on American soil, he was so excited he did a 'scissor kick,' Witkoff said. DOGE subcommittee to hold first hearing focused on ‘war on waste’ 'He was kissing people and hugging people he had never met before in his life,' Witkoff said. Fogel, a teacher, was arrested for bringing medical marijuana into the country in 2021 and sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2022. The Trump administration announced it had secured Fogel's release on Tuesday, and Trump greeted Fogel at the White House that night. Fogel thanked Trump and members of the administration for his safe return and said the 'superorganism of people' supporting him helped sustain him during his time in Russian prison. As for whose release the administration is working on next, Witkoff said Trump will 'use his strength to bring everybody home that we can.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/fogel-release-trump-putin-friendship-witkoff/	2025-02-12T06:10:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/B2638F5AF1EC6970636BF206815F6027.jpg?w=900
DOGE subcommittee to hold first hearing focused on 'war on waste'	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Delivering on Government Efficiency subcommittee, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., will hold its first hearing Wednesday as Congress begins working with the White House on President Donald Trump's plan to reshape the federal government. The new House subcommittee, a partner to billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, could be a crucial legislative tool for Trump's agenda. Greene, who met with Musk and Trump on Monday, said Wednesday's hearing will launch 'a war on waste.' The hearing, fully titled 'The War on Waste: Stamping Out the Scourge of Improper Payments and Fraud,' will feature testimony from a former FBI agent and the director of the United Council on Welfare Fraud. It comes as Democrats and some government workers are protesting massive cuts to the federal workforce and Musk's influence in the White House. Who is running DOGE with Elon Musk? 'DOGE subcommittee members will work with expert witnesses to examine how Congress can assist the president in the effort to stamp out improper payments and fraud,' Greene said in a news release. Trump: DOGE has found 'tremendous' fraud The hearing follows Trump's claims that DOGE has uncovered tens of billions of dollars in fraud and abuse, blaming bad government contracts. 'We're finding tremendous fraud and tremendous abuse. If I need a vote of Congress to find fraud and abuse, it's fine by me. I think we'll get the vote,' Trump said while speaking to reporters Tuesday alongside Musk in the Oval Office. Musk added, 'The people voted for major government reform, and that's what the people are going to get. They're going to get what they voted for.' Trump's executive order limits new hires As the White House looks to buy out nearly 2 million federal government employees, Trump is limiting federal agencies to hiring one worker for every four who leave. The deadline for federal employees to accept a buyout offer was extended indefinitely Monday as a lawsuit to block the plan continues in court. House Oversight Committee announces ‘disclosure’ task force The Office of Personnel Management has offered federal workers who resign pay and benefits through September. The White House has called the offer 'generous' and reported that more than 65,000 workers, about 2.5% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout. The buyout is part of Trump’s aim to reduce the federal workforce and aligns with plans to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of the administration’s efforts to dismantle USAID. Democrats question legality of DOGE actions Democrats have continued to question the legality of DOGE's actions, including spending cuts and the downsizing of the federal workforce. The moves have sparked protests in Washington, D.C., where thousands of American Federation of Government Workers union members and supporters rallied outside the Capitol, with some holding signs and chanting against Trump and Musk.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-subcommittee-hearing-war-on-waste/	2025-02-12T04:38:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
Ted Nugent praises Trump's deportations: 'This is war'	(NewsNation) — Conservative rock musician Ted Nugent endorses the Trump administration’s early push to round up illegal immigrants and deport them. 'Everybody I know — all my ranching buddies, private landowners — we’ve got our borders secure,' Nugent, a Texas resident, said during Tuesday's 'On Balance.' 'The least that we could expect is that our government would do what we the people do and what we the people demand: Secure my effing country.' ‘Too f—— low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source says So far, arrests have focused on what authorities say are the most dangerous migrants, but federal officials concede the end game is to deport anyone who is in the United States illegally. Nugent says the government can’t be concerned about otherwise law-abiding migrants who aren’t authorized to be here when agents face danger in the field. 'We don’t have the responsibility or the time or the effort to decide who might be dangerous or who might not be. Once you’ve invaded our country, you’re a bad guy,' he said. He added: 'This is war.' Ted Nugent: From rocker to shocker The 76-year-old Nugent enjoyed commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s as a solo recording artist and concert act and probably is best known for his 1977 album 'Cat Scratch Fever,' with its hit single of the same name. He later joined the supergroup Damn Yankees. In recent years, the Michigan native and hunting and gun-rights advocate has courted controversy for his outspoken views. In 2014, he wrote a column suggesting that illegal immigrants should become 'indentured servants' until they earn citizenship. He also drew the scrutiny of the U.S. Secret Service in 2012 after telling an NRA audience he would be 'dead or in jail' if Democratic President Barack Obama was reelected. The matter was dropped after Nugent met with agents. He later referred to Obama as a 'subhuman mongrel,' for which he apologized.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ted-nugent-trumps-deportations-war/	2025-02-11T20:14:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/nuge.jpg?w=900
What agencies do Elon Musk, DOGE have access to?	(NewsNation) — Despite its name, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency group is not a formal part of the federal government — it’s an outside commission set up to advise President Trump on areas where money can be saved. Under an executive order, Trump created DOGE, which he said would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Does DOGE have your personal information? Trump originally tapped Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead DOGE after his reelection last year. Since then, Ramaswamy left DOGE. Here's an updated list of all the federal agencies DOGE has gained access to. What does DOGE have access to? Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services DOGE agents have gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency confirmed in February. It's unclear which systems DOGE had access to and whether any sensitive medical information was part of the efforts. The Wall Street Journal reported that DOGE aides had been granted access to key payment and contract systems. CMS says DOGE doesn’t have full access and is just hunting for fraud, Politico reported. Commerce Department At least one DOGE agent has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT systems, including accessing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, New York Magazine reported. Democratic lawmakers accused DOGE of improperly inserting itself into the NOAA. In a joint statement, California Democratic Reps Zoe Lofgren and Jared Huffman said Musk’s cost-cutting group isaccessing NOAA’s computer systems. NOAA is charged with forecasting weather, monitoring atmospheric conditions and mapping the seas, among other things. No, DOGE did not find Pentagon spent $600 million on sushi Education Department DOGE cut $900 million from a federal research agency that tracks American students’ academic progress after claiming there's no need for much of its work. It’s unclear to what degree the Education Department’s Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk’s team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute’s work. Additionally, Senate Democrats are concerned DOGE may have illegally accessed federal student loan data, but that doesn’t mean borrowers will see their loans forgiven, as some on TikTok have claimed. The Washington Post reported that DOGE is using AI software to target cuts within the Department of Education, as well, indicating that sensitive information including internal financial information has been fed into a software system to analyze spending. Federal Aviation Administration Musk said DOGE will make 'rapid safety upgrades' to the air traffic control systems with the Federal Aviation Administration. 'With the support of President @realDonaldTrump, the @DOGE team will aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,' Musk wrote on the social platform X. 'The FAA’s primary aircraft safety notification system failed for several hours!' he added, likely referring to an outage of the FAA’s Notice to Air Mission system in February. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy then said on X that he 'talked to the DOGE team' and 'they are going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.' It remains unclear if Musk and DOGE have actually gained access to FAA systems. Elon Musk’s DOGE sued as Trump takes office: Report Treasury Department DOGE got access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems, The Associated Press reported. The news came after Treasury acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk resigned his position after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data. Musk on Saturday responded to a post on his social media platform X about the departure of Lebryk: 'The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.' He did not provide proof of this claim. US Agency for International Development The future of the U.S. Agency for International Development continues to remain uncertain as DOGE has taken control of the agency’s money, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. On Friday, a federal judge dealt Trump and Musk their first big setback in their dismantling of USAID, ordering a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of agency staffers off the job. Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE? U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, also agreed to block an order that would have given the thousands of overseas USAID workers the administration wanted to place on abrupt administrative leave just 30 days to move families and households back to the U.S. at government expense. According to current and former USAID officials, all USAID humanitarian work around the world had been stopped, ABC News reported. Veterans Affairs Veterans Affairs leaders confirmed they are working with DOGE but say veterans’ personal info remains secure, Military Times reported. They're reportedly working on ways to reform agency operations. Labor unions sue to block DOGE access to sensitive information On Monday, a coalition of labor unions filed a lawsuit asking a federal court to stop Musk’s team from accessing private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management. Judge adjusts ruling blocking Musk, DOGE from Treasury Department payment systems The suit, led by the American Federation of Teachers, alleges the Trump administration violated federal privacy laws when it gave DOGE access to systems with personal information on tens of millions of Americans without their consent. It was filed in federal court in Maryland. It’s the latest in a flurry of legal challenges to Musk’s growing influence over federal agencies he has promised to slash or dismantle. A federal judge in New York blocked Musk’s team from a Treasury Department system Saturday after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued over privacy concerns.

Marco Rubio: Marc Fogel’s release from Russia cause for ‘celebrat...	(NewsNation) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NewsNation that American teacher Marc Fogel's Tuesday release from Russia is cause for 'celebration.' 'Anytime an American comes home who's being held overseas like this situation is, it's a time for celebration,' Rubio said. 'We're happy for him and for his family. It's a case we've followed very closely for a number of years.' Teacher Marc Fogel released from Russia Rubio and hostage affairs envoy Adam Boehler joined 'CUOMO' via phone on their way to pick up American teacher Marc Fogel, whose release from Russian detainment was secured by the Trump administration Tuesday. The pair pointed out that Russia asked for nothing in return when releasing Fogel, which Rubio said shows 'President Trump's commitment to bringing home Americans.'

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough, File) Fogel was arrested for bringing medical marijuana into Russia in 2021. In 2022, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. On Tuesday, the Trump administration secured his return home. The U.S. government did not initially label Fogel as unlawfully detained, despite doing so in a similar case involving WNBA star Brittney Griner. In 2024, the Biden administration negotiated the release of Americans, including journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva as well as Whelan. Paul Whelan: No way Russia wanted nothing for Marc Fogel Though Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Donald Trump maintain that the country wanted nothing in return, retired U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who was held as a Russian prisoner for more than five years, tells 'CUOMO' he doesn’t buy it. 'The whole reason they hold Americans, the whole reason they hold the Tajiks and Uzbeks, is so that they can exact some sort of price.' Whelan said, adding that these arrests are more like 'kidnapping.' ‘He loves being a father’: Dad of Hamas hostage hopeful He clarified that he doesn't believe politicians are necessarily lying about Russia's wants, but rather that there are 'things that are done under the table.' No stranger to Russian prison conditions and thought processes, Whelan told NewsNation: 'They want some sort of exchange. They want sanctions relief. They want some sort of, you know, détente with the Ukraine situation.'

Musk defends DOGE alongside Trump in striking Oval Office moment	Elon Musk on Tuesday defended the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside President Trump, who invited Musk to speak and sat at the resolute desk as the tech mogul gave a lengthy address. 'The people voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get,' Musk said in response to pushback his work at DOGE has received. 'That’s what democracy is all about.' Musk also said he wants to add 'commonsense controls' to government, arguing that his ideas are not 'draconian.' And, when asked about personal conflicts of interest with his work overhauling the government, Musk replied, 'transparency is what builds trust.' In the first few weeks of Trump’s presidency, Musk has led an effort to dismantle federal agencies, buy out hundreds of thousands of federal workers from their jobs and take over payment systems within the Treasury Department and other agencies. The work has sparked numerous lawsuits and pushback from Democratic lawmakers, state office holders and unions representing federal works. Tuesday’s striking moment at the Oval Office featured the leader of the free world inviting the richest man in the world to give a defense of his goals in front of press brought in for the occasion. One of Musk’s young children pulled at his coat at times as the billionaire, wearing a black 'Make America Great Again' baseball cap, argued the federal bureaucracy can’t have more power than any elected representative. 'If money is spent badly, if your taxpayer dollars are not spent in a sensible or critical manner, then that’s not okay. Your tax dollars need to be spent wisely, on things that matter,' Musk said, defending the goal of DOGE. As examples of waste, Musk mentioned that people who are 150 years old, so are 'probably dead,' are receiving Social Security checks and that bureaucrats with a salary of 'a few $100,000' have 'somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth.' He said that happened with U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) employees, suggesting they 'got wealthy at the taxpayers’ expense.' Musk offered no specific evidence to back up these allegations. The president said on Tuesday that he thought it was 'crazy' that DOGE has been able to find so much fraud and waste in the federal government, arguing 'we had no idea we were going to find this much.' Trump also said the White House is watching for if there’s a conflict of interest or lack of transparency on anything Musk is working on, noting that he is 'a big businessman' doing this work. A federal judge issued a Saturday ruling that prevents DOGE from accessing the Treasury Department’s payment systems by blocking political appointees and special government employees, like Musk and DOGE personnel. On Tuesday, the court clarified the ruling, saying that it does not extend to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Meanwhile, Trump and his allies have denounced the original, sweeping ruling. Trump, in the Oval Office, said the judge has 'certain leanings' and that he hopes the courts would allow him to do what he was elected to do. 'It seems hard to believe that judges want to stop us,' Trump said. 'It seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don’t want you to do that. Then we have to look at the judges because I think it’s a very serious violation.' Musk doubled down on defending DOGE’s work at the Treasury Department in particular. 'The stuff we’re doing with the Treasury Department is so basic that you can’t believe it doesn’t exist already,' he said, adding that the U.S. currently pays some 'terrorists organizations, known fraudsters' that belong on a 'do not pay list.' Musk did not offer specifics on this declaration, but later said that if he is wrong, especially in making statements about what the federal government spends money on, he will accept corrections. 'Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. So, nobody is going to bat a thousand. We will make mistakes and we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes,' the Tesla CEO said. DOGE has targeted various parts of the federal government, including the USAID and is now looking to similarly gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Why are some calling for a Coca-Cola boycott?	(NewsNation) — A newly established Latino group is speaking out against Coca-Cola as part of its campaign against companies that do not support diversity, equity and inclusion, aka DEI. Others on social media are also boycotting the popular soda company, but the reasons for this are unclear. Who is leading the Coca-Cola boycott? 'The Latino Freeze Movement' was created in 2025 and calls itself a grassroots movement, saying it is 'committed to showing the value that Latinos, other minorities and allies have in the United States.' According to NewsNation affiliate Border Report, videos are circulating on social media of Latinos rejecting Coca-Cola. Cuomo: Department of Education isn’t a ‘DEI boogeyman,’ it’s necessary 'Latinos and Latinas stop spending money. Hold the line. We can all collectively make a big impact by simply holding and not spending our money,' the Latino Freeze Movement said on its website. Why are they calling for the boycott? The group urges its followers not to buy Coca-Cola or shop at Amazon, Target, Walmart and other companies that have scaled back DEI efforts. Coca-Cola has a webpage dedicated to DEI and has not announced any reduction of its initiatives. Others on TikTok have floated claims Coca-Cola called ICE on its employees at a plant and are using the hashtag '#Latinofreeze.' None of these rumors have been confirmed. Newsweek reviewed company records and public filings and did not find any evidence of mass layoffs. Meanwhile, a conservative research group has issued a 'woke alert' for Coca-Cola's support of transgender women participating in women's sports. Consumer Research also criticized Coca-Cola for saying, 'DEI is at the heart of our values.' Coca-Cola, according to its website, has approximately 530 million consumers in Latin America.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/coca-cola-boycott-explained/	2025-02-11T13:54:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/02/65cb8a2461e984.87465429.jpeg?w=900
Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE?	(NewsNation) —Tech billionaire Elon Musk may be in charge of the Trump administration’s new Department of Government Efficiency, but he’s also got a group of helpers to who are running the controversial agency. While Musk has been the face of DOGE, several others are working behind the scenes to keep on with the agency’s stated mission of cutting costs in the federal government by rapidly burrowing deep into federal agencies including The United States Agency for International Development and the Department of Education. While DOGE does not have an official roster because it’s not not technically a government agency, Musk appears to have tapped into several people within his sphere, including a group of young engineers with minimal work experience. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? Here’s who is running DOGE with Musk: Steve Davis Musk has installed Steve Davis, an engineer who has been with the tech billionaire for 20 years and over several of his companies including SpaceX and X as his deputy, reported the Los Angeles Times. Davis is currently also the president of Boring, Musk’s tunneling company. Musk's deputy has had a reputation for being a shrewd cost-cutter and running fast-paced operations, which have at times resulted with him at odds with safety regulators, the Guardian reported. UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 5: Elon Musk is seen in the U.S. Capitol after a meeting with Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., while on the Hill to talk about President-elect Donald Trump's 'Department of Government Efficiency,' on Thursday, December 5, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Boring’s former safety manager told Fortune that Davis had isolated him in ways that stopped him from doing his job when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that several Boring employees had been burned with chemical accelerants due to hazardous working conditions at the site. Does DOGE have your personal information? Davis undertook much of the hiring for DOGE prior to Trump taking office and was at the United States Agency for International Development when Doge staffers and agency security officials clashed over Musk’s demands for access to restricted areas, the Guardian reported. Marko Elez Musk brought Marko Elez, a 25-year-old Rutgers University graduate who worked at Musk’s SpaceX and X. Elez was a temporary appointee at Treasury who was given access to sensitive account data with administrator-level privileges, reported Wired. He resigned last week after racist social media posts of his came to light by the Wall Street Journal. 'Normalize Indian hate,' the account associated with Elez posted in September, regarding people of Indian ethnicity who work in the U.S. tech sector, the outlet reported. Elez was reinstated one day later. Vice President Vance on Friday said he disagrees with Elez’s posts but that 'stupid social media activity' should not 'ruin a kid’s life,' he wrote on X. 'So I say bring him back,' which President Trump said he would support. Musk replied with: 'He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.' Musk says he’ll bring back DOGE staffer under fire for racist posts Edward Coristine 19-year-old Edward Coristine was also tapped by Musk for DOGE. Coristine briefly worked for Musk’s brain chip start-up Neuralink. Coristine has gone by the username 'Big Balls' online and founded a company called 'Tesla.Sexy LLC', according to Wired. Coristine is a high school graduate with a history of launching startups and has founded at least five companies; many of these were erased from his now-deleted LinkedIn profile. Coristine has been given access to sensitive data and has been on calls with government employees as they are asked to defend their jobs, Wired reported. The Washington Post reported Coristine has taken on new roles as a senior adviser at the State Department and at the Department of Homeland Security. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 03: Protestors gather outside of USAID headquarters on February 03, 2025 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Some U.S. officials expressed alarm about Coristine’s being given the role. 'This is dangerous,' a U.S. officials told The Post, noting Coristine’s age and a report by Bloomberg News that he was fired for leaking a data security firm’s information to a competitor. Akash Bobba Another young engineer, Akash Bobba, 22, is also a part of DOGE. According to a copy of his now-deleted LinkedIn obtained by Wired, Bobba was an investment engineering intern at the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund as of last spring and was previously an intern at both Meta and Palantir. Luke Farritor Farritor, 23, is a former intern at SpaceX, Musk’s space company, and currently a Thiel Fellow, Wired reported. He dropped out of the University of Nebraska, but was part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll while he was enrolled, according to the outlet. 5 questions about DOGE’s access to federal payment systems Gavin Kliger Kliger is listed as 'special advisor to the director' at the Office of Personnel Management on his LinkedIn page and is listed as being in internal records as a special adviser to the director for information technology, reported Wired.

The billionaire did not go into detail on what his role will be exactly and said he was not speaking for Musk, but he appeared to have advance knowledge of Doge’s goals and said he had plans to take part in 'the money side,' head count and regulation.

House Oversight Committee announces 'disclosure' task force	(NewsNation) — The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform announced the formation of a tasks force for the declassification of federal secrets. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., will lead the bipartisan task force that will take on a number of issues, including topics that have spawned conspiracies. Luna has been involved in investigations into unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) or, as they are more commonly known, UFOs. Tom Homan: ‘I’m not satisfied’ with number of ICE arrests The task force is building on an executive order issued by President Donald Trump calling for the declassification of all files related to the John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations. Other topics will include UAPs, the Epstein list, 9/11 files and the origins of COVID-19. While all of those have sparked long-standing conspiracy theories, Luna maintained the group was not a conspiracy investigation committee but one intending to present information for Americans to determine the truth. 'We stand at the dawn of a new era,' she said. Luna stressed that the committee is a bipartisan effort that includes Democratic lawmakers. She also said the committee has already begun the process of communicating with several federal agencies to request information. If those agencies do not comply, Luna said the group would take action and do more than write letters protesting the lack of transparency. Previously, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had discussed forming a UFO caucus or task force to investigate recent whistleblower claims of secret UAP programs.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/oversight-new-task-force/	2025-02-11T11:26:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2184674649-e1734712571301.jpg?w=800
Teacher Marc Fogel released from Russia	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday it had secured the release of American Marc Fogel, who had been detained by Russia. Special envoy Steve Witkoff was involved in negotiating an exchange that would bring Fogel back to the U.S. National security adviser Mike Waltz said in a statement the exchange 'serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.' Fogel, a teacher, was arrested for bringing medical marijuana into the country in 2021 and sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2022. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts The U.S. government did not initially label Fogel as unlawfully detained, despite doing so in a similar case involving WNBA star Brittney Griner. Griner was released in a prisoner swap in 2022, and Fogel's family called on her to advocate for his release from the penal colony where he was serving his sentence. In 2024, the Biden administration negotiated the release of Americans, including journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva as well as former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. ‘We’re about to get annihilated’: Musk, DOGE descend on consumer bureau Fogel's name was reportedly brought up in those negotiations, but he was not included in the deal. The White House has not said what the U.S. has offered in exchange for Fogel. Waltz said Fogel will be on American soil by Tuesday night.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia/	2025-02-11T10:42:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/MicrosoftTeams-image-25-2.png?w=774
Over a dozen religious groups file immigration lawsuit	(NewsNation) — More than 25 religious groups have filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging a Trump administration order that allows immigration agents to make arrests at houses of worship. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington and says the new policy is spreading fear and lowering attendance at services and other church programs, which the groups say infringes their religious freedom. That freedom, the groups say, includes their ability to minister to immigrants, including those who don't have documents. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts 'We have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,' said the Most Rev. Sean W. Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church. 'We cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,' he said 'By joining this lawsuit, we’re seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus’ command to love our neighbors as ourselves.' Plaintiffs note that programs held by churches, including food banks, meal programs, homeless shelters and support programs for immigrants could be affected because people may be fearful of participating. The lawsuit represents several denominations, including those with a large presence in the U.S. Groups included in the lawsuit include Reform Judaism, with more than one million followers, the Episcopal Church with 1.5 million members, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) with nearly 1.1 million members and the African Methodist Episcopal Church with 1.5 million active members. ‘Too f—— low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source says Other denominations include the Christian Chruch (Disciples of Christ), the Church of the Brethren, the Convención Bautista Hispana de Texas, the Friends General Conference, the Mennonite Church U.S.a, the Unitarian Universalist Association, the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ. An earlier lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Maryland by Quaker congregations who objected to the change, which the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple later joined. Prior to the change, immigration agents needed special authorization to conduct operations at sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals. In one recent incident, a Honduran man was arrested outside his church in the Atlanta area while a service was being held inside. The Trump administration has not responded to the newest lawsuit though an earlier memo filed in opposition to the Quaker lawsuit outlined arguments including that the suit is based on hypothetical future harm and isn't sufficient for an injunction to be issued. Trump: Palestinians will have no right of return to Gaza under US proposal One group that did not join the lawsuit is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, though it has criticized the immigration crackdown with Pope Francis issuing a rebuke to President Donald Trump's deportation plan, saying forceful removal of people just because of their immigration status deprives them of their inherent dignity. Many conservative Christian faith leaders and congregations have not shared these concerns and have expressed support for the harsh immigration policies being put in place.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/religious-groups-immigration-lawsuit/	2025-02-11T08:15:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021616279146.jpg?w=900
Tom Homan: 'I'm not satisfied' with number of ICE arrests	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's 'border czar' Tom Homan said Tuesday that he is 'not satisfied' with the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests. When asked by NewsNation's Kellie Meyer if Trump is unhappy with immigration crackdown efforts since returning to office, Homan responded, 'I'm not.' If you look at the rest of interior enforcement three times higher than it was a year ago today. Three times higher is good, but I'm not satisfied. There are more criminal aliens that need to be arrested, hundreds of thousands,' he added. 'Sanctuary cities are putting roadblocks up. We've got leaks. So we need to increase the arrests of illegal aliens, especially those with criminal convictions. So we're going to continue.' His remarks followed NewsNation's confirmation that Trump is frustrated with the number of arrests made by immigration officials in the U.S. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts Trump: Immigration numbers are too low When asked about the pace of deportations Sunday, President Trump took the opportunity to say his border officials are doing an 'incredible job' and acknowledged it is difficult to find migrants who know they are being sought. However, a source with knowledge of the matter told NewsNation that the president told aides 'the numbers are too f—— low,' adding that Trump wants more. Asked last week if ICE needs to do more, Homan said, 'They’re doing a great job, but they’ve got to do more.' ICE averaged 787 arrests per day between Jan. 23-31, and about 11,000 arrests have been made in the last 18 days. The White House has reported 461 undocumented migrants were released from custody due to health concerns, insufficient detention space and other factors. Homan said NewsNation that he spoke with ICE Acting Director Caleb Vitello and that no one should be released back into the community 'without the clearance of headquarters.' He added that he understands there will be some, but the number of releases was 'unacceptable and that’s been fixed.' IRS could help with immigration crackdown Trump has requested the Department of Homeland Security send Internal Revenue Service agents to assist with immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday requesting criminal investigators agents assist with investigating human trafficking networks and finding businesses hiring illegal migrants. The request is part of Trump’s efforts to ramp up mass deportations. This is a developing story.

Eric Adams to address media as DOJ orders charges to be dropped	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams will hold a news conference this morning, hours after corruption charges against him were ordered to be dropped. The order came from the Justice Department on Monday night. A lack of evidence was not the reason, but rather the charges causing challenges to Adams's reelection campaign and ability to carry out efforts against illegal immigration and crime. In a two-page memo obtained by the Associated Press, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote: 'The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.' Top Justice Department official orders prosecutors to drop charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams Charges were ordered to be dropped immediately. The memo follows months of speculation that President Donald Trump would take steps to end the case against Adams, who was charged in September with accepting bribes of free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals seeking to buy his influence. Adams, a Democrat elected on a centrist platform, has moved noticeably right following his indictment, rankling some within his party.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/eric-adams-address-media-charges-dropped/	2025-02-11T06:58:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2186832418.jpg?w=900
King Abdullah says Jordan will bring in 2,000 'very ill' Palestin...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is speaking with Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday in private meetings over the future of Gaza. When asked if Trump is confident he can get the king on board with his plan for the Palestinian people, he answered, 'He's a great man.' Trump is pressuring Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries to take in Palestinians, and he's said he wants the United States to take over Gaza. Arab leaders have strongly rejected Trump's proposal, saying any plan to transfer Palestinians to their land would destabilize the region. Jordan already has taken in more than 2 million Palestinian refugees — making up almost half the total number of Palestinian refugees as registered or recognized by U.N. agencies. 'I believe we will have a parcel of land in Jordan... a parcel of land in Egypt,' Trump said Tuesday. Arab, Muslim Americans blast Trump’s ‘grotesque’ Gaza proposal The United Nations, human rights groups and some Democrats say Trump's proposal amounts to ethnic cleansing. After the first discussion of the day, though, the president addressed the press, saying the relationship with Jordan 'has been very strong.' On the topic of taking in Palestinians, King Abdullah said they have to look at the best interests of the United States and people of Jordan. 'One of the things we can do right away' is to bring 2,000 children who are in a 'very ill state' to Jordan as quickly as possible, King Abdullah said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Egypt’s foreign minister on Monday and 'reiterated the importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. A group of 11 people protested outside the White House on Tuesday before the meeting. Asked by a reporter how the United States will buy Gaza, Trump answered, 'we’re not going to buy anything.' 'We’re going to have it, and we’re going to keep it, and we’re going to make sure there’s going to be peace and there’s not going to be any problem and nobody’s going to question it and we’re going to run it very properly,' he said. Fragile ceasefire deal Trump on Monday said a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas should be canceled if the latter does not release all the remaining hostages it is holding in Gaza by Saturday. However, he also said such a decision would be up to Israel. 'If they’re not here, all hell is going to break out,' Trump said. He said 'yes' when a reporter on Tuesday asked if Saturday was still his deadline. Later, he said Hamas must have all hostages out by Saturday or 'all bets are off.' Your student loans won’t be forgiven if DOGE violated FERPA Hamas has said it would delay the next release of three Israeli hostages set for Saturday, claiming Israel violated the ceasefire agreement by not allowing a surge of tents and shelters into Gaza. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Tuesday that the dozens of hostages would only be returned if all parties remain committed to the ceasefire. In a televised address, the leader of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they are ready to resume attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden if the ceasefire in Gaza halts. After a four-hour discussion with his security Cabinet Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement he 'welcomed' Trump's demand for the release of hostages by Saturday at noon. 'In light of Hamas’ announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, I instructed the IDF last night to amass forces inside and around the Gaza Strip.

DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has requested the Department of Homeland Security send Internal Revenue Service agents to assist with immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday requesting criminal investigators to help tackle human trafficking networks and find businesses hiring workers in the U.S. illegally, as well as other immigration-related tasks. The request is part of Trump's efforts to ramp up mass deportations. Despite 'border czar' Tom Homan and Noem receiving his vote of confidence over the weekend, sources tell NewsNation that Trump is unhappy with the early results of his immigration crackdown and wants to see more enforcement. Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers: Source On Sunday, Trump was asked about immigration arrests and denied being bothered by the way immigration enforcement efforts have gone so far. 'They're doing an amazing job, I think. Tom Homan is doing an amazing job. Kristi Noem is doing an amazing job. But it's not easy finding murderers who know they're being looked for,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. However, a source with knowledge of the matter tells NewsNation that the president told aides 'the numbers are too f—— low.' ICE averaged 787 arrests per day between Jan. 23-31, and about 11,000 arrests have been made in the last 18 days. The White House has reported 461 undocumented migrants were released from custody due to health concerns, insufficient detention space and other factors. IRS asked to help with immigration crackdown Noem suggested IRS agents assist with investigating human trafficking networks and finding businesses hiring illegal migrants. 'It is DHS.'s understanding that the Department of the Treasury has qualified law enforcement personnel available to assist with immigration enforcement, especially in light of recent increases to the Internal Revenue Service's work force and budget,' she said in the letter to Bessent. The push by DHS could pull resources away from tax enforcement efforts. Of roughly 100,000 employees, the IRS has approximately 2,100 criminal investigators who look into drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption, according to the New York Times. Noem's proposal comes as Republicans grow increasingly frustrated with the IRS, with one lawmaker filing a proposal to abolish the agency and rewrite the current tax code.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/dhs-deputize-irs-agents-deportation/	2025-02-11T04:39:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24357601334356-e1734888330412.jpg?w=800
EU vows tough countermeasures to US tariffs	BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum 'will not go unanswered,' adding that they will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc. 'The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,' von der Leyen said in a statement in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum the previous day. 'Tariffs are taxes — bad for business, worse for consumers,' von der Leyen said. 'Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.' In Germany, home to the EU's largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that 'if the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united,' adding that 'ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.' A timeline of US-China tit-for-tat tariffs since Trump’s first term Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax in the hope that they will give local producers relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. He imposed similar tariffs during his first presidency, but the move damaged relations with key U.S. allies and drove up costs for 'downstream’’ manufacturers that buy steel and aluminum. It is not clear what countermeasures would seek to apply, but officials and observers have said they would target Republican states and traditionally strong U.S. exports. After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, the EU imposed counter-tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. EU Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said Tuesday that the tariffs are 'economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains established through our extensive transatlantic trade and investment ties.' What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them? 'We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,' Šefčovič said, but added that 'it is not our preferred scenario. We remain committed to constructive dialog. We stand ready for negotiations and to find mutually beneficial solutions where possible.' The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing some 30% of global trade. 'There is a lot at stake for both sides,' he told the EU legislature. While the EU has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth €688 billion ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros (107 billion) for the EU.

Trump tariffs 'potentially very harmful' to US: John Bolton	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s threat to use tariffs against other countries is causing confusion and uncertainty in the market that will come back and haunt the United States, according to the president’s former national security adviser. John Bolton, who served in the role during Trump’s first presidency, told NewsNation that the threat of tariffs directed at countries like Canada and Mexico is the wrong approach to reaching his goal for economic supremacy. 'China is the problem,' Bolton told NewsNation. 'China is dumping steel and aluminum, and so if that’s the problem and they’re not playing by pretrade rules, which is clearly the case, then I think the United States is entirely justified in retaliating.' Trump enacts steel and aluminum tariffs, pardons Blagojevich But rather than getting countries that have been harmed by China together to fight back, Trump has, Bolton said, chosen to 'slap Canada in the face' with threats of tariffs. He said rather than addressing the enemy, Bolton said the president has directed his anger in the wrong direction. Trump’s bigger agenda could be potentially 'very damaging' to the American economy, Bolton said. China imposed duties on U.S. imports on Monday, just hours after Trump announced he wanted to place 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum coming into the country. Even before being elected, Trump was not shy about his love of tariffs, calling them 'the greatest thing invented.' The president will eventually need to put his plan in writing, Bolton said, rather than 'making numbers up to bargain (with) and scare people.' Trump has announced that he plans to generate lost revenue through tariffs, which Bolton said will ultimately result in higher taxes for Americans. An analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost a typical U.S. household more than $2,600 a year. 'I think it’s economic self-harm to the United States,' Bolton said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-harmful-us-bolton/	2025-02-10T15:57:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2198045416.jpg?w=900

‘Too f------ low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source sa...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is frustrated with the number of arrests made by immigration officials in the U.S., NewsNation has confirmed. 'The numbers are too f------ low,' the president told aides, as recounted to a source with knowledge of the matter. 'He wants more,' the source described the president’s demand. Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged 787 arrests per day between Jan. 23-31. Asked last week if ICE needs to do more, border czar Tom Homan said, 'They’re doing a great job, but they’ve got to do more.' Memo warns border agents of escalating threats from Mexican cartels Administration officials confirmed some detainees were released back into the country after being arrested. 'I was made aware of that this morning, and I will address that today, but I've been told that some were released because of some health concerns that we could not handle within ICE detention,' Homan said last week, adding 'the president made it clear we're ending 'catch-and-release.'' There were 461 released from custody out of more than 8,000 arrested since President Trump took office, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week. 'It’s less than 6%. There are reasons for their release; some factors include lack of significant likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future, lack of detention availability, and some have serious medical conditions,' Leavitt said. Meanwhile, immigration agents are continuing enforcement actions across the country. 'We're going after those that have been the violent criminals, perpetuating crimes in our communities, also those with final removal orders, and then we will continue down the priority list,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CNN’s 'State of the Union' Sunday. Migrants stopped trying to cross Canadian border in subzero temps Noem also confirmed previous reports ICE is over capacity. 'Remember, we're continuously busing people back to Mexico, continuously flying people out of the country and repatriating them back … there's still room, absolutely,' she said. One part of the problem has been the lack of facilities to house detained migrants. Noem said besides ICE detention facilities, some local law enforcement and different governments have offered their facilities. Also, to combat the shortage, the administration is now constructing new detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Flights to Guantanamo carrying migrants began last week. Work is now underway by military forces at Guantanamo to dramatically increase the capacity to hold detained persons. Eventually, the base is expected to hold up to 30,000 people.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/trump-anger-ice-arrests-source/	2025-02-10T14:50:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771_734cd3.jpg?w=900
Trump enacts steel and aluminum tariffs, pardons Blagojevich	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday memorializing his plan to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, including from Canada and Mexico. 'This is beginning of making America rich again,' Trump told reporters as he signed the document. 'Our allies and enemies expected this,' he said, regarding the tariffs. 'We don't want it to hurt other countries.' What could get more expensive under Trump’s tariffs? Trump previously said that the steel and aluminum tariffs would impact 'everybody' when asked what countries would be affected. Trump also reaffirmed that he would announce 'reciprocal tariffs' later this week, which would mean the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases in which another country has levied duties on U.S. goods. Trump pardons former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich 'It's my honor to do it. I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people,' Trump told reporters. The ex-Illinois governor was convicted in 2011 for public corruption charges. When asked whether he's considered appointing Blogolevich to ambassador of Serbia, Trump said: 'No, but I would.' Will mortgage interest deduction expire if Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does? Blagojevich was released from federal prison in Colorado in Feb. 2020 after then-President Trump commuted his sentence halfway through its 14 years. He spoke to NewsNation local affiliate WGN the night he was released at the airport, telling reporters: 'I'm profoundly grateful to Trump. It's a profound and everlasting gratitude.' Trump signs plastic straw, international business orders Other Oval Office actions included the 47th president signing an executive order related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it 'unlawful for a U.S. person or company to offer, pay, or promise to pay money or anything of value to any foreign official' for business purposes. Trump told media his order is 'going to mean a lot more business for America.' ‘Too f—— low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source says The president also tackled bringing back plastic straws, saying that paper straws 'don't work.'

(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump says he feels he is not getting enough details about the attempts on his life from last year — and is now telling the Secret Service to give him 'every bit of information' they have, according to the New York Post. In particular, Trump wants to know why one of the suspects and six cell phones, and the other had foreign apps. 'No more excuses,' Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying. 'No more holding back because of Biden... I’m entitled to know. And they held it back long enough.' In a statement to NewsNation, the Secret Service said, 'As it relates to a request by the president, any information held by the Secret Service will be provided to the president, without exception.' Elon Musk calls to impeach ‘corrupt’ judge after DOGE access blocked Trump assassination attempts On July 13, 2024, authorities say Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, shot at Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service. Butler County Fire Chief Corey Comperatore died and two other people were injured. Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire. The Secret Service's response was heavily criticized in the wake of the attempt, with Ronald Rowe, the agency’s acting director, previously calling it a 'failure.' According to a Congressional task force investigating the shooting, Crooks had encrypted messaging accounts. Then, in September, at Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, investigators say a man named Ryan Routh shot at him. A Secret Service agent checking the perimeter says he saw Routh pointing a rifle through a fence. Six cell phones were found in his car — which is what Trump was referencing as information to be unsealed. More information about Routh is expected to come out in September when he goes to trial.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-orders-assassins-reports-unsealed-secret-service/	2025-02-10T12:38:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66cf9289ac73f5.84300666.jpeg?w=900
How much does it cost to make pennies and nickels?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump says he has directed the U.S. Treasury to stop making new pennies, which are worth less than they cost to produce. 'For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!' Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday. 'I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.' He added: 'Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time.' Trump directs Treasury to stop making pennies The U.S. Mint reported losing over $85 million on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced in fiscal year 2024. Trump's announcement comes shortly after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team highlighted the cost of making pennies. Here's how much pennies are costing taxpayers and what eliminating the one-cent coin would take. How much do pennies and nickels cost? The main argument for getting rid of pennies is about saving the U.S. some money. Every penny cost $0.0369 in 2024, up 20% from the year before, according to U.S. Mint's annual report. That means the unit cost of producing and distributing a penny is more than triple its face value. Nickels also cost more to produce than they're worth. Each of the $0.05 coins cost almost $0.14 to make. As recently as 2022, the nickel cost about $0.10, but rising raw materials costs have made them more expensive to produce. The Mint lost $17.7 million on nickels in 2024, meaning the two coins together cost taxpayers over $100 million last year. In fiscal year 2023, the losses were even higher, nearly $180 million between pennies and nickels. Pennies were made of copper before 1962 but are now mostly made of zinc with a thin copper plating. Can Trump discontinue the penny? It's not entirely clear if Trump can retire the penny on his own. 'Congress authorizes every coin and most medals that the U.S. Mint manufactures and oversees the Mint’s operations under its Public Enterprise Fund (PEF),' according to the U.S. Mint's website. Still, the president may be able to stop the production of new pennies. 'The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,' Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, said last month. Back in 1857, it was Congress that discontinued the unpopular half-cent coin and made the cent smaller to cut back on the amount of copper needed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has yet to comment publicly on the president's directive. DOGE actions ‘long overdue, much welcomed’: House speaker Why does the U.S. still make pennies? Countries like Brazil, Canada, Norway and New Zealand have all stopped producing low-denomination coins, so why is the U.S. still making pennies? 'The Mint’s official reason for minting pennies is that the Federal Reserve orders them,' The New York Times Magazine's Caity Weaver wrote in a 2024 story calling for the end of the penny. Weaver added: 'Specifically, the Federal Reserve 'buys' coins from the Mint at face value and stores them in bags all over the United States for distribution to banks.' If that doesn't sound like a very good reason, you're not alone. Surveys suggest most Americans on both sides of the aisle think the government should stop producing pennies. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama called the penny a 'good metaphor' for some of the larger problems facing the U.S. government but acknowledged that nostalgia may explain the penny's lasting power. 'It's one of those things where I think people get attached emotionally to the way things have been,' Obama said. 'We remember our piggy banks and counting up all our pennies and then taking them in and getting a dollar bill or a couple of dollars from them, and maybe that's the reason people haven't gotten around to it.' Is there a downside to getting rid of pennies? Proponents of the penny warn that ending production could drive up demand for nickels, which are even more expensive to produce. 'If penny production were eliminated, nickel production would likely double, compounding the Mint’s losses,' according to Americans for Common Cents, an advocacy group. Instead, the group argues the Mint should reexamine its overhead costs and focus on reducing the cost of producing nickels. Decommissioning the penny could also change the way commodities are priced since prices ending in 99 cents are so common. That could be good or bad for consumers. 'The item that once cost $2.99 might then cost $2.95,' said William Dickens, who taught economic and public policy at Northeastern University. On the other hand: 'Businesses might round up more often than down, leading to a slight inflationary effect,' David Smith, an economics professor at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio Business School, told CNBC. When Canada eliminated the penny, cash transactions were rounded to the nearest five cents based on the total amount of the transaction, not on each item. A 2017 paper found that penny-rounding in Canada imposed a tax of approximately $3.27 million on Canadian consumers at grocery stores. For a typical store, the additional rounding revenue amounted to an estimated $157 extra each year — suggesting a fairly minimal impact on shoppers. Others in favor of keeping the penny point out that a so-called 'rounding tax' would disproportionately affect the poor since they're more likely to use cash than the rich. Would pennies become worthless? If you've been hoarding pennies, don't worry — they're unlikely to become worthless overnight. Halting the production of new pennies and removing them from the system are not the same thing. Ajay Patel, a finance professor at Wake Forest University School of Business, told CNBC the actual elimination of pennies is decades into the future. According to Patel, people would be able to continue using pennies until they are slowly reabsorbed into the banking system and eventually melted down to recycle their zinc and copper. In fact, pennies could become more valuable over time. 'Pennies would become more scarce over time and eventually increase in value. In the near term, they might become useless, depending on how the Treasury treats them. I would think that would have to be in phases so people could convert them to other denominations, thus removing them from the system,' Gates Little, the CEO of Alabama-based Southern Bank, told CNBC. As of right now, there are an estimated 240 billion pennies lying around the U.S., according to The New York Times Magazine. That's over 700 pennies for every man, woman and child in the country.

Rod Blagojevich expected to receive pardon from Trump: Report	WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to pardon former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, according to Axios. Axios cited a source familiar with the plans. Blagojevich was released from federal prison in Colorado in Feb. 2020 after then-President Trump commuted his sentence after seven of 14 years. He spoke to WGN News the night he was released at the airport ahead of a media frenzy on the way to and at his North Side home. DOJ sues Illinois, Chicago over ‘sanctuary city’ laws In 2018, the former Illinois governor filed paperwork to formally request clemency from Trump. Blagojevich was impeached and removed from office after being convicted in 2011. He had been found guilty of crimes that included seeking to sell an appointment to Barack Obama’s old Senate seat and trying to shake down a children’s hospital. On Friday, Politico reported that Trump is considering nominating Blagojevich to become U.S. ambassador to Serbia. Blagojevich's parents immigrated from Serbia in the 1940s. The former governor went to a federal judge last March in an effort to overturn his ineligibility to hold office. Man pardoned in Jan. 6 case arrested on 2016 solicitation charge 'The case started with a megaphone, but it ends with a whimper. Sometimes cases in the federal courthouse attract publicity. But the courthouse is no place for a publicity stunt,' the judge wrote before closing the case with three sentences: 'He wants back. But he’s already gone. Case dismissed.' In an interview with NesNation affiliate WGN a year after his prison release, Blagojevich stated no remorse. 'I didn’t break a single law or cross a single line,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/rod-blagojevich-pardon/	2025-02-10T11:28:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/gettyimages-1207208052.jpg?w=900
Trump: Palestinians wouldn't have right to return to developed Ga...	President Trump in a new interview said Palestinians would not have the right to return to the Gaza Strip if it is taken over and developed by the United States, as he has proposed. 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. Much better,' Trump told Fox News's Bret Baier in an interview conducted Saturday and aired Monday. Schumer warns of ‘Trump shutdown,’ lays out 4-pronged plan for Democrats 'In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them, because if they have to return now, it’ll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,' Trump continued. 'It would be years before it could happen.' Trump asserted he could 'make a deal' with Jordan and Egypt to have them take in Palestinians displaced out of Gaza, though leaders of those countries and other Arab nations have rejected the idea. Trump is set to welcome King Abdullah II of Jordan on Tuesday to the White House, where the Gaza proposal is expected to be a major point of discussion. The president last week during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu first proposed the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and develop it. He has since said U.S. troops would not be involved in securing the area. Trump on Sunday called Gaza 'a demolition site.' The president’s controversial proposal stands to upend decades of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Arab leaders in the region, including some allies, have dismissed Trump's proposal. Judge directs Trump administration to comply with order to unfreeze federal grants Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian National Authority, said Trump’s comments 'represent a serious violation of international law.' Saudi Arabia reiterated its 'absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land.' Republicans appeared skeptical of the proposal, even as some welcomed it as an unorthodox solution to a long-standing problem.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-palestinians-gaza-strip/	2025-02-10T11:15:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038623143183-e1738953650210.jpg?w=900
Kanye West's X account shut down after 12-hour antisemitic rant	(NewsNation) — An X account for musician Kanye West has been deactivated following a multiday antisemitic tirade on the social media platform that ended in the rapper selling Nazi swastika T-shirts on his website. The account went offline Sunday night, though it’s unclear if it was deleted by X or by West, who in 2021 legally changed his name to 'Ye.' His X profile page now reads, 'This account doesn’t exist.' West’s antisemitic posts were condemned by several Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, who called his rant an 'egregious display of antisemitism, racism and misogyny.' Kanye West and wife raise eyebrows during Disneyland trip 'We know this game all too well. Let's call Ye's hate-filled public rant for what it really is: a sad attempt for attention that uses Jews as a scapegoat. But unfortunately, it does get attention because Kanye has a far-reaching platform on which to spread his antisemitism and hate. Words matter. And as we’ve seen too many times before, hateful rhetoric can prompt real-world consequences,' the group said in a statement. Antisemitic tirade on X Over the course of 12 hours starting Saturday evening, West started posting hateful comments. Some of the most egregious stated, 'I AM A NAZI' and ''I LOVE HITLER.' He also posted, 'Some of my best friends are Jewish, and I don’t trust any of them,' and added that he is 'never' apologizing for his antisemitic comments. 'I’m racist stereo types (sic) exist for a reason and they all be true,' he wrote in another post. 'I don’t even know what the f--- anti Semitic means. It’s just some bull---- Jewish people made up to protect their bull----,' the rapper said in a separate post. At the end of his tirade, West posted, 'I won...I tweeted pretty much everything I felt like for 12 hours and I still have my Twitter. And most importantly my billions.' 'Thank you everyone for participating in this social experiment.' UN announces new plan to counter the surge in antisemitism The comments sparked condemnation from several celebrities, including actor David Schwimmer, who called on X owner Elon Musk to shut down West’s tirade. 'We can’t stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk,' Schwimmer posted on Instagram. 'Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence. His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,' he wrote. Piers Morgan also called out West, saying, 'So disappointed that Kanye West has deleted his X account… said nobody. From genius rap superstar to demented, vile, racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist, violence-inducing troll. What a sad, pathetic downfall.' In a statement, the American Jewish Committee said West 'continues to purposefully use his platform to spew anti-Jewish hatred. While some may dismiss his hateful rants, we cannot overlook the dangerous influence they can have on his millions of followers, particularly on social media, where a significant portion of today’s antisemitism thrives. Hate, left unchecked, only multiplies.' West sells swastika T-shirts Shortly after unleashing the hateful comments on X, West appeared in a Super Bowl commercial Sunday night directing to his website, which was selling T-shirts with Nazi swastikas. The white T-shirts with a black swastika on the front were the only items for sale on the front page of yeezy.com as of Monday afternoon.

Experts fear other civil rights will be ignored West’s history of antisemitic and hateful comments West has had a history of offensive and antisemitic comments, including repeated praise of Hitler and the Nazis.

West doubled down on the controversial comments during an interview with NewsNation's Chris Cuomo at the time, saying he doesn’t 'believe in' the term 'antisemitic' and that the music industry today is 'modern-day slavery.' Cuomo questioned West if it was possible that his words violated the app’s guidelines. West responded, 'I don’t believe in that term … I classify as Jew also, so I actually can’t be an anti-Semite.'

Musk calls to impeach 'corrupt' judge after DOGE access blocked	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk is calling for the impeachment of judges blocking the Department of Government Efficiency after a federal judge stopped the department from accessing Treasury Department files. Musk claimed his team needs the data to prevent fraud, accusing the judge of protecting corruption. Over the weekend, Musk criticized the judge on his social media platform X, asserting his team is working to identify waste and abuse in government systems at the direction of President Donald Trump. On Monday, Musk doubled down on his attacks, replying to a user who noted federal judges can be impeached by Congress. 'It’s time,' he said. Musk clashes with judge over DOGE authority Early Saturday, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued a preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration allowed Musk’s team access to the Treasury Department’s central payment system in violation of federal law. Trump says 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum coming Monday The payment system handles tax refunds, Social Security benefits, veterans’ benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars annually while containing an expansive network of Americans’ personal and financial data. A hearing is set for Feb. 14. On Sunday, Musk called for the annual firing of federal judges. 'I'd like to propose that the worst 1% of appointed judges, as determined by elected bodies, be fired every year,' he wrote in a social media post. 'This will weed out the most corrupt and least competent.' In another post, he wrote, 'A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached now!' Trump: Musk could look at Education Department soon The White House called the ruling 'absurd' and 'judicial overreach.' In a Fox News Sunday interview, Trump supported Musk and said Musk and his team will soon start looking into the Education Department.

Why was Taylor Swift booed at the Super Bowl?	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — There was no on-field celebration for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce after this Super Bowl. Only consolation far away from the prying TV cameras. The pop superstar turned up at the big game for the second consecutive year as her boyfriend and the Kansas City Chiefs tried to make history by winning a third consecutive Lombardi Trophy. Instead, Swift found herself booed by a pro-Eagles crowd and then had to endure their countless cheers as Philadelphia rolled to a 40-22 victory at the Superdome. Super Bowl halftime performer detained after ‘Gaza’ flag display Last year, Swift and Kelce locked lips on the field at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas as red and gold confetti fell like rain after the Chiefs won their second straight Super Bowl — the duo's first since becoming a sports-and-music power couple. That was a celebratory affair for Swift all night: She won a beer-chugging contest to raucous cheers from the pro-Chiefs crowd, and she spent the game partying with celebrity friends including Blake Lively and Lana Del Rey. Yet much has changed over the past 12 months. Many sports fans have turned against Swift, whom they believe gets far too much television time during NFL games. And even more fans have turned against the Chiefs, who have replaced the Patriots of Tom Brady as the juggernaut that NFL fans love to hate. So it wasn't surprising that Swift was booed when shown on the videoboards alongside rapper Ice Spice during a break in the first quarter Sunday night. She gave a bit of a side-eye look and wrinkled her nose when she realized the boos were for her. By the second half, and with the Eagles in control, the cameras were staying away from her entirely, and after the game, President Donald Trump took a dig at Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in last year's election. 'The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,' Trump posted on social media. 'She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!' Super Bowl losers get this ring instead Swift and Kelce became a couple early last season, when the four-time All-Pro tight end invited the songstress to watch him play in a game against the Bears. Kelce had famously tried and failed to deliver a friendship bracelet to Swift when she had played at Arrowhead Stadium, but she took him up on the offer to attend a game and their relationship blossomed. Perhaps being shut out at the Grammy Awards last week was a harbinger of a long, difficult night. In 2024, she had won album of the year for her 14th career Grammy a week before joining Kelce for their on-field Super Bowl celebration. That week was arguably peak Taylor and Travis, not that their stardom has dimmed since. In 2024, after the Grammys, she was in the midst of her Eras Tour and had played a concert in Tokyo before making a mad dash to Las Vegas for the game. Jalen Hurts quiets any doubters with a Super Bowl MVP This year she eased into the Big Easy, arriving in time to join Kelce on a double date with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, on Friday night. The couples dined at Lilette, a French restaurant near the Garden District. On the eve of the big game, Swift was spotted with musicians Danielle and Alana Haim at Gianna Restaurant. The big question swirling early Sunday was what might happen if Kelce won a third straight Super Bowl ring and fourth overall. Would he pick such a festive moment to propose? BetMGM Sportsbook gave 8/1 odds for those willing to wager on it. That possibility was snuffed out well before the game was over. The Chiefs fell to 19-4 with Swift in the crowd, and Sunday was the first time she saw them lose in the playoffs. 'We haven’t played that bad all year. You don’t lose like that without everything going bad,' Kelce said. Now, the question is whether the 35-year-old Kelce — who made himself scarce in the postgame locker room — will be back for another Super Bowl run. He has been noncommittal about playing next year, and some within the Chiefs organization are bracing for a potential retirement after a record-setting career that will almost certainly land him in the Hall of Fame. Should the Monday after the Super Bowl be a national holiday? Kelce has been laying the groundwork for his post-playing career for years. He has a lucrative podcast with his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, and has hosted game shows and even tried his hand at acting this past offseason. 'I’ll let Travis make that decision on his own,' said Mahomes, his closest buddy on the team. 'He knows he still has a lot of football left in him. I mean, you can see it. He always makes plays in the biggest moment, but it’s if he wants to put in that grind, because it takes it takes it to go out there and play 20 games, whatever it is, and get to the Super Bowl. 'He’s done enough to be a gold-jacket guy and first-ballot Hall of Famer,' Mahomes added, 'but I know he still has love for the game, and he’ll get to spend some time with his family and make that decision on his own.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/ap-taylor-swift-makes-her-super-bowl-return-to-watch-travis-kelce-and-his-chiefs-face-the-eagles/	2025-02-10T08:00:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67aa23dd888a17.43634509.jpeg?w=900
High levels of microplastics in human brains are increasing: Stud...	(NewsNation) — The level of microplastics in human brains has increased by 50% over the past eight years, a study released this month found. Microplastics are tiny plastic pieces less than five millimeters long, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They are harmful to the ocean and aquatic life. In recent years, microplastics have been appearing more in human brains, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers discovered, publishing their findings in the Nature Medicine research journal. Considering a juice cleanse? It may harm your health, study finds People with dementia had up to 10 times more plastic in their brains, according to the study. 'These results highlight a critical need to better understand the routes of exposure, uptake and clearance pathways and potential health consequences of plastics in human tissues, particularly in the brain,' the study said. The researchers noted they have not determined whether microplastics are causing dementia but there is an association between the two. They analyzed liver, kidney and brain tissue from autopsies conducted between 2016 and 2024 with approval from the University of New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator. It's unclear how microplastics end up in the brain. Still, lead researcher and toxicologist Matthew Campen said in a news release that most microplastics are ingested through food, especially meat bought at grocery stores. 'The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,' Campen said. 'We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/high-levels-microplastics-human-brains-study/	2025-02-10T06:23:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66b0f039131cc7.62048926.jpeg?w=900
Trump agenda faces hearings over federal buyout, citizenship rule...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and top administration officials are openly criticizing the judiciary's authority as their sweeping agenda faces growing court challenges. Some officials, including billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have criticized a federal judge's decision blocking Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records, questioning the legitimacy of judicial oversight. Trump called the ruling 'crazy.' The administration's efforts to dismantle government agencies and the federal workforce are being held up in the courts. Judges have issued rulings temporarily blocking a deadline for mass buyouts for federal employees, an effort to place U.S. Agency for International Development workers on leave, and an executive order targeting birthright citizenship. Two judges will review cases on these issues Monday. Federal buyout deadline A federal judge will hear arguments Monday over the legality of the Trump administration's buyout offer to nearly 2 million United States federal employees. The American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees filed a lawsuit arguing the buyout is unconstitutional, asserting that only Congress has the authority to approve such measures. This buyout plan is part of Trump's broader effort to reduce the federal workforce by offering workers up to eight months of pay and benefits to leave their government jobs. It also aligns with Trump's efforts to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of the administration’s efforts to dismantle USAID. So far, more than 65,000 workers, about 2.5% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout. Federal workers have until 11:59 p.m. Monday to decide whether to accept the offer. Trump says 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum coming Monday Musk estimates the reductions could save $100 billion based on the average government salary, which is around six figures. Trump criticized the judge's decision to restrict DOGE's access, calling it 'a disgrace' late Sunday. 'We're very disappointed with the judges that would make such a ruling, but we have a long way to go,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. 'No judge should frankly be allowed to make that kind of a decision. It's a disgrace,' he said. Musk reiterates attack on judges Early Saturday, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued a preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration allowed Musk’s team access to the Treasury Department’s central payment system in violation of federal law. The payment system handles tax refunds, Social Security benefits, veterans’ benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars annually while containing an expansive network of Americans’ personal and financial data. A hearing is set for Feb. 14. Musk and his team said they are simply working to identify waste and abuse in government systems at the direction of the president. Early Monday, Musk reiterated his calls from over the weekend, writing in a social media post that 'it's time' to impeach federal judges. He also accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency of sending $59 million to luxury hotels housing illegal migrants last week and said the DOGE team will work to recoup those funds, which he said were illegally spent. Judges block birthright citizenship changes A fourth federal judge will hear arguments Monday against Trump's executive order to ban birthright citizenship. Trump Gaza plan may hurt national security: Counterterrorism expert The ACLU of New Hampshire filed a lawsuit calling for a judge to block the order, arguing it violates the 14th Amendment, endangers newborn babies, and essentially goes against core American values. Twenty-two states and several organizations have banded together to challenge the order in cases nationwide. Monday's hearing follows similar cases in Maryland, Seattle and Boston. The judges in the Maryland and Washington state cases issued indefinite injunctions against the policy change, calling it unconstitutional. The judge in Boston said Friday he would take the request from 18 state attorneys general to block the order under advisement.

Trump Gaza plan may hurt national security: Counterterrorism expe...	(NewsNation) — President Trump’s controversial proposal to displace Palestinians from Gaza could end up undermining national security, a counterterrorism expert says. The Republican president last week suggested the U.S. could 'take over' the war-torn enclave for redevelopment. Stephen A. Smith: Trump ‘like a Realtor’ on Gaza ownership Trump said 2 million Palestinians would have to be relocated, maybe permanently, as the territory is rebuilt. The idea has been panned by Democrats and even some GOP members and notably lacks support from Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. NewsNation national security contributor Tracy Walder tells 'NewsNation Prime' that Trump’s idea could derail the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, not to mention aggravate anti-U.S. sentiment abroad. ‘No basis’ for Netanyahu arrest warrant: Ex-Netanyahu staffer Walder, a former CIA officer and FBI agent, said people living in unstable circumstances sometimes turn to 'nefarious actors, such as terrorist organizations.' Asked if U.S. ownership of Gaza helps or hurts the chances for stability there, Walder said: 'I personally believe that it hurts the matter.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-gaza-national-security/	2025-02-09T18:20:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/trumpisrael.jpg?w=900
Eagles first to score after Chiefs defer to start Super Bowl LIX	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs are vying for a historic three-peat in the NFL's title game on Sunday in New Orleans, while the Philadelphia Eagles are the only remaining team that can stop them. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are back in the Super Bowl after beating the Buffalo Bills 32-29 in a thrilling AFC championship game. They'll face Philadelphia and star running back Saquon Barkley, who ran for three touchdowns as the Eagles beat the Washington Commanders 55-23 in the NFC title game. This Super Bowl is a rematch of two years ago, when the Chiefs edged the Eagles 38-35 in Glendale, Arizona. Last year, Kansas City beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime in Las Vegas. No team has ever won three straight Super Bowls. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce won’t even be on the field at the same time as Philadelphia’s offensive front during Sunday’s Super Bowl, but it’s personal for Kelce, whose brother, Jason, was the Eagles’ center for 13 years before retiring after last season. It was the younger Kelce that gave the Eagles the first bad omen: he called tails during the coin flip, a move that, again, did not fail. The Chiefs won the coin toss and opted to defer, marking the 15th straight Super Bowl that the team who won the coin toss deferred. The Eagles were going for it on fourth-and-2 from midfield and appeared to convert a 30-yard completion. But a flag came out for Brown putting his hand on cornerback Trent McDuffie’s face, leading to the questionable penalty. A big topic heading into the game was perceived bias for officials in favor of the Chiefs. Commissioner Roger Goodell called it 'ridiculous' but those complaints will only grow louder after that first penalty. About halfway through the first quarter, it was the Eagles that scored first, going up 7-0. If you're already tired of the game, have no fear. Kendrick Lamar will be the headliner for the halftime show. The rap megastar, who has won 17 Grammys, said he’s looking forward to bringing hip-hop to the NFL’s championship game, where he performed as a guest artist with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem in 2022. Lamar will be joined on stage by Grammy winner SZA — his former Top Dawg Entertainment labelmate. The singer appeared on Lamar's recent album 'GNX' and was featured on a couple of songs including 'Gloria' and 'Luther,' which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn. The duo’s previous hits include the Oscar-nominated 'All the Stars' and 'Doves in the Wind.' Jay-Z’s Roc Nation company and Emmy-winning producer Jesse Collins will serve as co-executive producers of the halftime show. Taylor Swift will be at the Super Bowl rooting for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the Chiefs, but she’s far from the only star with a rooting interest. The Chiefs' famous fans include Paul Rudd, Rob Riggle, Heidi Gardner, Jason Sudeikis, Henry Cavill, Henry Winkler and David Koechner. Musicians Melissa Etheridge and Tech N9ne have each created songs for their team. Meanwhile, the Eagles boast a starry roster of superfans such as Bradley Cooper, Will Smith, Kevin Hart, Miles Teller, Pink, Questlove and Meek Mill. Donald Trump is making history as the first president to attend the Super Bowl while in office. Trump has said that he thinks Kansas City will win, with quarterback Patrick Mahomes the difference-maker. Trump says in a pregame interview with Fox News Channel's Brett Baier that 'I guess you have to say that when a quarterback wins as much as he’s won, I have to go with Kansas City.' Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/chiefs-take-on-the-eagles-in-super-bowl-lix/	2025-02-09T15:18:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038753963760-e1739142584466.jpg?w=800
Trump says 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum coming Monday	President Trump said he will announce 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum on Monday, adding that he would also kick off reciprocal tariffs in the days after. Trump said that the steel and aluminum tariffs would impact 'everybody' when asked what countries would be effected. 'Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25 percent tariff— aluminum too,' Trump told reporters. '25 percent… for both.' Richard Gere calls Trump a ‘bully and a thug’ at awards show He added that details of the reciprocal tariffs will be announced on Tuesday or Wednesday in a news conference. 'Very simply, if they charge us, we charge them,' he said, adding that the tariffs would go into effect 'almost immediately' and impact 'every country.' Trump has signaled that he would impose sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as tariffs on semiconductor chips, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas. On Friday, he warned that reciprocal tariffs would also be announced early next week, adding that he thinks reciprocal as opposed to a flat fee tariff is the fair approach. Trump starts term with positive approval rating in CBS poll 'In terms of tariffs, I mean we’re going to have tariffs, mostly reciprocal tariffs,' he said. 'But probably a reciprocal tariff where a country pays so much or charges us so much and we do the same, so very reciprocal. Because I think that’s the only fair way to do it, that way nobody’s hurt— they charge us we charge them… as opposed to a flat fee tariff,' he added. Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on China on Feb. 1, following through on a longstanding pledge to target Chinese goods. He delayed the 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month after speaking with both nation’s leaders last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-aluminimum-steel/	2025-02-09T14:35:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196127740.jpg?w=900
Delaware governor on Trump's threats: 'Let's govern with compassi...	Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer (D) encouraged Republicans in Washington to 'govern with compassion' amid threats to slash funding from the Department of Education. In an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt, Meyer said he is in favor of looking at ways to balance the budget and reduce wasteful government spending. But he said there's a lot of 'uncertainty' about whether programs that support poor children in his state will last. Rep. Hern defends delay on House budget proposal 'I believe in efficient spending of federal money,' Meyer said, noting that he cut property taxes as a county executive. 'The challenge that we're seeing now, I'm trying to balance the budget. I'm trying to invest in Delaware. I'm trying to make historic investments in our schools, so those NAEP scores, those assessments of the progress of our children, can both go up and that equity can increase,' he said. 'So everyone's getting an equal shot.' Meyer said it’s 'a lot harder' for families who can't rely on the status of certain federal programs, like Title I, which supplements state and local funding for 'low-achieving children, especially in high-poverty schools,' according to the Department of Education. Meyer said Title I is 'really giving kids and families, working families, a shot at making it, of ending cycles of poverty.' Similarly, Meyer stressed the importance of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which he said provides more than $30 billion to ensure children with disabilities get appropriate public education suited to their needs. 'Right now, there's uncertainty, based on the president's statement about that, those resources may be going away,' Meyer said. 'We're hoping it's replaced with other money.' 'Quite frankly, if the rules change, I'm fine with that. If it increases the efficiency of our federal, of my federal tax dollars, as a taxpayer, I like that,' he continued. 'But let's not leave anybody behind.' 'Let's govern with compassion while we're making these changes,' he added. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Rep. Hern defends delay on House budget proposal	Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, on Sunday defended Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) for the delay in unveiling a budget resolution. In an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt, Hern said Johnson’s task is especially difficult, noting the GOP can lose virtually no votes in the House, but said he is optimistic that the conference will be able to move forward with a resolution this week. Trump accelerates Guantánamo Bay migrant directive: What to know 'When you have the smallest margin in the last 150 years in Congress, we can't lose a single vote. You think about that for a second, when you have, you know, the people that represent all corners of the country, Speaker Johnson has been working very hard through the weekend to get us where we can notice a budget markup this week so we can move forward with one big, beautiful bill, as President Trump would like,' Hern told Stirewalt. Johnson, members of his leadership team and an ideological cross-section of lawmakers huddled for hours on Thursday with President Trump and Vice President Vance to discuss a framework for advancing the president's legislative wish list. These include border funding, immigration policy and an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The marathon meeting came days after Johnson was forced to scrap plans to mark up an initial budget resolution amid a conservative revolt over the level of spending cuts. The impasse in the House led top Senate Republicans to announce they would move their effort to enact Trump's agenda, threatening to steamroll the House. How GOP skeptics in the Senate got to ‘yes’ on RFK Jr., Gabbard Johnson reported 'very positive developments' after the White House meeting Thursday and sought to push back on the Senate GOP plans, insisting House Republicans were nearing the finish line — even though several thorny issues remained. Hern echoed that sentiment in the Sunday interview. 'We know how difficult it's going to be. We understand what the Senate is trying to do, in doing two bills so they move quickly. I believe we're going to get the budget resolution done so we can start working on the policy,' Hern added.

TV reporter found dead in Louisiana hotel room, woman arrested	NEW ORLEANS (NewsNation) — Police are investigating the death of a television reporter who was in New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl and on Friday announced the arrest of a woman they say used his credit card. Adan Manzano, 27, an anchor and reporter for Telemundo in Kansas City, Missouri, was found dead Wednesday in his hotel room in Kenner, a suburb just outside New Orleans, police said. Police on Thursday evening arrested Louisiana resident Danette Colbert, 48. She is facing four felony charges, as well as a misdemeanor fraud and theft charge, Kenner Police Deputy Chief Mark McCormick said. Missing Alaska flight found with no survivors: What to know She also faces a state felony charge of possession of a stolen firearm, but Kenner Police do not believe it's related to Manzano's case, St. Tammany Sheriff’s Office Lt. Suzanne Carboni said. Colbert was seen on security video footage arriving with Manzano at his hotel room around 5 a.m. the day of his death and then leaving without him about an hour later, police said. She used Manzano's credit card at several stores in the area and authorities later located Manzano's credit card and cellphone at Colbert's residence in Slidell, northeast of New Orleans they said. Police also uncovered narcotics at Colbert's residence, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said Friday during a press conference. Investigators believe Colbert acted alone, he said. A phone number affiliated with Colbert’s residence was disconnected and no one responded to a message sent to an email associated with her. Conley described Colbert as a 'career criminal' known to New Orleans police for 'fraud schemes.' 'Everybody should be aware of their surroundings,' Conley said. 'This brings to light that there are people out there that prey on other people and bring them into their confidence and victimize them.' PHOTOS: Investigators examine, document aircraft wreckage following deadly plane crash near DCA Colbert was twice arrested in 2022 in Las Vegas on felony charges of grand larceny and administering a drug to aid in a felony crime, court records show. In both cases, Colbert was accused of drugging men in their hotel rooms on the Las Vegas Strip and stealing from them, according to Daniel Lippmann, the attorney who represented her. Lippmann told The Associated Press that both cases were later dismissed because the victims did not want to testify in court. Lippmann said he had no comment on the new allegations against Colbert. One of the victims told police he woke up alone and with a bloody nose after going up to his hotel room with Colbert, who he met at a bar, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in 2022. He said missing from his room was $50,000 in cash, a Rolex watch, $11,000 in poker chips, his phone and a designer luggage bag. And last year, a Louisiana jury found Colbert guilty of theft and fraud charges. She was ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution, according to Orleans Parish court records. Telemundo Kansas City General Manager Steve Downing said Manzano was a 'rising star' and 'true professional' — a bilingual television anchor and reporter who loved sports, and had covered the Kansas City Chiefs ′ past two Super Bowl victories. He hoped to see a record third straight win Sunday. New law punishing ‘sextortion’ a good start, grieving father says 'You would always see him with a smile on his face, he enjoyed the work that he did,' Downing said. 'He was very committed to serving the local community by providing them the best in sports news.' Kenner police are awaiting the results of the coroner’s full autopsy, which will determine whether Manzano's death was a homicide, Conley said. The coroner's office is conducting toxicology tests, and results are expected to take three to four weeks, Jefferson Parish Director of Forensic Operations Tim Genevay said.

Millions in US under winter storm alerts	(NewsNation) — Large areas of the nation are digging out after a strong storm brought moderate to heavy snowfall across parts of the Upper Great Lakes on Saturday before intensifying overnight across the Northeast. The National Weather Service said a storm over the central and southern plains will move northeastward, producing a swath of 4 to 8 inches of snow across parts of Minnesota and the Great Lakes. How to get free Starbucks after the Super Bowl Saturday night into Sunday, upstate New York and New England could see up to a foot of accumulation. Hazardous travel conditions were likely due to low visibility and snow-covered roads. In the meantime, a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley into the northern Mid-Atlantic region could result in significant icing in the Central Appalachians, forecasters said. Freezing rain on roadways was expected to make travel dangerous, and power outages were possible. The snow snarled air traffic across the Northwest on Sunday with Boston Logan International Airport reporting 100 cancellations. All New York-area airports report delays as well. 'One good thing with this storm, it is moving pretty quickly, so it’s not gonna be a prolonged winter weather event,' said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland. 'It looks like the snow will definitely be coming to an end earlier in the day on Sunday, after which the weather will be fairly tranquil for a few days.'

How GOP skeptics in the Senate got to 'yes' on RFK Jr., Gabbard	WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican skepticism in the Senate of President Donald Trump’sCabinet nominees has been worn down, putting his unconventional choices for some of the most powerful positions in the federal government on the verge of confirmation. Floor votes are expected this week on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in line to be the nation's health secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, the choice for director of national intelligence. Both are from outside traditional Republican circles and espoused views in the confirmation process that alarmed GOP senators at times. Still, their nominations have advanced to the full Senate after crucial committee votes. One by one, Republicans have acquiesced to Trump's picks, even those whose personal history, lack of experience and unorthodox views would have once made them hardly imaginable for a Cabinet. It's a striking demonstration of how GOP lawmakers are standing by as Trump, in a show of force, disrupts the federal government and installs loyalists to lead key departments. Republican leaders in the Senate, eager to show Trump their worth, have chalked up confirmations at a rapid clip. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, just a month into the role, has lined up a vote on Gabbard as the first order of business, followed by Kennedy later in the week. Already on the job is Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who faced allegations over drinking and aggressive behavior toward women. And Republicans appear ready to soon install Kash Patel as FBI director. Those four nominees were long seen on Capitol Hill as the most vulnerable to losing support from Republicans, who hold a Senate majority by three seats. 'There’s never any guarantees, but we’re trending in the right direction,' Thune, R-S.D., said as the Senate wrapped up its work Thursday night and dozens of Republicans headed to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort to meet with the president over the weekend. Thune's cautious optimism followed a week where the prospect of opposition from Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Todd Young of Indiana — both of whom have tried to maintain some independence from Trump — threatened to derail Kennedy and Gabbard. But after a series of intense phone calls and negotiations led by Vice President JD Vance, even in the moments leading up to committee votes Tuesday, the new leadership team persuaded the key holdouts to come around. Both walked away from the talks speaking of assurances the nominees would restrain some of their more worrisome views. The collapse of resistance has set a new tone in the Republican-controlled government and shown how even the most independent-minded lawmaker would rather work with Trump than risk crossing him. Trump himself has refrained from the threats to GOP skeptics that defined his first term and relied on Vance, a former Ohio senator, to quietly walk some of his former colleagues through their concerns. 'You can’t think of this just as a normal president coming into office for the first time,' said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who was involved in the effort to get Trump's nominees across the finish line. 'Everybody I was dealing with was truly undecided trying to get to yes, and so it was just a process.' It didn't always look that easy. Cassidy, a liver doctor, told Kennedy during a committee hearing that he was 'struggling' to support the nomination because Kennedy had built a following as a vaccine skeptic and refused to denounce a discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. Cassidy cited his ethics as a doctor — 'dedicating my life to saving lives' — as a chief cause for his concern. Young, a former intelligence officer in the Marine Corps, questioned past statements that Gabbard has made, including support for government leaker Edward Snowden and expressions of sympathy for Russia. Young said he sought written assurances from Gabbard that she would punish those who disclose sensitive government intelligence. Vance played a crucial role, brokering a letter from Gabbard that spelled out those assurances. 'I got them at the 11th hour,' Young said after his committee vote for Gabbard. Young said Vance approached him with a 'respectful' tone and 'listened a lot more than he talked.' It's a change from Vance's Senate tenure, when he often defied the GOP leadership under Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell. Now Vance is working closely with the new team. A similar process played out with Cassidy. He said he voted to advance Kennedy after 'intense conversations' and reassurances on how health agencies would handle vaccine recommendations. The senator thanked Vance for his 'honest counsel.' Cassidy and Young insisted that the political fallout from blocking Trump's Cabinet picks did not factor into their negotiations, but the stakes were clear. Cassidy, who is up for reelection in two years, already has a primary challenger after voting to convict Trump on an impeachment charge in 2021 stemming from Trump's role in the Capitol riot. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said that regardless whether Trump offers senators such as Cassidy or Young a campaign endorsement, no Republican wants to openly defy the president. 'I think that Donald Trump at his heart is ultimately a transactional guy,' Cramer said, adding, 'Whether you ever get an endorsement out of it, not having an active enemy. He can be pretty effective as you know and he's proven, so nobody wants to be in that spot.' That leaves Democrats almost powerless to stand in the way of Trump's Cabinet selections. With Republican support in line, Democrats had little recourse but to draw out the process through every procedural move possible. They are also trying to hold the Senate floor for maximum debate time to slow the pace of votes. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he hoped the tactic would call attention to Trump's expansion of presidential power and help 'persuade the American people to express outrage to their members of Congress, particularly from the red states, where so far their senators have been unwilling or unable to listen.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-how-republican-skeptics-in-the-senate-got-to-yes-on-rfk-jr-and-gabbard/	2025-02-09T04:47:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a8a4ad4354e5.77916511.jpeg?w=900
Trump accelerates Guantánamo Bay migrant directive: What to know	Trump administration officials are rapidly moving forward with President Trump’s directive to turn Guantánamo Bay into a facility that could hold up to 30,000 migrants who are being deported from the United States. Since announcing the move Jan. 29, the Pentagon flew 10 migrants described as 'high-threat individuals' to the facility in Cuba less than a week later, while Defense Department and Homeland Security officials work to put the infrastructure in place to meet the demands of Trump’s order. Officials have been less clear about the long-term prospects of using Guantánamo Bay as a migrant facility. Here’s what to know so far about the effort. Trump ordered a 30,000-person facility The president in late January signed a memo directing the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to prepare a 30,000-person migrant facility at Guantánamo Bay, a facility in Cuba that has been used to house military prisoners, including several Al Qaeda operatives linked to the 9/11 attacks. The order did not outline any specific timeline for establishing the facility, but U.S. troops arrived at the base in recent days to provide support with construction of tents near an existing migration detention facility. 'Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold them because we don’t want them coming back, so we’re going to send them out to Guantánamo,' Trump said of plans for the expanded migrant facility. 'This will double our capacity immediately. And tough, it’s a tough place to get out of.' Semafor reported that the Trump administration is in discussions with Willscot, a company that specializes in mobile offices and shipping containers, about providing temporary space to hold migrants at Guantánamo. The order is the latest step in a government-wide effort enacted by the Trump administration to remove certain immigrants from the United States. The White House has touted agreements with Colombia, El Salvador and Venezuela where those countries would accept deportees. Migrants already flown to Guantanamo The first flight of migrants to Guantánamo Bay took place this week, with a small number of individuals arriving on Wednesday. The Pentagon announced 10 'high-threat illegal aliens' were sent to the facility. Those individuals are being held in vacant detention facilities, the Pentagon said, until they can be transported to their home country or another destination. 'The detention of these high-threat illegal aliens at Guantánamo Bay is a temporary measure, and the Department of Defense will continue to support the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies in their efforts to facilitate the removal of the aliens as soon as possible,' the Pentagon said in a statement. While other flights to Guantánamo are expected in the coming weeks, the Pentagon has been using military aircraft to deport immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally back to their country of origin. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested Guantánamo Bay could be used as an interim holding space for migrants while the U.S. reaches agreements with other countries to process deportees. Officials won't rule out sending women, children Trump administration officials have signaled that the migrants who will be kept at Guantánamo are violent criminals and single men. But as facilities to hold thousands of migrants are erected, officials have not ruled out the possibility that women and children might end up there at some point. 'So remember that Guantánamo Bay clearly, by this president, has said that it will hold the worst of the worst, that we are going after those bad actors,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on NBC. 'These are the types of individuals that we are targeting, we're removing from communities, and that could end up having a stay at Guantanamo Bay before they are returned home to their countries to deal with.' Pressed multiple times on 'Meet the Press' whether women, children and families could be held at Guantánamo, Noem would not directly answer. Instead, she reiterated the administration was focused on targeting 'the worst of the worst.' Scrutiny of conditions Trump critics and watchdog groups are expected to keep a close watch on the treatment of migrants and the conditions they’re kept in at Guantánamo Bay, given the facility’s reputation. Guantánamo Bay is best known as a military base where terror suspects are held. It became infamous for accusations of torture and abuse as the U.S. carried out the war on terrorism. The Biden administration sought to wind down operations at the facility, and there are 15 prisoners still there. Noem has said the administration intends to follow due process with migrants at Guantánamo so that those being held there would have the same rights they would if detained in the United States. The secretary also said the administration does not plan on holding migrants at Guantánamo long-term. 'The plan is to have a process that we follow that's laid out in law and make sure that we're dealing with these individuals appropriately according to what the state and the national…law directs,' Noem said. 'So we will work with Congress to make sure that we're addressing our legal immigration laws and using Guantanamo Bay appropriately. But it is an asset that we have that we fully intend to utilize.' Some Democratic lawmakers have argued the use of such a notorious facility to house migrants is intended as a scare tactic as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration. 'It's all about scaring and intimidating people,' Sen. Mark Kelly (R-Ariz.) said. 'It's the same thing for Guantanamo Bay. Building a facility there is because it just sounds very frightening to a lot of folks.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-accelerates-guantanamo-bay-migrant-directive-what-to-know/	2025-02-09T04:16:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Guantanamo_020825_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=900
7 competitive primaries to watch in 2026	Primary battles are already underway in key Senate and gubernatorial races ahead of the 2026 midterms, an election that will determine not only control of Congress but also the governorships in several states. Retirements and term limits have triggered wide-open contests that are poised to become packed with candidates, while a few potentially vulnerable incumbents seem like they could face a serious primary challenge for another term. Here’s seven primaries to watch as the 2026 elections approach: California gubernatorial primary The race to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has already been underway for more than a year and a half, and no candidate has emerged as a clear frontrunner. The Democratic field is already loaded with several prominent current and former California politicians, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former state Senate pro tempore Toni Atkins, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. But no candidate has pulled away, leaving the door open for others with a larger national profile. The most prominent rumored candidate is former Vice President Harris, coming off a narrow loss to President Trump in November. Others have speculated she would instead plan another presidential run in 2028 instead. Harris brushed aside questions about her future on Friday, saying she will be in touch with her community and leaders to 'figure out what I can do to support them.' If Harris doesn’t run, a favorite could be former Rep. Katie Porter (D), who has appeared to express interest in the role. Some hypothetical polling has found her as the leader if she enters the race. California’s electoral system features a top-two primary in which all candidates appear on the same ballot and the two highest finishers advance to the general election. Republicans will also take part in the primary, but a Democrat will be the favorite to win the race in the blue stronghold. Florida GOP gubernatorial primary Along with Newsom, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is one of the most prominent governors in the country, and the race to succeed him will likely be fierce. No one has officially announced their candidacy yet, but a few possible candidates have expressed interest. Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) could be an early favorite as a close ally of Trump and someone who has increasingly taken on a national profile. Sources have said Donalds has approached Florida donors about running and brought on several staffers, including Trump 2016 and 2024 pollster Tony Fabrizio. One poll from last month showed Donalds clearly ahead of other potential candidates, but most voters were undecided. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) told The Tampa Bay Times last month that he was thinking about running, saying he has a 'compelling vision' for Florida. The controversial former House member was Trump’s first choice for attorney general before he withdrew amid an Ethics Committee probe into him and accusations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he denies. State Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez are other possible candidates, but the biggest wildcard may be Florida first lady Casey DeSantis. NBC News reported Thursday that the governor’s wife is considering a run, which would be her first for political office. Louisiana GOP Senate primary Sen. Bill Cassidy (R) has been a possible target for a primary challenge since his condemnation of Trump’s role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and for voting to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial on incitement of insurrection. Trump has repeatedly criticized Cassidy, who has already picked up at least one primary challenge. Louisiana state Treasurer John Fleming announced in December that he would challenge Cassidy for the GOP nomination, saying the state needed a 'true conservative voice.' Cassidy’s campaign has projected confidence at his prospects, noting his large amount of cash on hand and voting record overwhelmingly supporting Trump initiatives. But others could join the race too, including Rep. Clay Higgins (R). One additional obstacle for Cassidy may be the repeal of Louisiana’s 'jungle' primary in which all candidates appeared on the same ballot and the top two advanced to the general election. Starting in 2026, candidates for Senate will take part in partisan primaries, leaving Cassidy to campaign just for Republicans and unaffiliated voters. Michigan Senate primaries The race for Michigan’s Senate seat in 2026 suddenly came to life at the end of last month when Sen. Gary Peters (D) announced he wouldn’t seek a third term in office. Possible candidates on both sides of the aisle quickly indicated they were considering a bid, and the primaries for both could get crowded. On the Democratic side, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg seems to be inching toward announcing his candidacy after moving to Michigan in 2022. Polling shows, and analysts said, he would likely be an early frontrunner, but he could be joined in the race by candidates like Reps. Haley Stevens and Hillary Scholten and state Attorney General Dana Nessel. For the GOP, the 2024 Republican nominee for Senate, former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), has said he’s thinking of trying again after losing by less than 20,000 votes in November. But he could face opponents like 2022 GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon and Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), among others. New York Democratic gubernatorial primary Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) is seeking her second full term in office after becoming governor in the aftermath of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) resignation from office and her own successful election. But her favorability rating has been poor for months, and she seems likely to face significant obstacles to reelection, potentially both in the primary and general election if she wins the Democratic nomination. A poll this month from Siena College found only one in three New York voters would reelect her, while 57 percent said they would prefer someone else. Among Democrats, only 55 percent view her favorably. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) has been a sharp critic of Hochul and seems most likely to challenge her in the primary. He called Hochul the 'new Joe Biden' in not understanding their vulnerabilities and that they should drop out of their election. He also argued that Trump’s improvement in the Democratic stronghold in November shows a 'vote of no confidence' in the state’s leadership. If he goes forward, Torres could give Hochul an intense challenge. Ohio GOP gubernatorial primary Vivek Ramaswamy is widely expected to join the race to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine (R) this month and will be a quick favorite for the nomination. Ramaswamy’s profile rose significantly in the GOP presidential primaries and as a close ally to Trump, and he’s already received significant support before even launching his bid. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) have all declared their support for him, and some of Vice President Vance’s top political advisers are expected to be part of his campaign team. He won’t be alone in the primary, as state Attorney General Dave Yost has already declared his candidacy. Yost has had extensive experience in Ohio politics. But Ramaswamy seems to be in a strong position. A poll from Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates showed Ramaswamy with 52 percent in a hypothetical GOP primary to Yost’s 18 percent. State Treasurer Robert Sprague was expected to run but declined and endorsed Ramaswamy. Texas GOP Senate primary Texas Sen. John Cornyn (R) is set to run for his fifth term in the Senate, but he may face the biggest challenge of his career from state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R). Cornyn and Paxton have sparred for years over various issues. Paxton has accused Cornyn of being insufficiently conservative and attacked him for his support for additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and the gun safety bill. Cornyn has slammed Paxton over the attorney general’s legal issues and 2023 impeachment. Paxton has said he would decide whether to run in the next few months and an aide told The Hill he’s meeting with donors and voters across the state. The potential matchup could become the latest proxy battle between two wings of the state party, the establishment and the staunch conservatives. The battle has taken place recently in the state House and in Paxton’s impeachment trial, in which he was acquitted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/7-competitive-primaries-to-watch-in-2026/	2025-02-09T04:14:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Competitive-Primaries_020825_Illustration_CJGNAP.jpg?w=900

DOGE siege of USAID dominated week in politics	(NewsNation) — By now, the average American may be more familiar with two acronyms that are grabbing headlines in Washington and beyond: DOGE and USAID. The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is headed by 'special government employee' Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. With President Trump’s blessing, DOGE is scrutinizing spending at federal agencies, including the United States Agency for International Development. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? USAID operations have effectively been put on hold, less than three weeks after Trump began his second term in office. Proponents of the agency say it pays dividends by promoting democracy when it assists struggling foreign nations. But people in Trump’s corner say USAID has funded several questionable programs, such as efforts to promote 'Diversity, Equity and Inclusion' across the globe. NewsNation’s Mills Hayes reports that not all of the information cited by Trump representatives bear out, although USAID did offer Serbia a $1.5 million grant to advance DEI in the workplace. Other examples offered by the White House — such as $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia and $32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru — were efforts funded by a different federal entity, the U.S. State Department. Ex-administrators of USAID defend agency targeted by Trump On the flipside, USAID has disbursed millions to fight AIDS in Africa; conserve the Amazon Rainforest in South America and support a United Nations food program. USAID has also distributed U.S. agricultural products, and $34 million in rice, soybean and wheat purchases are on hold, the Washington Post reports. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration’s attempts to place 2,200 USAID employees on paid leave. Meantime, Musk’s DOGE has also set its sights on the U.S. Department of Education. Concerned about the ramifications, Democratic members of Congress sought to enter the agency’s Washington headquarters last week but were locked out. DOGE actions ‘long overdue, much welcomed’: House speaker 'The Democrats have lost their minds,' Trump said in response. 'They tried to break into the Department of Education just because we want to go and check the books.' Musk also is facing scrutiny over the young DOGE team he’s hired as reports surface about their prior businesses and online activity. A 19-year-old DOGE member started a company that hired convicted hackers, and WIRED reports that company has at least two Russian-registered domains. Another DOGE staffer reposted comments from white nationalists and misogynists on social media, and a third staffer resigned after past racist posts were made public.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-usaid-trump-musk/	2025-02-08T18:01:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/aid_f85fd1.jpg?w=900
Trump says he won't deport Prince Harry: 'He’s got enough problem...	(The Hill) — President Trump said on Friday that he is 'not interested' in deporting Harry, who currently resides in Montecito, Calif., with his wife, Meghan Markle. 'I don’t want to do that,' Trump told the New York Post. 'I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.' In February last year, Trump accused former President Biden's administration of 'protecting Harry,' adding that he wouldn't do the same if he wins the White House. Will Casey DeSantis run for governor of Florida? 'He betrayed the queen. That’s unforgivable,' Trump told the U.K.’s Daily Express in an interview, adding that Harry 'would be on his own' if reelected. Trump, in his Friday interview with the New York Post, went on to state he thinks 'poor Harry' is 'whipped' by Markle. Trump has previously criticized Prince Harry and Markle over their reported differences with the royal family. In 2023, he told radio host Hugh Hevitt, 'I didn’t like the idea that they [Harry and Markle] were getting U.S. security when they came over here.' The royal couple has also voiced disapproval of Trump over the years, with Markle calling the president 'divisive' and 'misogynistic' during the 2016 presidential race. Trump later called Markle's comments about him 'nasty.' Democrats call stop work order at CFPB ‘illegal’ On Friday, Trump praised Prince Harry's brother, Prince William, calling him a 'great young man.' The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has probed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for information about Prince Harry's immigration status. The think tank alleged the department 'may have improperly granted' his visa after the royal family member disclosed personal drug use in his memoir 'Spare.' In 2023, the DHS request was declined, but a judge is still considering the case, per the Associated Press.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-he-wont-deport-prince-harry-hes-got-enough-problems-with-his-wife/	2025-02-08T13:53:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP24246656702909-e1739049032116.jpg?w=800
Missing Alaska flight found with no survivors: What to know	(The Hill) — A small commuter aircraft that crashed in western Alaska Thursday was found on sea ice on Friday, with officials announcing that all 10 individuals aboard died. This incident marks one of the most lethal accidents in the state over the past quarter-century. The plane, operated by Bering Air, had been traveling from Unalakleet to Nome when it vanished on Thursday, only to be found the next day. This accident comes just weeks after two other aviation incidents took place last month. A deadly midair collision near Reagan Washington National Airport killed 67 people, and a fatal crash in Philadelphia claimed seven lives. Following these incidents, President Trump pledged to overhaul the Federal Aviation Administration, including by naming a new acting leader and updating the nation’s air traffic control system. 'My heart is broken over the news out of Nome. Alaska is a big small town,' Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.) wrote on the social platform X about Thursday's crash. 'When tragedy strikes, we’re never far removed from the Alaskans directly impacted. But that also means we come together as a community to grieve and heal.' Rescue teams used helicopters to search for the plane's last known position when they discovered the wreckage on Friday, according to Mike Salerno, a representative from the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were deployed to assess the situation. The Coast Guard reported that the aircraft vanished approximately 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. According to radar forensic data from the U.S. Civil Air Patrol, at around 3:18 p.m., the plane experienced some sort of incident that led to a rapid decrease in altitude and speed. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said he could not 'speculate on what that incident was.' McIntyre-Coble also mentioned that there were no distress signals received from the aircraft, which is equipped with an emergency locating transmitter. This device, when submerged in seawater, sends a signal to a satellite that subsequently alerts the Coast Guard if an aircraft is in trouble. He claimed the Coast Guard had not received any such messages. According to Lt. Ben Endres from the Alaska State Troopers, there were ten adults on board, and the flight was a standard commuter service.

What we know about the commuter plane crash in Alaska	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Authorities are working to recover the wreckage of a plane crash in western Alaska that killed 10 people while investigators are trying to determine what caused the small commuter aircraft to go down in the icy Bering Sea. The single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet to the hub community of Nome when it disappeared Thursday afternoon. The Bering Airplane was found the next day after an extensive search. Nine passengers and the pilot were killed. Crews on Saturday were racing to recover the wreckage and the remains of those killed in the crash before expected high winds and snow. Here are things to know about the plane crash, which is one of the deadliest plane crashes in the state in 25 years. Bryan Kohberger case: Expert explains how a firing squad works The plane was reported missing near Nome Officials said contact with the Cessna Caravan was lost less than an hour after it left Unalakleet on Thursday. Authorities said the flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, and the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. The wreckage was found Friday by rescuers who were searching by helicopter. Local, state and federal agencies scoured large stretches of icy waters and miles of frozen tundra before finding the plane. A Black Hawk helicopter will be used to move the aircraft once the bodies are removed, officials said. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the world’s most famous sled dog race. Nome is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. Who are the Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for Israeli hostages? The cause of the crash is under investigation The National Transportation Safety Board is sending people from various states to investigate the crash. Radar data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed, but it is not clear why that happened, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. If a plane is exposed to seawater, an emergency locating transmitter sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message to the Coast Guard. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard. Flying is an important mode of transportation in the largest U.S. state Alaska's vast landscape and limited infrastructure makes traveling by plane a common thing. Most communities are not connected to the developed road system that serves the state’s most populous region. Some high school teams fly to sporting events against rival high schools, and goods are brought to many communities by barge or by air. Mother, son die from food poisoning at Dominican Republic resort Who was on the plane? Authorities said all 10 people on board the plane were adults. Among those killed were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson. They had traveled to Unalakleet to service a heat-recovery system vital to the community’s water plant, according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. The identities of the others killed in the crash have not been released. 'At this time, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy,' the flight operator Bering Air wrote in a statement on its website. 'We recognize the profound loss this has caused, and we want to extend our sincerest condolences to everyone impacted.' The flight company said it had set up telephone hotlines staffed with specialists to provide emotional support and updates to people who had loved ones on the flight. Other recent U.S. plane crashes are also under investigation The Alaska plane’s crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/ap-heres-what-we-know-about-a-commuter-plane-crash-in-alaska-that-killed-10-people/	2025-02-08T12:38:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a7c157a3f282.46489531.jpeg?w=900
Spending bill talks bog down after Trump's efforts to slash gover...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they have to deal with some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year's spending bills. It's a task that by all accounts is not going well. The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills in Washington. But Trump's first weeks in office have escalated tensions between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional approval. A look at where the talks stand: Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January; aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But optimism has faded in recent days. 'Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they walked away from talks. But it’ll have to resume,' House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said Thursday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave a similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as though they are 'trying to set up some sort of government shutdown, which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they’ve been sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So I hope we can get back to it.' Rep. Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as Thursday so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. 'But, we're not making the progress I would hope,' said Cole, R-Okla. Democrats dispute GOP leadership's characterization Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said 'that is false' in response to the assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. 'The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from the table,' DeLauro said. Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro 'has been trying to get Republicans to respond to her for weeks.' 'I’m hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at the table and reach a spending agreement, in the best interest of the American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors,' Jeffries said. Tensions over topline spending levels Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., worked out with then-President Joe Biden, spending for defense and nondefense would increase by 1% for the current budget year, which began Oct. 1. That would bring the tallies to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for nondefense. Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of an inflation, at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. 'That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people,' Jeffries said. Republicans don't see it that way. Cole said Democrats are having a hard time adjusting to the reality of Trump being in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress. 'We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don't have those anymore,' Cole said. 'And in particular, the president doesn't feel bound by an agreement made by another president that didn't go down on his watch.' Cole said that 'there's only one signature that matters right now and it's not Joe Biden's anymore.' Democrats wary as Trump and Musk revamp federal government Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to Trump's first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to resign, entire agencies are dismantled and Elon Musk's team from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive information of countless Americans. They are worried about how current government services are being affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending bill negotiations. 'The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in Congress,' said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 'It is up to our Republican colleagues to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real.' DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. 'You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And that's got to be it. Those assurances have to be made,' DeLauro said. Plan B If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure, then it's possible that they could also pass another temporary measure to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they try to work out their differences. Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions or CRs in Washington parlance, generally fund government programs and agencies at current levels. 'I don't want a CR,' Cole said. 'But I certainly prefer a CR to a shutdown.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-spending-bill-talks-bog-down-after-trumps-efforts-to-slash-government/	2025-02-08T06:58:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a771af631da7.21811593.jpeg?w=900
Dem AGs sue over DOGE access to Treasury payment systems	(The Hill) — A coalition of 19 Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Friday night over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury Department payment systems that dole out trillions of dollars in payments annually. The lawsuit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and announced earlier in the week, is the latest legal resistance against billionaire Elon Musk’s sweeping moves to reshape and dismantle parts of the federal bureaucracy. 'As the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is not used to being told ‘no,’ but in our country, no one is above the law,' James said in a statement. The states that sued alongside New York are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. In a separate lawsuit, the Justice Department earlier this week agreed to temporarily limit DOGE’s access to Treasury Department systems. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., let two special government employees with ties to DOGE maintain 'read-only' access to the systems while litigation continues — but one of those two employees tendered his resignation after several racist social media posts were exposed by the Wall Street Journal. An account associated with the employee, 25-year-old Marko Elez, posted to 'Normalize Indian hate' and that 'you could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity,' according to the Journal. But later Friday, after launching a poll on X, Musk said he would rehire the staffer. The attorneys general mentioned the posts in their complaint. In statements announcing the lawsuit, the attorneys generals took sharp aim at DOGE and its leadership as the group implants itself in the executive branch, agency by agency. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called DOGE’s access to the Treasury systems a 'coup, plain and simple,' deriding Musk as an 'unelected weirdo billionaire' and his team as a 'group of teenage hackers.' Aaron Ford, Nevada’s attorney general, said Trump has the right to 'lawfully' enact his policies but claimed the Treasury access was 'illegally provided' to Musk and DOGE. And Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul accused Trump of putting 'the whims of Elon Musk' ahead of Americans’ privacy and security. 'We’ve gone to court to address this outrageous situation and to protect the American people,' Kaul said. Earlier in the week, the Justice Department in a separate lawsuit agreed to temporarily limit DOGE’s access to Treasury Department systems, which dole out trillions of dollars of payments annually, until the next stage of the case. The lawsuit is just one emerging battle over Musk’s plans to slash trillions of dollars in federal spending, which has led his team to seize access to agencies across the government. Legal efforts have also been waged against the DOGE team’s efforts in the Education and Labor departments. One group of plaintiffs has vowed to expand their lawsuit over the weekend to cover the Department of Health and Human Services and the Consumer Protection Financial Protection Bureau.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dem-ags-sue-over-doge-access-to-treasury-payment-systems/	2025-02-08T04:21:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038705847158-e1738980938543.jpg?w=800
Who are the Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for Israel...	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Israel on Saturday is releasing 183 Palestinian prisoners in the latest exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, part of a ceasefire that has paused the war but whose future is uncertain. Israel views the security prisoners as terrorists, while Palestinians see them as freedom fighters resisting a decades-long military occupation. Nearly every Palestinian has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel at some point, for militant attacks or lesser offenses like rock-throwing, protesting or membership in a banned political group. Some are held for months or years without trial in what is known as administrative detention, which Israel says is needed to prevent attacks and avoid sharing sensitive intelligence. Eighteen of those released Saturday had been sentenced to life and 54 were serving long sentences for their involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. Seven of those convicted of the most serious crimes will be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation. Among those being released are 111 Palestinians who were rounded up after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which triggered the war. They have been detained without trial. Here’s a look at some prominent Palestinian prisoners released since the truce went into effect on Jan. 19. Iyad Abu Shakhdam Abu Shakhdam, 49, was sentenced to the equivalent of 18 life sentences over his involvement in Hamas attacks that killed dozens of Israelis during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, between 2000 and 2005. Among the most infamous of those attacks was a double suicide bombing that blew up two buses in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba in 2004, killing 16 Israelis, including a 4-year-old, and wounding over 100 others. In interviews with Arabic media, he described his militancy as a desire for revenge stemming from his brother’s killing by Israeli security forces in 2000. Abu Shakhdam was on the run for weeks before his arrest in his hometown of Hebron in the West Bank in November 2004, following a gunfight with Israeli security forces in which he was shot 10 times. During 21 years in prison, his family said, he finished high school and earned a certificate for courses in psychology. Jamal al-Tawil Al-Tawil, 61, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank, has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prison, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings. Most recently, the Israeli military arrested al-Tawil 2021, saying that he had participated in violent riots and mobilized Hamas political activists in Ramallah, the seat of the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority and Hamas' main rival. He had been held without charge or trial since then. After his arrest, he went on hunger strike for more than three weeks to protest his administrative detention. During one of al-Tawil's stints in Israeli prison in the early 2000s, he ran a successful electoral campaign from custody to become mayor of Al-Bireh, a West Bank town abutting Ramallah. U.S. court documents from 2007, filed by the families of Israelis killed during the second intifada, show that al-Tawil had served for years as chairman of Al-Islah Charitable Society, a front organization to raise money for Hamas. The case accused al-Tawil of recruiting a Hamas militant to carry out a 2001 suicide bombing that targeted a crowded pedestrian mall in Jerusalem, killing 11 people. His daughter, 32-year-old journalist Bushra al-Tawil, was among the dozens of women and teenagers released in the first round of prisoner-for-hostage exchanges on Jan. 19. He and another prisoner were immediately taken to a hospital for medical treatment after their release on Saturday. Mohammed el-Halabi The Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization, was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas in a high-profile case that drew criticism from rights groups. He was freed on Feb. 1. Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. One independent audit found that el-Halabi had enforced internal controls and ordered employees to avoid anyone suspected of Hamas ties. Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them. U.N. experts say el-Halabi was questioned for 50 days without access to a lawyer. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Israel has attributed the closed hearings to sensitive security information being relayed. Shadi Amouri Amouri, 44, from the northern West Bank city of Jenin, was arrested for his alleged role in manufacturing the powerful car bomb that detonated beside an Israeli bus packed with passengers on June 5, 2002, killing 17 Israelis in what became known as the Megiddo Junction suicide bombing. The attack during the second intifada took place in northern Israel. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. Amouri was sentenced to life in prison, plus 20 years. He was among those transferred to Egypt on Feb. 1 and released into exile. Zakaria Zubeidi Zakaria Zubeidi is a prominent former militant leader and theater director whose dramatic jailbreak in 2021 thrilled Palestinians across the Middle East and stunned the Israeli security establishment. Zubeidi was a senior militant in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade in the urban Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. After the second intifada in 2006, he co-founded a theater in Jenin to promote what he described as cultural resistance to Israel. The Freedom Theater has put on everything from Shakespeare to stand-up comedy to plays written by residents. In 2019, after Zubeidi had already served years in prison for attacks in the early 2000s, Israel arrested him again over his alleged involvement in shooting attacks that targeted buses of Israeli settlers but caused no injuries. Zubeidi, who was released on Jan. 30 into the West Bank, had been awaiting trial in prison. He denies the charges, saying that he gave up militancy to focus on his political activism after the intifada. In 2021, he and five other prisoners tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel. All six were recaptured days later. Mohammed Abu Warda A Hamas militant during the second intifada, Abu Warda helped organize a series of suicide bombings that killed over 40 people and wounded more than a hundred others. Israel arrested him in 2002, and sentenced him to 48 terms of lifetime imprisonment, among the longest sentences it ever issued. As a young student, Abu Warda joined Hamas at the start of the intifada following Israel’s killing of Yahya Ayyash, the militant group’s leading bomb maker, in 1996. Palestinian authorities said at the time that Abu Warda had helped to recruit suicide bombers, whose attacks targeting crowded civilian areas in Israeli cities killed scores of people in the early 2000s. Abu Warda was released and deported on Jan. 30. Mohammed Aradeh, 42 An activist in Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Aradeh was sentenced to life in prison for a range of offenses going back to the second intifada. Some of the charges, according to the Israeli Prison Service, included planting an explosive device and attempted murder. He was credited with plotting the extraordinary prison escape in 2021, when he and five other detainees, including Zubeidi, used spoons to tunnel out one of Israel’s most secure prisons. They remained at large for days before being caught. From an impoverished and politically active family in Jenin, in the northern occupied West Bank, Aradeh has three brothers and a sister who have all spent years in Israeli prisons. He was welcomed as a sort of cult hero in Ramallah on Jan. 25 as family, friends and fans swarmed him, some chanting 'The freedom tunnel!' in reference to his jailbreak. Mohammed Odeh, 52, Wael Qassim, 54, and Wissam Abbasi, 48 All three men hail from the neighborhood of Silwan, in east Jerusalem, and rose within the ranks of Hamas. Held responsible for a string of deadly attacks during the second intifada, the men were handed multiple life sentences in 2002. They were accused of plotting a suicide bombing at a crowded pool hall near Tel Aviv in 2002 that killed 15 people. Later that year, they were found to have orchestrated a bombing at Hebrew University that killed nine people, including five American students. Israel had described Odeh, who was working as a painter at the university at the time, as the architect of the attack. All three were transferred to Egypt on Jan. 25. Their families live in Jerusalem and said they will join them in exile. Mohammad al-Tous, 67 The 67-year-old al-Tous had held the title of longest continuous Israeli imprisonment until his release last Saturday, Palestinian authorities said. First arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces along the Jordanian border, the activist in the Fatah party spent a total of 39 years behind bars. Originally from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, he was among the prisoners exiled on Jan. 25. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-who-are-the-palestinian-prisoners-released-in-exchange-for-israeli-hostages-3/	2025-02-08T03:40:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a7478912ce66.62820906.jpeg?w=900
Hamas releases 3 more Israeli hostages for dozens of Palestinian ...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants released three gaunt, frail-looking Israeli civilian men they held for the past 16 months on Saturday, and Israel was freeing dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile agreement that has paused the war in the Gaza Strip. Before a crowd of hundreds, armed Hamas fighters led Eli Sharabi, 52, Ohad Ben Ami, 56, and Or Levy, 34, onto a stage, where they were forced to make a public statement before being handed over to the Red Cross. The three were among about 250 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. They appeared to be in much poorer physical condition than any of the 18 other hostages released so far during the ceasefire that began Jan. 19. Hostages' condition sparks concern The hostages' emaciated condition and the stage-managed ceremony — a departure from previous hostage releases where the captives were not made to speak — sparked outrage in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said 'we will not accept the shocking scenes' that played out. The statement did not lay out punitive measures. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the 'difficult scenes' were reason to extend the truce with Hamas and bring home the dozens of remaining hostages. In an apparent response to concerns over the released hostages’ health, Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, claimed it had 'made efforts to preserve their lives despite the (Israeli) bombardment.' Many Palestinians released from Israeli jails during the ceasefire have also appeared gaunt and pale, and have alleged abuses and mistreatment in Israeli custody. The current phase of the truce, which runs until early March, does not appear to have been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza, welcomed by Israel but vehemently rejected by the Palestinians and most of the international community. But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult phase, when Hamas is to release dozens more hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire. Hamas may be reluctant to free more captives — and lose its main bargaining chip — if it believes the U.S. and Israel are serious about depopulating the territory, which rights groups say would violate international law. This was the fifth swap of hostages for prisoners during the ceasefire. Before Saturday, 18 hostages and more than 550 Palestinian prisoners had been freed. The gaunt appearance of the three hostages 'evoke the horrifying pictures from the liberation of the camps in 1945, the darkest chapter of our history,' said the Hostages Families Forum, a group representing relatives of most of the captives. 'We have to get all of the hostages out of hell. There can be no more delays.' The first phase of the ceasefire calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Last week, wounded Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt for the first time since May. Who was released on Saturday? Sharabi and Ben Ami were both captured from Kibbutz Beeri, one of the hardest-hit farming communities, during the Hamas-led attack. Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where he was taking shelter in a safe room when the militants arrived. Sharabi’s wife and two teenage daughters were killed in the attack. His brother Yossi was also abducted and died in captivity. Levy’s wife was killed during the attack and his now 3-year-old son has been cared for by relatives. It is unclear whether either man knows about what happened to their families. Ben Ami, a father of three, was kidnapped with his wife, Raz, who was released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Relatives of the hostages cheered, clapped and cried as they watched live footage of their loved ones being released. Levy's brother, Michael, said his brother’s young son, Almog, was already told his father was on his way. 'Mogi, we found daddy,' Michael Levy said he told the boy, using his nickname, in an interview with Israeli Channel 12. 'We haven’t seen happiness like that in him for a long time.' The 183 Palestinian prisoners being released by Israel on Saturday include 18 people serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis, 54 serving long-term sentences and 111 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained after the Oct. 7 attack but not tried for any crime. All are men are aged between 20 and 61. Virtually every Palestinian has a friend, relative or acquaintance who has been imprisoned. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. More than 70 are still in Gaza, and Israel has said 34 of those are believed to be dead. Israel says Hamas has confirmed eight of the 33 to be released during the first phase of the truce are dead. Ceasefire's next phase is uncertain It is not clear whether Israel and Hamas have begun negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu’s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won’t release remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. In the Oct. 7 attack, some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground war, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods. Senior militants among Palestinian prisoners set for release Of the 72 prisoners being released Saturday, five are from east Jerusalem, 14 from the Gaza Strip and the remaining 53 from the occupied West Bank. Seven are to be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation. A total of 47 prisoners were being freed Saturday from Ofer prison in the West Bank, and transferred to Palestinian custody near Ramallah where scores of relatives, friends and supporters welcomed some of them cheering and clapping. One extremely frail-looking prisoner was loaded directly from a bus into an ambulance for emergency treatment. The Palestinian security prisoners were detained over offenses ranging from bomb attacks to involvement in militant organizations, in some cases dating back decades. They include Iyad Abu Shakhdam, 49, who has been locked up for nearly 21 years over his involvement in Hamas attacks in crowded civilian areas that killed dozens of Israelis during the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. That included a notorious 2004 suicide bus bombing in Israel’s southern desert city of Beersheba that killed 16 people, including a 4-year-old. Another is Jamal al-Tawil, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of al-Bireh, abutting Ramallah. He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli jail, with the military reporting his last arrest in 2021 over his alleged participation in violent riots and efforts to entrench Hamas' leadership in the West Bank. He was transferred to administrative detention, a repeatedly renewable six-month period in which suspects are held without charge or trial. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. ___ Goldenberg contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-to-free-3-more-israeli-hostages-for-dozens-of-palestinian-prisoners-under-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-02-08T03:26:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a7407e4998d0.20425490.jpeg?w=900
No, DOGE did not find Pentagon spent $600 million on sushi	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency did not find the Pentagon spent $600 million on sushi and it never claimed to, despite social media posts online. A Facebook post earlier this week showed a statement wrongly attributed to Musk. It claimed to detail federal spending uncovered by DOGE. 'My experience with DOGE has been totally wild so far. I told you yesterday about the $600 million per year the Pentagon was spending on Sushi,' the text of the statement reads. DOGE staffer resigns after racist posts exposed It goes on to say: 'Well, I just found another wild one! The Air Force was spending $1,280 per paper coffee cup! Like literally those ones you find at the office. $1280!!! We also found that $230k per month was being spent by the IRS on Starbucks Cinnamon Roast K Cups, but everyone was working from home!' The claims about the Pentagon and the Air Force were attributed to Musk but they appear to have originated from a parody account on X. The tech billionaire never said them. An X account named @iamnot_Elon, which is labeled as a parody, posted the statement Jan. 26. Several days later, a Facebook post Feb. 3 matched the statement essentially word-for-word but attributed it to Musk himself. Does DOGE have your personal information? The Facebook post was shared more than 3,000 times in three days, according to USA Today. Similar versions circulated on other social media platforms like Instagram and Threads. Several users on X appeared to be confused by the satirical post. One account replied: 'This is ridiculous, they just trash taxpayers money.' Another wrote: 'Stop, no way. We really need to out the party that approved those expenses.' The official DOGE account on X has been sharing the new transparency unit's work but there are no posts about pricey Pentagon sushi. PolitiFact has also debunked the claim in the Facebook post.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-pentagon-sushi/	2025-02-07T14:56:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/GettyImages-470826623.jpg?w=900
Trump says Social Security ‘won't be touched’ by DOGE	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said Friday that his new Department of Government Efficiency will not 'touch' social security, as the non-government task force continues to be criticized for its attacks on different federal agencies and programs. 'Social Security will not be touched, it will only be strengthened,' Trump said during a news conference when asked if there are any limits placed on what Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, can examine. But Trump added that he would 'weed out' undocumented people whom he claimed were utilizing the program. 'We have illegal immigrants on Social Security and we're going to find out who they are and take them off... we're not going to stand for that.' Does DOGE have your personal information? Undocumented immigrants are not eligible and cannot collect Social Security benefits, though they often pay taxes that help fund the program. The president’s statement has been in line with campaign promises he made about social security. Trump had said he won’t 'cut one cent' from Social Security or raise the retirement age. The official Republican Party platform adopted at the Republican National Convention echoed those promises but it has been less clear how Trump plans to shore up the program’s finances. Since becoming the head of DOGE, Musk has targeted the United States Agency for International Development and the Education Department leading many to fear social security could be next on its hit list. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? Trump, under Musk’s recommendation, ordered USAID funding to be paused for 90 days, and many of the agency’s staff were fired or put on administrative leave, which largely halted the agency’s work. Musk’s DOGE has also turned on the Education Department, with lawmakers raising concerns about DOGE’s access to internal systems containing personal information on tens of millions of Americans.

Lawmakers denied entry into Department of Education	(NewsNation) — Democratic members of Congress were denied entry into the Department of Education on Friday morning. The doors were locked and a security guard could be seen having a tense conversation with a lawmaker. 'They are blocking members of Congress from entering the Department of Education! Elon is allowed in and not the people? ILLEGAL,' Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., wrote on X. In another post, he said armed federal officers were called to the scene. 'We aren't dangerous,' Frost wrote. 'We are here to represent our people. To defend public education. This is an authoritarian regime.' Does DOGE have your personal information? The incident happened as Trump reportedly considered using an executive order to abolish the department, an issue he campaigned on during the 2024 election. 'We’re ranked number one in cost per pupil, so we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we’re ranked at the bottom of the list,' Trump has previously said. 'We’re ranked very badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools.' Shutting down the Department of Education would require an act of Congress. The department administers funding for K-12 schools that is appropriated by Congress; provides oversight for schools; administers student loans and grants; and can also create federal rules. Along with the Education Department, Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk moved to eradicate the U.S. Agency for International Development. Democrats tried Monday to enter USAID headquarters, but were blocked from this building as well by officers. This story is developing. Refresh for updates.

Illinois, Chicago sued by DOJ over sanctuary city status	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit Thursday against Chicago, Cook County and the state of Illinois, accusing officials of interfering with immigration enforcement efforts. The suit comes on the heels of a federal judge blocking President Donald Trump's executive order preventing the children of migrants without legal status from receiving birthright citizenship for the second time this week. Chicago and Illinois leaders vow to fight DOJ Local leaders are pushing back against the Trump administration, asserting the city maintains its welcoming status despite federal pressure. The DOJ's lawsuit argues Chicago's state and local laws — such as the Illinois Way Forward Act, the Illinois Trust Act and Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance, which limit local police cooperation with ICE agents — interfere with the federal government's immigration enforcement. Federal buyout deadline extended as Trump plans USAID cuts Additionally, it argues the supremacy clause of the Constitution gives the federal government the right to create and enforce laws without interference from states. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker defended the laws. 'Unlike Donald Trump, Illinois follows the law,' he said, adding that the Trust Act was signed into law by a Republican governor and 'has always been compliant with federal law and still is today.' 'We look forward to seeing them in court,' Pritzker said. Sheriff: Illinois Trust Act ties our hands Some local law enforcement officials, such as Winnebago County Sheriff Gary Caruana, argue the current legislation prevents their ability to do their jobs effectively. 'The Trust Act does not allow us to call immigration and say this person has an issue and could be dangerous — and this is where I'm concerned about public safety — this person could be dangerous, you might want to take a look at this. We can't do that,' he said. Senate installs Russell Vought as Trump’s next budget chief In a social media post, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit is under review by the city's law department and reaffirmed the city's commitment to protecting residents. Earlier this week, Johnson accused the Trump administration of trying to undermine Chicago's humanity and called for Congress to pass immigration reform.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/doj-sues-illinois-chicago-sanctuary-city/	2025-02-07T06:17:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25027710663013.jpg?w=900
Trump's birthright citizenship order going in front of third judg...	(NewsNation) — A third federal judge is weighing President Donald Trump's push to end birthright citizenship Friday after a second judge ordered a nationwide pause earlier this week. At issue is whether birthright citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution. So far, judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents have said the 14th Amendment grants birthright citizenship. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland put an injunction on Trump's executive order. In Seattle on Thursday, U.S. District John Coughenour issued his own injunction, accusing Trump of trying to change the Constitution 'under the guise of an executive order.' What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown praised the judge's decision, saying that 'time and time again, (Trump) has shown a disdain for the United States Constitution.' Meanwhile, the Trump administration is focusing on a four-word phrase in the 14th Amendment: 'subject to the jurisdiction.' Per the 14th Amendment, 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.' Trump administration officials say this means people in the U.S. illegally, visiting or on a visa are not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. — and, therefore, their children are not citizens. Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship would overturn more than a century of precedent It may be an uphill fight, with precedent set at a Supreme Court case more than a century ago. Back then, the high court ruled children born in the U.S. to Chinese parents — who were prohibited from becoming citizens at that time — could be citizens under the 14th Amendment. Trump's executive order was set to go into effect on Feb. 19 but now will remain blocked unless both courts are overruled. More than two dozen states and organizations are part of at least nine different lawsuits challenging the order. Friday's hearing in Boston is set to start at 10 a.m. ET, and a fourth case will be heard Monday in New Hampshire.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-third-judge/	2025-02-07T05:51:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771.jpg?w=900
Federal buyout deadline extended as Trump slashes USAID staffing	(NewsNation) — Nearly 2 million U.S. federal employees now have until the weekend to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration, which is seeking to dramatically reduce the federal workforce, after a judge delayed Thursday's deadline. The move coincides with President Donald Trump's plan to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, leaving fewer than 300 workers of its current 10,000-employee workforce. These workers would be responsible for managing U.S. humanitarian efforts abroad. According to reports, only 12 staff members would oversee projects in Africa and eight in Asia. A lawsuit filed by the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees seeks a federal court order to stop the USAID cuts. Catholic aid group downsizes by nearly 50% amid USAID freeze Labor unions are fighting the buyouts for federal workers, arguing the plan is an illegal scam unauthorized by Congress and warning federal workers to read the fine print. 'What we've been urging is for people to look at these offers with caution because there's legal uncertainty,' said John Hatton of the National Active and Retired Federal Employee Association. 'We don't know what that means in terms of, do you still lose your job, do you waive all legal rights under this offer as well.' Buyout offer extended after judge’s ruling Millions of U.S. government employees had been facing a Thursday deadline to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration. Those who choose to stay still risk being laid off. U.S. District Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. ruled in favor of several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan spearheaded by Trump adviser Elon Musk. The judge did not express an opinion on the legality of the buyouts and directed administration officials to extend the deadline to apply until after a hearing scheduled for Monday. Saving USAID not the hill Dems should die on: Commentator Trump’s push to reduce the size of the government is unprecedented, causing turmoil in Washington and triggering protests and union concerns over potential legal violations. So far, more than 60,000 employees, about 2% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout, with more expected to join. It remains unclear how many of the federal government’s 2.3 million civilian workers will ultimately agree to the offer. What’s included in the buyout offer? On the surface, the Office of Personnel Management's offer seems straightforward: federal workers who resign will receive pay and benefits through September. However, the situation may not be that simple. The deal limits employees’ ability to address any issues if things go wrong. Even after workers accept the buyout, the government still has the right to rescind the offer. The buyout impacts not only employees at domestic agencies such as the Department of Labor, which has long drawn criticism from Trump’s supporters, but also those in intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Unions and some lawmakers are urging federal workers to reject the buyout offer, cautioning that, with government funding set to expire in March, their pay and benefits could be at risk. The move has sparked protests in Washington and across the nation. What happens if federal workers don’t accept the buyout offer? Federal workers who do not accept the offer may face job losses and miss out on the pay and benefits offered by the buyout. Did USAID money lead to Trump impeachment? The Office of Personnel Management has warned several federal agencies could downsize in the coming months, though this does not apply to military personnel or workers in immigration enforcement, national security and the U.S. Postal Service.

Coast Guard locates wreckage of missing Alaska flight	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The FAA confirms a plane found in Alaska is the wreckage of Bering Air Flight 445. In a statement, the agency said it and the National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating the crash and NTSB will provide all updates. The U.S. Coast Guard announced it had located an aircraft matching the description of a plane that went missing off the Alaskan coast Friday evening. The aircraft was located roughly 34 miles southeast of Nome, Alaska, and three deceased individuals were found inside. Airport employees accused of leaking DC plane crash video Nine passengers and the pilot were onboard the aircraft. It is not clear what the status is for the remaining individuals. The plane experienced a drop in speed and elevation prior to disappearing, authorities announced on Friday. An aircraft carrying 10 people across Alaska’s Norton Sound south of the Arctic Circle went missing Thursday afternoon and rescuers searched into the night for any sign of the aircraft. The Bering Air Caravan was heading from Unalakleet to Nome with nine passengers and a pilot, according to Alaska's Department of Public Safety. Authorities were working to determine its last known coordinates. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people in western Alaska, about 150 miles southeast of Nome and 395 miles northwest of Anchorage. The disappearance marks the third major incident in U.S. aviation in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people onboard and another person on the ground. The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m., and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. The aircraft was 12 miles offshore, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. 'Staff at Bering Air is working hard to gather details, get emergency assistance, search and rescue going,' Olson said. Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. Airplanes are often the only option for travel of any distance in rural Alaska, particularly in winter. The Nome Volunteer Fire Department said in a statement on social media that ground crews were searching across the coast, from Nome to Topkok. 'Due to weather and visibility, we are limited on air search at the current time,' it said. People were told not to form their own search parties because the weather was too dangerous. In an update early Friday, the department said that 'crews are still searching on the ground, canvassing as much area as possible,' but that 'we do not have any updated information on the location of the missing aircraft.' A U.S. Coast Guard airplane crew was expected to search the missing aircraft's last known position. The National Guard and troopers were also helping with the search, according to the fire department. It was 17 F in Unalakleet around takeoff, according to the National Weather Service. There was light snow falling and fog. The names of the people on board weren't yet being released. Nome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

Ellen Greenberg's death staged to look like suicide: Neuropatholo...	(NewsNation) — Dr. Wayne Ross, a forensic neuropathologist hired by the family of Ellen Greenberg, believes the teacher's 2011 death was staged to look like a suicide, he told NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin. He cites a towel placed next to her, clean despite her 20 stab wounds, as evidence of the staging. The case was originally ruled a homicide, then changed to suicide. Greenberg's family has long found her passing suspicious, with her father saying he believes she was strangled. Attorney: Ellen Greenberg’s family hasn’t heard from her fiancé Ross agrees: 'To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she was strangled. Yeah, I would testify in the court of law.' The medical examiner who initially investigated the case released new legal verification indicating he believes the ruling of a suicide is inaccurate. Just days ago, the family of Ellen Greenberg reached a settlement agreement with Philadelphia officials to reopen the investigation. And Ross has an idea of what they might find — from bruises on her wrists and legs, to conflicting blood splatter evidence. Former DHS employee arrested for kidnapping child, falsifying documents Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who worked as Philadelphia district attorney when Greenberg was found dead, addressed the case Thursday. 'There's nothing I wanted more than to give these parents some finality, some answers, some clarity, and we received more evidence, more information during the course of our investigation that ... pointed toward a suicide,' Shapiro said. Ellen Greenberg's death Greenberg was found dead Jan. 26, 2011, in the kitchen of her apartment by her fiancé. The 27-year-old woman had been stabbed 20 times. Cost to sequester Megan Boswell jury thousands per day Philadelphia Medical Examiner Marlon Osbourne initially ruled the death a homicide due to the large number of stab wounds, including 10 on the back of Greenberg’s neck. But police challenged the finding and he changed his assessment to suicide. Osbourne did not offer an explanation for the change at the time, but a new statement showed he made the change after acquiring additional information from her case file and consulting with another doctor.

(NewsNation) — Bill O'Reilly tells NewsNation he doesn't fear any uprising led by Elon Musk, as he believes the Tesla billionaire doesn't actually 'have any power' in the administration. 'I'm not worried that he's going to do a coup d'état,' O'Reilly said. 'I'm not worried because he doesn't have any power. He can't subpoena anybody. He's just is an adviser.' Does DOGE have your personal information? 'He presents to Trump,' O'Reilly added. 'Trump does what he wants.' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been active since President Donald Trump took office and signed an executive order creating the organization just more than two weeks ago. After Musk vowed to cut $2 trillion from federal government spending, the tech billionaire has come under fire from Democrats questioning Musk’s authority to act. Its investigations — most notably into the U.S. Agency for International Development — have drawn ire from protestors and politicians alike who fear he has too much influence and power for an unelected official. 'Think this is just a hyped-up story. Doesn't mean very much. I'm happy if Elon Musk uncovers wasteful spending,' O'Reilly said. Elon Musk's role DOGE has been controversial from the start.

Federal workers need more time on buyout decision: Money expert	(NewsNation) — A financial expert says he has many 'reservations' around the Trump administration’s buyout offer to federal employees because the staffers don't have enough data or time to make an informed, 'irrevocable' life-altering decision. 'We understand what he's trying to do here, but there's a way to do it where people can make educated and good long-term decisions in another month or two to get all that data,' Doug Flynn, co-founder of Flynn Zito Capital Management, told NewsNation. So far, more than 60,000 employees, about 2% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout with more expected to join them. It remains unclear how many of the federal government’s 2.3 million civilian workers will ultimately agree to the offer. Federal employees accepting buyouts ‘rapidly growing’ Millions of U.S. government employees had been facing a Thursday midnight deadline to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration or remain in their position. Those who chose to stay still risked being laid off. However, a federal judge delayed that deadline until Monday after ruling in favor of several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan spearheaded by Trump adviser Elon Musk. Flynn said buyouts are presented in the corporate world with much more information and assurances along with ample time so an employee is able to make an informed decision, When private companies 'do that, they lay out everything that you're going to get, and they've run it through all the legal channels, and so you can have it looked at by an employment attorney, but it's probably already run through as the best deal you're going to get,' he said. 'And they give you more than nine days to make an irrevocable, lifelong decision.' While it may seem beneficial to some employees who are near retirement, for others, the decision is much harder because they may not be able to secure the same kind of employment again, he added. 'It does make a big difference in these people's lives in terms of planning.'

NCAA changes participation policy on transgender athletes	NewsNation) — The National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Board of Governors voted to change its policy on transgender athletes, restricting women’s sports to those athletes who were assigned female genders at birth. The announcement comes one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to keep men from participating in women’s sports. The change also comes on the heels of three University of Pennsylvania swimmers suing the school and the NCAA, claiming their rights were violated after they were teammates with a transgender swimmer on UPenn’s women’s swimming team. White supremacist found guilty of planning power grid attack The updated participation policy allows college athletes who were assigned male genders at birth to practice with women’s teams and receive benefits such as medical care while practicing, the NCAA said in a statement. Men’s sports remain open to all eligible student-athletes. Under the new policy, schools are directed to foster welcoming environments on all of its campuses. The NCAA is an organization made up of 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states that collectively enroll more than 530,000 student-athletes, the organization said. 'We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,' NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. 'To that end, President Trump's order provides a clear, national standard.' The lawsuit filed by the three former UPenn swimmers involved their former teammate, Lia Thomas, who won an NCAA championship in 2022 in the 500 freestyle while part of the school’s women’s team. Thomas was originally part of the school’s men’s swimming team before transitioning. As part of Thursday’s NCAA policy change, the Board of Governors also directed NCAA staff to assist all of its member schools foster respectful and inclusive collegiate athletic cultures.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/ncaa-participation-transgender-athletes/	2025-02-06T14:00:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67683998f0b576.83202384.jpeg?w=900
Increased security in New Orleans ahead of Super Bowl	NEW ORLEANS (NewsNation) — After a New Year's Day terror attack struck New Orleans' historic French Quarter, city officials say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for Sunday's Super Bowl. More than 125,000 visitors — including President Donald Trump — are expected to converge on the Big Easy this week for days of revelry capped off by the clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome to crown this season's NFL champion. Following the truck-ramming attack that killed 14 people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist they are ready after more than a year of preparations. Federal workers fear mass firings as buyout deadline looms Approximately 2,000 law enforcement officers will be present for the Super Bowl, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters Wednesday. No vehicle traffic will be allowed on Bourbon Street, and the city will block intersections leading to the most popular areas, Kirkpatrick said. Security has had to 'heighten' with Trump's visit announced on Tuesday, and the city 'will have to shut down some additional streets a little longer in order to provide a safe corridor for him,' Kirkpatrick said. Drones are prohibited above downtown New Orleans and around the Superdome in the days leading up to the game, and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. No one will be allowed inside a cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium. The perimeter will include blast barriers and trucks will be required to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, said Homeland Security Investigations New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of security.

Three UPenn teammates of Lia Thomas sue university	(NewsNation) — Three swimmers and former teammates of transgender competitor Lia Thomas have sued the University of Pennsylvania and others, alleging that the school violated their rights. Former UPenn swimmers Grace Eastabrook, Ellen Homquist and Margot Kaczorowrski filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts this week. The Ivy League Council of Presidents, the NCAA and others are listed as defendants. Thomas was banned from competing in elite swimming competitions, including the Olympics. Thomas swam for the University of Pennsylvania and won an NCAA title in meets that are outside the World Aquatics competitive system, in which she was not registered. Federal workers fear mass firings as buyout deadline looms The World Aquatics governing body added a new gender inclusion policy in 2022, banning biological male athletes from competing in women’s elite races unless they transitioned by the age of 12 or before experiencing male puberty. It also created an 'open' category for transgender athletes. Thomas gained national recognition after she won the 2022 NCAA championship in the 500 freestyle and was named an All-American in three of the women’s swimming and diving championships. In the lawsuit, the three former UPenn swimmers who all competed at the 2022 Ivy League Women's Swimming and Diving championships, said that before the season began, the school's swimming coach, Mike Schnur bragged that he had a 'secret weapon.' They said before the Ivy League championships, Thomas' dominance over women's swimmers 'meet after meet' had become international news. They claim that the Ivy League Council of Presidents, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, met behind closed doors to 'strike a public blow for trans-identifying men competing in women's sports.' The lawsuit said that the 2022 Ivy League meet was to be the culmination of the league's public campaign to 'manipulate public opinion and change the NCAA Division I collegiate sports landscape' for trans-identifying men who wanted to compete in women's competitions. In a statement provided to NewsNation by an NCAA spokeswoman, the organization said, 'College sports are the premier stage for women’s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women’s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships.' An email sent to the University of Pennsylvania seeking comment was not immediately returned. Thomas is the first known male-born athlete to win an NCAA Division I women’s title. Thomas previously competed for the university’s men’s team before transitioning to a woman. One of Thomas’ teammates spoke to NewsNation, which agreed to allow the teammate to remain anonymous. 'This is a problem that needs to be fixed,' she told NewsNation. The lawsuit filed by the swimmers comes on the heels of President Donald Trump signing an executive order stopping men from competing in women's sports. But Thomas's former teammate told NewsNation that she feels a lot of her teammates are 'really scared' to speak out. She said that the first time she saw Thomas compete with UPenn’s women’s team, she felt shocked and said the team was just forced to accept it because no one was in place to do anything about it. This is a developing story. NewsNation will update it as more information becomes available.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/upenn-teammates-lia-thomas-sue/	2025-02-06T08:24:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6705bfba0300c8.02293859.jpeg?w=900
Nearly a third of those in ICE custody have criminal convictions	(NewsNation) — Data from the Department of Homeland Security indicates nearly 30% of those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody have criminal convictions. In addition, just over 33% have a final order of removal. In the wake of President Donald Trump's actions to make good on campaign promises of mass deportations, there are more than 41,000 in ICE custody. Judge cements block on Trump’s order restricting birthright citizenship ICE has also targeted members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. A recent action in Colorado resulted in the arrest of 10 people, though sources told NewsNation information about the action was leaked, potentially affecting results. Local officials did not help because Colorado law prohibits them from doing so, leaving federal officials to conduct immigration raids. Most of those detained are housed in an area under the purview of the New Orleans field office with the most beds in the system, with roughly 9,400 in custody. While the average length of custody is 90 days, some have been in custody for three months or more. The administration has started releasing deportation flights to other countries, including Colombia, Mexico and India. Newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the administration has been in talks with El Salvador about the country accepting deportees of different nationalities. ICE raids heighten fear among NYC street vendors Tom Homan, who the administration has placed in charge of the effort, says congressional funding is needed for more beds but that the agency is doing what it can with the resources available. Recently, the Trump administration announced a plan to house people flagged for deportation at Guantanamo Bay. The facility, infamous for its use to indefinitely detain people during the war on terror, would be able to house 30,000 immigrants who have been marked for deportation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/nearly-third-ice-custody-criminal/	2025-02-06T08:22:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195569259.jpg?w=900
Trump to sign order sanctioning International Criminal Court	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court for targeting the United States and its allies, a White House official told NewsNation. NewsNation previously reported on the order, originally set to be signed Tuesday and pushed back due to a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The order will put financial and visa sanctions on individuals and family members who help the ICC investigate U.S. citizens or allies. DOJ sues Illinois, Chicago over ‘sanctuary city’ laws The U.S. has never accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC and is not a party to the Rome Statute. In a fact sheet, the administration said the statute gives the ICC broad power that poses 'a significant threat to United States sovereignty and our constitutional protections.' The court was created in 2002 to facilitate international justice for war crimes, crimes of aggression, genocide and crimes against humanity. The Trump administration said the court has been politicized, citing its issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli officials and Hamas officials at the same time. The administration claims the court constrains democratic nations from exercising the right of self-defense while failing to hold other regimes, such as Iran, accountable. The administration says investigations into the U.S. and Israel 'undermine its credibility as an impartial arbiter of international justice.' Trump has also decried the cost of the court, which has had expenditures of more than $2 billion. However, the U.S. has not been a regular contributor to ICC funding, with Congress typically blocking any efforts to give funds. Rand Paul knocks Trump Gaza takeover plan: ‘I thought we voted for America First’ Trump previously sanctioned the ICC during his first administration, freezing assets and banning officials from entering the U.S. after the court opened an investigation into American actions in Afghanistan. Trump's recent move comes after he suggested the U.S. 'take over' the Gaza Strip, a proposal that global leaders have rejected and that some have suggested is illegal. This is a developing story.

Live: Trump addresses bipartisan National Prayer Breakfast	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is attending the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday, joining a Washington tradition that has lasted more than 70 years and brings together bipartisan lawmakers for fellowship. This year's event is co-chaired by Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. Trump made headlines at the final prayer breakfast of his first term, which took place the day after he was acquitted by the Senate in his first impeachment trial. Judge cements block on Trump’s order restricting birthright citizenship During his previous remarks, Trump criticized Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who publicly said she prayed for him, and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, who cited his faith in his decision to vote to convict Trump. The National Prayer Breakfast was first attended by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in February 1953, and every president since has spoken at the event. Trump will also speak at another prayer breakfast on Thursday sponsored by a private group.

Federal workers fear mass firings as buyout deadline looms	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Millions of U.S. government employees face a Thursday deadline to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration or remain in their position. Those who choose to stay may still risk being laid off. President Donald Trump's push to reduce the size of the government is unprecedented, causing turmoil in Washington and triggering protests and union concerns over potential legal violations. So far, more than 40,000 employees, about 2% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout. It remains unclear how many of the federal government's 2.3 million civilian workers will ultimately agree to the offer, which guarantees pay through September if they resign by Thursday. What's included in the buyout offer? Confusion and anger continue in Washington over the proposed buyouts. On the surface, the offer from the Office of Personnel Management seems straightforward: federal workers who resign by the end of the day Thursday will receive pay and benefits through September. However, the situation may not be that simple. Is it real or is it a trick? Federal workers debate legitimacy of buyout offer as deadline nears The deal limits employees' ability to address any issues if things go wrong. Even after workers accept the buyout, the government still has the right to rescind the offer. The buyout impacts not only employees at domestic agencies such as the Department of Labor, which has long drawn criticism from Trump's supporters, but also those in intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Unions urge federal workers to turn down buyouts Unions and some lawmakers are urging federal workers to reject the buyout offer, cautioning that, with government funding set to expire in March, their pay and benefits could be at risk. The move has sparked protests in Washington and across the nation. Outside the Department of Labor on Wednesday, some lawmakers slammed Elon Musk's role in reshaping the federal workforce, claiming the decision could impact all Americans, not just government workers. 'What he's trying to do is essentially destroy our agencies, destroy the social safety net, and then take all of that, pretend it's savings, so then he takes all of that hard-earned wealth of working-class people from across the country and redistributes it to himself his billionaire friends and his own companies,' said Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif. Army recruiting hits record highs after Trump’s win In response to these concerns, the Office of Personnel Management defended the buyout offer, stating, 'This is a rare, generous opportunity — one that was thoroughly vetted and intentionally designed to support employees through restructuring.' What happens if federal workers don't accept the buyout offer? Federal workers who do not accept the offer may face job losses and miss out on the pay and benefits offered by the buyout. The Office of Personnel Management has warned several federal agencies could downsize in the coming months, though this does not apply to military personnel or workers in immigration enforcement, national security and the U.S. Postal Service.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-workers-firings-buyout-deadline/	2025-02-06T04:36:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196938721.jpg?w=900
Does DOGE have your personal information?	(NewsNation) — Current and former officials have been raising the alarm after a team led by Elon Musk was granted access to the Treasury's payment systems, which include sensitive data on millions of Americans. The White House says that Musk, a South African tech billionaire, has a security clearance to access the system; however, the agency typically restricts access to a very small number of senior personnel because of the sensitivity of the information. Musk says DOGE will make ‘rapid safety upgrades’ to air traffic control system What is DOGE? President Donald Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) through an executive order, renaming what was previously the Office of Digital Services and moving the office to be under the Executive Office of the President from the Office of Management and Budget, where it was previously located. The office is tasked with modernizing government technology, and Trump has also directed Musk, who heads DOGE, to review finances. Why has DOGE been controversial? DOGE has been controversial from the start. Though it is not an agency or a Cabinet-level position, it has been treated similarly. Because it is not an agency, Musk has not had to go through a Senate confirmation hearing that would typically be required for someone at that level of power. The White House has classified Musk as a special government employee with a limited contract, which means he is exempt from certain regulations regarding financial disclosure and transparency. DOGE employees identified, prosecution possible: US Attorney DOGE has also made unilateral changes to certain agencies, most notably USAID. The organization is responsible for providing humanitarian assistance abroad, and after accessing systems, DOGE put the majority of employees on administrative leave, recalled those stationed overseas and blocked staff from accessing the Washington, D.C., office. Musk and Trump have alleged the agency is 'criminal' and a 'fraud' though there has been no evidence offered to back up any of those claims. What information does DOGE have access to? The Treasury Department's payment system includes the systems that control money for federal grants, payments for Social Security and Medicare, tax information and payments to government contractors. That means DOGE employees have access to the Social Security numbers of millions of Americans, along with sensitive tax information and banking accounts for direct deposit. Trump and Musk have maintained that DOGE is conducting a financial audit. However, audits do not typically include (or require) direct access to the payment system. Trump also fired the inspector general whose role includes auditing government programs and who has extensive experience doing so. What could DOGE do with that information? The Trump administration claims Musk has read-only access to the system, but critics have still raised the alarm about what Musk could do. What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Theoretically, with access to the payment system, DOGE could cut off any payments it or the president decides should be cut. That could range from broad moves, like cutting off the funds for school lunch programs, or granular ones, like deciding which individual Americans should or should not recieve Social Security payments. DOGE also has access to information on government contractors, including a 'Do Not Pay' list that prevents ineligible individuals or companies from receiving federal funds. Headed by Musk, whose companies are heavily subsidized by government funds, DOGE could blacklist his competitors and make them ineligible for contracts or remove companies owned by his allies that are currently blacklisted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/does-doge-have-personal-data/	2025-02-05T16:31:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24318569633728-e1731532012925_3d1ae4-e1732493115731.jpg?w=800
Musk says DOGE will make 'rapid safety upgrades' to air traffic c...	Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday said the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will make 'rapid safety upgrades' to the air traffic control systems with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 'With the support of President @realDonaldTrump, the @DOGE team will aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,' Musk wrote Wednesday on the social platform X, which he owns. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? 'Just a few days ago, the FAA’s primary aircraft safety notification system failed for several hours!' he added, likely referring to an outage of the FAA's Notice to Air Mission system over the weekend. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN over the weekend that the system allows pilots to download flight details ahead of a trip and is required for planes to fly. Shortly before Musk's post on Wednesday, Duffy posted on X that he spoke with the DOGE team, who will 'plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.' The Department of Transportation (DOT) did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for more details on what these upgrades could look like. When asked about the upgrades, a White House spokesperson doubled down on DOGE's mission. 'DOGE is fulfilling President Trump’s commitment to making government more accountable, efficient, and, most importantly, restoring proper stewardship of the American taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars,' the spokesperson said. 'Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.' 'The ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change,' the spokesperson added. 'While change can be uncomfortable, it is necessary and aligns with the mandate supported by more than 77 million American voters.' DOGE actions ‘long overdue, much welcomed’: House speaker Musk owns SpaceX, a leading aerospace company, along with electric vehicle maker Tesla and the social media company X. His remarks come nearly a week after a deadly midair collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport between a passenger plane and a military helicopter. All 67 people aboard the American Airlines plane and helicopter were killed. The crash prompted scrutiny of the FAA, along with the Trump administration's plans to reduce federal bureaucracy. FAA employees were reportedly sent an offer to resign with eight months' pay one day before the collision, but an official with the Office of Personnel Management later said controllers were not eligible for the offer, The Associated Press reported. There is no evidence the efforts to reduce the federal workforce played a role in the collision, and a shortage of air traffic controllers had been an issue long before President Trump took office or began DOGE. Democrats accuse DOGE of going after NOAA Thousands of federal workers have been offered the buyout as Trump, Musk and DOGE look to slash government spending and bureaucracy. On his first day in office, Trump issued a federal government hiring freeze that applies to much of the federal government, but air traffic controllers were not included in this freeze, the AP noted. Musk made headlines this week after his team pushed for access to the Treasury Department's payment system, and DOGE staff has been involved at the Small Business Administration and the Government Services Administration. Musk has also been a vocal proponent of gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D) quickly slammed Duffy's announcement of DOGE's work. 'They have no relevant experience. Most of them aren't old enough to rent a car. And you're going to let them mess with airline safety that's already deteriorated on your watch?' she wrote on X. House Republican eyes Medicare, Social Security for DOGE cuts Some of the DOGE staff members are reportedly young adults, some of whom have reportedly not graduated from college. Duffy clapped back, writing on X, 'Madam Secretary, with all due respect, 'experienced' Washington bureaucrats are the reason our nation's infrastructure is crumbling. You need to sit this one out.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-doge-air-traffic-control/	2025-02-05T15:51:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/muskelon_01202025ap_837cbb.jpg?w=900
DOGE actions 'long overdue, much welcomed': House speaker	(NewsNation) — House Speaker Mike Johnson is defending the actions being taken by the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency amid complaints from Democrats over whether the newly formed agency is wielding too much power. The agency, more commonly known as DOGE, has been active since President Donald Trump took office and signed an executive order creating DOGE just more than two weeks ago. After Musk vowed to cut $2 trillion from federal government spending, the tech billionaire has come under fire from Democrats questioning Musk’s authority to act. Asked if Musk and DOGE had been given powers that fall under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution that grants Congress various enumerated powers and the right to pass laws necessary to carry out those powers, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, defended the agency. ‘Corrupt’ FBI staff in Jan. 6 probe should worry: Justice Dept. Johnson told reporters that the executive branch of the government has the right to evaluate how agencies within the branch operate. He said by pausing the work of federal agencies that are now under evaluation, DOGE ensures that American tax dollars are being used wisely.

'That’s what the American people demand and deserve.' Johnson said that Congress views DOGE’s evaluation of agencies such as the U.S. Department of Education and other federal offices as an 'active, engaged, committed' exercise in what the executive branch was designed to do. Johnson said that DOGE has 'broad discretion' on how federal funding is used. '(DOGE) is using that authority right in a way that hasn’t been used in a long time,' the House speaker said. 'So it looks radical. It’s not. This is not a usurpation of authority in any way. It’s not a power grab. I think they’re doing what we’ve all expected and hope and asked that they would do.' Democrats gathered Tuesday for what was characterized as a 'Nobody Elected Elon' rally outside of the U.S. Treasury, ABC News reported. The group accused Musk of abuse of power. Musk was appointed a 'special government employee,' which subjects him to less stringent rules on ethics and financial disclosures than other workers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said that Musk is 'seizing power that belongs to the American people.' Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats, plan to introduce legislation that would block 'unlawful meddling' in the Treasury Department’s payment systems, ABC News reported. Texas Dem says he’ll bring articles of impeachment against Trump This week’s rally comes as DOGE took control of the finances of the U.S. Agency for International Aid, had employees locked out of their workplaces and accessed classified information, NewsNation reported this week. Meanwhile, federal lawmakers were told by a U.S. Treasury official that DOGE will only have 'read-only' authority over the government’s payment system. Two large unions representing current and retired government employees filed a lawsuit against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, saying DOGE broke privacy laws by entering the agency’s payment system, according to The Associated Press. Johnson told reporters that he expects more legal challenges to come over DOGE activity. Johnson called the nation’s $36 trillion debt load 'a serious threat' to the future and security of the nation and said that action needed to be taken. 'We’ve got to spend money better, and if this executive branch and this White House is going to take the initiative to dig in and expose it, we applaud it,' Johnson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-actions-overdue-speaker/	2025-02-05T14:23:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
What school programs remain even if Dept. of Education is gutted?	(NewsNation) —President Donald Trump is considering shuttering the Department of Education, but several federal school programs that are not under that department could remain after a potential gutting. The Education Department was established by Congress so it would also require an act of Congress to shut it down, but Trump is preparing to slash it to the full extent of his power, directing his administration to cut spending while pressuring employees to quit. But several school programs could remain intact even if the Education Department gets gutted. What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Head Start Head Start is an early education program that serves some of the nation’s neediest families and children and is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. Head Start serves the nation’s neediest families, offering preschool for children and support for their parents and caregivers, according to the agency. Many of the people it serves come from low-income households, are in foster care or are homeless. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 23: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters after signing a series of executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on January 23, 2025. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) While the program is not under the Education Department, Trump’s executive order to freeze federal grants has put it on hold. Administrators around the country last week discovered they were locked out of a government website used to access grant funding for Head Start. What does the Department of Education do? The website went back online for many operators. But a week later, 45 Head Start grant recipients across the country reported problems accessing their funding, said Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association. School Lunch Program The National School Lunch Program is a federally assisted meal program that is administered by the Department of Agriculture. The program provides 'nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children each school day,' according to the agency. It largely serves districts in high-poverty areas, allowing them to distribute meals at no cost to the students. The program served 4.7 billion lunches in 2023, and nearly 241 billion lunches since 1969, according to the UDSA. What does get cut with the Dept. of Education? The Department of Education administers funding for K-12 schools that is appropriated by Congress. The largest are the Title 1 program, which helps educate children from low-income families, and the IDEA program, which helps students with disabilities. Funding for both of those programs accounts for around $28 billion a year. While it’s a significant dollar amount, it only amounts to roughly 10% of funding. It’s not clear how schools would be expected to make up for the loss in funds if those funds were to be eliminated. The Education Department also provides oversight for schools, notably through the Office of Civil Rights, which investigates discrimination complaints filed against colleges and K-12 schools. It can also create federal rules, which have been used to protect minority populations. If the department is dismantled, it’s unclear how anti-discrimination policies would be made or enforced or if such policies would continue to exist. Student loans and grants for higher education are a big part of the department’s work and several aid programs could be eliminated. Currently, federal student loans are provided and serviced by the department. If the government decides to reduce or eliminate its role in lending for education, students who need help to afford college would have to rely on private lenders. Those who already have student loans would likely see a disruption in servicing as the loans would have to be transferred elsewhere, potentially to the Treasury Department. That would include payments for students who are currently enrolled. The Department of Education also provides oversight when it comes to for-profit colleges. That could enable for-profit schools to operate with less stringent standards, which could leave students with amounts of loan debt despite receiving an inadequate education.

Texas Dem says he’ll bring articles of impeachment against Trump ...	Texas Democratic Rep. Al Green said Wednesday he plans to bring articles of impeachment against President Trump after he suggested the U.S. should take over Gaza. 'The movement to impeach the president has begun,' Green said on the House floor. 'I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done.' Arab nations decry Trump proposal for US to take over Gaza On Tuesday, as Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he floated the idea of the U.S. taking over the Gaza Strip. He said Americans should be responsible for cleaning up and rebuilding the war-torn region, though he did not provide details about who would be able to live there. These are some of Trump’s most extreme comments on the matter and come after the start of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire last month. There are nearly 2 million Palestinians who hope to have their own state. Democrats, including Green, slammed the president for the remarks, calling the takeover idea 'ethnic cleansing' and likened it to throwing a match on an already volatile situation. 'Ethnic cleansing is not a joke, especially when it emanates from the president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, when he has the ability to perfect what he says, ethnic cleansing in Gaza is no joke, and the prime minister of Israel should be ashamed knowing the history of his people,' Green said. Green denounced Trump’s remarks and said he wanted to remind people that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was correct when he said 'injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' 'Injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America,' he said. Trump wants to take over Gaza. How would that work? Green was one of the lawmakers who initiated Trump’s first impeachment in 2017. He said Wednesday that he 'laid the foundation for impeachment' and will do it again. 'I know that it’s time for us to lay the foundation again. On some issues, it is better to stand alone than not stand at all,' he said. 'On this issue, I stand alone, but I stand for justice.' Protests against Trump, Project 2025 planned in cities across US Green called on the American people, noting that an impeachment movement must be a grassroots movement. 'The people have to demand it, and when the people demand it, it will be done,' he said.

Arab nations decry Trump proposal for US to take over Gaza	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested the U.S. 'take over' Gaza and handle cleanup, but Arab nations and their leaders in the region are rebuking the plan. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights' and said that what Trump wanted to do would be a 'serious violation of international law.' The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia says its commitment to a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering. What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Abbas is meeting Wednesday with the king of Jordan. Trump said Jordan is one nation that could take in some Palestinians, but the country has said it does not support removing Gazans from the enclave. When questioned over whether the U.S. military would be involved in the 'takeover' of Gaza, Trump said: 'If it's necessary, we'll do that.' 'We're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs,' Trump said. At a press briefing Wednesday, though, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is not committed to having boots on the ground. 'His administration will work with partners in the region to reconstruct this region,' Leavitt said, adding that Trump will meet with the king of Jordan next week and that he already spoke with the king of Bahrain, crown prince of Saudi Arabia and president of Egypt. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? When asked whether Trump is prepared to remove Palestinians by force, Leavitt said Trump wants Gaza to be a place where all people can live. 'The president is prepared to rebuild Gaza for Palestinians and all people in the region,' Leavitt said. While Trump previously said Palestinians should be 'permanently' relocated out of Gaza, Leavitt said Wednesday the president is committed to rebuilding the region for all people who want to return to it 'once it is no longer a demolition site.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, says he supports Trump's proposal. Sources in Israel who spoke to NewsNation say Trump's announcement took them by surprise. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz. (Israeli Prime Minister's Office) It shocked world leaders as well. Asked in the House of Commons about Trump's remarks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes in Gaza. While Germany has been an ally of Israel, its Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement that the 'displacement of the Palestinian civilian population from Gaza would not just be unacceptable,' but also said it would go against international law. 'This would also lead to new suffering and new hatred,' Baerbock said.

Judge cements block on Trump’s order restricting birthright citiz...	GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge Wednesday furthered a block of President Trump’s executive order preventing the children of migrants without legal status from receiving birthright citizenship. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman at the conclusion of a hearing in Greenbelt said Trump’s order 'runs counter to our nation’s 250-year history of citizenship by birth' and likely violates an 1898 Supreme Court decision on the issue. 'The United States Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected the president’s interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment,' Boardman said. 'In fact, no court in the country has ever endorsed the president's interpretation. This court will not be the first.' A separate federal judge in Seattle previously put Trump’s executive order on hold. But that ruling will expire Thursday, when that judge will hold another hearing. Boardman’s ruling, unless overturned by an appeals court, will remain intact until she can issue a final ruling on the merits of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, which is likely to take months. Trump on his first day in office signed the executive order narrowing birthright citizenship so that it doesn’t extend to children born on U.S. soil to parents without permanent legal status, beginning with babies born Feb. 19. It is part of a flurry of immigration actions Trump has taken during his first few weeks in office. Eric Hamilton, deputy assistant attorney general for the civil division, insisted at the hearing that the Trump administration’s position aligned with the 1898 Supreme Court precedent central to the case, United States v. Wong Kim Ark. 'We have not taken a position that Wong Kim Ark is bad law. We think it is consistent with the rule that we have laid out for the Citizenship Clause,' Hamilton said. But Boardman rejected that notion and said a ruling blocking Trump’s order nationwide was necessary to protect the public interest. 'Today, virtually every baby born on U.S. soil is a citizen upon birth. That is the law and tradition of our country. That law and tradition will remain the status quo pending the resolution of this case,' said Boardman, an appointee of former President Biden. 'The government will not be harmed by a preliminary injunction that prevents it from enforcing an executive order likely to be found unconstitutional,' she added. Wednesday’s proceeding in Maryland is the first in a blitz of hearings set to take place across the country over the next week in most of the nine lawsuits challenging Trump’s birthright citizenship order. The case in Maryland was brought by two immigrant rights organizations and five anonymous expecting mothers without permanent legal status. The other cases involve 22 Democratic state attorneys general, the American Civil Liberties Union and Santa Clara County, Calif., among other groups. The challengers emphasize that the courts have only recognized few exceptions to the 14th Amendment’s birthright citizenship guarantee for all people born on U.S. soil: children of diplomats, people born on foreign ships, children of enemies in hostile occupation and Native American tribe members. 'Generations of children have grown up with that promise,' Joseph Mead, special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, which is representing the Maryland challengers, said at Wednesday’s hearing.

Army recruiting hits record highs after Trump's win	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The U.S. Army announced its record-breaking recruitment numbers, marking its most productive December in over a decade, with some crediting President Donald Trump for the boost. This marks a significant turnaround for the branch, which has faced challenges in recent years in recruiting enough young people and has implemented major changes to its recruitment programs. Officials now say December 2024 was their best December in 15 years, with nearly 350 soldiers enlisted every day that month. Army recruiters shared on X, 'Our recruiters have one of the toughest jobs – inspiring the next generation of #Soldiers to serve. Congratulations and keep up the great work!' USPS resumes accepting packages from China, Hong Kong In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, the Army met its recruiting goal of 55,000 and began to rebuild its delayed entry pool. About 24% of those recruits came out of the Future Soldier Prep Course. Army to add more training units The Army, hoping to ride this high, is set to significantly expand the number of recruits they can send to spring training. By April, the service reportedly expects to add 10 more training units, which could accommodate up to 9,600 new recruits annually. In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000. The following year, the service brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, widely missing its publicly stated 'stretch goal' of 65,000. In 2023, there were several initiatives to try and help lower-performing recruits — including adding courses like the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, to help them meet the military academic and physical standards to move on to basic training. Is the Trump administration taking credit for the change? Pete Hegseth, Trump's newly confirmed secretary of defense, touted the Army's recruitment numbers, writing on X, 'BOTTOM LINE: America's youth want to serve under the bold &amp; strong 'America First' leadership of @realDonaldTrump.' He also attributed the rise in recruitment to the new administration during his confirmation hearing. 'We’ve already seen it in recruiting numbers,' Hegseth said. 'There’s already been a surge since President Trump won the election.' Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the Associated Press last month that the Army is on track to meet its 2025 enlistment goals, expecting 81,000 new recruits. She said she expects the Future Soldier Prep Course will contribute about 30% of this year’s recruits. Here’s how the Pentagon could change under Hegseth Hegseth has promised to remove 'woke' programs from the military, referring to an over-emphasis on diversity. But Army leaders have stated that 'wokeness' hasn't played a role in the recruitment increase. According to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total in August 2024 before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers. NewsNation reached out to the Pentagon for comment on Hegseth's remarks, but they declined to provide any additional information at this time.

USPS restores accepting inbound packages from China, Hong Kong	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Postal Service reversed course Wednesday, announcing it will continue accepting inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong, a day after it suspended service from those regions. 'The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery,' the USPS wrote in a notice posted to its website. The USPS did not state a reason for the suspension in a brief announcement, but it came after President Donald Trump imposed an extra 10% tariff on all imports from China. CIA offering buyouts for its workforce The USPS announced Tuesday it would stop accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong 'until further notice.' Trump’s order to impose new taxes on Chinese goods coming into the United States ended duty-free handling of parcels, which had previously been considered 'de minimis' shipments. Trump recently threatened tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada, three countries that he said were not doing enough to crack down on the production and distribution of deadly fentanyl. The U.S. and the latter two countries reached border-security agreements to pause the tariffs. In retaliation, Chinese officials announced they were raising tariffs on certain U.S. goods coming into China.

ICE raids heighten fear among NYC street vendors	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — Nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations are unsettling some New Yorkers — and some street vendors, fearing arrest, are staying home. The sense of fear in the New York City community is palpable and visible. Following ICE raids across the area, fewer vendors are on the city's streets. It comes as the agency's 25 field offices were reportedly ordered to enhance 'routine operations' to meet a quota of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests per day. Since taking office, Trump has ordered other federal law enforcement agencies to assist with immigration efforts and scrapped restrictions at schools, churches and hospitals. ICE raids rattle NYC street vendors One of the first raids under the new administration targeted a fish wholesaler in Newark, New Jersey, and the most recent took place at the Bronx Terminal Market. ICE isn't just going after undocumented workers with criminal records; it's also detaining people who haven't committed crimes, including U.S. citizens and veterans. This has created widespread anxiety among restaurant owners and staff, many of whom view their teams as family and are now afraid that anyone could be swept up in a raid. USPS suspends acceptance of packages from China, Hong Kong Street vendors, the majority of whom are immigrants, are in an even tougher position. With a strict city cap on vending permits, many operate without the proper license, and if caught, they risk a criminal summons, which could put them directly in ICE's path. As a result, some vendors have stopped working altogether to avoid being detained or deported. Those who continue to work have reportedly started forming messaging groups to warn each other about ICE sightings and to offer mutual support. Advocates call for more vending permits Immigration advocates and nonprofits, such as the Street Vendor Project, are backing legislation that would expand the number of available street-vending permits and reduce criminal charges for minor violations so that selling food without a license won't lead to deportation. According to the Immigration Research Initiative, 75% of mobile food vendors are forced to work without a license because of the city’s cap. The Street Vendor Project is also pushing for a shift in enforcement responsibility from the New York Police Department to the New York City Department of Sanitation, which technically oversees street vending, in hopes of reducing the risk of ICE involvement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/nyc-street-vendors-ice-raids/	2025-02-05T05:35:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2192861754-1.jpg?w=900
Protests against Trump, Project 2025 planned in cities across US	A movement to oppose the early actions of President Donald Trump’s administration is taking off online, with plans to protest across the U.S. on Wednesday. The movement has organized under the hashtags #buildtheresistance and #50501, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one day. Many of the protests are planned at state capitols, with some in other cities. The movement has websites and accounts across social media. Flyers circulating online decry Project 2025, a hard-right playbook for American government and society, and include messages such as 'reject fascism' and 'defend our democracy.' In a coffee shop just a block from Michigan’s Capitol, organizers of a planned action there Wednesday pushed together tables, spreading out poster boards to write messages that read 'No Deportations Ever!' and 'Workers Unite!' What has Project 2025 said since Trump’s win? Kelsey Brianne, a key organizer of Michigan’s rally, called it a 'real grassroots effort.' She learned about the movement Sunday night and has been coordinating speakers and safety protocols. 'I got involved because I knew that there was a need, and I knew what I could do,' Brianne said Tuesday. 'But also I want to look back at this time and say that I did something and I didn’t just sit back.' Trump has signed a series of executive orders in the first couple of weeks of his new term on everything from trade and immigration to climate change. As Democrats begin to raise their voice in opposition to Trump’s agenda, protests have also begun. On Sunday, thousands of people marched against Trump's plan for large-scale deportations in Southern California, including in downtown Los Angeles, where protests shut down a major freeway for hours.

Stephen A. Smith: Trump 'like a Realtor' on Gaza ownership	(NewsNation) — Stephen A. Smith said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's suggestion to 'own' the Gaza Strip is 'ridiculous.' Trump 'sounded like a real estate agent,' Smith said during an appearance on NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' 'We shouldn't be hearing about real estate opportunities out of the mouth of the president of the United States.' Smith believes Trump's statement will likely be dismissed: 'I think it's a dangerous proposition and not something that should be entertained.' Senate confirms Pam Bondi to lead Justice Department The president welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, making him the first head of state to visit the White House in Trump's second term. The pair of world leaders addressed the media following what Trump called 'fantastic talks,' echoing an earlier suggestion that the 1.8 million Palestinians currently living in Gaza should be permanently resettled. Trump said he sees the United States engaging in 'a long-term ownership' of Gaza, telling reporters that the idea has received 'tremendous praise.' Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark said Trump's ownership idea would require 'strategic consent' to work. 'There are so many details of this, but the basic concept is a wonderful concept,' Clark said on 'CUOMO.' 'If we could just bring peace to the region. If we could just rebuild Gaza, if the people would just stop wanting to kill each other.' The president did not clarify whether his resettlement idea means he does not support a two-state solution. Last year, Trump’s son-in-law said Israel should bulldoze an area of the Negev desert and move Palestinians there, The Guardian reported. Jared Kushner praised the 'very valuable' potential of Gaza’s 'waterfront property' and suggested Israel should remove civilians while it 'cleans up' the strip Trump suggests ‘all’ Palestinians permanently move out of Gaza Trump said that the Gaza Strip 'should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have … lived a miserable existence there,' referring to Palestinians. 'Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts' and 'build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza,' the president said. When asked how many Palestinians should be resettled in an earlier address Tuesday, Trump said, 'All of them.' Trump suggested building enclaves for Palestinian Gaza residents in neighboring countries. He did not suggest the same for Israeli residents. When asked where Palestinians will go, Trump did not specify any countries. Regarding Palestinians moving back to Gaza once it is rebuilt, Trump said he envisioned Gaza becoming an 'international, unbelievable place' that includes Palestinians, though he did not provide a timeline for their return. Trump warns ‘no guarantees’ fragile peace in Gaza will hold The president also said the United States will take over the Gaza Strip, taking responsibility for dismantling bombs and cleaning out the debris in the region, which has been reduced to rubble since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. When asked if U.S. troops would go to Gaza to secure the area, Trump said, 'We will do whatever is necessary.' Trump and Netanyahu also talked about the need to contain Iran and make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.

Trump wants to take over Gaza. How would that work?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Tuesday that the United States will 'take over' the war-torn Gaza Strip. The president said he sees the United States engaging in 'a long-term ownership' of Gaza, telling the media that the idea has received 'tremendous praise.' Trump said he envisions the United States taking responsibility for dismantling bombs and cleaning out the debris in the region, which has been reduced to rubble since the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Can Trump take over Gaza Strip? Although Trump said he wishes for the United States to own the sought-after small territory, it's unclear how the U.S. would gain control of Gaza. His administration's deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus acknowledged the lack of information, telling NewsNation 'we'll have a lot of clarity for you in the coming days.' Trump warns he left instructions to ‘obliterate’ Iran if he is assassinated Sen. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told NewsNation he believes that Trump isn't suggesting planting an American flag in Gaza, but rather opening up the region to American businesses. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the 47th president's potential business dealings in the strip shouldn't come as a shock, as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, pointed to the high value of Gaza's 'waterfront property' last year. Will Trump send US troops to Gaza? When asked if U.S. troops would go to Gaza to secure the area, Trump said, 'We will do whatever is necessary.' He did not specify whether they would engage with Hamas, if needed. Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark believes that, while it might make sense to evacuate Gaza as construction begins, there are myriad questions that we don't have the answers to quite yet. 'Is Hamas going to be in charge? Do they want the U.S. troops in? Are Gazans going to leave or evacuate part of it? Who's going to take care of them? Who's going to give them food and so forth?' Clark asked Tuesday on 'CUOMO.' 'What happens when the first sniper kills an American soldier?' he added. Clark pointed to the lack of answers — and potential U.S. involvement in a major Middle East conflict — as concerning on a national level. 'It's not impossible, but it's not something you just wave your hand and say, 'Yeah, we're taking over. It's going to work,'' Clark explained. 'It may not work because you have to have strategic consent, resources and all the accompaniment to make it work. That doesn't come out of a press conference.' Senate confirms Pam Bondi to lead Justice Department Trump suggests ‘all’ Palestinians permanently resettle from Gaza The suggestion comes just hours after Trump first floated the idea that all 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza should be resettled elsewhere. In a Tuesday news conference, he said the Gaza Strip 'should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have … lived a miserable existence there,' referring to Palestinians. Trump suggested building enclaves for Palestinian Gaza residents in neighboring countries. He did not suggest the same for Israeli residents. Trump’s idea to clear Gaza is a real estate grab: Congressman But where would they go? Ortagus told NewsNation that one potential location is Saudi Arabia, which she said has 'one of the best deradicalization programs' in the world. Regarding Palestinians moving back to Gaza once it is rebuilt, Trump said he envisioned Gaza becoming an 'international, unbelievable place' that includes Palestinians, though he did not provide a timeline for their return. Gaza Ceasefire Talks Delayed Trump's 'takeover' idea comes as Netanyahu delayed talks for the second phase of a permanent ceasefire, which were scheduled to begin Monday. President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas days before leaving office. Though it occurred during the Biden administration, Trump has said he deserves credit for making the deal happen. Netanyahu told reporters Tuesday he believes the 47th president provided 'powerful leadership' but did not say who deserved credit for the deal. Trump has not been confident about the long-term prospects for the truce. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters Monday.

Israel to be 'very tough' in ceasefire negotiations: Consul	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, with discussions including the ceasefire deal with Hamas and the broader security situation in the Middle East. Ofir Akunis, the consul general of Israel in New York, joined NewsNation to discuss the meeting and Trump's recent executive order that puts 'maximum pressure' on Iran. 'That's the right thing to do, to put Iran under pressure, to put Hamas under pressure, to put Hezbollah, to put the hoodies under pressure, and not to be naive and to think that if you will only negotiate with them, be nice with them, and reflect a weakness in front of them, something good will happen to the world,' Akunis said. Trump warns he left instructions to ‘obliterate’ Iran if he is assassinated Akunis said Iran poses a threat not just to Israel and other nations in the region but to the larger world, including the U.S. 'So they are, Iran, it's the heart of the 'Axis of Evil,' and they're using their proxies to attack the Western world,' he said. Akunis said Israel is committing to getting hostages back from Hamas. A ceasefire deal negotiated by the Biden administration set the stage for the return of hostages, followed by talks that would lead to a permanent ceasefire. That framework included Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Since taking office, Trump has suggested Palestinians should be 'cleaned out' of Gaza, leaving the area open for development. Akunis referred to negotiating with Hamas as negotiating with the devil and said the group must be driven out of Gaza. 'We must be very tough during the negotiations about the second phase,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israel-tough-ceasefire-negotiations/	2025-02-04T14:15:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25030457994335.jpg?w=900
Congress puts hold on Trump's $1 billion arms sale to Israel	Congress has placed a hold on a $1 billion arms sale package for Israel that was readied alongside President Trump welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington on Tuesday. Two congressional aides told The Hill on Tuesday that a hold has been placed on the arms sale package. President Trump to host Israeli PM at the White House The four top lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have the power to individually block arms sales orders when over a certain dollar amount. Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to visit Trump since he returned to the White House, generally a recognition of the importance of the relationship. A hold on arms sales to Israel signals a major flouting of convention, where U.S. military support for Israel is viewed as an investment in American national security. The Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. officials, reported that the $1 billion arms sale package includes 4,700 1,000-pound bombs, worth more than $700 million, as well as armored bulldozers built by Caterpillar, worth more than $300 million. The hold comes as Democrats have seethed over Trump’s actions a little over two weeks into his presidency. They pushed back on an initial federal aid freeze; are condemning a halt on U.S. foreign assistance; raising alarm over the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and opposing the president’s threats of tariffs on America’s neighbors Mexico and Canada, to name a few of the high-profile conflicts. But there are few options for Democrats to push back on Trump’s agenda absent Republican allies, given the GOP's majorities in the House and Senate. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have announced they will delay and stall Trump’s State Department nominees until the administration retreats on its efforts to break up USAID. Trump could try to override the Israeli arms sale hold. In 2019, he issued an emergency declaration to push through more than $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval. The Republican-controlled Senate at the time voted to block the sale. Arms sales to Israel are historically bipartisan, even as Democrats have increasingly raised alarm over Israel’s war conduct in the Gaza Strip and Netanyahu’s policies toward Palestinians. Amid Israel’s war against Hamas in response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, an estimated half of the nearly 47,000 Palestinian casualties are women, children and the elderly. Nearly all of the 2 million Gaza residents require humanitarian assistance, and 90 percent are displaced among widespread destruction. Still, Democrats in positions of power did not stand in the way of President Biden sending weapons to Israel or green-lighting arms sales. In June, Biden moved forward on a $18 billion arms sale to Israel. Netanyahu will meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday and is expected to visit Capitol Hill and meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. The U.S. provides about $38 billion to Israel as part of a 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU). That amounts to $3.3 billion in foreign military financing — generally a credit for Israel to purchase weapons systems in the U.S., and $500 million for missile defense programs annually. The MOU runs through fiscal 2028 and will need to be renewed in 2029.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/israel-arms-sale-congress/	2025-02-04T13:37:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump-Israel_040524_PhotoSplit_AP.png?w=900
Trump: ‘All’ Palestinians should be permanently resettled elsewhe...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday, making him the first head of state to visit the White House in Trump's second term. The pair of world leaders addressed press on Tuesday. Trump said, regarding the Middle East's future, 'we have the right man, we have the right leader' in Netanyahu. 'I think we have a combination that is unbeatable,' he added. Trump said 'I don't think people should be going back to Gaza,' adding that 'if they had an alternative,' no one would want to return. When asked how many Palestinians should be resettled, Trump said 'all of them.' 'It's all death in Gaza,' Trump said, adding that an ideal path forward lies in getting 'a beautiful area to resettle people permanently.' Trump warns ‘no guarantees’ fragile peace in Gaza will hold Gaza Ceasefire Negotiations for the second phase of a permanent ceasefire were supposed to start Monday, but Netanyahu delayed talks until he personally met with Trump. President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas days before leaving office. Though it occurred during the Biden administration, Trump has said he deserves credit for making the deal happen. Netanyahu told reporters on Tuesday he believes the 47th president provided 'powerful leadership,' but did not say who deserved credit for the deal. Trump has not been confident about the long-term prospects for the truce. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters on Monday. The deal includes multiple phases. Phase one will include the release of 33 Israeli hostages, including all women, children and men over 50 years old. Under the deal, a permanent ceasefire would come with both sides agreeing on who will be in power when the fighting ends. Many families of the hostages who were taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 are concerned that the ceasefire deal could fall apart over contention about Gaza’s new leadership. Both Netanyahu and Trump say Hamas cannot remain in power. Hamas frees 4 female Israeli soldiers in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners as ceasefire holds Another tenant of that ceasefire deal is the total withdrawal of Israeli troops, which Netanyahu has been staunchly against. That leaves much to be hammered out before the deal can reach phase two. Netanyahu has already held meetings with national security adviser Michael Waltz and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle Eastern envoy. Trump is scheduled to meet one-on-one with Netanyahu before more meetings with both of their extended cabinet members. The two are expected to keep the focus on keeping the ceasefires intact in both Lebanon and Gaza.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-host-israeli-pm-white-house/	2025-02-04T12:54:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a1b79ba1e1d6.92732274.jpeg?w=900
Cartel war escalates, creates new threat at southern border	(NewsNation) — A violent new threat has emerged at the southern border as cartels weaponize drones as bombs to attack rival cartels. Border agents are also under threat, with many at the border feeling unsettled by current events as cartels enter desperation mode. They are a $13 billion-a-year industry smuggling people into the country, but their efforts are being stifled by President Donald Trump's border security. White House begins migrant flights to Guantánamo Bay NewsNation obtained video of these weaponized cartel drones dropping a bomb on what is believed to be a rival cartel. NewsNation believes this to be a cartel-on-cartel crime about four hours south of the Rio Grande Valley in Mexico. Border agents tell NewsNation they have always faced threats from Mexico, but the violence is escalating with these bomb-wielding drones, and the agency is taking it seriously enough to prompt warnings about them. US Coast Guard stops ocean smuggling operations off San Diego A memo went out agencywide among U.S. Customs Border and Patrol following NewsNation's reporting on the drones. Texas Department of Public Safety Lieutenant Chris Olivarez told Blake Burman on 'The Hill' that this latest warning shows what these criminal organizations have access to.

Senate panel advances Tulsi Gabbard nomination for DNI	The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday advanced Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to become the next director of national intelligence (DNI), putting her in position to get confirmed by the full chamber after key senators threw their support behind her. The 9-8 vote was along party lines. It puts Gabbard only days away from being considered on the Senate floor after a roller-coaster process. 'The Intelligence Committee just voted for Tulsi Gabbard's nomination to be the Director of National Intelligence favorably to the full United States Senate,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told reporters after the closed-door vote. 'We look forward to her confirmation and working with her to keep America safe,' he added. The vote took place only hours after Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), a key GOP swing vote, announced that he would support her. During Thursday’s confirmation hearing, the Indiana Republican was visibly frustrated after Gabbard refused to call Edward Snowden, the former contractor-turned-leaker who fled the U.S., a traitor on multiple occasions. But on Tuesday Young said he secured a number of commitments from Gabbard regarding deterring Snowden-like whistleblowers, not pardoning Snowden and working to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 'I appreciate Tulsi Gabbard’s engagement with me on a variety of issues to ensure that our intelligence professionals will be supported and policymakers will receive unbiased information under her leadership,' Young posted on the social platform X alongside a letter Gabbard sent him of commitments in order to win his vote. 'I have done what the Framers envisioned for senators to do: use the consultative process to seek firm commitments, in this case commitments that will advance our national security, which is my top priority as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer,' he continued. 'Having now secured these commitments, I will support Tulsi’s nomination and look forward to working with her to protect our national security.' Gabbard had secured another big win on Monday as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that she would back her in the committee vote. Collins and Young had been seen as pivotal votes in committee, and winning over the pair likely also greases the skids for the former congresswoman on the Senate floor, where she can only afford to lose three Republicans. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is considered a likely 'no' vote, while Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) indicated following the hearing that he had more 'questions' about her confirmation. From the moment Trump announced Gabbard as his nominee to be DNI, questions have cropped up about her past views and statements. Those include her 2017 meeting with then-Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, which occurred as he was accused of using chemical weapons on his own people, as well as her stance on Russia given multiple comments she made about the war with Ukraine that were considered sympathetic to Moscow and were echoed on Russian state TV. Gabbard also faced numerous questions over her past defense of Snowden. A key moment during Gabbard’s hearing came when Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) asked whether she views Snowden as a 'traitor,' advising her that members of the Intelligence panel would feel a lot better about her nomination if she would do so. Instead, Gabbard sidestepped two questions about whether Snowden betrayed the nation, telling lawmakers she is 'focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again,' referring to Snowden’s theft of secret documents. Lankford said it should have been an 'easy question' to say it’s 'universally accepted when you steal a million pages of top-secret documents and you hand it to the Russians, that’s a traitorous act.' Privately, Gabbard had sought to assuage senators about her views on Snowden, saying she didn’t feel he had the proper channels to blow the whistle. The Gabbard move also comes about a week and a half after senators confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who lost three votes on the floor but got the greenlight thanks to a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Vance.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-panel-advances-tulsi-gabbard-nomination-for-dni/	2025-02-04T11:38:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/IMG_5427.jpeg?w=900
Trump oil tariffs expected to raise price at the pump	(The Hill) - President Trump’s tariff on Canadian oil is expected to raise prices at the pump for U.S. consumers, if it takes effect as planned after a 30-day delay. Analysts told The Hill that the 10 percent tariff set to be imposed under an executive order Trump signed over the weekend would lead to a pricing bump, though it ​would not be evenly distributed. According to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, consumers in the Midwest, Rockies and New England would see the greatest impacts. What is a sovereign wealth fund, and which countries have them? 'New England relies on refined products from Canada,' said De Haan, referring to products like gasoline that are processed at Canadian refineries. 'Refineries in the Midwest, Great Lakes and Rockies rely more on the Canadian crude oil for sourcing oil for their refineries,' he added. Ultimately, De Haan said, drivers in New England could see gasoline prices rise by 15 cents to 25 cents per gallon. In the Midwest, Rockies and Great Lakes, he predicted a hike of between 5 cents and 20 cents per gallon. He noted that people in New England could also see a price bump for home heating oil of 20 cents to 30 cents per gallon. Trump is planning to institute the tariff on Canadian oil and a larger 25 percent tariff on other goods from America’s northern neighbor. However, he announced Monday evening that the tariffs, which would have taken effect at midnight, will be paused for 30 days to see whether the U.S. and Canada can reach a ' final Economic deal.' He said that in the meantime, Canada has agreed to secure the U.S.-Canada border and try to prevent fentanyl from entering the U.S. Canada is the top supplier of U.S. oil imports, providing 60 percent of the nation’s crude oil imports last year. As of Monday, the average U.S. gasoline price stood at $3.01 per gallon. Oil produced domestically or from other countries couldn't simply be substituted for those imports because refineries in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains are currently set up to receive Canadian oil via pipeline. What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them? 'Canadian crude and the Midwest refinery system were made for each other. Neither one of them really has substitutes or somewhere else to go,' said Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’s energy security and climate change program. 'Our refineries need heavy oil to go with light oil that we mostly produce here at home,' he said. The refineries in question are set up to process the thicker 'heavy' oil — which can be sourced from Canadian oil sands. Seigle gave a more conservative estimate for impacts to the Midwest, a rise of between 7 cents and 15 cents per gallon in what he predicts will be the hardest-hit region. Here are some goods in the crosshairs of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China De Haan said it would be very difficult and expensive to rejigger existing infrastructure to suit the tariffs. 'It's like saying, can existing highway, you know, suddenly move and shift?' he said. De Haan warned that the energy tariffs could also have broader reaching impacts on the economy. '25 percent tariffs to your No. 1 trading partner, yeah, they could sink the economy,' he said. 'It could absolutely undermine the U.S. and Canadian economies at the same time.' Ironically, fuel prices could go back down in the case of an economic slump, as people will want to travel less and buy fewer items. 'Tariffs on gasoline could be offset … if we start to see a recession or a slowdown,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trump-oil-tariffs-gas-prices/	2025-02-04T10:57:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Gas-prices_020425_AP_Jenny-Kane-e1738667433611.jpg?w=900
Federal employees accepting buyouts 'rapidly growing'	(NewsNation) — The number of federal employees who have agreed to accept buyouts to leave their jobs is 'rapidly growing,' and officials with the Office of Personnel Management expect that number to spike significantly as this week's deadline for a final decision approaches, NewsNation has learned. The Trump administration announced last week that employees who leave their jobs by a Feb. 6 deadline would receive eight months of salary. A spokesperson for OPM told NewsNation that the agency expects to see the largest surge in the number of workers accepting the buyout within 24 to 48 hours before the Thursday deadline. Trump to issue executive order relating to ICC sanctions Bloomberg reported Tuesday that 20,000 employees, which represent about 1% of the federal workforce, have signed up for the deferred resignations. Although the number is growing each day, the OPM spokesperson told NewsNation that the 20,000 figure is not up to date and that the agency expects the largest spike of resignations to come in the next two days. The buyout is being offered in an effort to shrink the government. The report indicated that President Donald Trump and billionaire CEO Elon Musk, who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), hope that as much as 10% of the federal workforce accepts the buyout. There are currently 2.3 million civilian federal employees, the report indicated. However, more than half of those employees who hold roles in civilian defense and intelligence employees, as well as law enforcement personnel and postal workers, are not eligible for the buyout, the Bloomberg report indicated. The report indicated that the federal buyout is different than those seen in the private sector. Workers who leave their jobs are free to take other jobs as long as they do not conflict with their current federal employees. They are also not permitted to sue the government over the deferred resignation. The federal government employed more than 3 million people as of November last year, which accounted for nearly 1.9% of the nation’s entire civilian workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. The average tenure for a federal employee is nearly 12 years, according to a Pew analysis of data from OPM.

DOGE employees identified, prosecution possible: US Attorney	(NewsNation) — After Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees were identified on X, those responsible could be prosecuted. Edward R. Martin Jr., U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, issued a statement Monday saying that he had evidence people 'committed acts that appear to violate the law in targeting' employees of DOGE. The statement added: 'We are in contact with FBI and other law-enforcement partners to proceed rapidly. We also have our prosecutors preparing.' Trump to issue executive order relating to ICC sanctions On Monday, Elon Musk quote tweeted screenshots of Reddit posts that fitted the description of Martin's statement, saying 'They have broken the law.' Musk also reposted a tweet reporting threats against the DOGE team on Tuesday, adding: 'Threatening or encouraging murder is a crime. Those who do so will go to prison.' It followed a public letter Martin wrote to Musk on Monday morning, where he insisted, 'We must keep all our American government employees safe,' offering his and his staff's services to protect those employees by pursuing legal action where necessary.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-employees-id-prosecution-possible/	2025-02-04T10:21:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
NTSB gives update on investigation into DC plane crash	(NewsNation) — The National Transportation Safety Board is giving an update on the investigation into a collision between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people last week. The crash happened after a Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers collided with an American Airlines plane that was approaching a landing at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. Those on board the plane included members of the U.S. and Russian figure skating communities. Of those on board, 55 have been positively identified so far. Crews began pulling wreckage from the Potomac River on Monday and began work to recover and identify additional victims. What is a sovereign wealth fund, and which countries have them? The cause of the crash is under investigation, with officials discouraging speculation even as President Donald Trump publicly blamed diversity, equity and inclusion efforts for the crash despite there being no evidence that DEI played any role. It's believed FAA staffing in the air traffic control tower was lower than ideal, and there is conflicting information about the helicopter's altitude before the crash. The crew did have night-vision goggles on board, but it is not known if they were wearing them at the time. Questions have also been raised about an increase in traffic into Reagan Airport even as the FAA has struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers. There have also been questions about why a helicopter was being allowed to operate in such close proximity to passenger planes. The FAA instituted temporary airspace restrictions around the airport following the crash. It is not clear how long they will remain in place.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ntsb-update-investigation-dc-crash/	2025-02-04T07:46:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196783522.jpg?w=900
Trump to issue executive order relating to ICC sanctions	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will issue an executive order on Tuesday relating to International Criminal Court (ICC) sanctions, a White House official told NewsNation. Trump is set to sign multiple executive orders today. The ICC has been bracing for these measures and reportedly paid salaries three months in advance to shield some of its staff. China counters with tariffs on US products Last month, the House of Representatives voted to punish the court for issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister regarding the war in Gaza. The move could have some tie to the Israeli prime minister visiting the White House later today.

RFK Jr. faces first vote for Health and Human Services secretary	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Senate Finance Committee will vote Tuesday on whether to send Robert F. Kennedy's nomination for secretary of Health and Human Services to the floor. Kennedy's confirmation faces uncertainty. Key senators to watch include U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a doctor who pressed Kennedy over his views on vaccines during confirmation hearings last week. In the hearings, Cassidy repeatedly asked Kennedy whether he would 'reassure mothers unequivocally and without qualification' that the measles and hepatitis B vaccines do not cause autism. Kennedy did not directly answer the question and instead replied, 'If the data is there, I will absolutely do that.' What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? Multiple studies by health organizations and medical experts have debunked claims about a connection between autism and vaccines. Cassidy told Kennedy his past remarks 'undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments' concerns him. On Monday evening, Cassidy said he had 'very cordial' conversations with Kennedy over the weekend but was 'still working through' the vote. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are also seen as potential 'no' votes because they voted against President Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. While Kennedy has sparked concerns about his record of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines, he has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, asserting he is not anti-vaccine and promising not to 'take away' shots if confirmed. Kennedy needs support from all but three Republicans if Democrats oppose him.

China counters with tariffs on US products	BEIJING (AP) — China countered President Donald Trump's across-the-board tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs on select U.S. imports Tuesday, as well as announcing an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures. U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday before Trump agreed to a 30-day pause as the two countries acted to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trump planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days. The Chinese response was 'measured,' said John Gong, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. 'I don’t think they want the trade war escalating,' he said. 'And they see this example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.' US businesses brace for Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to drive up costs This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind. This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter, with the government announcing a slew of measures that cut across different sectors of the economy, from energy to individual U.S. companies. Counter tariffs China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday. 'The U.S.’s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,' the State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement. 'It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.' China vows ‘countermeasures’ in response to Trump tariffs The impact on U.S. exports may be limited. Though the U.S. is the biggest exporter of liquid natural gas globally, it does not export much to China. In 2023, the U.S. exported 173,247 million cubic feet of LNG to China, representing about 2.3% of total natural gas exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. China imported only about 700,000 cars overall last year, and the leading importers are from Europe and Japan, said Bill Russo, the founder of the Automobility Limited consultancy in Shanghai. Further export controls on critical minerals China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they are essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption. The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium. 'They have a much more developed export control regime,' Philip Luck, an economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former State Department official, said at a panel discussion on Monday. 'We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others,' he said. 'So … they could put some significant harm on our economy.' US companies also impacted In addition, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement did not mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Trump’s 10% tariffs on China were to take effect. It is unclear how the probe will affect Google’s operations. The company has long faced complaints from Chinese smartphone makers over its business practices surrounding the Android operating system, Gong said. Otherwise, Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company. Google did not immediately comment. What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them? The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an unreliable entities list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, which is a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing could bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over 'improper Xinjiang-related behavior' after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton. The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute. However, the world is braced for further impact. 'A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,' Dover said.

Trump warns 'no guarantees' fragile peace in Gaza will hold	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end. Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters on Monday. The leaders' talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal and concerns about Iran's nuclear program, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda. Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next Netanyahu's arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump's second term comes as the prime minister's popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a 'witch hunt.' Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu’s standing. It's Netanyahu's first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defense minister and Hamas’ slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority over its citizens or territory. Netanyahu and Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu said in statement that the meeting with Witkoff and U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Waltz was 'positive and friendly.' The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel’s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week. Aid is surging into Gaza under the ceasefire. Is it helping? Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu’s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn’t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections. Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces’ full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may 'have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.' 'The president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That's what he got,' Resnick said. 'He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.' Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement. Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages — including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers — are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire? 'I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,' said Zangauker, who traveled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. 'We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.' Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza. Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu's desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. 'This push by Trump doesn’t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,' Telhami said. 'It's hard to see the Saudis going along with it.' Netanyahu on Monday met with Trump’s pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel. The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran's air defenses. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran's nuclear program. 'This is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,' said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. 'What’s at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.' Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

It's wide open': Journalist details US-Canada border concerns	(NewsNation) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday agreed to border security measures with President Donald Trump in exchange for a 30-day pause on sweeping tariffs. Canada will spend $1.3 billion to reinforce the U.S.-Canadian border with new helicopters, technology and personnel to target fentanyl trafficking and other crimes. The Canadian border, including what and who crosses it, is a problemover which journalist and 'No BS Newshour' host Charlie LeDuff has long raised red flags. 'I own it. You called me months ago saying you need to talk about what's happening up there,' NewsNation's Chris Cuomo said Monday, imploring LeDuff to share what he's learned in his investigation. Rubio says El Salvador offers to accept deportees from US of any nationality, including Americans LeDuff warned the U.S.-Canada border poses a threat to national security, one that is often overlooked due to the louder calls for change at the southern border. 'Canada and United States have a 5,500 mile border,' LeDuff said on 'CUOMO.' 'The Mexican border's 2,000 miles. In Mexico, on that border, 10 times the Border Patrol agents' as in the north. LeDuff told NewsNation that, in the last four years, around 500 people on the terror watch list crossed into the U.S. from the Mexico border. Those crossing from Canada totaled nearly 1,000, he said. 'It's not a good deal up there, man,' he said. 'It's wide open.' Trump’s tariff delay is ‘opportunity’ for Mexico: Ex-DEA chief LeDuff couldn't speak to Canada's fentanyl flow for certain, telling NewsNation that the border's porosity lends itself to unclear numbers. 'As you saw today, Trudeau bent. When you're throwing $1.5 billion for a fentanyl czar, you know something's up,' he said. Cartels make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona. Fentanyl can also be made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but apparently that's happening to a much lesser extent. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds (19.5 kilograms) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds (9,570 kilograms) at the Mexican border.

What is a sovereign wealth fund, and which countries have them?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. to start developing an American sovereign wealth fund and said it could be used to profit from TikTok. Trump's new order begins the process of creating a sovereign wealth fund, which is aimed at generating more money for the government by investing in assets like stocks, bonds and real estate. 'We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters Monday. Specific details were scarce, but Trump suggested the fund could be a way for the U.S. to buy the social media platform TikTok. Here's what to know about sovereign wealth funds and why Trump wants one. Trump orders creation of US sovereign wealth fund, says it could own part of TikTok What is a sovereign wealth fund? Sovereign wealth funds, SWFs, are investment vehicles owned by countries. Typically, they're set up to manage state-owned assets, according to the Center for Global Development (CGD), a Washington-based think tank. Different SWFs have different financial, economic and political objectives. Some function like a savings fund — nest eggs where current money gets invested for future generations. Those funds have decadeslong investment horizons and are often set up by commodity-rich countries to save a portion of their resource wealth for later on, according to The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. Other sovereign wealth funds are intended as stabilization funds, which governments can draw on to smooth the budget. Many funds have multiple objectives, mixing stabilization, savings and development. Trump didn't offer many details on the fund's strategic focus or where the money to start it would come from. Sovereign wealth funds typically start with a wealth surplus, but given the United States budget track record, relying on hypothetical future surpluses is unrealistic, experts at the CGD wrote in a recent report. What does it mean for TikTok? Trump said TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, was an example of what he could put in a new U.S. sovereign wealth fund. 'We might put that in the sovereign wealth fund, whatever we make, or we do a partnership with very wealthy people, a lot of options,' he said of TikTok. 'But we could put that as an example in the fund. We have a lot of other things that we could put in the fund.' As one of his first acts in office, Trump directed his Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April. The president has said he's looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of the popular social media platform. In theory, a sovereign wealth fund is one way the U.S. could acquire a stake in the company without nationalizing it. Trump’s executive order gives TikTok a reprieve. What happens next? Which countries have sovereign wealth funds? There are over 90 sovereign wealth funds around the world that manage over $8 trillion in assets, according to The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. Norway's $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund is the largest. The fund invests revenues from the nation's oil and gas production and is one of the world's largest investors, owning on average 1.5% of all stocks listed worldwide, according to Reuters. The Norwegian fund's current value corresponds to about $321,000 for every man, woman and child living in the country of 5.6 million people. Other countries with major sovereign wealth funds include China, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Trump predicted that the U.S. could eventually top Saudi Arabia’s fund size. 'Eventually, we’ll catch it,' he promised in the Oval Office on Monday. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, added: 'The extraordinary size and scale of the U.S government and the business it does with companies should create value for American citizens.' Which US states have sovereign wealth funds? The U.S. already has 21 sovereign wealth funds at the state level, according to the CGD. The largest ones are based in Alaska, New Mexico and Texas and are funded through the proceeds of oil, gas and mineral revenue. Those funds are primarily used to pay for in-state programs like education and state government operations, CGD said.

U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports paused with border security deal...	(NewsNation) — An impending trade war between Canada and the United States has been temporarily averted, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday after his country agreed to border-security measures with the United States. Trudeau and President Trump talked by phone at 3 p.m. Eastern time, and afterward Trudeau said Canada will spend $1.3 billion to reinforce the U.S.-Canadian border with new helicopters, technology and personnel to target fentanyl trafficking, among several measures. 'In addition, Canada is making new commitments to appoint a Fentanyl Czar, we will list cartels as terrorists, ensure 24/7 eyes on the border, launch a Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering,' Trudeau said on X. 'I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl and we will be backing it with $200 million.' The news of the agreement came hours after Mexico agreed to a similar plan to appease the Trump administration on border security to stave off threatened U.S. tariffs on imports. As with Mexico, the U.S.-Canada truce is good for 30 days. Canada had begun preparing a host of retaliatory tariffs of its own on U.S. imports, to counter the 25% tariffs Trump had threatened on many of its goods entering the United States (Canadian oil would have been subjected to smaller, 10% tariffs). Trump announces pause on Mexico tariffs after striking deal More than 60% of Canada's production is exported to the U.S., and 60% of the oil that the US imports comes from Canada, which could have meant higher prices at the pump, 30 to possibly 70 cents a gallon. Trump has been very clear that he intends to continue to use his strategy of tariffs to try and broker the kind of deals that he's looking for on some of these issues, particularly immigration. The White House is confident in that strategy because 77% of exports from Mexico go to the United States. For Canada, 75% of its exports come to the U.S. The U.S. relies on the Mexican and Canadian markets but to a much lower percentage (Mexico, 11% and Canada, 12%). Nevertheless, the President has acknowledged that there could be some pain that some consumers would be feeling if these tariffs do come to fruition. The Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs, if implemented on paper as they are right now, would shrink economic output by 0.4% and increase taxes by $1.2 trillion from 2025 to 2034 which would come to about $830 in taxes per US household in 2025. Canadian provinces ban US alcohol in retaliation for tariffs Following Trump's criticism of the European Union and the threat of tariffs against the body, European leaders have rebuked it and called for unity. 'I think that we have to do everything to avoid this totally unnecessary and stupid tariff wars or trade wars,' Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters on Monday. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said: 'First of all, we have to should stay united. No matter (if we are) talking about economic tariffs, we are talking about Greenland or other issues, we have to stay united.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-speaking-trudeau-canada-tariffs/	2025-02-03T12:31:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676e04041219b3.84887230.jpeg?w=900
Elon Musk-led DOGE effectively shuts down USAID	(NewsNation) —President Trump’s new DOGE task force is causing major shakeups within the federal government with the Elon Musk-run agency having effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development. The future of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) continues to remain uncertain as the Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has taken control of the agency's money, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. Tech billionaire Elon Musk who runs DOGE announced that President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency down. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? 'USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die,' Musk posted to the social platform X, which he owns. USAID is in charge of administering U.S. humanitarian aid around the world. The agency employs around 10,000 people and has an annual budget of around $30 billion. Staffers of the agency were instructed to stay out of the agency’s Washington headquarters, and yellow police tape and officers blocked the agency’s lobby on Monday. USAID workers also said more than 600 additional employees had reported being locked out of the aid agency’s computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that 'at the direction of Agency leadership' the headquarters building 'will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.' Two top security chiefs at USAID were put on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk’s government inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. The major move has ruffled several feathers with Democratic lawmakers calling the DOGE takeover a major national security mistake. They stressed that aid from the agency is not charity but international money that goes to countries that the U.S. considers allies. The aid also provides a bulwark in defense of adversaries, they added. But Republicans say only about 10 to 20% of all USAID money goes to work on the ground, adding that much of the budget is inflated. What is USAID? Explaining the US foreign aid agency and why Trump and Musk want to end it Legal challenges to DOGE’s shutdown are likely as many Democrats contend that it's illegal for the president or anyone else to unilaterally shut down a government agency without congressional approval. Congress controls federal money and budgets. DOGE has become an x-factor in the federal government in the short time of its existence. The task force also obtained unrestricted access to the Treasury Department's highly sensitive payment systems, which pays out tax refunds, government contracts and Social Security and Medicare benefits.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-doge-shuts-down-usaid/	2025-02-03T12:11:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25031110042232.jpg?w=900
What is DOGE, and what’s it doing?	(NewsNation) — The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) created under President Donald Trump has reportedly gained access to sensitive and classified data, leading to questions surrounding what the nongovernment task force can and will do. What is DOGE? Under an executive order, Trump created a nongovernment agency called DOGE that he said would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. On his first day, Trump renamed the 'U.S. Digital Service' as the 'U.S. DOGE Service.' It further directed that DOGE be established within the Executive Office of the President. What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it down? Making the new entity part of the government could allow it to more easily access information across agencies. It can also potentially do much of its work behind closed doors, even as some regulations on governmental disclosure will persist. Trump originally tapped tech billionaire Elon Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead DOGE after his reelection last year. Since then, Ramaswamy left DOGE. What is Elon Musk's role in DOGE? Musk is the sole head of DOGE after Ramaswamy, who is planning to run for Ohio governor in two years, left. The new administration hasn’t yet said if Musk will formally join the government as part of his work on DOGE. Musk had pledged to cut $2 trillion in government spending and restructure federal agencies with 'mass headcount reductions across the federal bureaucracy.' The idea for DOGE also appeared to have come from Musk, who discussed the need for a 'government efficiency commission' while campaigning alongside Trump. USAID leaders escorted out of building after blocking DOGE access to secure systems While it’s not completely clear what Musk has in store for DOGE, he has provided some clues. 'Incentives matter. There should be rewards for wise spending, but those who waste taxpayer funds cannot be allowed to keep doing so without consequences,' Musk posted on X of DOGE in November, hinting that cuts will be imminent under his guidance. FILE - President-elect Donald Trump listens to Elon Musk as he arrives to watch SpaceX's mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Nov. 19, 2024. (Brandon Bell/Pool via AP, File) What are the limits of DOGE? Because DOGE is not an actual government agency, its power will be limited. While it can make recommendations on budget cuts, it can’t actually do that without congressional approval. 'They don’t have any authorities,' Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who’s president of the American Action Forum, told Politico. 'On my most cynical days, I think they’re just a think tank, and I run a think tank. I know how little power I have.' While Trump may be eager to carry out DOGE’s agenda, he will also need to work through Congress on the budgets as it makes decisions on federal funds. Elon Musk’s DOGE sued as Trump takes office: Report 'Because of DOGE’s inability to implement policy on its own, the leaders’ plan relies heavily on the president-elect who invited them to serve,' reported The Atlantic. However, Trump’s pick to run the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, has argued that Trump has the power of impoundment, the authority to refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress. The impoundment argument will likely be challenged in court, the outlet writes, but if the courts rule in Trump’s favor, DOGE may get the power it seeks. What has DOGE done so far? DOGE has already gained access to sensitive data from at least two government agencies. The task force got access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems, on Friday, The Associated Press reported. The news came after Treasury acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk resigned his position after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data. Musk on Saturday responded to a post on his social media platform X about the departure of Lebryk: 'The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.' He did not provide proof of this claim.

DOGE has also gained access to classified information with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Two top security chiefs at USAID are on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk’s government inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. DOGE eventually gained access Saturday to the aid agency’s classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk’s DOGE crew lacked high enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials — John Voorhees and deputy Brian McGill — believed themselves legally obligated to deny access. Lawsuits DOGE is facing DOGE was slapped with several lawsuits on Trump’s first day in office from groups saying the new nongovernment entity must abide by the same transparency as federal agencies. The suits were brought by progressive consumer watchdog Public Citizen, the American Public Health Association and National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm. The groups argue that DOGE should be considered a federal advisory committee, which falls under regulations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. DOGE faces early bumps with lawsuits and leadership shake-up The plaintiffs all argue that DOGE is covered by FACA, which mandates that federal advisory committees meet transparency requirements, such as having a charter, fairly balanced membership and a designated federal officer to call meetings. 'The suit challenges DOGE’s operating without complying with federal transparency laws,' the groups said in a statement. 'DOGE’s stacked membership, far from being fairly balanced, reveals that only one viewpoint is represented: that of ‘small-government crusaders’ with backgrounds in either the tech industry or Republican politics. This shortcoming renders DOGE’s membership imbalanced and unfit for the function it has been directed to perform,' the National Security Counselors’ lawsuit states.

Crews begin work to recover wreckage from DC plane crash	(NewsNation) — Following a plane crash in Washington, D.C., last week, divers and salvage workers are planning to remove the wreckage and recover the remaining bodies from the Potomac River. The mid-air collision between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter left 67 people dead. Authorities have identified 55 of the people who have been killed so far. There are 12 victims still left in the river, though officials have said they are confident they will be able to recover remains from all those who were killed in the crash. Black box recovered in Philadelphia medical transport jet crash: NTSB Salvage crews are preparing to lift the fuselage of the plane out of the water, which is where they believe the remaining 12 victims are located. Divers have not been able to recover the bodies with the wreckage still in the water. An investigation into the crash is ongoing, with many questions remaining about the cause of the crash, including why helicopters were allowed to fly in the same space where planes were landing. The FAA has put a no-fly zone around the Reagan National Airport, but it's not clear how long it will last. Trump announces pause on Mexico tariffs after striking deal Data from the crash shows conflicting altitude readings regarding how high the helicopter was flying. Information from the black box shows the Black Hawk helicopter at 325 feet, while readings from the control tower showed 200 feet. The pilots of the helicopter did have night vision goggles, but it's not clear if they were wearing them at the time of the crash.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/crews-work-recover-wreckage/	2025-02-03T10:05:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196783525.jpg?w=900
What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is following through on his campaign promise to impose tariffs on America's top trading partners — a decision that could come at a high cost to U.S. consumers. Trump said Friday he would place a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% additional tariff on all imports from China. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower, 10% tariff. The president wrote on Truth Social that the tariffs are meant to end 'the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA' with regard to 'TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS.' The tariffs against Mexico have since been paused after Trump said he struck a deal with President Claudia Sheinbaum to supply 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border. What does the US import from Mexico, China and Canada? Nevertheless, Trump has acknowledged American consumers could bear some of the cost from the tariffs. 'We may have short-term, a little pain, and people understand that,' Trump told reporters on Sunday. Here's what to know about tariffs and how they could impact your wallet: What are tariffs, and how do they work? Tariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries. They are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. So, a 25% tariff on a $4 good shipped from Canada or Mexico would face an additional $1 charge. When companies import goods from abroad, they pay the tariffs to the U.S. government. However, economists warn those costs eventually get passed on to American consumers through higher prices. Who pays for tariffs? Companies — importers — pay tariffs on goods from abroad, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. If that sounds counterproductive, many economists argue that it is. When companies face higher costs, consumers usually end up footing the bill. For example, Trump imposed a tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018. Researchers estimate the price of washing machines increased by around 12%, about $86 per unit. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates Trump’s tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power. What executive orders has President Donald Trump signed? Even Trump has acknowledged Americans could feel 'some pain' from the emerging trade war. 'WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.' While companies pay tariffs, they can indeed hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies could cut prices to offset the tariffs to maintain their market share in the U.S. Why does Trump want tariffs? Trump argues tariffs are a way for the U.S. to strike back against foreign countries he sees as ripping off America in terms of 'TRADE, CRIME AND POISONOUS DRUGS.' The president defended his tariffs on Canada in a social media post on Sunday: 'We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true!' Trump went on to say Canada should become our 'Cherished 51st State.' Canada is the largest source of U.S. energy imports, and, last year, 60% of U.S. crude oil imports came from America's northern neighbor, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Previously, Trump said the tariffs against Canada and Mexico would remain until the countries crack down on the flow of drugs and 'illegal aliens' coming into the U.S. He said the additional tariff on China will stay until the country stops drugs, particularly fentanyl, from coming to the U.S. What impact do tariffs have on the economy? The effects of tariffs have long been debated, but economists on both sides of the aisle generally agree the costs tend to outweigh the benefits. Americans could see higher prices on a range of goods the U.S. imports from its top three trading partners, including vehicles, fruits and vegetables, smartphones, toys, laptops and even fuel at the pump. Tariffs can also lead to retaliation, with foreign countries responding by slapping their own taxes on goods from the U.S. After Trump's announcement, Canada immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs on American goods. Those who support tariffs often argue they prevent American businesses from offshoring jobs, but it’s not that simple. Workers who produce the specific goods covered by tariffs often benefit, but tariffs can also hurt workers in other industries that rely on those imports. In other words, a government tariff may be trading jobs in one industry at the expense of jobs in another. A 2024 paper by a group of top economists looked at Trump’s 2018 tariffs and found that 'import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment in newly-protected sectors.' However, retaliatory tariffs had 'clear negative impacts,' primarily in agriculture.

Trump announces pause on Mexico tariffs after striking deal	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump announced on Monday morning that he is immediately pausing tariffs on Mexico after reaching a deal with its President, Claudia Sheinbaum. In a post to Truth Social, Trump revealed he had spoken to Sheinbaum and negotiated assistance from Mexico to strengthen the United States' border sovereignty and deter drug trafficking into the country. 'It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,' Trump said. 'These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period [sic] during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it down? 'I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a 'deal' between our two Countries.' Sheinbaum also commented on the accord via X and during a press conference later Monday morning saying that it was a 'good conversation' with the president that lasted around 30 to 45 minutes. She confirmed that 10,000 members of Mexico's National Guard will be at the U.S. southern border, adding that the United States will work 'to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico' Sheinbaum added that efforts would begin today about security and trade between both nations It follows concessions made by Colombia following Trump's threat of tariffs on the South American country following a backflip on allowing deported migrants to return via U.S. aircraft.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-pause-mexico-tariffs-after-deal/	2025-02-03T07:54:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072190.jpg?w=900
JD Vance visiting East Palestine 2 years after train derailment	(NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance is in East Palestine, Ohio, on Monday, two years after a toxic train derailment scarred the town for generations. With Vance are Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, new Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted. Husted recently replaced the vice president in the Senate. After a train carrying chemicals derailed on the border of Pennsylvania and Ohio on Feb. 3, 2023, officials burned 116,000 gallons of vinyl chloride and forever changed the town. Vinyl chloride is still being detected in the area, and residents have been sick, reporting rashes and upper respiratory issues. What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it down? Independent testing found dioxins in Lori O’Connell’s home. Now, her husband has aggressive breast cancer. She said they were completely healthy before. O'Connell said Vance needs to realize 'these people still need help.' 'We still need health care monitoring. There are people who still want to be removed from this area, and they can't do it,' O’Connell said. 'Their hands are tied.' Tammy Tsai said she has recently had difficulty climbing stairs because of a 'lack of breath,' while her husband, Rick, says it’s been 'nothing but doctor's visits' and multiple diagnoses since the derailment. Ever since he tested East Palestine creeks for chemicals, Rick Tsai said, he’s had 'horrible acid reflux.' 'We’ve got people here on oxygen that were never on oxygen before,' Rick Tsai said on 'Morning in America.' 'So something is happening here.' A lawsuit was filed Monday containing the first seven wrongful death claims filed against Norfolk Southern railroad — including the death of a 1-week-old baby, The Associated Press reported. It alleges the railroad and its contractors botched the cleanup while officials at the EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on it and failed to adequately warn residents about the health risks. While the lawsuit provides some examples of lingering health effects families have seen, it doesn’t include details about the deaths, according to the AP. Temporary protection for about 350,000 Venezuelans to end: DHS A Norfolk Southern spokesperson declined to comment to the AP on the litigation. No public health emergency has been declared, and there is no long-term health monitoring plan. President Donald Trump has yet to sign a disaster declaration for East Palestine despite criticizing the Biden administration for not doing enough. The declaration is something NewsNation asked then-Sen. JD Vance about a year ago. 'I think it's shameful that (Biden) hasn't signed it,' Vance said then. 'I think the minute that Mike DeWine, the governor of the state asked for it, the president should have responded to it.' Rick Tsai said he hopes Vance talks to residents of East Palestine and not just the mayor. 'I pray it's not just the photo op,' Tsai said. '... I do believe that something tragic has happened here and is continuing to happen.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/ohio-train-derailment/jd-vance-east-palestine-2-years-later/	2025-02-03T06:26:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/6679e23c19ace5.21998976.jpeg?w=900
What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it dow...	(NewsNation) — The future of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is uncertain amid changes under the Trump administration and a freeze imposed on billions of dollars in foreign assistance. A week after President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day pause on foreign aid, two top USAID security officials were removed after refusing to grant representatives of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency access to restricted areas, the Washington Post reported Sunday. Congressional Democrats have challenged the administration, fearing Trump may dissolve USAID's independence and merge the agency with the State Department. Here’s a closer look at USAID and its mission: What is USAID? USAID provides humanitarian assistance to other countries impacted by conflicts and assists developing countries, primarily by dishing out funds to nongovernmental organizations, foreign governments and international organizations, or other U.S. agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The agency has a budget of over $50 billion. President John F. Kennedy created the organization at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. USAID today is at the center of U.S. challenges to the growing influence of China, which has a successful 'Belt and Road' foreign aid program of its own. Trump defends tariffs as Mexico, Canada and China plan retaliation Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries. Why do some want USAID dismantled? USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. Several federal websites have also gone dark in recent days. The Trump administration and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID’s humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency’s leadership and staff in Washington. Tech billionaire Elon Musk said on X that he believes USAID is a 'criminal organization' that should 'die.' Musk was responding to the news that senior officials at USAID physically attempted to block people from Musk’s new department from having access to secure systems, NBC News reported. Musk calls USAID a ‘criminal organization’ that should ‘die’ The Trump administration is making USAID a target in its wide changes to the federal government. In a three-page letter last week, it was revealed Trump is considering merging the agency into a branch under the State Department. Democrats have slammed Trump over the reports about the merger, noting the agency is 'by statute, an independent establishment.' How are lawmakers reacting? Republicans and Democrats have long fought over the agency, arguing whether humanitarian and development aid protects the U.S. by helping stabilize partner countries and economies or is a waste of money. Democrats argue Trump has no legal authority to eliminate a congressionally funded independent agency and that the work of USAID is vital to national security. Trump and congressional Republicans claim much of foreign aid and development programs are wasteful and single out programs they say advance liberal social agendas.

EU warns Trump it would ‘respond firmly’ to tariffs	(The Hill) — The European Union (EU) said it will 'respond firmly' if President Donald Trump signs tariffs that could impact its member countries. A spokesperson for the union said that the 27-member group was not aware of any additional tariffs being imposed on EU products but said the use of tariffs is 'hurtful on all sides,' Bloomberg reported. Trump defends tariffs as Mexico, Canada and China plan retaliation 'The EU would respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods,' the spokesperson said. 'There is a lot at stake.' The remarks come just a day after Trump signed an executive order imposing significant tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. A 25 percent tariff will impact goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10 percent tariff will affect Chinese goods. They are set to take effect on Tuesday and Trump justified the impact on Americans by arguing the pain caused by economic fallout will be 'worth the price.' In December, Trump threatened tariffs in the EU unless the bloc buys large quantities of American oil and gas to make up for the growing deficit in the U.S. Trump reiterates Canada should become 51st state as tariffs loom Despite Trump’s threat, the EU purchases a large amount of American oil and gas, and no more would be available unless the U.S. increases its output. Tensions with the EU and U.S. are already heightened as the president has said he wants to acquire Greenland, which is owned by Denmark. Officials in Denmark have insisted that it’s not for sale and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had a 'fiery' call with Trump over the issue.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/trump-tariffs-eu/	2025-02-02T16:09:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25031808023751-e1738528773190.jpg?w=800

(NewsNation) — As President Donald Trump doubles down on his sweeping tariffs against the country's three biggest trading partners, leaders from Canada, Mexico and China are biting back. The levies of 25% on Canadian and Mexican and 10% on Chinese goods will take effect Tuesday. The affected countries say their strategy is to 'make Americans feel the same pain too.' President Trump laid out his motive on Truth Social, saying: 'We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Rep. Amo: Trump’s DEI remarks on plane crash ‘beneath the office of the president’ Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit back, announcing he will impose a 25% tariff on more than $100 billion worth of American goods, on everything from alcohol to perfume, clothing and produce. Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum ordered similar retaliatory tariffs, sharing the following message in part on X: 'If the United States government an d its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities.' And China has vowed to file a case against the United States with the World Health Organization, defending their record on fentanyl. But how will this affect American's wallets? This could raise the price on a lot of things. Some of the top imported products from the United States include cars, produce, alcohol, cellphones, clothes and shoes. Some Democrats also warn the tariffs could punch up the price of your Super Bowl party. 'I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax, with the big game coming next week. If you you know, avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, price is going to go up,' Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said on CBS News' 'Face the Nation' Rep. Donalds on Trump tariffs: ‘The risks are worth it’ The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates Trump’s tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power. Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates the tariffs would increase inflation, which was running at a 2.9% annual rate in December, by 0.4 percentage points this year. Daco also projects the U.S. economy, which grew 2.8% last year, would fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026 'as higher import costs dampen consumer spending and business investment.’’ The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china/	2025-02-02T16:08:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/north-america_bernal_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Trump reiterates Canada should become 51st state as tariffs loom	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has extended a solution to Canada ahead of tariffs against the Commonwealth country going into effect on Tuesday. In a post to Truth Social on Sunday, Trump proclaimed that Canada should annex itself to the United States; a suggestion he has made before. 'We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have,' Trump wrote. US businesses brace for Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to drive up costs 'We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! 'Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Here are some goods in the crosshairs of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China Both China and Canada have vowed to retaliate against tariffs imposed by the 47th president. However, it seems Trump has no plans to stop the campaign promise after signing an executive order on Saturday. They go into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday. Canada will be taxed 25% on imports, and so too Mexico. Whereas China will be taxed 10% on all imports. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a lower 10% rate. Several industries are expected to be impacted, including the automotive, gas, tech and toy sectors, among others.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-reiterates-canada-become-51st-state-tariffs/	2025-02-02T10:29:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25027818887599.jpg?w=900
USAID security leaders on leave after trying to keep Musk's DOGE ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has placed two top security chiefs at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Elon Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Members of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, eventually did gain access Saturday to the aid agency's classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk's DOGE crew lacked high-enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials — John Vorhees and deputy Brian McGill — were legally obligated to deny access. The current and former U.S. officials had knowledge of the incident and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information. It comes a day after DOGE carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. Musk formed DOGE in cooperation with the new Trump administration with the stated goal of finding ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Panama City contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-usaid-security-leaders-on-leave-after-trying-to-keep-musks-doge-from-classified-info-officials-say/	2025-02-02T09:31:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679faceb64dbd0.40081108.jpeg?w=900
Is it a safe time to fly? Ex-Black Hawk crew chief says yes	(NewsNation) — Former Black Hawk helicopter crew chief Mark McEathron believes there has never been a safer time to board a flight. Despite two recent aircraft crashes McEathron insists they are unrelated and that there is no immediate threat to travelers. 'There's there's no relationship whatsoever. They're different air spaces, entirely different climate situations, entirely different aircraft, entirely different crews entirely and so that is completely unrelated,' McEathron told 'NewsNation Live Weekend.' NTSB: Helicopter’s black box recovered from DC crash site 'The truth is the safest time in history for aviation,' he said. 'These incidents are tragic, they're terrible, they're terrifying for viewers and for people who fly and participate in this, but it is just a statistical fact that it's the safest time we've ever had.' McEathron explained the various roles of a pilot and crew chief on a Black Hawk helicopter flight and what he believes occurred on the night of the crash. 'The pilots' jobs are to fly the aircraft. The crew chief's job is airspace surveillance and obstacle avoidance,' he said. 'That's the job of the crew chief, especially at the angle of the Black Hawks will fly. They fly nose down just before the main road, or to be able to pull it along. So, the pilots are looking straight ahead, looking down, or even looking in the aircraft for the tasks and duties they have to do. Virginia Attorney General asks Costco to end DEI policies 'Where the crew chief is the only one that could be looking up back, down [and] below. So they're the ones that really clear that airspace. 'Unfortunately, in this incident, we had one crew chief on the aircraft not to we don't always fly with two. That's not necessarily required, but there was only one in unfortunately, he was on the opposite side of the where this aircraft was coming from, and so he would have had no visibility of it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/is-it-safe-time-fly-black-hawk/	2025-02-02T09:20:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25031098531334.jpg?w=900
Here are some goods in the crosshairs of Trump's tariffs on Mexic...	President Donald Trump signed an order to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico, as well as China, starting Tuesday. Canada and Mexico quickly announced retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would take 'necessary countermeasures.' The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023. That is far greater than the $643 billion in commerce that the U.S. did with China in that same year. Trump declared an economic emergency Saturday in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a lower 10% rate. Following are just a few imported goods whose prices may be hit first: A ‘grenade’ lobbed into auto production For decades, auto companies have built supply chains that cross the borders of the United States, Mexico and Canada. More than one in five of the cars and light trucks sold in the United States were built in Canada or Mexico, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility. In 2023, the United States imported $69 billion worth of cars and light trucks from Mexico – more than any other country -- and $37 billion from Canada. Another $78 billion in auto parts came from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. The engines in Ford F-series pickups and the iconic Mustang sports coupe, for instance, come from Canada. 'You have engines and car seats and other things that cross the border multiple times before going into a finished vehicle,’’ said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. 'You have American parts going to Mexico to be put into vehicles that are then shipped back to the United States. 'You throw 25% tariffs into all that, and it’s just a grenade.’’ China is also a major supplier of auto parts to the U.S. In a report Tuesday, S&amp;P Global Mobility reckoned that 'importers are likely to pass most, if not all, of this (cost) increase to consumers.’’ TD Economics notes that average U.S. car prices could rise by around $3,000 – this at a time when the average new car already goes for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. Higher prices at the pump Canada is by far America’s biggest foreign supplier of crude oil. From January through November last year, Canada shipped the U.S. $90 billion worth of crude, well ahead of No. 2 Mexico at $11 billion. For many U.S. refineries, there’s not much choice. Canada produces the 'type of crude oil that American refineries are geared to process,’’ Lincicome said. 'It’s a heavier crude. All the fracking and all the oil and gas we make here in the United States – or most of it – is a lighter crude that a lot of American refineries don’t process, particularly in the Midwest.’’ Of the tariffs on Canadian oil imports, Lincicome said, 'how the heck does that shake out? My guess is that it shakes out just through higher gas prices, particularly in the Midwest.’’ TD Economics figures that Trump’s tariffs could push up U.S. gasoline prices by 30 cents to 70 cents a gallon. Computers, Clothes and Toys Tariffs on China could impact a wide variety of consumer goods that Americans depend on. Cell phones, computers and other electronic devices were among the top imports from China last year, according to Commerce Department data. The U.S. also imported more than $32 billion in 'toys, games and sporting goods' from China last year, data shows. And Americans import billions of dollars a year in clothing from China. That includes more than $7.9 billion in footwear last year, according to Commerce Department data. Trouble in Margaritaville Tariffs could raise the price for those raising a glass of tequila or Canadian whisky. In 2023, the U.S. imported $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. The U.S. imported $537 million worth of Canadian spirits, including $202.5 million worth of whisky. Canada and Mexico were also the second- and third-largest importers of U.S. spirits in 2023, behind the European Union, the council said. The council said the U.S. is already facing a potentially devastating 50% tariff on American whiskey by the European Union, which is set to begin in March. Imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada could pile even more retaliatory action on the industry. Chris Swonger, the council’s president and CEO, said he appreciates the goal of protecting U.S. jobs. But tequila and Canadian whisky – like Kentucky bourbon -- are designated as distinctive products that can only be made in their country of origin. 'At the end of the day, tariffs on spirits products from our neighbors to the north and south are going to hurt U.S. consumers and lead to job losses across the U.S. hospitality industry, just as these businesses continue their long recovery from the pandemic,' Swonger said. Expensive avocados, just in time for the Super Bowl For American consumers still exasperated by high grocery prices, a trade war with Canada, Mexico and China could be painful. In 2023, the U.S. bought more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico –including 63% of imported vegetables and 47% of fruits and nuts. Farm imports from Canada came to $40 billion. A 25% tariff could push prices up. 'Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,’’ Lincicome said. 'They can’t eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them – 90% -- come from Mexico. You’re talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.’’ U.S. farmers are nervous, too, that Canada and Mexico will retaliate by slapping tariffs on American products such as soybeans and corn. That’s what happened in the first Trump administration. China and other targets of Trump tariffs hit back by targeting the president’s supporters in rural America. Exports of soybeans and other farm products dropped, so Trump spent billions of U.S. taxpayer money to reimburse farmers for lost sales. 'President Trump was as good as his word,’’ said Mark McHargue, a Central City, Nebraska, farmer who grows corn, soybeans, popcorn and raises hogs. 'It did take the sting out of it. That’s for sure.’’ But he would prefer to see the government push to open foreign markets to American farm exports. 'We would rather get our money from the market,’’ said McHargue, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau. 'It doesn’t feel great to get a government check.’’ ____ Associated Press Writers Josh Boak in Washington, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit and Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia contributed this story.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/ap-here-are-some-goods-in-the-crosshairs-of-trumps-tariffs-on-mexico-canada-and-china/	2025-02-02T08:32:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679f97de327124.54080138.jpeg?w=900
US businesses brace for Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and Chi...	WASHINGTON (AP) — From an ice cream parlor in California to a medical supply business in North Carolina to a T-shirt vendor outside Detroit, U.S. businesses are bracing to take a hit from the taxes President Donald Trump imposed Saturday on imports from Canada, Mexico and China — America’s three biggest trading partners. The levies of 25% on Canadian and Mexican and 10% on Chinese goods will take effect Tuesday. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a lower 10% rate. Mexico’s president immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs and Canada’s prime minister said the country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country’s government firmly opposes the move and will take 'necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.' The Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the 'wrongful practices of the U.S.' The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates Trump's tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power. Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates the tariffs would increase inflation, which was running at a 2.9% annual rate in December, by 0.4 percentage points this year. Daco also projects the U.S. economy, which grew 2.8% last year, would fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026 'as higher import costs dampen consumer spending and business investment.’’ The Penny Ice Creamery in Santa Cruz, California, has had to hike prices of its ice cream, including popular flavors 'strawberry pink peppercorn’’ and 'chocolate caramel sea salt,’’ repeatedly in recent years as an inflationary surge increased the cost of its supplies. 'I feel bad about always having to raise prices,’’ co-owner Zach Davis said. 'We were looking forward to inflation coming down, the economy stabilizing in 2025 ... Now with the tariffs, we may be back at it again.’’ Trump tariffs, Davis said, threaten to drive up the cost of the mostly made-in-China refrigerators, freezers and blenders he’ll need if Penny Ice Creamery goes ahead with plans to add to its six shops. He still has painful memories of the extra equipment costs the company had to absorb when Trump slapped massive tariffs on China during his first term. The new tariffs will also raise the price of a customer favorite — sprinkles — which Penny Ice Creamery imports from a company in Whitby, Ontario. Tacking a 25% import tax on even something as small as that can damage a small business like his. 'The margins are so slim,’’ he said. 'Being able to offer that add-on can maybe generate an additional 10 cents in profit per scoop. If a tariff wipes that out, that can really be the difference between being profitable and being break-even and even being underwater by the end of the year.’’ In Asheville, North Carolina, Casey Hite, CEO of Aeroflow Health, expects to take a hit because his company gets more than half its supplies, including breast pumps, from Chinese manufacturers, providing them to American patients through insurance plans. Aeroflow Health gets paid by insurers at pre-negotiated rates, put in place before Trump decided on his tariffs. Hite said the tax on Chinese imports would hit the company’s finances, forcing it either to purchase cheaper and lower-quality products or pass higher costs along via higher health insurance premiums. Those might take two years to materialize, Hite said, but eventually they would hit consumers’ budgets. 'It will impact the patients,' Hite said. 'In time, patients pay more for the products.' Even the made-in-USA absorbent incontinence pads Aeroflow Health buys aren’t safe from Trump’s import taxes. They may include pulp from tariff target Canada and plastics and packaging from China, according to the Aeroflow Health, which warns of 'turbulences' from the tariffs. 'Is this going to affect our business? You bet it is,’’ said Linda Schlesinger-Wagner, who owns skinnytees, a women’s apparel company in Birmingham, Michigan, north of Detroit, that imports clothing from China. She said the 10% tax would increase her costs, though she plans to absorb the extra expense instead of passing it along to customers. 'I don’t like what’s going on,’’ she said, referring to the broader impact of the tariffs. 'And I think people are going to be truly shocked at the pricing they’re going to see on the cars, on the lumber, on the clothes, on the food. This is going to be a mess.’’ William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that many companies that stocked up on imported goods ahead of time to avoid the tariffs. They will be able to draw on their piled-up inventories for weeks or a couple of months, delaying their customers’ pain. George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, an industry advocacy group, said construction companies have been hoarding materials in anticipation of Trump’s actions, but he worries about the possibility of inflation spiking in three to six months. 'Once that inventory starts to get low, we’re going to start feeling the effects,' Carillo said in a phone interview Saturday, ahead of the announcement. 'Developers and general contractors need to keep up with the pace and they’re going to start buying more products and it’s going to be at a higher price point.' All that will be exacerbated by an emerging immigration crackdown that is already spooking the construction industry’s labor pool, he said. 'You put tariffs and you put workforce instability, it’s going to create major delays in projects. It’s going to create an increase in prices because of the lack of availability,' Carrillo said. Then there are the industries that don't have the luxury of stockpiling, including supermarkets whose farm products will spoil. So the tariff impact will show up on grocery shelves within days. 'You don’t stockpile avocados,’’ Reinsch said. 'You don’t stockpile cut flowers. You don’t stockpile bananas.’’ In the tomato trading hub of Nogales, Arizona, produce vendor Rod Sbragia, who followed his father into the business nearly four decades ago, worries that the import levies will force some distribution companies out of business and 'would be detrimental to the American consumer, to the choices they have at the supermarket.' Sbragia voted for Trump in the past three elections and calls himself a 'staunch Republican.' The president, he said, must not have been properly advised on the matter. 'When we’re worried about cost to consumers, inflationary pressures and the overall health of our population,’’ he asked, 'why are we going to make it more difficult to get access to fresh fruits and vegetables?' American farmers are also likely to get caught in Trump’s trade tussle with Canada, China and Mexico. The president’s supporters in rural America make a tempting target for retaliatory tariffs. That is what happened in Trump’s first term when other countries, notably China, slapped back against the president’s tariffs with levies of their own on things like soybeans and pork. In response, Trump spent billions in taxpayer money to compensate them for lost sales and lower prices. Many farmers are now counting on the president to come through and protect them from reprisals. 'The Trump administration provided a safety net,' said former tobacco grower Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a collection of 700 farms that lawfully brings in foreign temporary laborers to work the fields through a federal visa program. Many of the association's farmers 'trust him that he’s going to take care of anybody who’s hurt by the tariffs, and that’s really all that we can ask for.' ___ Associated Press staff writers Mae Anderson and Cedar Attanasio in New York; Mike Householder in Birmingham, Michigan; Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina; Gabriel Sandoval in Phoenix; and Didi Tang and Christopher Rugaber in Washington, D.C., contributed to this story.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-us-businesses-brace-for-trumps-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-to-drive-up-costs/	2025-02-01T23:27:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679f1f32785695.91618378.jpeg?w=900
Democratic National Committee picks Ken Martin as new chair	(NewsNation) — Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, won the Democratic National Committee’s election to be the party’s next chair. He won in the first round with 246.5 votes out of 428 votes cast. (Delegates who live abroad are given half a vote, which accounts for the half percent of his total.) Martin, who also previously served as vice chair of the DNC, relied on his long-standing relationships with delegates to secure his win. He also touted his record of 25-0 in Minnesota state races while campaigning for the position. NewsNation’s Special Report: Crisis on the Border Martin beat Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democrats, and six other candidates. Wikler had received the endorsements of eight large unions as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but that support was not a match for the relationships Martin had built within the party as well as the endorsement of Representative James Clyburn. 'We're coming. This is a new Democratic Party. We're taking the gloves off. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people,' said Martin when asked by NewsNation about his message to President Donald Trump. Part of his plan to start winning races immediately includes creating a 'war room' that will focus on combating misinformation and disinformation. He also acknowledged that Republicans successfully spent three years defining Joe Biden and the Democratic Party before Democrats began revving up their communications infrastructure to respond. Martin wants to make sure that doesn’t happen anymore. Of Trump’s first weeks in office, Martin said his actions 'have shown us what happens when amateur hour meets demolition derby.' Federal websites told to purge content related to gender, climate Throughout the race, Martin said that under his leadership, the country can expect year-round campaigning that will prove to Americans that Democrats are the party that delivers for the working class. Martin plans to build up state parties and promised to take the 'great ideas from the other candidates' in the race and bring them to bear. With the race in the rearview mirror, Martin said it was time to unify, believing that Democrats are part of 'one team, one fight.' Martin has his work cut out for him. Democrats lost the White House and control of the Senate and remain in the minority in the House of Representatives after November’s elections. Meanwhile, Trump has moved swiftly to follow through on some campaign promises, particularly on immigration and dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Republicans in Congress are also working to show that their party is unified. Two big gubernatorial elections later this year, in Virginia and New Jersey, will test whether Republicans can keep up their winning streak or if Democrats are able to win back some of the working-class voters that have recently drifted away from the party.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dnc-picks-ken-martin-chair/	2025-02-01T20:05:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25010861347457.jpg?w=900
NewsNation's Special Report: Crisis on the Border	(NewsNation) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations and arrests continued across the country this week with raids in Florida, New York, Colorado, California, Texas and Washington state. In a memo obtained exclusively by NewsNation, there are new warnings about calls to assassinate ICE agents, and the threats are growing on social media. The posts call for the murder of ICE agents and advise detainees to urinate and defecate in agent’s vehicles. Border czar Tom Homan spoke to NewsNation about the importance of officer safety, saying that operation secrecy remains critical after missions in Chicago and Aurora, Colorado, were leaked. 7 killed in Philadelphia medical transport jet crash 'We’ve got many target cities,' Homan said. 'We’ve got to keep our officers safe. Bad guys know we’re coming.' Meanwhile, President Donald Trump designated Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. U.S. Border Patrol has received new intel this week that cartels have authorized the use of weaponized, explosive drones against law enforcement officials. ICE agents, however, are pushing ahead, averaging more than 1,000 arrests per day. The agency is aiming for 1,500 daily arrests. The U.S. military has been leading deportation flights out of the country and fortifying the southern border. The Army, National Guard and the Marines are estimated to be 4,000 strong. Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warnings But with nearly 1.5 million undocumented immigrants set to be deported, where will they go? Trump said tens of thousands of migrants, considered 'the worst of the worst,' will be heading to Guantanamo Bay detention camp. 'We have 30,000 beds in Guantanamo to detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people,' Trump said. 'Some of them are so bad we don't even trust other countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So we're going to send them out to Guantanamo.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/special-report-crisis-on-the-border/	2025-02-01T17:36:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/NN_CRISIS-ON-THE-BORDER-PRIME-SPECIAL-Key-Art_1920x1080.png?w=900
Democrats electing new leader as party struggles to repair brand	OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — Democrats, desperately seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, are electing a new party leader Saturday in a low-profile race that could have big implications for their future. The new Democratic National Committee chair will succeed Jaime Harrison, who did not seek another term after a tumultuous 2024 election in which Trump became the first Republican to win the popular vote in two decades and made modest gains with core Democratic constituencies — African Americans, Latinos and working-class voters, among them. 'The world needs the Democratic Party to get up off the mat,' said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin state party head who is a top candidate, before the vote. He said the nation is facing a 'moment of Trumpian terror.' More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory were in suburban Washington for the election, which featured a group of candidates dominated by party insiders. The leading contenders, Wikler and Minnesota’s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They have promised to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party’s anti-Trump rapid response system. They have pledged not to shy away from Democrats' dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day party. But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, were elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011. Also in the race: former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O’Malley, and Faiz Shakir, who managed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ last presidential campaign. Candidate Marianne Williamson, an activist and author, surprised DNC members before voting began by endorsing Martin as 'our best chance to cut the court with the billionaire funded corruption that will otherwise obstruct and limit our possibilities.' Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong. The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand. Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party. Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC. But he has struggled to gain traction. Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons. By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food. Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections. Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party. 'As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t see a desire to change,’' said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair. ___	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-democrats-to-elect-new-leader-as-party-struggles-to-repair-brand/	2025-02-01T09:05:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679e559b47c053.16393703.jpeg?w=900
What are tariffs and how do they work?	WASHINGTON (AP) — Tariffs are in the news at the moment. Here's what they are and what you need to know about them: Tariffs are a tax on imports Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. U.S. tariff rates vary: They are generally 2.5% on passenger cars, for instance, and 6% on golf shoes. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump’s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. There’s much misinformation about who actually pays tariffs President Donald Trump, a proponent of tariffs, insists that they are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, it is importers — American companies — that pay tariffs, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That’s why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs. Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices — and sacrifice profits — to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy. What has Trump said about tariffs? Trump has said tariffs will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare. 'Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,’’ Trump said at a rally in Flint, Michigan, during his presidential campaign. As president, Trump imposed tariffs with a flourish — targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China. 'Tariff Man,' he called himself. Trump has promised even more and higher tariffs in his second term. The United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That shift has been a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered tree trade and an increasingly powerful China. Tariffs are intended mainly to protect domestic industries By raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices. Before the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue driver for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90% of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy. Tariffs fell out of favor as global trade grew after World War II. The government needed vastly bigger revenue streams to finance its operations. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government collected around $80 billion in tariffs and fees. That’s a trifle next to the $2.5 trillion that comes from individual income taxes and the $1.7 trillion from Social Security and Medicare taxes. Still, Trump wants to enact a budget policy that resembles what was in place in the 19th century. Tariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States. Trump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars. 'I can do it with a phone call,’’ he said at an August rally in North Carolina. If another country tries to start a war, he said he’d issue a threat: 'We’re going to charge you 100% tariffs. And all of a sudden, the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, ‘Sir, we won’t go to war.’ ' Economists generally consider tariffs self-defeating Tariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. They’re also likely to provoke retaliation. The European Union, for example, punched back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump’s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country. A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump’s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs 'neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment’’ where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found. Despite Trump’s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States. Worse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had 'negative employment impacts,’’ especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports. If Trump’s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. The study found that support for Trump and Republican congressional candidates rose in areas most exposed to the import tariffs — the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-what-are-tariffs-and-how-do-they-work/	2025-02-01T08:06:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679e4786e50488.98303360.jpeg?w=900
First American hostage, 2 others freed from Hamas captivity	(NewsNation) — The first American hostage since the cease fire deal between Hamas and Israel went into effect two weeks ago was released from Gaza City Saturday morning, along with two Israeli hostages. Keith Siegel, 65, returned home to his family but not before an ominous fanfare as Hamas paraded him in front of a large crowd, as Hamas has done with each hostage release. Keith Siegel This undated photo provided by Hostages Family Forum shows Keith Siegel, who was abducted and brought to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. (Hostages Family Forum via AP) Siegel’s wife, Aviva, who was also taken hostage but released after 51 days, celebrated her husband's release. Throughout the more than 400 days he remained in captivity, she vocally called for his return. Telegraph reporter Jotam Confino joined NewsNation’s 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' after the exchange. 'He looks very fragile. He looks thin. He's being escorted by Hamas. It doesn't look like he's really able to walk fully by himself, but he's out now,' Confino said. His wife has spoken in Washington, D.C., multiple times with high-level officials to get Keith out and thanked President Donald Trump Saturday morning for finalizing the deal to get him out. Yarden Bibas Yarden Bibas, 35, and Ofer Kalderon, 54, were also released in an earlier handoff in Khan Younis, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, marking the fourth hostage-prisoner exchange of cease fire’s first phase. Hundreds gathered in Tel Aviv’s 'hostage square' to welcome the newly freed hostages, many appearing concerned and putting their hands together in prayer formation. 'His (Yarden Bibas’) family, mainly his wife and his two children, they have become somewhat of a symbol for Israel in this whole hostage strategy, mainly because they are very young,' Confino said. Bibas is 35, and his youngest child was nine months old when he was kidnapped. Bibas’ other son was four years old at the time of the kidnapping. 'Yarden does not know if his wife and two children are alive or dead,' Confino said. In November 2023, Bibas was forced to record a hostage video that his wife and children had been killed in an Israeli air strike, but it has not been confirmed. 'His nightmare is nowhere near ending,' Confino said. 'He's waiting for the Israeli government to find out more about his family.' Ofer Kalderson For Kalderon, he was reunited with his four children, two of whom were also held by Hamas. They were kidnapped from their home on Oct. 7, 2023, the first day of the now 15-month-long war. What's next in the Hamas-Israel cease fire? Hostage negotiations between Hamas and Israel resume on Tuesday as the second phase of the deal approaches. In this phase, Israel said it would pull troops from Gaza, but that remains to be seen. All male Israeli soldiers and more Palestinian prisoners are supposed to be released. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to meet with Trump at the White House. 'So many are worried that any second the whole thing could break down. (Hamas) could execute hostages, or they could renew fighting with Israel,' Confino said. 'So, we're really taking it day by day here in Israel.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/first-american-hostage-freed/	2025-02-01T08:05:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25032330708438.jpg?w=900
Trump fires the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bur...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden administration holdover. Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Chopra's tenure saw the removal of medical debt from credit reports and limits on overdrafts penalties, all based on the premise that the financial system could be fairer and more competitive in ways that helped consumers. But many in the financial industry viewed his actions as regulatory overreach. In a social media post Saturday about his departure, Chopra thanked people across the country who 'shared their ideas and experiences' with the government's consumer financial watchdog agency. 'You helped us hold powerful companies &amp; their executives accountable for breaking the law, and you made our work better,' Chopra posted above on X above pictures of his letter announcing that he would no longer lead the bureau. During Trump's first term, the Republican had picked Chopra as a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission. In his letter, Chopra noted that the bureau was ready to work with the Trump administration. He said the agency had prepared rules to block Russia, China and others from using data brokers to surveil Americans, and had put forth policies intended to prevent people from losing access to banking services for exercising their constitutional right to express their political or religious views. The letter noted the CFPB has also analyzed Trump's campaign proposal to cap credit card interest rates. Chopra was notified of his firing in an email, according to a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director. But he had publicly stated that he would leave his post if the new president asked. In many ways, Chopra exemplified some of the tensions between Trump's promises to curb regulations for businesses and his populist appeals to voters. When The Associated Press reported on Jan. 22 that Chopra remained in his job after Trump took the oath of office, his critics in the financial sector quickly said the president needed to dismiss him. 'The longer Director Chopra stays, the harder it will be for this pro-growth administration to undo the politically-driven, government-price setting agenda that former President Biden’s appointee has engaged in over the last several years at the Bureau,' emailed Weston Loyd, press secretary at the Consumer Bankers Association. Chopra is an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of Trump's favorite targets, and the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement that if Trump and Republicans 'decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.' She said the bureau under Chopra had held 'Wall Street accountable.' California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that Chopra's dismissal 'marks the end of an era of strong consumer protection and the beginning of a plan to end this important agency.' The bureau was created after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate mortgages, car loans and other consumer finance. It has long been opposed by Republicans and their financial backers. Last year, the Supreme Court rejected a challenged that could have undermined the bureau, ruling that the way it is is funded does not violate the Constitution. Unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on the annual budget process in Congress, but is funded directly by the Federal Reserve.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-trump-fires-the-director-of-the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau/	2025-02-01T07:55:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679e44004c2889.39592261.jpeg?w=900
2 hostages return to Israel after handover in southern Gaza	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Two hostages arrived in Israel after Hamas handed them over to the Red Cross on Saturday, while Palestinian authorities say Israel has agreed to release dozens of prisoners in the fourth round of exchanges during the Gaza ceasefire deal. The truce, which began Jan. 19, is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Hamas militant group. The fragile deal has held for nearly two weeks, halting the fighting and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory. The militants released Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, to the Red Cross after each climbed on a stage and waved to onlookers. Both had been abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Armed Hamas militants formed a line leading to the stage after chaotic crowds surrounded hostages during a handover Thursday, angering Israel. Another hostage, American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, is also set to be released Saturday and is expected to be handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza City to the north. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are expected to be freed in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners during the truce’s initial six weeks. Israel says it has received information from Hamas that eight of those hostages were either killed in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack or have died in captivity Also on Saturday, wounded Palestinians are expected to be allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt through the Rafah crossing. It had been the only exit point for Palestinians during the war before Israel closed it in May. A European Union civilian mission was deployed Friday to prepare for the reopening of the crossing. The reopening would mark another key step in the first phase of the ceasefire, which calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. The Health Ministry said 50 sick and wounded children are scheduled to be evacuated through Rafah crossing along with 61 companions. In Israel, the release of Bibas has brought renewed attention to — and concern for — the fate of his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons. All four were captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz. A video of their abduction by armed men showed Shiri swaddling in a blanket her two redheaded boys — Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old at the time. Kfir was the youngest of about 250 people taken captive on Oct. 7, and his plight quickly came to represent the helplessness and anger the hostage-taking stirred in Israel, where the Bibas family has become a household name. Hamas has said Shiri and her sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has not confirmed that, but a military spokesman recently acknowledged serious concern about their fates. Yarden Bibas is believed to have been held separately from his family. Photos taken during his abduction appeared to show him wounded. Like Bibas, Kalderon was also captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz. His two children and ex-wife, Hadas, were also taken, but they were freed during the 2023 ceasefire. In Kfar Saba, north of Tel Aviv, Kalderon's family hugged and cheered as they saw the images of him climbing onto the stage in Khan Younis and being transferred to the Red Cross. 'Ofer is coming home!' they said, arms lifted to the sky. Keith Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. She was released during the 2023 ceasefire and has waged a high-profile campaign to free Keith and other hostages. The dozens of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel on Saturday include people serving lengthy and life sentences. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in Nov. 2023. About 80 more hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third of them believed dead. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire are dead. Israel and Hamas are set next week to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the latest ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu’s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. In the Oct. 7 attack that started the war, some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground war, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-to-release-3-male-hostages-israel-to-release-dozens-of-palestinian-prisoners-under-ceasefire/	2025-01-31T23:19:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679dc69d632525.81399269.jpeg?w=900
‘Heartbreaking’ search for those killed in DC air crash as army h...	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Police boats combed the banks of the Potomac River on Friday, slowly scanning the shoreline in the rain as investigators sought clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people and raised questions about air traffic safety around the nation’s capital. The black box from the Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a commercial jetliner and crashed into the Potomac River has been recovered, investigators announced. They are reviewing that flight data recorder along with two recovered earlier from the jet. No one survived the Wednesday night collision. The remains of 41 people had been pulled from the river as of Friday afternoon, including 28 that had been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference. He said next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families, and he expects all the remains to be recovered. The wreckage of the plane's fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get all the bodies, he said. 'This is heartbreaking work,' Donnelly said, noting that more than 300 responders were taking part in the effort at any one time, including teams of divers and two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, at least one of which carries a crane. 'It’s been a tough response for a lot of our people.' It was unclear how long the recovery operation would take. 'We’re working as fast as we can,' Donnelly said. 'We need your patience.' The American Airlines jet was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. The helicopter had three soldiers on board. Although Ronald Reagan National Airport reopened, two of its three runways remained closed to keep aircraft from flying over the crash scene, said Terry Liercke, the airport's vice president and manager. Roughly 100 flights were canceled Friday. The Federal Aviation Administration also heavily restricted helicopter traffic around the airport, the Department of Transportation said in a statement, hours after President Donald Trump claimed in a social media post that the Army Black Hawk had been flying higher than allowed. Investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder of the American Airlines jetliner, which collided with the chopper as the plane was coming in for a landing at the airport, which is just across the Potomac from Washington. The flight data recorder was in good condition and its information was expected to be downloaded shortly, National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman told reporters. He said water entered the cockpit voice recorder, and while that’s not unusual, it adds to investigators’ work. The helicopter’s data, contained in a single black box, was at NTSB headquarters and appears to be undamanged, Inman said. Investigators are examining the actions of the military pilot as well as air traffic control, after the helicopter apparently flew into the jet's path. NTSB investigations normally take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Military aircraft frequently conduct such flights in and around the capital to practice routes they would fly if key government officials had to be quickly moved during a major catastrophe or attack. Other potential factors in the crash, including the helicopter’s altitude and whether the crew was using night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel. On Friday the Army released the names of two of the soldiers who died: Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, the crew chief; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. Eaves was one of the pilots on the helicopter. But in an unusual move, the name of the third soldier is not being released for now at the family’s request, the Army said. The FAA on Friday barred helicopters from flying over a roughly 6-mile (10-kilometer) stretch of the Potomac and parts of its shoreline, including over the airport, according to the Department of Transportation statement. The new limits exempt helicopters on emergency medical flights, active law enforcement and air defense missions, and carrying the president. They are expected to remain in place at least until the NTSB finishes its preliminary report. Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas, carrying, among others, nine students and parents from Fairfax County, Virginia schools, a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and a group of hunters. Crash debris has drifted miles (kilometers) downriver. Dean Naujoks, who routinely patrols the Potomac for the environmental group Waterkeeper Alliance, found floating debris Thursday in a pair of shallow coves along the Maryland shore. The wreckage included pages from a flight manual, part of the plane’s cabin wall, a woman’s sweater and dozens of sugar packets with the American Airlines logo. Naujoks, who had law enforcement permission to take his motorboat about 2 miles (roughly 3 kilometers) from the crash site, turned the items over to the FBI. 'Everything is covered in jet fuel,' Naujoks said Friday. 'The sugar packets made me think of the flight attendants. I’m thinking of the people these things belonged to, and it’s a punch to the gut. It’s just a sad day on the river.' According to an FAA report obtained by the AP, one air traffic controller was responsible for coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes when the collision happened. Those duties are often divided between two people, but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic begins to slow down. On Wednesday, though, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called 'not normal.' However, a person familiar with the matter said tower staffing that night was actually normal. The positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away for breaks, shift changes or when traffic slows, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. Inman said investigators had interviewed at least one air traffic controller working at the time of the crash. He said interviews were ongoing, and it was unclear how many controllers were working at the time. 'Air traffic control interviews are critical,' Inman said. 'That’s the reason why there’s a process in place that began immediately after the accident.' Investigators will also examine staffing levels, training, hiring and other factors, in addition to looking at controllers' records. The FAA has long struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers. Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, said the helicopter crew was 'very experienced' and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around the city. The helicopter's maximum allowed altitude at the time was 200 feet (about 60 meters), Koziol said. It was not immediately clear whether it exceeded that limit, but Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor in the collision. A day after he questioned the helicopter pilot’s actions and blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air safety, Trump said Friday that the helicopter was 'flying too high.' 'It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump said in a post on the Truth Social platform. Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people aboard and five people on the ground. Experts often highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots. ___ Gomez Licon reported from Miami.

Foreign aid freeze could cut thousands of American jobs	(NewsNation) — After President Trump’s executive order freezing almost all foreign aid from the U.S., American businesses that help provide global assistance are furloughing employees. There’s grave concern that stated policy goals of the Trump administration, like American prosperity, strong national security and combating the rise of China, are at risk through these actions. Impact on U.S. businesses The foreign aid budget accounts for less than 1% of the federal budget or around $40 billion, according to the State Department, yet thousands of Americans are employed by businesses that work in the aid arena. For many, their jobs are on the line. Bodega owners, customers react to immigration crackdown in NYC For example, U.S.-based aid company Chemonics International directly employs 1,100 Americans and partners with more than 145 American companies. It’s enacted furloughs that could become permanent if funding is cut. 'As a result of the stop-work order that is affecting all of the USAID-funded programs we implement, we are taking several cost reduction measures, including furloughing many of our staff,' a Chemonics spokesperson said. According to the State Department’s cable issuing the stop-work order consistent with the President’s executive order, the initial timeline for this pause in funding is a minimum of 90 days. Many are concerned that the first 30 days are being used to create a review process instead of conducting reviews, delaying funding longer. A person familiar with USAID’s programs warned that if the State Department or Congress wants any foreign assistance programs to resume after this pause, it’s possible that partners who help implement the programs will no longer exist. USAID partners pay upfront for all costs of doing work on behalf of the U.S. government (like salaries, office leases, etc.) either with cash on hand or through a line of credit. If the government does not reimburse them within 30 days, lenders may not be willing to extend credit to partners again. And with no cash on hand, a business cannot survive. Trump launches aviation safety assessment ordering ‘competence’ over ‘DEI’ While Secretary of State Marco Rubio has signed some waivers that provide exemptions, like foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance, the work of aid organizations is vast, encompassing agriculture, education, health care, and more. The source said that many partners that implement USAID’s programs face financial insolvency within 30 to 60 days. Some U.S. small businesses that work overseas have already folded. The head of an American-owned small business explained that the order didn’t just pause current and new funds. The government has also stopped paying for work that’s already completed, including invoices submitted before the order was issued. That small business may have to file for bankruptcy. They, and others, don’t understand why the administration would not pay bills and freeze funds before a review process is in place, wondering if this is actually an excuse to gut the foreign aid budget and fold USAID into the State Department in a diminished capacity. National security and keeping China at bay The actions of the Trump administration are not just detrimental to these American businesses and their employees; they’re counterintuitive to the goals of the Trump administration, according to several sources. Sanctuary policies would be punishable under Tennessee bill The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a bipartisan group that includes almost 270 retired admirals and generals, provided several examples of where the freeze could harm U.S. interests. For example, security guards who were guarding thousands of ISIS militants at the Al Hol camp in Syria stopped showing up for work, leaving the camps largely unattended until the freeze on the specific camp program was lifted. Current U.S. foreign assistance programs to prevent, detect and respond to biothreats and global disease outbreaks are frozen, hurting America’s ability to halt health threats, like other pandemics, from reaching the U.S. In the tiny nation of Papua New Guinea, in a strategically important region to the U.S., China owns over 40 companies, and there are more than 1,800 foreign companies controlled by Chinese nationals or entities. With this funding freeze, Chinese influence can grow, and successful partnership opportunities with allies that advance U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific will shrink. Co-chair of the council, former CENTCOM Commander and Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, believes the freeze 'takes the U.S. off the playing field and diminishes America’s strength around the world.' At his confirmation hearing to be secretary of state, Rubio said he’ll focus on three questions: Does every dollar we spend make us safer, does it make us stronger, and does it make us more prosperous? USGLC Communications Director Josh Cohen not only believes that when it comes to international assistance, the answer to all three is 'yes,' 'but if we pull back from the world, China is itching to fill the vacuum.' Illinois governor blocks pardoned Jan. 6 rioters from state jobs Right now, funds are frozen, but no permanent cuts have been made, which is limiting criticism. Many of the people NewsNation spoke with were only willing to do so anonymously for fear of retribution in the form of permanent cuts. A State Department spokesperson justified the pause by saying it is impossible to evaluate programs on autopilot because participants don’t have an incentive to share details if they’re continuing to get funds. 'A temporary pause, with common-sense waivers for truly life-threatening situations, is the only way to scrutinize and prevent waste,' they said. Notably, all of the sources NewsNation spoke with agreed there’s value in a review process to get rid of waste and understand that the new administration wants alignment with what they perceive are America’s interests. But to pause funding without a review process in place is leaving thousands of Americans jobless and allowing China to step into the void. This could leave the country weaker, less secure and less prosperous. That’s the opposite of what voters said they wanted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/foreign-aid-freeze-jobs/	2025-01-31T16:37:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/Foreign-aid_051124_Photo_AP.png?w=900
Multiple houses on fire after plane crash in Philadelphia	(NewsNation) — A small plane crashed in Philadelphia, causing an explosion and multiple house fires. Police say two people were on board the plane. The status of those individuals is unknown. Other injuries have been reported on the ground, and multiple homes are on fire. The FAA said in a statement 'a Learjet 55 crashed around 6:30 p.m. local time on Friday, Jan. 31, after departing from Northeast Philadelphia Airport. There were two people on board. The plane was en route to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri.' What can the ‘black box’ tell us about plane crashes? Gov. Josh Shapiro said he is offering all 'Commonwealth resources as they respond to the small private plane crash in Northeast Philly.' Flight data showed a small jet taking off from the airport at 6:06 p.m. and disappearing from radar about 30 seconds later after climbing to an altitude of 1,600 feet. It is not clear what led to the crash. This is a developing story. Check back for more details.

Federal websites told to purge content related to gender, climate	(NewsNation) — Portions of federal government websites have gone dark as agencies are being told to 'pause' them to remove content that doesn't comply with President Donald Trump's views. The U.S. Department of Agriculture was told to delete pages about climate change, according to an email from the agency's communications department. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's pages on HIV also went dark earlier in the day, but some content was later restored.

Live: White House answers questions after DC plane crash	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump on Friday asserted the military helicopter involved in a deadly midair collision near Washington, D.C., was 'flying too high.' 'The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump posted on Truth Social. More than 60 people died after an American Airlines flight collided with a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on its final approach to Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Wednesday night. DC plane crash: Flight manifest expected to be released Friday The New York Times reported Thursday that the helicopter was supposed to be flying lower to the ground at the time of the crash, citing four people briefed on the issue. The Times reported that the helicopter had asked permission to use a route that would have allowed it to fly no higher than 200 feet. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Pentagon are investigating the cause of the crash. Since the collision took place on Wednesday night, Trump has vacillated between arguing the helicopter may have been at fault in the incident and claiming diversity efforts in hiring air traffic controllers may have played a role. 'The people in the helicopter should have seen where they were going,' Trump told reporters Thursday at the White House. 'What was the helicopter doing in that track? Very sad. But visually, somebody should have been able to see and taken that helicopter out of play and the should have been at a different height.' Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warnings But Trump has also repeatedly suggested without evidence that efforts to hire diverse individuals, including those with disabilities, had weakened federal aviation safety. 'We want the most competent people, no matter what race they are. … If they don’t have a great brain, a great power of the brain, they’re not going to be very good at what they do,' he said. The president also signed a memo Thursday to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the aviation sector and to assess airline safety, as well as an executive order to appoint a new head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in the wake of the incident.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-black-hawk-too-high-plane-crash/	2025-01-31T08:10:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25030597079190-e1738335463110.jpg?w=800
DC plane crash: Flight manifest expected to be released Friday	(NewsNation) — Officials are expected to release a flight manifest Friday with a list of those on board the American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members when it collided with a military helicopter carrying three soldiers at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. It's expected to be released as crews continue recovery operations. The DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services confirmed Friday morning that 41 bodies have been recovered from the crash site, including all three soldiers who were on the Army Black Hawk helicopter. During a Thursday news conference, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said the flight manifest for American Airlines Flight 5342 would be released after the families of those who were on the flight are notified. 'They are waiting for all of the families to be notified,' Kelly said. 'There are some folks on that plane who are from overseas. That's partially the reason for the delay. They expect we would likely have the manifest on Friday afternoon.' The 67 people on the plane and military helicopter are presumed dead. Investigators recover black boxes from plane in DC crash The National Transportation Safety Board is examining the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recovered Thursday from the passenger jet. Investigators will zero in on how the plane experienced a rapid loss of altitude on its approach over the Potomac. Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warnings Officials said their investigation 'will take some time' but intend to have a preliminary report on the crash within 30 days. Jennifer Homendy, board chair, said while it is an 'all hands on deck event,' they will allow first responders to complete their 'important safety mission.' To determine the cause of the crash, Homendy said the NTSB will look at several factors, including 'human, machine and the environment.' DC plane crash: What we know so far The midair crash occurred shortly before 9 p.m. local time Wednesday, shutting down the airport until 11 a.m. Thursday. Part of the investigation will revolve around an interaction with air traffic control in the final moments before the collision. According to investigators, the plane was cleared to land at a shorter runway just minutes before at Reagan National. The pilots acknowledged the change as well. Air traffic control also asked the helicopter if it could see the plane and if it could pass behind it, but, seconds later, the crash occurred. Diversity has ‘nothing to do’ with ATC hiring: Ex-FAA official There were 60 passengers and four crew members aboard American Eagle Flight 5342, according to American Airlines. The FAA said the plane was a Bombardier CRJ700 arriving from Wichita, Kansas. A U.S. Army official said the helicopter was a UH-60 Black Hawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, said both pilots were experienced and had flown the specific route before. The pilot-in-command had 1,000 flying hours, and their co-pilot had just under 500. Who are the victims of the DC plane crash? The victims include figure skaters and coaches, as well as members of the D.C. branch of the Steamfitters union. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts,' U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement. United Association Steamfitters said four members were on board the American Airlines flight. 'May they rest in peace,' UA Local 602, based in Prince George’s County, Maryland, said on X.

Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warni...	(NewsNation) — Congress added more daily flights to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport's schedule last year — and multiple other times over the past quarter century — despite warnings from the airport where 67 people died in a plane crash Wednesday night. The collision between an American Airlines commercial passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River is the worst air crash in the U.S. since 9/11. The crash was reminiscent of another on Jan. 13, 1982, when an Air Florida flight plowed into the Potomac due to bad weather, leaving 78 dead. Wednesday's crash has resurfaced concerns about the airport's proximity to the river, narrow landing space and overcrowding. Despite the geographic and logistical challenges, Congress authorized 10 additional 'slots,' or flights, to DCA's daily flight schedule. Investigators recover black boxes from plane in DC crash DCA (the airport's three-letter code) operates on a 'slot rule,' meaning the number of daily arrivals and departures is limited. Only four other high-density airports manage congestion this way: JFK and LaGuardia in New York, Newark in New Jersey and O'Hare in Chicago. Reagan National serves as the area's 'short-haul' airport, according to its website, as nonstop service is limited to a perimeter of 1,250 miles. However, nonstop service is offered beyond that limit to West Coast cities such as Los Angeles and Seattle due to recent federal exemptions. Through legislation passed by Congress, the U.S. Department of Transportation can issue 'beyond-perimeter' exemptions, allowing nonstop service to cities outside the 1,250-mile perimeter. Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act authorized 10 additional daily flights to DCA's schedule, all of which are outside the perimeter. This decision was made 'over the strong opposition of the Airports Authority,' DCA's website says. Congress also added 54 total slots spread across 2012, 2003 and 2000. What we know about the DC plane crash victims Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., opposed the increase. 'With this profoundly reckless decision, the (Commerce, Science and Transportation) Committee is gambling with the safety of everyone who uses this airport,' Kaine said in a statement last February. 'As we have said countless times before, DCA’s runway is already the busiest in the country.' Members of Congress travel frequently, using the two D.C.-area airports, Reagan National and Washington Dulles International Airport. 'Forcing the airport to cram additional flights in its already crowded schedule will further strain its resources at a time when air traffic controllers are overburdened and exhausted, working 10-hour days, six days a week,' Kaine said before a final bill was written last year. DC crash co-pilot ‘at the prime of his life’: Dad An FAA report obtained by the Associated Press said one air traffic controller was working two positions at the time of the crash, which was 'not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.' On May 25, 2023, nine days after the reauthorization act was signed into law, the FAA sent a memo to the Office of Government and Industry Affairs to provide an analysis of how the additional slots would impact delays and airport operations. 'Additional flights at DCA would likely have a negative impact on operational performance and passenger experience,' the memo said. About 20% of departures and 22% of arrivals at DCA experienced average delays of a little more than an hour from January 2022 through May 2023. Listen: Audio captures air traffic control at moment of DC plane crash The memo clarified slot limits are based on airport capacity, not demand. Whereas Congress successfully sought to increase the number of slots, the FAA 'imposes slot limits when demand exceeds capacity,' the memo said. 'I was so distraught when I heard this news last night,' Kaine told the New York Times on Thursday. 'I will not be able to rewatch the speech I gave on the Senate floor about it because it would make me too upset.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/congress-authorized-more-flights-reagan-airport-despite-warnings/	2025-01-31T01:25:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/americanairlines_dca_022323gn4_w.jpg?w=900
Did night vision goggles play a role in DC plane crash?	(NewsNation) — Investigators are looking at the factors that contributed to Wednesday's tragic plane crash in Washington, D.C., and they may consider whether night vision goggles played a role. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that a 'fairly experienced' crew was conducting an 'annual proficiency training flight' in the military helicopter when it collided with the civilian airplane. The helicopter operators were wearing night vision goggles. U.S. Rep Mark Green, R-Tenn., a former flight surgeon for the U.S. Army Night Stalkers, told NewsNation that flying in an urban environment with night vision presents challenges but moving lights, like those on a plane, should have been detectable. What we know about the DC plane crash victims 'If the [night vision goggles] are on, you should see those lights,' he told NewsNation's Leland Vittert on Thursday. Instead, the bigger issue may have been 'target fixation,' meaning the helicopter crew was focused on something else, like another plane. 'I've investigated crashes before where target fixation was the issue,' Green said. 'They get their eyes locked on one other thing and they miss the thing in their periphery.' Investigators recover black boxes from plane in DC crash Green also pointed out that the helicopter only had one crew chief, which may have made it harder to spot hazards. 'The aircraft that I flew in had two, one on each side, and those crew chiefs are literally outside the aircraft, especially in a situation where they're this low,' he said.

Diversity has 'nothing to do' with ATC hiring: Ex-FAA official	(NewsNation) — A former Federal Aviation Administration official said diversity has 'nothing to do' with air traffic control hiring, adding he takes exception to President Donald Trump’s claim it may have contributed to the deadly collision between a passenger jet and military helicopter Wednesday. 'There are very strict requirements for air traffic control. It's a two-year process. It's intensive. It's a lot of training,' Randy Babbitt, who served as the 16th administrator of the FAA, told NewsNation. 'You don't just go from the end of your two years to Chicago-O’Hare,' he said. Trump attacked the FAA’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies Thursday, claiming the agency had committed to adding employees with the 'most severe' disabilities because they are part of the 'most underrepresented' portion of the American workforce. He added air traffic controllers needed to be 'geniuses.' What we know about the DC plane crash victims However, Trump later said there is no evidence the collision could be blamed on DEI hires. 'It just could have been,' the president said. Babbitt pushed back on Trump, who blamed former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama for DEI policies. 'I would take great exception. I would also note that there were four years between Obama and Biden when President Trump was president, so I don't know what action he took there, but he certainly was in existence,' he said. When it comes to diversity in the FAA, Babbitt said it does not weigh heavier than skill. 'Airlines hire a lot of people, but not all of them are going to be pilots. The FAA hires a lot of people, not all of them can be controllers,' he said. 'They have very, very high standards to be an air traffic controller, and that's important to remember. Diversity has nothing to do with it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/diversity-atc-hiring-standards-faa/	2025-01-30T17:39:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196164305.jpg?w=900

What is the role of air traffic control at US airports?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump criticized air traffic controllers for not properly directing the military Black Hawk helicopter that collided with an American Airlines passenger jet carrying 64 passengers and crew. Trump questioned the air traffic control tower in a Truth Social post, asking why it did not tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if the pilot saw the plane. 'This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented,' Trump wrote. 'NOT GOOD!!!' In a news conference Thursday, Trump said, 'We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas.' Trump said his administration would ensure 'nothing like this happens again.' What we know about the DC plane crash victims Trump told reporters that the angle of the helicopter was 'unbelievably bad' when the air traffic controller began telling the pilot what to do. Trump also cast blame on the helicopter pilot, claiming the pilot did the opposite of what he was told. 'For some reason, there weren't adjustments made,' Trump said. The role of air traffic control According to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, air traffic controllers ensure the safety of about 2 million passengers per day and about 1 billion per year. The industry’s workforce includes about 4,000 trained employees. Tower controllers are based in glass towers at the nation’s airports and manage air traffic at a range of 3 to 30 miles around the airport. Tower controllers provide pilots with taxiing and takeoff instructions, air traffic clearance and other instructions based on their observations and experience, the association said on its website. FILE - In this Friday Jan. 25, 2019, file photo is the air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport in New York. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) The controllers are tasked with providing separation between landing and department aircraft and transferring control of aircraft to the en-route center controllers. Employees at terminal radar approach control facilities work in radar rooms that are located in the airport towers, the association said. These workers are also responsible for the safe separation of departing aircraft, landing and aircraft maneuvering in the airport environment. NewsNation reached out to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association for comment Thursday, but an email was not immediately returned. Trump's executive order on hiring freezes Almost immediately after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that sparked the freezing of federal civilian employees into positions that were currently open. The order stated that the freeze affects all executive departments and agencies regardless of their sources of operational or programmatic funding. A day later, the White House said that hiring within the Federal Aviation Administration had betrayed the agency's mission 'by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence.' The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure issued a statement after, saying Trump had frozen the hiring of air traffic controllers along with other safety-critical positions.

(Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) In the statement, the committee, led by its ranking member, U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., said that the bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 directed the administration to hire the maximum number of air traffic controllers. He said that Trump's hiring freeze put air travelers at risk. DC plane crash: Trump suggests FAA’s diversity efforts caused safety issues 'Hiring air traffic controllers is the number one safety issue according to the entire aviation industry,' Larsen said in the statement. 'Instead of working to improve aviation safety and lower costs for hardworking American families, the (Trump) Administration is choosing to spread bogus DEI claims to justify this decision. 'I'm not surprised by the President’s dangerous and divisive actions, but the Administration must reverse course. Let’s get back to aviation safety and allow the FAA to do its job protecting the flying public.' Trump said Thursday that his executive order restored the 'very highest standards' of air traffic standards. 'We have to have our smartest people,' Trump told reporters. 'It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. It matters intellect, talent. They have to be naturally talented geniuses.' Air traffic control job shortages In 2023, then Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told NewsNation that one of the biggest issues facing the aviation industry was a lack of air traffic controllers. 'We do see a concern in terms of the availability of enough air traffic control staffers, that you have backups if somebody calls in sick or if there’s a lot of pressure on a particular region or tower. And in some areas, we’re not at the staffing levels that I want us to see,' Buttigieg said in the interview. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg speaks before President Joe Biden during a visit to the U.A. Local 190 Training Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., Friday, Sept. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) On Thursday, Buttigieg criticized Trump's response to the crash, writing on X 'Despicable. As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. He continued: 'President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA. One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.' Black Hawk knew plane was in area before crash: Transportation chief In the 2023, interview, the former transportation secretary told NewsNation that he hoped to see more air traffic controllers in place. 'I'd like to see us have about 3,000 more (air traffic control) than we have right now,' Buttigieg said in 2023. 'Just to be clear, that doesn’t mean there are empty seats in a tower. But, what it does mean is you don’t have the kind of buffer, the kind of redundancy, that you want to.' Did the airport’s location matter? Because of the airport’s proximity to the White House and U.S. Capitol, the amount of restricted airspace around Reagan International Airport is much higher than in other cities, the BBC reported. Aviation consultant Phillip Butterworth-Hayes told the BBC that air traffic involving both commercial airliners and military aircraft makes managing the air space more complex. Butterworth-Hayes called the area 'the most secure' airspace in the world and said that it should be the safest considering the number of security and civilian safety organizations working there, the BBC reported. 'You are at the border of three or four aviation systems here,' he said. 'And it’s at those borders where most accidents tend to happen.' What air traffic controllers saw According to audio recordings of air traffic control conversations that took place, one air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the passenger jet in its sight less than 30 seconds before the collision took place. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told reporters Thursday that the helicopter pilot was at fault, asking why the aircraft had come into the path of the jet. Figure skating community reacts to loss after DC crash Moments after air traffic control asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight, it instructed the helicopter to 'pass behind' the jet,' The Associated Press reported. Air traffic control had directed the pilot of the American Airlines flight to 'take runway 33' at Reagan Airport. According to reports, no response was heard from the helicopter on the ATC audio, but the pilot’s response was heard on a different frequency that is designed for helicopters. The audio also picks up an air traffic controller saying, 'Crash, crash, crash. This is an alert three. Crash, crash, crash.' From there, air traffic controllers began diverting other air traffic away from the area. Audio picks up air traffic controllers saying that the collision took place over the Potomac River as the plane was approaching its assigned runway. One air traffic controller said that all runways were closed and that no planes were moving. 'I just saw a fireball, and then it was just gone,' audio picks up one air traffic controller saying. 'I haven't seen anything since they hit the river. But it was a CRJ and a helicopter that hit, I would say about a half-mile off the approach into 33.'.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/role-air-traffic-control-us-airports/	2025-01-30T11:38:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196738835.jpg?w=900
‘He was a force of nature’: Father of DC crash victim mourns son	(NewsNation) — Douglas Lane, who lost his son, Spencer, in the Washington, D.C., plane crash, said he had dreams of competitive figure skating. '(Spencer) was really just kind of a force of nature,' said Douglas Lane. His father said that despite getting a relatively late start in figure skating, Spencer was determined to follow his passion. 'Even though people train since they're a small child, and it takes them years and years to develop skills, he just started,' said Douglas. 'And three years later, he's in Wichita, Kansas, on the national development team for U.S. figure skating, training with former world champions.' Trump suggests FAA’s diversity efforts caused safety issues in crash The FAA said the midair crash occurred before 9 p.m. ET in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over 3 miles south of the White House and the Capitol. American Airlines Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet and a speed of about 140 mph when it rapidly lost altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. Spencer’s coaches were also on board the flight, according to his father. 'Wonderful people,' Douglas said of the coaches. 'Former world champions from Russia and some other skaters. And so it's just devastating.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/dc-plane-crash-victims-father/	2025-01-30T10:58:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-16-1.jpg?w=900
Reagan Washington airport one of world's most complex airspaces	(NewsNation) — The airspace where a deadly mid-air crash between a passenger plane and a U.S. Army Black Hawk occurred late Wednesday night is one of the most complex and congested in the country. At least 28 bodies had been recovered from the scene Thursday morning. Officials said 27 bodies were recovered from the jet, and one was pulled from the helicopter. Officials expect no survivors from the crash, which would make it the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), located along the Potomac River outside of Washington, D.C., services both military helicopters and passenger planes every day. Audio captures air traffic control at moment of DC crash The airspace is further complicated by the area's two other major airports, multiple military bases and frequent high-profile political voyages. 'You are at the border of three or four aviation systems here — and it's at those borders where most accidents tend to happen,' Aviation consultant Philip Butterworth-Hayes told BBC News, adding that DCA is 'the most controlled bit of airspace in the world.' Ronald Reagan Washington Airport's traffic problem DCA is especially crowded, according to glass manufacturer SageGlass, which partook in renovations at the airport in 2021. The airport was originally designed to accommodate 15 million passengers annually — but it routinely sees more than 23 million passengers in a year. A 2021 Government Accountability Office report reported 88,000 helicopter flights within 30 miles of DCA from 2016-2019, including roughly 33,000 military and 18,000 law enforcement flights, Reuters reports. Despite its packed flight log, the airport has only three runways. The largest, Runway 1/19, is 7,169 feet long, per the airport's official website. The other two runways are around 2,000 feet shorter than 1/19, leading a large majority of incoming flights to utilize one runway. No officials have indicated that congestion caused Wednesday's crash. What we know about the DC plane crash victims Just last year, Congress approved the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act, which increased the number of flights to and from DCA, despite concerns from political and aviation officials. Tim Kaine, D-Va., warned of the safety consequences of more congestion while addressing Congress in May 2024. Kaine's concern came after an incident where two planes nearly collided on a runway, telling lawmakers: 'Thank God a collision and catastrophe was averted. But more and more planes on this busiest runway in the United States is just going to increase the chance of a significant incident.' No survivors expected in DC plane crash Operations at Reagan National Airport have resumed after an American Airlines regional passenger jet carrying 64 people en route from Kansas collided with a military Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, sending both aircraft into the icy Potomac River near Washington, D.C. At least 28 bodies had been recovered from the scene Thursday morning. Officials said 27 bodies were recovered from the jet, and one was pulled from the helicopter. 'We don’t believe there are any survivors,' D.C. fire and EMS chief John A. Donnelly said Thursday during a news conference. The midair crash occurred shortly before 9 p.m. local time Wednesday, shutting down the airport until 11 a.m. Thursday. Part of the investigation will revolve around an interaction with air traffic control in the final moments before the collision.

DC crash map: Paths of American Airlines Flight 5342, UH-60 Black...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The collision Wednesday night between a military helicopter and American Airlines Flight 5342 happened in some of the world's most tightly controlled airspace, just over 3 miles south of the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The collision happened at around 9 p.m. when a regional jet at the end of a flight from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter on a training exercise, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The helicopter was a UH-60 Black Hawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia flying south over the Potomac River as the American Airlines flight was flying north. A few minutes before the jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked American Airlines Flight 5342 if it could do so on a shorter runway, and the pilots agreed. Controllers cleared the jet to land, and flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. What we know about the DC plane crash victims Less than 30 seconds before the collision, an air traffic controller asked a helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later, saying, 'PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ' — apparently telling the copter to wait for the Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet to pass. There was no reply. Seconds after that, the aircraft collided. The plane’s radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the Potomac River.

(NEXSTAR) -- American former ice skater Nancy Kerrigan is speaking to the media after a deadly plane crash in Washington, D.C. left no survivors, including skaters from the Skating Club of Boston. Kerrigan, an Olympic medalist, is an alum of the club. Two teenage figure skaters, their mothers and two world champion coaches from Boston were among the 14 members of the skating community killed when an American Airlines flight collided with an Army helicopter Wednesday night and crashed into the frigid waters of the Potomac River. Skating Club of Boston CEO Doug Zeghibe said Thursday that skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane were among those killed, along with 1994 pairs world champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov. In all, 14 of the victims were coming back from a national development camp for promising young skaters following the U.S. Championships in Wichita, Kansas, Zeghibe said. 'Skating is a very close and tight-knit community. These kids and their parents, they’re here at our facility in Norwood, six, sometimes seven days a week. It’s a close, tight bond,' Zeghibe said. 'This will have long-reaching impacts for our skating community.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/nancy-kerrigan-speaks-at-skating-club-of-boston-following-deadly-plane-crash/	2025-01-30T10:09:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25030540380734_bd7926.jpg?w=900

Who are Evgenia Shishkova, Vadim Naumov? Championship skaters in ...	NEW YORK (PIX11) – Russian figure skaters Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov were aboard a plane that crashed Wednesday in the Potomac River, according to the Kremlin. Shishkova and Naumov were married and won a 1994 world championship in pairs figure skating. The skaters competed for Russia in the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Olympics, according to the Skating Club of Boston, where they are listed as coaches. The pair have been coaching since the late 1990s after their championship run. In addition to the 1994 win, they took home medals at championships worldwide throughout the 90s. Both studied in St. Petersburg, Russia. No survivors expected in passenger jet, Black Hawk crash near DC 'I like to share my passion and love for the sport of figure skating with my students,' Shishkova said in her coaching bio. Naumov spoke in his coaching bio about coaching his students on and off the ice. Both former champions have coached their students through regional and international championship placement. 'I love to create an environment where students have fun while working hard. I also believe that helping and guiding athletes through their emotional challenges, ups and downs during training and competing are coach’s responsibilities,' he said. The pair's death is a devastating blow to the figure skating community. 'The skating community is small - a lot of people know each other or know of each other What happened last night was devastating,' said figure skating analyst Jackie Wong. 'Please keep the families and loved ones of all involved in your thoughts. Be good to one another.' Audio captures air traffic control at moment of DC crash The Skating Club of Boston sent athletes to the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, which concluded Sunday.

Both aircraft went into the icy Potomac River, prompting an extensive search and rescue operation. At least 28 bodies were recovered from the scene Thursday morning. Officials said 27 bodies were recovered from the jet and one was pulled from the helicopter. Officials in D.C. fear there are no survivors. Hegseth announced in a post on X that the Pentagon and Army 'immediately' launched an investigation into the collision, calling the incident 'absolutely tragic.' 'Search and rescue efforts still ongoing,' he said, adding, 'Prayers for all impacted souls, and their families.' Air space was closely monitored making collision ‘unimaginable’: Former NTSB official Hegseth said aviation operations from the U.S. Army in D.C. are on a 48-hour operational pause as the crash is reviewed. 'We anticipate that the investigation will quickly be able to determine whether the aircraft was in the quarter and the right altitude at the time of the incident,' he said.

Here are some of the deadliest plane crashes in US history	An American Airlines jet with 60 passengers and four crew members aboard collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. Everyone aboard was feared dead, officials said Thursday. Fatal crashes of commercial aircraft in the U.S. have become a rarity. The deadliest recent crash was in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. All 45 passengers and the four crew members were killed when the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane crashed into a house. One person on the ground also was killed. The collision Wednesday of the Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine plane and UH-60 Blackhawk occurred over the Potomac River and the aircraft fell into the water. In 1982 an Air Florida flight crashed into the Potomac and killed 78. Here are some of the deadliest commercial plane crashes in the U.S. since the Air Florida disaster according to reports from the National Transportation Safety Board: — Feb. 12, 2009: A Colgan Air plane crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane, including 45 passengers, two pilots and two flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. — Aug. 27, 2006: A Comair aircraft crashed when taking off in Lexington, Kentucky, after it left from the wrong runway and ran off the end. Two crew members and 47 passengers were killed. — Nov. 12, 2001: Just after takeoff, an American Airlines flight crashed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York. All 260 people aboard the plane were killed. — Sept. 11, 2001: Nearly 3,000 people were killed as 19 al-Qaida hijackers seized control of four jetliners, sending two of the planes into New York’s World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the fourth into a field in western Pennsylvania. It remains the deadliest terror attack in history. — Jan. 31, 2000: An Alaska Airlines flight crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Anacapa Island, California. The crash killed 83 passengers and five crew members. — July 17, 1996: A Trans World Airlines flight crashed in the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on its way to Paris, France. All 230 people on board were killed, and the airplane was destroyed. — May 11, 1996: A Valujet Airlines flight crashed into the Everglades about 10 minutes after takeoff from the Miami International Airport. The crash killed all 105 passengers and five crew members. — Oct. 31, 1994: An American Eagle flight in Roselawn, Indiana, crashed, killing 64 passengers and four crew members. — Sept. 8, 1994: A USAir flight crashed while attempting to land in Pittsburgh. It killed 127 passengers and five crew members. The airplane was destroyed by the impact and fire. — July 19, 1989: A United Airlines flight experienced an engine failure and crashed while attempting to land in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 110 passengers and one crew member. — Aug. 16, 1987: A Northwest Airlines flight crashed just after taking off in Romulus, Michigan, striking light poles, a rental car facility and the ground. The crash killed 148 passengers and six crew members. — Aug. 2, 1985: A Delta Air Lines flight crashed when approaching to land at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport during a thunderstorm. It struck a car and two water tanks, and killed 134 passengers and crew members. — July 9, 1982: A Pan American World Airways flight crashed just after takeoff near New Orleans, Louisiana, and collided with trees and houses, killing 145 people onboard. — Jan. 13, 1982: An Air Florida flight plummeted into the Potomac, killing 70 passengers and four crew members. That crash was attributed to bad weather.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ap-here-are-some-of-the-deadliest-plane-crashes-in-us-history/	2025-01-30T06:38:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/679b62de0491a5.11021252.jpeg?w=900
Live: RFK Jr. goes in front of Health committee for 2nd confirmat...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, is going in front of lawmakers for his second confirmation hearing Thursday. He faced senators in the Finance Committee on Wednesday — now he will be questioned by those on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Should Kennedy be confirmed, he will be in charge of a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees insurance for nearly half the country; funnels billions of dollars to the states for Medicaid; and provides health insurance for the nation’s older Americans through Medicare. HELP committee chair Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in his opening statements Thursday, said he agrees with Kennedy on some issues — such as being against ultra-processed food and wanting to reduce obesity. However, Cassidy added, 'it’s no secret I have some reservations about your past positions on vaccines and a couple other issues.' Wednesday's hearing was contentious, with Kennedy grilled over his past remarks on vaccines. Experts say he has a record of spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. What we know about the DC plane crash victims However, Kennedy has tried to downplay these past remarks. 'News reports have claimed that I am anti-vaccine or anti-industry — I am neither. I am pro-safety,' Kennedy said at Wednesday's hearing before being interrupted by a protestor, who was escorted out. Later, Kennedy said he supports the measles and polio vaccine. 'I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking any of those vaccines,' Kennedy said. Still, he made several false claims during the hearing, including about the COVID-19 vaccine, such as that children under six don't need it because they have a 'zero risk' of coronavirus infection. This isn't true: According to several studies, COVID-19 was a leading cause of death for children 1 to 4. The University of Oxford found it ranked seventh as a cause of death among that age group between 2021 and 2022. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends COVID-19 vaccines for those 6 months and older and says the inoculation is safe for children. Kennedy also inaccurately claimed Medicaid is fully paid for by the federal government when in reality, states and federal taxpayers fund it. When it came to the topic of Alzheimer's, Kennedy misstated the state of the science and research, falsely claiming the National Institutes of Health ignores 'any other hypothesis' for it than amyloid. The NIH's $3.8 billion budget for Alzheimer’s and similar dementias includes researching a range of other factors that may underlie how Alzheimer’s develops, the Associated Press reported.

Trump: DC plane crash ‘looks like it should have been prevented’	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump weighed in on the Wednesday evening crash between an American Airlines plane and military helicopter in Washington, claiming it 'should have been prevented.' 'The airplane was on a perfect and routine line of approach to the airport,' he wrote on Truth Social. 'The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time.' 'It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn. Why didn’t the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane,' he continued. 'This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!!' Officials say ‘no survivors’ expected after crash at Reagan National Airport Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed the sentiment during a press conference Thursday morning. 'We are going to wait for all the information to come in from, from this vantage point, but to back up what the president said, what I’ve seen so far, do I think this was preventable? Absolutely,' he said. Duffy also confirmed that both aircraft had been located, and a federal investigation was underway. Their remarks come after a regional jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew collided with a military helicopter, which was on a training mission, just before landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport on Wednesday evening. American Airlines said the flight was en route from Wichita, Kansas. The two aircraft crashed mid-air as the plane was descending to the runway around 9 p.m. local time, according to officials.

Gabbard, RFK Jr., Patel hearings set to consume Capitol Hill	Hearing-mania is set to consume Capitol Hill on Thursday as a trio of President Trump's top allies appear for high-stakes confirmation showdowns with senators that could make or break their chances of getting across the finish line. Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Kash Patel will simultaneously appear for confirmation hearings Thursday morning, setting up a triple-box of events that are set to command the attention of Washington as GOP members try to keep their unblemished run of confirming Trump’s nominees. 'It’s huge,' said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which Kennedy will appear before. 'We’ll separate the men from the boys tomorrow.' Much of the attention will center on Gabbard, Trump’s pick to become director of national intelligence (DNI), whose confirmation odds are considered the shakiest of the president’s selections amid increasing questions from skeptical Senate Republicans, some of whom are on the Intelligence panel. Those questions had largely surrounded her 2017 meeting with since-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad and remarks she’s made about the war between Ukraine and Russia that were considered sympathetic toward Moscow. However, Senate Republicans have also noted concerns about Gabbard’s stance on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for the warrantless surveillance of foreign targets. Gabbard voted against reauthorizing the program as a member of the House and five years ago called for its repeal, but says she has since changed her stance. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), however, does not believe she has actually changed her position. Collins sits on the Intelligence Committee, which will hear from Gabbard on Thursday and then decide whether to advance her to the floor. Gabbard can’t afford to lose any GOP votes in committee, and with Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) also considered a swing vote on the panel Republicans say Gabbard must use Thursday as an opportunity to convince members she is right for the job. 'Hers will be the most watched right off the bat,' said Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) a friend of the DNI nominee. 'She’s going to be the biggest challenge to get through. I was really bullish about [Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth]. I’m very bullish on Kash. I’m very bullish on [Kennedy].' 'We’ve got a lot of work still to do with Tulsi,' Mullin added. 'I still think she can get confirmed, but there’s still some people to talk to.' Republicans are also keeping open the possibility of advancing Gabbard’s nomination to the floor even if she receives an unfavorable recommendation or no recommendation at all, according to Mullin, who is a close ally of both Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.). 'I think the president will want that floor vote,' Mullin added. As for Kennedy, he will appear for the second straight day before a panel of senators, after enduring a grilling from the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday over his nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The former independent presidential candidate-turned-Trump supporter will come before the HELP committee for what is expected to be a second day of intense questioning from Democrats, who targeted him over his history of comments on vaccines and abortion, among other topics. While Finance Committee Republicans, who will vote on his confirmation, appeared largely unmoved on his nomination, there remains one wild card: Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). Cassidy, who sits on the Finance Committee and chairs the HELP panel, and is himself a doctor, attended almost the entirety of Wednesday’s hearing — a rarity for a senator who isn’t chair. His questioning also revealed Kennedy’s unfamiliarity with Medicare and Medicaid, two health care programs he would oversee at HHS. The Louisiana Republican is also up for reelection in 2026 and is staring down a primary challenge after voting to convict Trump over his actions on Jan. 6, 2021. 'There’s a campaign to protect RFK,' one source close to the Trump team said. 'The MAGA verse has been laying down the line, particularly on Cassidy.' 'Cassidy may get the Joni Ernst treatment of, ‘Hey, you better vote for him or you’re going to have a problem,’' the source added, referring to Trump allies pressuring the Iowa Republican to vote for Hegseth’s confirmation. Cassidy declined to take questions about Kennedy after the hearing. Republicans who watched part of the hearing, however, believed Kennedy’s confirmation chances remain in a good spot and that he will ultimately get the green light on the floor. '[Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren] got in his grill pretty hard. He seemed to handle it fine,' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said, adding that Kennedy will be fine if a repeat of Wednesday occurs. 'I don’t think he did any harm to himself.' Patel is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee with the hopes of maintaining his level of GOP support to become the next FBI director in the coming weeks. For all of the comments that alarmed Democrats and some Republicans over the years, Patel has kept a low profile ever since Trump nominated him to the post in November, giving him a boost with GOP members that will control his fate. Democrats, though, have been trying to elevate him in recent weeks with the hopes of spurring the requisite four Republicans to oppose him. 'I think we got a taste of that from last week,' said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a member of both the Judiciary and HELP committees, pointing to Pam Bondi’s hearing to lead the Justice Department that included numerous mentions of Patel. 'I’m sure it will be this series of horror stories and lots of faux outrage,' Hawley continued. 'What he needs to do is … talk about how he’s going to get the FBI back to fighting crime.' Patel will need all of the help he can get on the GOP side as Democrats on the panel are promising a scorched earth affair in a long-shot attempt to take down his nomination. 'We’re going to introduce him to the American people,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), pointing to Patel’s 'enemies list' and plans to get retribution on them, among other reasons. 'And they’re not going to like him.'

Jocelyn Nungaray's mom: Deportations should have started years ag...	(NewsNation) — Alexis Nungaray, mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, says it's been a relief to see President Donald Trump's deportation flights begin. 'This should have happened years ago,' Nungaray told NewsNation's Blake Burman. 'These guys that took Jocelyn's life should have been on a flight just like that.' Nungaray's 12-year-old daughter, Jocelyn, was sexually assaulted and killed in Houston last June. Two Venezuelan men who were in the country illegally have been charged with capital murder for her death. Jocelyn Nungaray’s mom calls for changes at border Nungaray was at the White House on Wednesday as Trump signed the Laken Riley Act, calling the moment 'surreal' and 'bittersweet.' 'It's a tragedy that we have to be here in the first place,' Nungaray said. 'But it's so remarkable that we get to be here in honor of making change.' Deportation flights from the US to Colombia resume after a diplomatic spat The Laken Riley Act — named after a slain Georgia nursing student who was killed by a Venezuelan man in the country illegally — gives federal authorities broader power to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes. Nungaray said she's honoring her daughter's legacy by pushing for better border security: 'Anyone who has any sort of record doesn't belong here.' The Laken Riley Act received bipartisan support — a point U.S. Senator Ted Budd, R-N.C., emphasized in a conversation with NewsNation on Wednesday. 'Americans want our country safe, and they want us prosperous, and today was about safety,' Budd told Elizabeth Vargas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/jocelyn-nungarays-mother-deportations/	2025-01-29T17:23:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Alexis-Nungaray.jpg?w=852
Trump's return-to-work policy could impact a million federal work...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s executive order putting an end to remote work for federal workers is poised to change the job setup of more than a million employees. Half of the federal workforce had been allowed to work remotely as a part of a larger culture shift that occurred during the pandemic. Under new policies, officials estimate that more than 1 million federal workers could be now be impacted, reported The Washington Post. Few agencies have a high volume of employees who can work remotely, government data from the Office of Management and Budget showed. At the Environmental Protection Agency, nearly 98% of 16,000 employees are telework-eligible, with 15% working remotely, reported The Washington Post. In the Department of Veterans Affairs, 26% of 485,000 employees are eligible, with 8% working remotely. However, the Trump administration said it's looking to fill large federal facilities like the Department of Energy, where fewer than 1% of the office spaces are being used, according to the Public Buildings Reform Board. Trump ends remote work, impacting half of federal workers A 2023 Government Accountability Office report said that 17% of the 24 federal agencies are using as little as 9% of federal buildings and only as much as 49% of their building’s capacity. In addition to bringing workers back to the empty desks, Trump says he wants to sell unused federal buildings. However, the shift could cause strain on the agencies if employees leave. It could also hamper opportunities that have helped increase employment for underserved populations, according to a 2023 report from the Office of Personnel Management. Nearly 42,000 veterans and military spouses are teleworking, and 2,250 are doing remote work. About 131,000 individuals with disabilities are able to do telework, and 14,000 can work remotely, the outlet reported. Several unions have pushed back, including one that represents 800,000 federal workers. 'President Trump’s order is a blatant attempt to corrupt the federal government by eliminating employees’ due process rights so they can be fired for political reasons,' said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley. 'It will remove hundreds of thousands of federal jobs from the non-partisan civil service and make them answerable to the will of one man.'
