Luigi Mangione's fellow inmates: Free him, 'conditions suck'	(NewsNation) — NewsNation's Alex Caprariello and Ashleigh Banfield spoke exclusively with prison inmates who called for UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione to be transferred to Rikers Island in New York City. The inmates yelled from their cells during a live broadcast of 'Banfield,' describing the conditions at the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon in Pennsylvania. 'Luigi's conditions suck,' inmates shouted to NewsNation's Caprariello. 'Free Luigi.' They also said Mangione doesn’t have a television in his cell and expressed their desire for him to waive his extradition challenge. United Healthcare CEO killing: Suspect used ‘ghost gun,’ police say Mangione has a cell to himself and is kept away from other inmates. The prison menu, which inmates shouted was 'terrible,' includes fruit, grits, scrambled eggs, and 'porcupine meatballs' for lunch, a dish made from ground beef and rice. Gene Borrello, a former organized crime associate who spent 13 years behind bars, including four at Rikers, described the conditions at the New York City prison as the 'most dangerous in America.' He warns that if Mangione is transferred to Rikers, he will face harsh realities, including substandard food, unsanitary conditions, and safety concerns. 'You have to watch your back every day,' Borrello said on 'Banfield.' 'There's no structure. It's just complete chaos. ... It's nonstop stabbings and gang violence where the cops are scared to come to work. It's a place you want to avoid.' Fingerprints taken from Mangione match those found on a water bottle near the place in New York City where United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot last week. The water bottle was in an alleyway Mangione allegedly ran to after the shooting, sources told NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. Thompson, 50, was killed just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 near a Midtown Hilton Hotel while he was walking to UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting. NYPD officers searched for the gunman in New York and Georgia. On Dec. 9, police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, responded to reports of a man matching authorities’ description of the suspect at a local McDonalds. It was there that Mangione was arrested. The NYPD said Mangione matched the description authorities were searching for and that he had with him a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting. New reporting shows Mangione also had a manifesto and spiral notebook with a 'to-do' list. Mangione allegedly wrote in the manifesto he acted alone and that he 'apologizes for any strife or traumas, but it had to be done.' 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' the manifesto says. Luigi Mangione’s extradition hearing As he was escorted into a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday after his arrest, Mangione shouted to reporters gathered outside. 'It’s completely an injustice and an insult to the American people,' he said. During his extradition hearing Tuesday, Mangione tried to interrupt and talk with his attorney, Thomas Dickey. The state of Pennsylvania is pursuing a governor’s warrant for 26-year-old Mangione. That process could take 30 days, especially as Mangione is trying to fight it.

Six-time Super Bowl champion Bill Belichick to be named UNC footb...	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (WNCN) – One of the greatest to ever work the sidelines on the gridiron is set to join the college ranks in Chapel Hill. Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick, who led the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl titles, will be the next head football coach at the University of North Carolina, according to Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network and NFL.com. 'The deal is done,' Rapoport posted on social media around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday. The 72-year-old coach stepped away from football this year after parting ways with the Patriots following the 2023 season. CBS 17 first learned of Belichick's consideration from Inside Carolina. PREVIOUS: Bill Belichick interviewed for UNC’s vacant head football coach job, report says He’s set to replace Mack Brown, who was fired nearly two weeks ago after six years leading the Tar Heels. Under Brown’s tutelage, UNC compiled a 44-33 overall record during his second stint at the school, ending this season at 6-6. Brown, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2018, concluded his time with the Tar Heels as the winningest coach among active FBS head coaches, accumulating a career record of 282-149 between his stints at Tulane, Texas and UNC. The 73-year-old also finished his tenure winning a program-record 113 games. UNC tight ends coach and run game coordinator Freddie Kitchens, a former head coach of the Cleveland Browns, is currently slated as the Tar Heels’ interim coach in preparation for their upcoming bowl game against UConn later this month. READ MORE: What led to UNC’s decision to fire head football coach Mack Brown? Belichick, who’s only about seven months younger than Brown, arrives at UNC during a turbulent and ever-changing landscape in college football, amid the rise of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes as well as free player movement through the transfer portal era. He even has slight ties to the university, dating back to when his father, Steve Belichick, spent two seasons as UNC's backfield coach between 1953 and 1955. A photo of Belichick inside Kenan Memorial Stadium as a child went viral on Monday after being shared during a media appearance on ESPN. This marks the first time Belichick has ever worked at the collegiate level, following monumental success alongside quarterback Tom Brady across most of his historic 24-year tenure with the Patriots. Since departing from New England, he's been in the running for other NFL job openings, most notably the Atlanta Falcons back in January. On Monday, the Super Bowl-winning coach appeared on 'The Pat McAfee Show,' saying he had 'a couple of good conversations' with UNC Chancellor Lee Roberts amid recent speculation of him being linked to the job opening. READ MORE: All the connections Bill Belichick has with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 'I've had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor Roberts and we’ve had a couple of good conversations,' Belichick said. 'So we’ll see how it goes.' Although he didn’t go into extensive detail about his UNC discussions, Belichick broke down the parallels between overseeing an NFL franchise and running a college program, especially now that players can profit off their athletic exploits with endorsements and revenue sharing on the horizon. 'If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,' Belichick said Monday. 'It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching, techniques that would transfer to the NFL.' 'It would be an NFL program at a college level,' he added. The exact contract details regarding Belichick’s hiring are unknown at this time.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/bill-belichick-unc-football-coach/	2024-12-11T15:05:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1789394659.jpg?w=900
Missing woman Hannah Kobayashi found safe: family	(NewsNation) — The family of missing Hawaii woman Hannah Kobayashi said in a statement she has been found safe. 'We are incredibly relieved and grateful that Hannah has been found safe. This past month has been an unimaginable ordeal for our family, and we kindly ask for privacy as we take the time to heal and process everything we have been through,' the statement said. The family has spoken to Kobayashi but has not elaborated further on her disappearance. Kobayashi was reported missing after she didn't board a connecting flight during her trip from Hawaii to New York. She was spotted in a few locations in Los Angeles before disappearing, sparking a search. Family members were sent strange texts from her phone before she cut off contact. She was seen on Los Angeles at the Grove Market and near the stadium where the LA Lakers play, accompanied by an unknown man. That man later spoke to police about his encounter with Kobayashi. Kobayashi's family initially feared she may have been trafficked. During the search, photos that appeared to show Kobayashi getting married also raised fears that she could have been a victim of a green card marriage scam. While searching for her, Kobayashi's father took his own life. Police later announced that Kobayashi intentionally missed her flight and believed she had gone to Mexico of her own accord. No further information on her whereabouts has been released. This is a developing story.

FBI Director Christopher Wray to step down	(NewsNation) — FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he is stepping down as FBI director at the end of the current administration. Wray announced his plan to leave his role at a townhall meeting for FBI employees. He said his goal is to keep the focus on the agency's mission and that stepping down is the best way for him to avoid dragging the FBI into political division. An FBI official told NewsNation the meeting was standing room only in Washington, D.C., and received a standing ovation that lasted more than a minute. 'After weeks of careful thought, I’ve decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on our mission — the indispensable work you’re doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,' he said. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: Suspect’s fingerprints link him to scene The move clears the way for President-elect Donald Trump to appoint a new director. Trump previously announced plans to nominate Kash Patel for the role. Wray's term as director was not set to end until 2027 but Trump has repeatedly said he would fire Wray, citing the agency's involvement in executing a search warrant for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Trump has repeatedly referred to the incident as a raid. 'When you look at where the threats are headed, it’s clear that the importance of our work — keeping Americans safe and upholding the Constitution — will not change. And what absolutely cannot, must not change is our commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time. Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law — those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change,' Wray said. 'That’s the real strength of the FBI — the importance of our mission, the quality of our people, and their dedication to service over self. It’s an unshakeable foundation that’s stood the test of time, and cannot be easily moved. And it — you, the men and women of the FBI — are why the Bureau will endure and remain successful long into the future.' Trump responded to Wray's resignation on Truth Social. 'The resignation of Christopher Wray is a great day for America as it will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice. I just don’t know what happened to him. We will now restore the Rule of Law for all Americans,' he said. 'Under the leadership of Christopher Wray, the FBI illegally raided my home, without cause, worked diligently on illegally impeaching and indicting me, and has done everything else to interfere with the success and future of America. They have used their vast powers to threaten and destroy many innocent Americans, some of which will never be able to recover from what has been done to them. Kash Patel is the most qualified Nominee to lead the FBI in the Agency’s History, and is committed to helping ensure that Law, Order, and Justice will be brought back to our Country again, and soon. As everyone knows, I have great respect for the rank-and-file of the FBI, and they have great respect for me. They want to see these changes every bit as much as I do but, more importantly, the American People are demanding a strong, but fair, System of Justice. We want our FBI back, and that will now happen. I look forward to Kash Patel’s confirmation, so that the process of Making the FBI Great Again can begin. Thank you!' Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-IA, noted that Wray's resignation came after a letter from Grassley demanding the director step down. 'Reform is badly needed at FBI American ppl deserve TRANSPARENCY &amp; ACCOUNTABILITY,' he said. Wray has faced grilling from House Republicans who have accused him of politicizing the agency. Wray was himself appointed by Trump to replace former FBI Director James Comey, but Trump soured on him after the Justice Department began investigations into the former president after he left office. This is a developing story. Check back for more details.

FBI says it has no answers for drones seen over New Jersey	EWING, N.J. (NewsNation) — The FBI says it has no answers as to the dozens of drones reported at night across New Jersey in recent weeks. The agency has been investigating reports about the mysterious nighttime drone flights that started occurring last month across central New Jersey and has asked the public for help. Since then, residents have reported seeing drones in other areas. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said during a Wednesday briefing there is 'no evidence these are coming from a foreign entity of the work of an adversary.' She also refuted a claim by U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew who said the drones were being launched by an Iranian mothership. 'No there is not any truth to that,' said Singh. While speaking at an unrelated bill signing event in Princeton, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy noted there were 49 reports of drones on Sunday, mostly in Hunterdon County. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect fights extradition New Jersey State Rep. Brian Bergen told NewsNation he’s not getting enough information from officials. 'There were no answers,' he said. 'Every question that was asked by members of the state legislature? No answers. No resolution. They don’t know where the drones are coming from. They don’t know who is doing it. They don’t know why they’re doing it. But they say there’s no credible threat.' Middletown Mayor Tony Perry said a recent reported sighting over Naval Weapons Station Earle was particularly concerning. 'We had one confirmed drone directly over the top of Earle,' he told NewsNation. 'If anybody knows Naval Weapons Station Earle, if you come within 500 feet of Earle, they’re already authorized to fire upon you when you’re just a fishing boat. Unfortunately, it seems like we’re unable to take any action when a foreign, unauthorized drone is flying above.' Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Drone operators also must be FAA certified. Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists. Nancy Mace allegedly attacked on Capitol Hill; suspect arrested The flights initially raised questions in part because they took place near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas, and some of the devices were recently spotted over a large reservoir in Clinton. The FBI asks that residents share any videos or photos they may have of the flights, along with any other relevant information.

Fentanyl found inside dead dolphins in Gulf of Mexico	(NewsNation) — Traces of fentanyl were found inside bottlenose dolphins who were found dead in the Gulf of Mexico, raising concerns that the deadly drug may be affecting other sea life. Researchers from Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi found traces of fentanyl and other illegal substances were found in the six dolphins that were found dead. Fentanyl found in dead dolphins The research team studied 89 dolphins, from three areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Of the 89 dolphins that were studied, 30 contained traces of having drugs in their system, including 24 that had traces of fentanyl. The research found that the trace of fentanyl detected in the mammals was not necessarily the cause of death. Who gets $60K reward money in UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? Researchers say they don’t know where the fentanyl is coming from but given the proximity of the Mexican border to where the dolphins were found, drug smuggling via the waterway could be one possible source. Authorities say that drug smugglers have been using the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico for years. This summer, the Mexican Navy pulled 1.6 tons of suspected cocaine from the water. Researchers think other animals could have drugs in their systems The university said that the findings indicate that pharmaceuticals have become emerging micropollutants and are a growing global concern. Dara Orbach, the study’s lead author said that the fatty blubber of dolphins is a good indicator of levels of ocean pollutants because it can store contaminants and be sampled relatively minimally invasively in live animals. Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi said they don’t think the dolphins with drugs found inside them are alone. A previous study discovered that sharks were also found to have cocaine in their system. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect fights extradition	(NewsNation) — The legal representation for Luigi Mangione, who is charged with murder in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is trying to block his extradition to New York from Pennsylvania. The state of Pennsylvania is pursuing a governor’s warrant for 26-year-old Mangione, who is currently at the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon. That process could take 30 days, especially now that Mangione is trying to fight it. As he was escorted into a Pennsylvania courthouse Tuesday, Mangione shouted to reporters gathered outside. Nancy Mace allegedly attacked on Capitol Hill; suspect arrested 'It’s completely an injustice and an insult to the American people,' he said. During his extradition Tuesday, Mangione tried to interrupt and talk with his attorney, Thomas Dickey. Dickey told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo that he believes that Mangione will plead not guilty. 'We've seen no evidence. We've seen nothing,' Dickey said on 'CUOMO' Tuesday. 'I don’t want people to jump to these prejudgment things because nobody would ever want that if they were accused, or one of their loved ones were accused.' Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting In the months leading up to the shooting, Mangione's mother reported him missing to police in San Francisco, California, the New York Police Department's Chief of Patrol, John Chell, said. Mangione's mother told law enforcement that her son wasn't returning phone calls and text messages or posting on social media. Several GoFundMe accounts have been set up so people can donate to pay Mangione's legal bills. GoFundMe says they are quickly working to shut these down.

Luigi Mangione reported missing 2 weeks before CEO slain: Police	Editor’s note: The video above aired on Dec. 10, 2024. NEW YORK (WPIX) – The parents of Luigi Mangione, the man suspected of shooting and killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, told law enforcement that they hadn't heard from their son in months. Mangione's mother reported him missing to San Francisco police two weeks before Thompson's slaying in Midtown, according to John Chell, New York Police Department Chief of Patrol. Mangione, 26, appeared in a Pennsylvania court on Wednesday, where he contested his extradition to New York to face murder and other charges. Who was Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO? 'This is completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people,' Mangione said as he was led into court. He wants a hearing on the extradition, according to Mangione's attorney, Thomas Dickey. 'I don’t want people to jump to these pre-judgment things because nobody would ever want that if they were accused, or one of their loved ones were accused,' Dickey said in an interview with NewsNation. 'And the big hearing today, I haven’t seen any evidence yet. I don’t even know if this is him or whatever. So we’re going to test those waters and give the government a chance to bring some evidence.' The NYPD is working to assemble a timeline and trace Mangione's whereabouts before and after the shooting. He was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Who gets $60K reward money in UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? Chell said authorities are reviewing considerable evidence, including what's described as a handwritten manifesto. The document that Mangione had on him at the time of his arrest said, 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming. I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. I wasn’t working with anyone,' sources told NewsNation affiliate WPIX. Mangione intends to plead not guilty to all accusations against him, his attorney said.

Blinken testifying at committee hearing on Afghanistan withdrawal	(NewsNation) — The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committee is set to hear Secretary of State Antony Blinken speak on the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal on Wednesday. Thirteen U.S. service members and 170 Afghans died in a suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate entrance of Hamid Karzai International Airport during the withdrawal. Lawmakers have been demanding answers about how such a significant operation could have gone so wrong. A committee aide tells NewsNation that members of the Foreign Affairs committee plan on asking Blinken about the role he played in the chaotic evacuations, as well as who had top authority over the withdrawal and why the State Department kept the U.S. Embassy open. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting The committee says the hearing is a culmination of three years of investigations into the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Blinken was asked to testify before the committee several times. Republican representatives tried earlier this year to hold him in contempt of Congress for not complying with a subpoena to appear. The State Department, meanwhile, says they have provided Foreign Affairs committee members with large amounts of information and that Blinken has testified before Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times. A report by GOP representatives on the Foreign Affairs Committee was released in September, accusing the Biden administration of failing to see warning signs about how quickly Kabul would fall to the Taliban, as well as delaying an evacuation, NewsNation's partner The Hill reported. White House officials, in response, said House Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul, R-Texas, was cherry-picking details and not placing enough blame on President-elect Donald Trump. The Taliban overtook Kabul only days into the evacuation from Afghanistan, and an estimated 100,000 partners of U.S. government efforts were left behind, The Hill reported.

US inflation ticked up last month as some price pressures remain ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Fueled by pricier used cars, hotel rooms and groceries, inflation in the United States moved slightly higher last month in the latest sign that some price pressures remain elevated. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in November from a year earlier, up from a yearly figure of 2.6% in October. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices increased 3.3%, the same as in the previous month. Measured month to month, prices climbed 0.3% from October to November, the biggest such increase since April. Core prices also rose 0.3% for a fourth straight month. Wednesday's inflation figures from the Labor Department are the final major piece of data that Federal Reserve officials will consider before they meet next week to decide on interest rates. The relatively mild November increase won’t likely be enough to discourage the officials from cutting their key rate by a quarter-point. The probability of a rate cut next week, as envisioned by Wall Street traders, rose to 98% after Wednesday’s inflation report was released, according to futures pricing tracked by CME FedWatch. The Fed slashed its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, by a sizable half-point in September and by a quarter-point in November. Those cuts lowered the central bank’s key rate to 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3%. Though inflation is now way below its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, average prices are still about 20% higher than they were three years ago — a major source of public discontent that helped drive President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Grocery prices jumped last month, an uncomfortable reminder for consumers that food prices remain a big drag on households' budgets. Beef prices leapt 3.1% just from October to November and are up 5% from a year earlier. Egg prices, which have been volatile for more than two years, in part because of outbreaks of bird flu, soared 8.2% just last month. They are nearly 38% higher than a year ago. Gas prices ticked up 0.6% from October to November, ending a string of declines. Still, gas is down more than 8% from a year earlier. Hotel prices leapt 3.2% from October to November and are 3.7% higher than a year ago. But one key category that has been pushing prices up showed welcome signs of cooling in November: Rental prices ticked up just 0.2%, the smallest increase since July 2021. A measure of housing costs also rose by just 0.2%, the mildest rise since April 2021. Fed officials have made clear that they expect inflation to fluctuate along a bumpy path even as it gradually cools toward their target level. In speeches last week, several of the central bank’s policymakers stressed their belief that with inflation having already fallen so far, it was no longer necessary to keep their benchmark rate quite as high. Typically, the Fed cuts rates to try to stimulate the economy enough to maximize employment yet not so much as to drive inflation high. But the U.S. economy appears to be in solid shape. It grew at a brisk 2.8% annual pace in the July-September quarter, bolstered by healthy consumer spending. That has led some Wall Street analysts to suggest that the Fed doesn’t actually need to cut its key rate further. But Chair Jerome Powell has said that the central bank is seeking to 'recalibrate' its rate to a lower setting, one more in line with tamer inflation. In addition, hiring has slowed a bit in recent months, raising the risk that the economy could weaken in the coming months. Additional rate cuts by the Fed could offset that risk. One possible threat to the Fed’s efforts to keep inflation down is Trump’s threat to impose widespread tariffs on U.S. imports — a move that economists say would likely send inflation higher. Trump has said he could impose tariffs of 10% on all imports and 60% on goods from China. As a consequence, economists at Goldman Sachs have forecast that core inflation would amount to 2.7% by the end of 2025. Without tariffs, they estimate it would drop to 2.4%. When the Fed’s meeting ends Wednesday, it will not only announce its interest rate decision. The policymakers will also issue their latest quarterly projections for the economy and interest rates. In September, they projected four rate cuts for 2025. The officials will likely scale back that figure next week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/ap-us-inflation-likely-edged-up-last-month-though-not-enough-to-deter-another-fed-rate-cut/	2024-12-11T06:10:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675996dd393761.99778998.jpeg?w=900
Luigi Mangione’s lawyer: No evidence he shot UnitedHealthcare CEO	(NewsNation) — Thomas Dickey, Luigi Mangione's lawyer, tells NewsNation that 'I haven't seen any evidence' backing up accusations his client shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York last week. 'I don’t want people to jump to these prejudgment things because nobody would ever want that if they were accused, or one of their loved ones were accused,' Dickey said exclusively on 'CUOMO' Tuesday. The attorney pointed out that the ghost gun found on Mangione when he was arrested at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald's Monday has not definitively been matched to the one used in Thompson's death. 'I haven't been certainly made aware of that. I haven't seen any holistic report,' he said. 'So, if you've seen that already, then that's interesting because I certainly haven't seen that.' Luigi Mangione ‘brilliant-minded,’ nonviolent: Acquaintances Investigators said Mangione matched the description of the ID they were searching for and was found in possession of several items they believe would connect him to the shooting. Those allegedly include a mask, firearm, suppressor, fake New Jersey ID that investigators believe was used to check into a hostel in New York and a handwritten document speaking to his motivation. Dickey emphasized that he'd only started representing his client for about '12 hours' before the TV interview and apologized that his lack of knowledge of the rumors circulating about Mangione may 'disappoint' many. 'I got to look at evidence and, you know, not going to go by conjecture and opinions and speculation, what people think,' he explained. Luigi Mangione's lawyer: 'He's entitled to bail' Dickey also pointed to Pennsylvania law that classifies most crimes — except for capital punishment cases or when punishment includes life without parole — as bailable offenses. In Pennsylvania, Mangione was charged Monday with forgery, carrying firearms without a license, having 'instruments of a crime,' tampering with records or information and false identification to law enforcement. Later that day, Manhattan prosecutors filed a second-degree murder charge, among others, against Mangione, according to an online court docket obtained by NewsNation. Luigi Mangione charged with murder in UnitedHealthcare shooting On Tuesday, a judge denied Mangione bail. The state of Pennsylvania is pursuing a governor's warrant to transfer him to New York and has 30 days to do so. Dickey said that in Pennsylvania, a second-degree murder charge doesn't warrant life without parole. '[Because of] those two exclusions, he's entitled to bail,' Dickey said. 'Whether it's $10 billion or $10,000 or whatever, the judge had that discretion, but he should have set bail.' Lawyer describes meeting accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Dickey recalled his first meeting with Mangione, telling NewsNation's Chris Cuomo he intended to 'develop a relationship, a bond,' with his client rather than assess him or his mental state. 'He seemed to understand my questions. He seemed to be able to interact with me, and so I was pleased with that,' he said. When asked about Mangione's mood, Dickey said to use your 'common sense' about how one accused of such a crime would feel. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ Dickey also addressed the public Tuesday afternoon in a press conference from his law firm in Altoona, Pennsylvania, roughly 35 miles from the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon, where Mangione is currently being held without bail as he attempts to fight extradition to New York. Dickey, who took on the case Tuesday, refused to clarify who hired him during that press conference. Mangione will remain in the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon until a governor’s warrant is secured. Blair County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Peter Weeks said both Pennsylvania and New York’s governors feel confident they can obtain a governor's warrant before the deadline. Who is Luigi Mangione? Mangione had no prior criminal record. A spokesperson with the University of Pennsylvania confirmed that Mangione attended and graduated with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering. NewsNation local affiliate WPIX confirmed that Mangione was employed as the head counselor for the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies program in 2019. The Mangione family issued a statement following his arrest. 'Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,' the statement said. 'We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.'

Pepperdine student feared for his life amid Franklin Fire	(NewsNation) — Pepperdine University students were among many Malibu residents subjected to the Franklin Fire currently raging in Southern California. Crews with the Los Angeles County Fire Department responded to the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, near Malibu Canyon Road and Station Boundary at around 10:45 p.m. As of 2 a.m., the fire was mapped at 853 acres with no containment. The cause of the fire was under investigation. Nicholas Gerding, a student at Pepperdine University, joined 'NewsNation Now' to discuss how close the Franklin wildfire came to their shelter-in-place spot on campus. What to know about the fast-moving Franklin Fire 'The worst part was when it was right up against the windows of the library, and that was the scariest because they ordered us to stay away from those windows, and we all kind of huddled in the middle of the library for about 30 minutes before those fires were kind of taken care of,' Gerding said. 'There were about 30 minutes where I genuinely did not know if I was going to be okay or not. ... It was really looking like it wasn't going to go well, and coming to terms with the fact my life might end today was a hard 30 minutes to sit through and kind of manage,' he added. Shelter-in-place orders have since been lifted, with students either choosing to leave campus, return to their dorms or remain in the library, according to Gerding.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/pepperdine-student-franklin-fire/	2024-12-10T15:03:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2189204759.jpg?w=900
NJ governor taking unidentified drone flights 'deadly seriously'	New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) said that he is taking unidentified drone flights in his state 'deadly seriously.' 'These are apparently … as I understand it, very sophisticated,' Murphy told a group of reporters in a clip posted to the social platform X Monday. Live: House panel holds drone hearing 'The minute you get eyes on them, they go dark. And, you know, we’re obviously most concerned about sensitive targets and sensitive, critical infrastructure. We’ve got military assets, we’ve got utility assets, we’ve got the president-elect’s, one of his homes, here. This is something we’re taking deadly seriously,' he added. Last week, in a post on X, Murphy said he 'convened a briefing' featuring Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as well as other important figures in the Department of Homeland Security, New Jersey government 'and members of our congressional delegation to discuss reported drone activity over parts of North and Central New Jersey.' 'We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter. There is no known threat to the public at this time,' Murphy added. In the clip posted to X on Monday, the Garden State governor told reporters that he and other officials 'don’t see any concern for public safety.' FBI investigating reports of large drones flying in New Jersey, seeks public’s help 'It’s really frustrating that we don’t have more answers as to where they’re coming from and why they’re doing what they’re doing,' Murphy said in the clip. The FBI’s field office in Newark, N.J., said last Tuesday that they, alongside New Jersey authorities 'are asking for the public to report any information related to the recent sightings of possible drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River.' 'Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,' the field office added in a release.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/new-jersey-drone-flights/	2024-12-10T12:56:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24157731297026-e1717682524417.jpg?w=900
What to know about the fast-moving Franklin Fire	(NewsNation) — Firefighters are continuing to battle the Franklin Fire, which has led to mandatory evacuation orders for nearly 10,000 Malibu, California residents living in the area around Pepperdine University. Los Angeles County fire crews are fighting the blaze, which was dubbed the Franklin Fire, and has been mapped at 853 acres with no containment. Fire officials said that as of Tuesday morning, the fire has burned nearly 2,600 areas as of Tuesday. Alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter denied bail Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters on Tuesday that 18,000 people have been affected by the fire and that 8,100 structures are in the affected areas. Of those structures, 2,043 are under mandatory evacuation orders while 6,046 are under evacuation warnings. Here’s what is known about the fire at this time. Where is the Franklin Fire? The fire was reported in the Malibu Canyon near South Malibu Canyon Road and Francisco Ranch Road, which is located near Pepperdine University. Cal Fire officials announced that the fire had spread across the Pacific Coast Highway (Highway 1) and was moving toward the Malibu Pier. The pier is a popular tourist destination that is popular among locals and surfers. Malibu is located nearly 37 miles outside of Los Angeles.

Fire officials said that as of Tuesday afternoon, the fire has burned 2,593 acres. The fire started affecting only about 10 acres, CalFire officials said but has continued to spread due to the high winds. Conditions are not expected to improve until at least Wednesday, officials said. Where could the Franklin Fire travel to? The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that Californians are urged to remain vigilant and that 'critical fire conditions' were expected to affect many areas east of Los Angeles and Ventura counties as well as the Inland Empire, San Diego County valleys, and Inland Orange County areas through Wednesday.

(AP Photo/Ethan Swope) What schools, businesses, and neighborhoods have evacuated because of the fire? Pepperdine University canceled classes and issued a shelter-in-place order due to the surrounding area being affected by the blaze. Residents in several Malibu neighborhoods and surrounding communities have had their power shut off as utility workers are hoping to mitigate the effects of the high Santa Ana winds. Jamie Foxx opens up about ‘medical complication’ in new comedy special A university spokesperson told NewsNation affiliate KTLA that the university is 'well-designed' to protect people at the center of its campus. The shelter-in-place order has been lifted as of Tuesday. Cal Fire officials have said that more than 10,000 Malibu residents are affected by the evacuation order and that about 8,100 structures are impacted, the Los Angeles County sheriff said Tuesday. The New York Times reported that the evaluation orders extended to the western border of Los Angeles and included much of the Santa Monica mountains.

Hong) In addition to Pepperdine University, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District closed all of its schools in Malibu. The district said that the closures were due to the fire and 'other fire concerns'. The closures affected two elementary schools, a middle school and Malibu High School. Residents have been asked to avoid using their sprinklers or irrigating their lawns as that water may be needed to fight the fire. Pacific Coast Highway between Kanan Dume Road and Topanga Canyon Boulevard has been shut down until further notice, the California Highway Patrol announced on Tuesday. Has anyone died in the Franklin Fire? No deaths or serious injuries have been reported since the fire broke out. A Pepperdine spokesperson told The New York Times that damage to the campus is minimal and that none of the university’s 3,000 students and faculty members who were sheltered in place were injured. Local law enforcement officials said that several structures have sustained damage or have been destroyed due to the fire, but that no further details about the number of buildings that sustained damage were available. The Los Angeles Fire Department said that a 'minimal number' of homes have been destroyed. What started the Franklin Fire? Fire officials have not announced the cause of the fire. However, the National Weather Service on Monday issued a Red Flag warning for areas East of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, KTLA reported. The weather service announced that warm Santa Ana winds produced gusts of up to 80 mph. AccuWeather officials announced that the dry air and dry vegetation are creating conditions that are conducive to new fires spreading out of control. Has air quality been affected by the Franklin Fire? Smoke generated by the Franklin Fire has diminished the air quality in Malibu and in surrounding communities, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said. Smoke was largely spreading west over the Pacific Ocean, but was spread over Los Angeles throughout the day on Tuesday, the agency said. A Wildfire Smoke Advisory was released by the agency, which runs through 5 p.m. local time on Wednesday. The fire is actively producing smoke with winds pushing the smoke toward Malibu. Sensors showed that levels put the air quality in the unhealthy to hazardous category, the agency said. Smoke is most likely to affect Northwest coastal Los Angeles County, including Malibu. The alert said that some smoke impacts may occur in parts of the San Fernando Valley, Santa Monica, downtown Los Angeles, and nearby areas on Wednesday afternoon as winds shift to come from the southwest.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/what-know-about-franklin-fire/	2024-12-10T12:05:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345369331608.jpg?w=900
Timeline of UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect's movements	(NewsNation) — After a search that spanned multiple states, Luigi Mangione, 26, was named as the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Thompson, 50, was killed near a Hilton Hotel while walking to UnitedHealth Group's annual investor meeting in New York City last Wednesday. An official motive has not yet been revealed for the shooting, but the words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene, police sources told NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. These words are similar to the title of the book 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which is about the ways insurance companies reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. UnitedHealthcare has the highest claim denial rate among insurance companies. It rejects 32% of all claims compared to the industry average of 16%. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ United Healthcare was being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegedly running a monopoly and unfairly blocking out competitors. In addition, Thompson, as well as other executives at United Healthcare, were being sued over allegations they sold shares of stock in the company before the probe by the DOJ was announced. Thompson, 50, was a father of two. After becoming CEO of UnitedHealthcare in 2021, he helped the company bring in $281 billion in profits in 2023. Between his salary and other benefits, Thompson made an estimated $10 million last year. This undated photo provided by UnitedHealth Group shows UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson. (AP Photo/UnitedHealth Group via AP) Here are the events surrounding Mangione's arrest on Monday. Nov. 24 On this date, the suspected shooter arrived in New York City on a Greyhound bus at the Port Authority terminal. Police said the bus originated in Atlanta, Georgia. The suspect took a taxi to a New York hostel and checked in using an ID that authorities believe was fake. Surveillance video shows the man, at one point, pulling down his facemask and smiling while talking to an employee in the hostel lobby. Nov. 29 The suspect checked out of the hostel — but police believe this was an administrative check-out as he did not show up at the required time. He checked back into the same hostel the next day. Police say he did not stay somewhere else during this time. Dec. 4 The suspect left the hostel before dawn and then was seen on video around the area of the Hilton. At some point, he went to a Starbucks, and then returned to the hotel. Just before 7 a.m., Thompson was shot in the back and leg by the gunman. Thompson was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the shooter was 'lying in wait,' and arrived at the Hilton five minutes before Thompson. Many people passed him, but the gunman appeared to wait for his intended target,' Tisch told reporters at a press conference. During the press conference, police shared surveillance photos of the suspect holding a gun and fleeing the scene on a bicycle. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting Dec. 6 Investigators say the suspect entered the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, leading them to believe he had left New York City. However, they did not find a video of him leaving or getting on a bus. A backpack that police say is the gunman's is found in a wooded area of Central Park. It is later revealed to contain a jacket and Monopoly money. Dec. 7-8 Officers from the New York Police Department continued searching Central Park, and released more photos of the suspect next to and in the back seat of a taxi. NYPD divers looked in Central Park Lake for the weapon used to kill Thompson. Dec. 9 Altoona, Pennsylvania police responded to reports of a man matching the description of the suspect at a local McDonald's. Responding officers said the man was acting suspiciously. Authorities then arrested Luigi Magione, 26, initially charging him with forgery, carrying firearms without a license, having 'instruments of a crime,' tampering with records or information and false identification to law enforcement. Court records show a murder charge was added hours after. The NYPD revealed Mangione’s name at a press conference. Mangione matched the description authorities were searching for and also had with him a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting, police said.

Alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter's manifesto to be evidence	(NewsNation) — Alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione's manifesto will be used as evidence, an NYPD source told NewsNation. Mangione is facing second-degree murder charges in New York in connection with the shooting. Luigi Mangione's alleged manifesto The document has been described as two to three pages long and talks about the insurance industry. Quotes include, 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming' and 'I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done.' Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting The document also states he was not working with anyone else. 'To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn’t working with anyone,' it reads. Mangione, 26, was arrested on Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after being spotted at a McDonald's on firearms charges related to a ghost gun he allegedly had on him when arrested. The NYPD told NewsNation they have not finished interviewing Mangione about the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson but believe the gun found on him when he was arrested is the gun used in the murder.

McDonald's in Pennsylvania slammed with bad reviews after arrest ...	ALTOONA, Pa. (WTAJ) -- A McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, is getting backlash online after an employee called 911, leading to the arrest of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was taken into custody at the McDonald's on Monday morning after a customer noticed a man in the back of the store with a mask, laptop and backpack. The customer then went to an employee who in turn called 911. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ Calls for Luigi Mangione to be freed Since the arrest, social media has lit up with calls for Mangione to be freed, which has led to users leaving bad reviews for the fast-food restaurant, even if they've likely never been there. While some want to praise Mangione, Gov. Josh Shapiro was vocal against 'vigilante justice' and said he's 'not a hero.' A recurring theme for the reviews is 'rats,' which likely refers to the employee 'ratting out' Mangione by calling 911. Others are also calling it 'noisy' because 'employees talk too much,' again, likely referring to the employee talking to dispatch/police. Luigi Mangione charged with murder in UnitedHealthcare shooting 'Full of rats. Untrustworthy staff. Nobody stays in their lane,' one reviewer said on Facebook. 'Mcdiarrrhea of the mouth here. Would not recommend. Unsafe food served by unsafe ppl. Curious what insurance plans employees get working here,' one user from Illinois wrote on Yelp. 'This McDonald's location is dealing with a serious rat problem. They have rats working the register,' said another from New York on Yelp. Yelp has shut down reviews for the location, citing 'unusual activity.' UnitedHealthcare shooting arrest: 'Review bombing' The following statement pops up when visiting the page: 'This business recently received increased public attention, which often means people come to this page to post their views on the news. While we don’t take a stand one way or the other when it comes to this incident, we’ve temporarily disabled the posting of content to this page as we work to investigate whether the content you see here reflects actual consumer experiences rather than the recent events. Please note that we apply this same policy regardless of the business and regardless of the topic at issue. Read more on Yelp Support. Luigi Mangione ‘brilliant-minded,’ nonviolent: Acquaintances If you’re here to leave a review based on a first-hand experience with the business, please check back at a later date.' The 'review bombing' of the store has led to Yelp showing a 1-star rating for the location. Meanwhile, poor reviews continue to flood the 'McDonald's (Altoona, PA)' Facebook page. UnitedHealthcare shooting reward It was unknown whether the employee who called 911 or the customer who alerted them would receive the $50,000 reward offered by the FBI or the $10,000 reward from the NYPD for information leading to an arrest in Thompson’s slaying.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/luigi-mangione-arrest-mcdonalds-bad-reviews/	2024-12-10T09:26:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/McDonalds-on-Plank-Road-in-Altoona-Pa.-e1733842310681.png?w=800
US sees shortage of wildland firefighters	(NewsNation) — A shortage of wildland firefighters is getting worse — and becoming a concern to public safety. It's an extremely dangerous career path, that carries with it mental and physical stress. For many, the low pay is just not worth the risk. Wildland firefighters can be on duty for 20-40 days in a row, working 24-48 hour shifts. Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard on Capitol Hill to get Senate support While their wages vary depending on where they live, an entry-level wildlands firefighter typically makes $34,000 a year. Many rely on overtime or hazard pay to get ahead financially. NewsNation has spoken to people who live in houses with multiple roommates because of their salary. In addition, that amount of money is not enough for people in a career who face a mountain of health concerns. A structure firefighter, who puts out flames in buildings, often uses oxygen devices for respiratory protection, but most wildland firefighters, who work in uncultivated land, don't do that. The Forest Service has acknowledged that there's a link between cancer and fighting wildland fires — something people have long expressed concern over. There's not much job security either. Many wildland firefighter positions are seasonal jobs that end at the end of fire season. Although fire season is lasting longer now, sometimes even through January, when it's over, firefighters need to either apply for unemployment or have another job lined up. One report by LAist shows California is about 1,250 wildland firefighters short of what it needs to fully staff crews. While the Forest Service said on its website that it met its staffing goal this year with 11,393 firefighters, NewsNation sources disagree. 'They need to double that number, and then they need to also increase their resources of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft,' Joseph Ten Eyck, the wildfire/urban-interface fire programs coordinator at the International Association of Firefighters, said. Donald Trump says tariffs will not hurt Americans’ pockets George Broyles, a retired firefighter for the Forest Service, says many end up having to choose between their health, family and job. 'It's a great job, don't get me wrong,' Broyles said. 'I think that's why a lot of folks struggle — because they love the work that they do, but the challenges with pay and with health and travel and the trauma that we deal with, whether it's yourself that gets injured, or your or your brother or sister that's out there on the line — it takes a big emotional toll on everybody.' When President Joe Biden took office, his administration increased wildfire firefighters' minimum wage from $13 an hour to $15 an hour. However, that pay bump expires at the end of the year. While Biden proposed a $1.6 billion budget to support the wildland workforce for FY2025, Congress has not approved it yet. Lawmakers are also negotiating a disaster relief bill that the wildfire firefighter union hopes will include more money for them.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/us-shortage-wildland-firefighters/	2024-12-10T08:33:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24312051643465.jpg?w=900

(RMG News) The fast-moving flames prompted mandatory evacuation orders east of Malibu Canyon Road and south of Piuma Road, along with the Serra Retreat area, fire officials said in a post to X, formerly Twitter. The blaze jumped Malibu Canyon Road just before 1 a.m., creating a dire situation for those in the area. It was not immediately known how many structures were damaged or destroyed. Students and staff at Pepperdine University were told to shelter in place. A spokesperson told KTLA the university was 'well-designed' to protect people in the center of campus. In a 1:09 a.m. X post, Pepperdine University issued the following alert: 'All community members on the Malibu campus are directed to shelter in place in the Tyler Campus Center or Payson Library.

A lot of families are hurting': Luigi Mangione classmate	(NewsNation) — A former high school classmate of Luigi Mangione, the man charged in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson had been following the case since last week but said he never connected Mangione with the crime until Monday. Freddie Leatherbury, who has known Mangione since the sixth grade, told NewsNation on Tuesday that it has been difficult to see his high school portrayed in a negative national spotlight since Mangione was arrested on Monday and that those who know Mangione remain shocked. 'My life since about 1 (p.m.) Eastern time yesterday has just been so surreal,' Leatherbury said. Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione? Mangione, 26, was charged with several criminal offenses, including murder. Mangione, 26, was denied bail and faces a preliminary hearing on Dec. 23. Mangione will likely be taken to a state correctional facility Monday evening, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said. Mangione was arrested at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s following a dayslong manhunt after Thompson was shot and killed on a Manhattan sidewalk last week. 'Nothing connected to me when I saw the surveillance footage,' Leatherbury said. 'It’s so impressive to me that the McDonald’s worker of all people who had never seen this person in his life picked him out of a crowd basically and said, ‘I know that guy. He’s the wanted guy.’ That’s crazy to me.' Leatherbury said he and Mangione weren’t in the same social circles but were friendly. He remembers Luigi as being driven, smart and athletic. He said Mangione was everything one could want in a high school student. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting Leatherbury said he followed Mangione on social media. He characterized him as an infrequent poster on social platforms and that he did not see any red flags that indicated he was capable of committing a crime with which he is charged. 'It doesn’t seem thinkable that this is the same person,' Leatherbury said, adding, 'It just goes so against everything I knew about Luigi.' He added: 'None of us can come up with any leads or any or any history of inclination to do anything like this.' Leatherbury said that there isn’t much 'worth hearing' regarding Mangione, but said his thoughts are focused on Thompson’s family. He also said Mangione’s family is grieving the loss of life they’re going to have with Mangione. 'So a lot of families are hurting right now,' Leatherbury told NewsNation. 'So I I don't really need to know much more from Luigi, to be honest. I just want to know that they're at peace and comfortable with what's going on moving forward.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/families-hurting-luigi-mangione-classmate/	2024-12-10T06:21:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/96e8a6a7-b272-4899-ad30-5d043b735e68.jpg?w=800
Wildfire explodes near Pepperdine University; evacuations ordered	(KTLA) - Firefighters raced to protect structures as a fast-moving wildfire exploded near Pepperdine University in Malibu amid strong Santa Ana winds Monday evening.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) As of 2 a.m., the fire was mapped at 853 acres with no containment. The cause of the fire was under investigation. The fast-moving flames prompted mandatory evacuation orders east of Malibu Canyon Road and south of Piuma Road, along with the Serra Retreat area, fire officials said in a post to X, formerly Twitter. The blaze jumped Malibu Canyon Road just before 1 a.m., creating a dire situation for those in the area. It was not immediately known how many structures were damaged or destroyed. Students and staff at Pepperdine University were told to shelter in place. In a 1:09 a.m. X post, Pepperdine University issued the following alert: 'The University is now activating its shelter-in-place protocol.

Jay-Z files motion to reveal rape accuser's identity	Jay-Z’s attorney, Alex Spiro, filed court paperwork Monday asking a judge to require his rape accuser, who is only identified as 'Jane Doe,' to reveal her identity if she wants to continue the lawsuit. Spiro said the woman hasn’t provided any evidence to justify her anonymity and that her 'vague assertions of potential harm fall far short of the stringent requirements' under the law. The woman who previously sued Sean 'Diddy' Combs, alleging she was raped at an awards show after-party in 2000 when she was 13, amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z was also at the party and participated in the sexual assault. Spiro asked for an urgent hearing on the matter. Who are the celebrities accused with Diddy? S.D.N.Y._24-cv-07975_dckt_000038_000_filed_2024-12-09Download 'Mr. Carter deserves to know the identity of the person who is effectively accusing him — in sensationalized, publicity-hunting fashion — of criminal conduct, demanding massive financial compensation, and tarnishing a reputation earned over decades,' Spiro wrote. 'He has never been accused of, let alone engaged in, any sexual misconduct.' The 24-time Grammy award-winning rapper, producer and music mogul, whose real name is Shawn Carter, called the allegations 'idiotic' and 'heinous in nature' in a statement released by Roc Nation, one of his companies. He also revealed that he had anonymously sued the woman’s lawyer, Tony Buzbee, last month, alleging he was trying to blackmail the rapper by threatening to make the rape allegation public if he didn’t agree to a legal settlement. He said Buzbee sent a letter to his lawyer appearing to seek a settlement but that the letter had the 'opposite effect' on him. Celebrities who had the worst year in 2024 'It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion,' Jay-Z’s statement read. 'So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!' The litigation is part of a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs as the hip-hop mogul remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, said the notion that he was trying to blackmail Jay-Z is 'stupid and laughable,' and that his letter simply sought confidential mediation in the litigation. 'What he fails to say in his recent statement is that my firm sent his lawyer a basic demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him,' he said in an emailed statement. 'Since I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I’m very proud of her resolve.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jay-z-rape-accusers-identity/	2024-12-09T21:34:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/6668abff160446.34366488.jpeg?w=900
Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting	(NewsNation) — A primary care physician in the wake of a UnitedHealthcare CEO's killing has highlighted growing frustrations within the medical community over insurance company practices, particularly aggressive claim denials. Dr. Saju Mathew, a 20-year veteran physician, told NewsNation Monday that insurance companies are increasingly blocking critical medical procedures through complex 'prior authorization' processes. 'We as doctors have been crying, screaming on the top of our lungs regarding how lots of insurance companies are denying claims on a daily basis,' Mathew said on 'NewsNation Now.' He cited examples of patients being unable to obtain routine tests like mammograms without extensive bureaucratic hurdles. Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting person of interest Luigi Mangione? UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting The doctor's comments come after the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan, which has sparked a national conversation about health care industry practices. On social media in particular, some users gloated about the killing, a reaction they framed as rooted in their enmity for the health insurance industry. That, in turn, brought rebukes from others who condemned those responses as inhumane, especially in the circumstances. Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested as a person of interest and was reportedly found with a three-page manifesto expressing anger toward corporate America. Shell casings at the scene had words written on them with markers said to have included 'Depose,' 'Deny,' and 'Defend.' Doctor calls out claim denials after UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting Mathew said that UnitedHealthcare denies one in three claims, a trend he says is symptomatic of a broader industry problem. The company reported $281 billion in revenue last year. 'But it's just not UnitedHealthcare. It's really all insurance companies,' he said. Mathew argued that meaningful change would require congressional action, suggesting legislators should mandate transparency about insurance denial rates and restore medical decision-making power to physicians and patients. Killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO uncorks anger at insurance industry 'No. 1, we should be able to make sure that people understand which insurance companies have the highest denial rate,' Mathew said. The physician called for removing insurance companies' ability to arbitrate medical necessities, particularly in critical procedures like knee replacements for patients with severe arthritis. A recent KFF poll spotlights Mathew's concerns, revealing that 97% of registered voters believe insurance companies bear significant responsibility for high health care prices. A February report from KFF found that Americans owe 'at least $220 billion' in medical debt and that about 3 million people have debts of over $10,000.

Luigi Mangione 'brilliant-minded,’ nonviolent: Acquaintances	(NewsNation) — The man charged in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, was 'brilliant-minded' and 'very popular' in high school, an anonymous classmate tells NewsNation. 'He was the valedictorian of our high school, but he didn't put in much effort at all. He would sit there in class, not study after school, and aced the tests,' the classmate said on 'CUOMO.' According to class records, Mangione attended a private high school in Baltimore, Maryland. In addition to academic feats, he was also a wrestler. '[Mangione] was an extraordinary mind. He was a very popular person in the class,' he added. 'Had a lot of friends. It's just shocking that he would commit such a heinous act.' Luigi Mangione charged with murder in UnitedHealthcare shooting R.J. Martin, who was roommates with Mangione at a coliving space in Hawaii, met Mangione when he was already in his 20s. Martin tells NewsNation that he, like many others in the community, was looking to enjoy the tropics and live healthier — namely, healing a bad back, Mangione told him. 'I don't know if it was an injury or preexisting, (but) he was doing everything he could to, you know, not be in pain when he moved in at Surfbreak [Coliving],' Martin said. Martin’s experience echoes Mangione’s high school reputation, with the roommate describing him as 'a kind person, great listener, somebody that you know you would enjoy having a cup of coffee with.' 'And I just can't imagine that this is the same person,' Martin said, calling the incident 'unimaginable.' Martin emphasized that while he and Mangione had discussed health care before, it never teetered toward violent ideation. 'Most people are aware that many of the systems that we live within don't benefit us as well as they could. And you know, those are normal intellectual conversations and discussions that we have,' Martin said. 'And he and I had many of those kinds of intellectual conversations, but never anything remotely towards violence. He was never aggressive. I never even remember him once being upset.' Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting person of interest Luigi Mangione? Mangione’s anonymous classmate pointed to him as someone who was 'capable of running or starting their own biotech firm that could have helped cure some of these illnesses.' 'I want to know why he thought there was no other way. … The fact that that mind is now going to spend, likely, the rest of their life in prison is very sad,' he added. Luigi Mangione named person of interest in UnitedHealthcare shooting Manhattan prosecutors filed murder and other charges against Mangione late Monday night. He remains in Pennsylvania jail. He was arrested Monday on forgery charges in Pennsylvania after questioning by authorities, according to a police briefing on Monday evening in the Keystone State. His Monday arraignment saw his bail denied, and a preliminary hearing set for Dec. 23. In Pennsylvania, Mangione was charged with forgery, carrying firearms without a license, having 'instruments of a crime,' tampering with records or information and false identification to law enforcement. The NYPD released Mangione’s name at a press conference later that day. Investigators said Mangione matched the description of the ID they were searching for and was found in possession of several items they believe would connect him to the shooting. Those allegedly include a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that was used to check into a hostel in New York. Police described the firearm as consistent with the one used to shoot Thompson. Investigators said the gun appeared to be a ghost gun, a term for a gun with no serial number, which may have been made on a 3D printer and capable of firing a 9mm round. Police also recovered a handwritten document that speaks to his motivation and mindset. Mangione has no prior arrests on his record.

Who are the celebrities accused with Diddy?	(NewsNation) — Rap mogul Jay-Z has been accused of assault alongside Sean 'Diddy' Combs in an amended complaint filed Sunday, but his name is just the latest among several well-known people linked to the accusations against Combs. Originally filed in October 2024, the suit named only Combs but now identifies Jay-Z as 'Celebrity A,' who was accused of raping a 13-year-old at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty, NBC News first reported. Jay-Z accused The victim, identified as 'Jane Doe,' alleges that the pair of stars assaulted her after the event in Manhattan in September 2000. Court documents accuse Jay-Z of being present during 'many such instances.' What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, denied the allegations in a lengthy statement in response to the complaint. In it, he claims the lawyer behind the accuser’s suit attempted to blackmail him. The rapper is the most high-profile name to be linked to Combs, but several others have been tied to the disgraced music producer who is currently in a New York prison after a federal indictment on three counts of racketeering, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. Cuba Gooding Jr. Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was added to a sexual assault lawsuit against Combs by music producer Rodney Jones earlier this year. Jones, also known as Lil Rod, alleged that Gooding sexually harassed and assaulted him, such as by groping him while aboard Combs’ yacht in 2023. He said Gooding did not stop until he forcibly pushed him away and that Combs left him alone with the actor. Gooding has denied the allegations. Aaron Hall R&amp;B singer and songwriter Aaron Hall was sued alongside Combs by Liza Gardner for battery, sexual assault and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Garner said in 1990, she and her friend met Combs during an event at the offices of MCA Records, and the two were invited back to Hall’s home. There, she 'was coerced into having sex with Combs,' the suit alleged. 'After Combs finished doing his business, Liza Gardner laid in bed, shocked and traumatized,' the lawsuit stated. 'As she was in the process of getting dressed, Hall barged into the room, pinned her down and forced Liza Gardner to have sex with him.' Both Hall and Combs have denied the allegations. What we know about the Diddy investigation Harve Pierre Bad Boy Records executive Harve Pierre, Combs, and a third 'assailant' were sued by Anna Kane, the ex-wife of an NHL hockey player. Kane alleged that the three gang-raped her when she was 17 after trafficking her across state lines in 2003. Kane said that she met Pierre as a junior in high school when he approached her at a lounge in Detroit near her home. Pierre and Combs convinced the then-teen to take a private jet with them and a third person to Combs’ recording studio in New York City. That’s where they drugged her and then began taking turns raping her, she alleged. 'As a result of being raped by Mr. Combs, Mr. Pierre and the Third Assailant, Ms. Doe suffered significant emotional distress and feelings of shame that have plagued her life and personal relationships for 20 years,' her lawsuit stated. Pierre denied the allegations in a statement to TMZ. Christian 'King' Combs Combs’ son Christian 'King' Combs was named alongside his father in a lawsuit that accuses the younger Combs of sexual assault and battery on a yacht that was chartered by the music mogul in 2022. Grace O’Marcaigh, a steward working on the yacht, alleged in a civil suit in the Los Angeles County Superior Court that Christian, 26, forced her to take a 'spiked' shot of tequila, groped her and then assaulted her, according to court documents. She says she complained to the ship’s captain, but the incident was not properly investigated. She alleges Combs paid the captain a hefty tip as part of a 'coverup,' reported Rolling Stone. Jay-Z says lawsuit accusing him of raping a child at awards after-party is part of an extortion ploy Jacob the Jeweler Celebrity jewelry designer Jacob Arabo, known as Jacob the Jeweler, was named as a defendant in a complaint filed against Combs in July, reported Business Insider. The complaint accuses Combs of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sex trafficking by a woman who worked at one of the rapper’s infamous 'white parties.' He alleged that Combs forced her to have sex with Arabo, who was one of the party guests. Yung Miami Rapper Yung Miami, who once dated Combs, is named in the sexual assault lawsuit filed by Jones as being a part of his sex trafficking operation. The lawsuit accuses the rapper of bringing Combs tuci, a drug sometimes called 'pink cocaine,' on a private jet. Jones alleged Yung Miami was among several women 'who were paid a monthly fee to work as Mr. Combs' sex workers.' The rapper was also named in another sexual assault lawsuit filed by Jane Doe who alleges that Yung Miami harassed her to have an abortion at the behest of Combs, reported Vulture. Yung Miami denied the allegations, reported The Los Angeles Times.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/celebrities-accused-diddy/	2024-12-09T11:56:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1201994175.jpg?w=900
Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting person of interest Luigi Man...	(NewsNation) —Authorities have arrested a person of interest in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and little is still known about him or why he attacked the executive. Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in Pennsylvania on firearms charges and is described by police as a person of interest in the shooting. NewsNation is working to obtain more information on Mangione. Thompson, 50, was shot just before 7 a.m. last week near a hotel on 54th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, sources told NewsNation. UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: Who was Brian Thompson? The gunman had been anticipating Thompson to arrive at the hotel for an investors meeting, police said. This was a 'premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a news conference. The suspect was 'lying in wait for several minutes.' Luigi Mangione named person of interest in UnitedHealthcare shooting The NYPD released Mangione's name at a press conference on Monday. Investigators said Mangione matched the description of the ID they were searching for and was found in possession of several items they believe will connect him to the shooting. Those allegedly include a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake NJ ID that was used to check into a hostel in New York. Police described the firearm as consistent with the one used to shoot Thompson. Investigators said the gun appears to be a ghost gun, a term for an gun with no serial number, which may have been made on a 3D printer and capable of firing a 9mm round. Police also recovered a handwritten document that speaks to his motivation and mindset. Mangione has no prior arrests on his record. What do we know about the suspect in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? Upon locating the backpack, police discovered a jacket and monopoly money. As Thompson arrived at the Hilton, the shooter stepped out from behind a car and fired multiple rounds, striking Thompson in the leg and back. Kenny said it appeared that the 'gun malfunctions as he clears the jam and begins to fire again.'

(NYPD)The New York Police Department released photos of a person of interest wanted for questioning in connection to the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (NYPD) The suspect then ran through an alley, hopped on an electric Citi Bike and rode through Central Park on Center Drive. 'I hear a shot,' a witness told NewsNation affiliate WPIX. 'When I look around, I saw a guy with a gun. He shot three times, then he starts running.' Investigators recovered several 9 mm shell casings from outside the hotel and a cell phone from the alleyway through which the suspect fled. They were also searching Thompson's hotel room and interviewing his UnitedHealthcare colleagues, Kenny said. While the shooting was targeted, police say they still don’t know a motive for the attack. What is Luigi Mangione's manifesto? Investigators said a three-page, handwritten document was found that they described as a manifesto. While they said they don't believe there are specific threats to others in the document, they described it as showing 'ill will' toward corporate America. Authorities say it gives insight into the mindset of motives in what they described as a 'targeted' killing. How was Luigi Mangio found? Police said old-fashioned detective work was used to locate Mangione. The photo of a person of interest taken from surveillance video was shared across the country and a McDonald's employee identified Mangione as a possible match. Responding officers said Mangione was acting suspiciously and found that he had multiple IDs on him.

Pennsylvania police question man in connection with CEO killing	(NewsNation) — NewsNation has confirmed that authorities in Altoona, Pennsylvania, are questioning a man in connection with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson Police have expanded the search for the suspected shooter beyond New York as they have implored the public to come forward with information. NewsNation affiliate WTAJ reports a person of interest is currently being questioned and CBS confirmed the person was found with a gun similar to the one used in the shooting. Forever chemicals tainting food supply, destroying American farmers Thompson was killed while walking to the company's annual investor meeting. Police say they believe the attack was targeted and not a random act of violence. The words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene of the shooting, police sources said to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX. The words appear to be a possible reference to a book titled 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which details the ways insurance companies use to reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. United Healthcare has the highest claim denial rate among insurance companies, rejecting 32% of submitted claims compared to the industry average of 16%. Police released surveillance photos of a person of interest they hoped to question, which showed an individual in a dark, hooded jacket with a backpack. The backpack was later located and found to contain Monopoly money. Thompson, 50, was a father of two. He became CEO of United Healthcare in 2021 and helped the company bring in $281 billion in profits in 2023. Between salary and other benefits, he was estimated to have more than $10 million in compensation last year. 9 states could halt Medicaid expansion if Trump cuts funding Earlier this year, Thompson was sued by the Hollywood Firefighters’ Pension Fund for insider trading and fraud. Executives at United Healthcare were being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegedly running a monopoly and unfairly blocking out competitors. The Department of Justice also launched an antitrust investigation into the United Healthcare Group following a cyberattack on a subsidiary that handled healthcare payments. During the attack, many patients were forced to pay out of pocket for care and medications or were unable to get them because medical facilities were unable to process payments.

Daniel Penny found not guilty in Jordan Neely's death	(NewsNation) — The jury in Daniel Penny’s high-profile trial has returned and has found the former Marine not guilty in the death of Jordan Neely. The verdict comes after Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the manslaughter charge against Penny, who is accused of killing Neely. The judge’s ruling on Friday left the jury to consider a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide against Penny. The verdict drew mixed reactions inside the courtroom, including applause. Neely's father, Andre Zachery, and his attorney were asked to leave the courtroom. In a news conference held outside of the courthouse minutes after the verdict was read, Zachery said that the judicial system had failed. 'Let the marchers march and let the steppers step,' Zachery said. 'You want to do something about this verdict? Then you go into your neighborhood and you promote Black unity.' He added: 'Black people, we are all that we have. This system protects every other group except for the very people that built this country.' In a statement released by his office, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that the jury had spoken and that he deeply respects the jury process and the jury's verdict. He said that during the trial, prosecutors and their family members were 'beseiged with hate and threat.' 'Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it,' Bragg said in the statement. Wiley gave the jurors the Allen charge earlier on Friday, which are instructions reminding the jurors of how much time and money has gone into the case and how imperative it is that they reach a decision. Daniel Penny trial: Jurors return to deliberate lesser charge This comes after jurors told Wiley they were unable to come to a unanimous decision on the manslaughter charge against Penny, who also faces one for criminally negligent homicide. Penny has pleaded not guilty. Penny placed Neely in a chokehold for nearly six minutes after the man threatened to kill other passengers on the subway. The jury, made up of five men and seven women, deliberated after closing arguments began last week. Before the judge dismissed the manslaughter charge, the jury indicated that it could not decide on the manslaughter charge after it struggled with both Penny's justification for placing Neely in the chokehold and whether the chokehold actually caused Neely's death. The jury can find Penny guilty of criminally negligent homicide if it decides Penny acted recklessly or was careless. The lesser charge carries a maximum sentence of four years. Defense attorneys representing Penny petitioned a judge to have the charges against their client dismissed after Thanksgiving, but the judge ruled that the case would move to closing arguments. The defense rested on November 29 after electing not to have Penny testify in his own defense. Deliberations began after the seven-week trial that included 40 witnesses. Jury members also watched hours of video during the trial and listened to recordings of 911 calls that were placed following the incident. During their deliberations, the jury sent a series of notes to the judge, requesting key pieces of evidence, including cellphone video footage of Penny keeping the chokehold on Neely. The jury also requested that judge read definitions of 'recklessness' and 'negligence,' which spoke to the issue of Penny's justification for his actions. Jordan Neely’s cause of death is disputed Central to the case was whether the hold that Penny put on Neely led to the man’s death. The medical examiner, key to the prosecution, said the reason for Neely’s death was the chokehold, but the defense’s experts said this was not the case. He said it was a combination of four factors: restraint and struggle, sickle cell crisis, a synthetic drug in his system called K-2 and schizophrenia.

The defense’s clinical pathologist, Dr. Satish Chundru, testified that Neely’s injuries suffered in the 2023 incident, along with video shot by passengers, did not indicate that Neely died from the chokehold applied by Penny. Chundru, citing medical records, testified that the location and extent of the bruising Neely suffered, along with other factors, led him to conclude that the chokehold was not fatal. In addition to the bruising on Neely’s neck, Chundru testified that there was a small amount of petechiae — small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding — on his eyelids. Jay-Z accused of raping 13-year-old in 2000 with Diddy Chundru concluded that Neely died from 'the combined effects' of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Prosecutors maintained that Penny's actions are directly connected to Neely's death. 'I’m sure that you had absolutely no question in your mind about what caused Jordan Neely's death. It’s too obvious,' Yoran said during her closing argument. 'This is a clear case of death by chokehold.' Daniel Penny encounters Jordan Neely Jurors learned during the trial that Neely was begging for money May 1, 2023, but that he began to shout to passengers that he was willing to die or go to jail.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Testimony included that Neely, who sometimes entertained passengers as an Elvis impersonator aboard the subway, began acting erratically and began making threats to passengers, witnesses said. Penny has said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, 'I will kill.' Penny put his arm around Neely’s neck, took him to the floor, and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving at roughly the last minute, witnesses said. Penny’s defense attorneys asked jury members to put themselves in the shoes of those aboard the train, while prosecutors countered that Penny acted too aggressively and was forceful and reckless in responding to Penny. Defense attorney Steven Raiser told jurors during his closing argument that Neely was filled with rage when he entered the train and was not afraid of any consequences. However, prosecutors argued that despite Neely’s actions, Penny went too far. 'You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing, no matter what it is that they are saying,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran told jurors during her closing argument, according to The Associated Press. Raiser told jurors this week that his client could not release Neely from the hold without putting others in danger. He also said that Penny never applied enough pressure to Neely to cause his death. Prosecutors disagreed, citing Penny’s military experience. 'He was trained in this,' Yoran said during her closing argument, referring to the chokehold, according to The New York Times, 'and yet he continued with the foreseeable and tragic results.'

Daniel Penny trial: Jurors return to deliberate lesser charge	(NewsNation) — Jurors head back to New York City court Monday morning to continue deliberating whether they will convict Daniel Penny with criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a subway train last May. Penny faced two charges, both of which he pleaded not guilty: One of second-degree manslaughter and another of criminally negligent homicide. However, Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the more severe manslaughter count Friday afternoon after jurors said they were deadlocked on it. David Tarras, head of the federal criminal defense practice at Rossen Law, tells NewsNation this was an 'unusual' move. If Penny is found guilty, his legal team has already said they will file an appeal. Should Penny be convicted of criminally negligent homicide, he faces up to four years in prison. Had manslaughter still been on the table, he could have gotten 15 years. Forever chemicals tainting food supply, destroying American farmers Jordan Neely's father sues Daniel Penny Neely's father, Andre Zachary, sued Daniel Penny alleging negligence, assault and battery that led to the death of his unarmed, 30-year-old son. On May 1, 2023, Penny, now 26, placed Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes after Neely, who was homeless, started shouting and acting erratically on a crowded, underground train. According to the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Zachary is seeking a judgment awarding damages 'in a sum which exceeds the jurisdictional limits of all lower Courts which would otherwise have jurisdiction.' Penny’s lawyer Steven Raiser said the timing of the lawsuit is 'unfortunate.' 'We will not be distracted by this attempt to attack Danny while he is under such tremendous stress,' Raiser said in a statement Thursday. But Christopher Neely, Jordan’s uncle, maintained that Neely didn’t deserve to die, the Associated Press reported. 'What gave Daniel Penny the right to choke Jordan nearly for six minutes?' He said outside the courthouse last week. 'He had an option to go to another car. He had the option to say something and not do nothing.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/daniel-penny-trial-jurors-deliberate-lesser-charge/	2024-12-09T04:43:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24341623325034.jpg?w=900
Jay-Z accused of raping 13-year-old in 2000 with Diddy	(NewsNation) — Rap mogul and entrepreneur Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, alongside defamed music star Sean 'Diddy' Combs, an amended complaint obtained by NewsNation alleges. The victim, identified as 'Jane Doe,' alleges that the pair of stars assaulted her at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty. She was invited by a limousine driver after the Video Music Awards in Manhattan in September 2000. Originally filed in October 2024, the suit named only Diddy. Sunday's amended complaint identifies Jay-Z as 'Celebrity A,' who was accused of raping the 13-year-old while 'Celebrity B,' a female, watched. Anonymous Diddy accuser revealed as NHL player’s ex-wife Court documents also accuse Jay-Z of being present during 'many such instances.' 'He believes he is above the law. He is not,' the filing reads. 'His close friend Shawn Carter has been with Combs during many such instances described herein. Both perpetrators must face justice.' The suit also accuses Jay-Z of 'orchestrating a conspiracy of harassment, bullying and intimidation against Plaintiff’s lawyers, their families, employees and former associates in an attempt to silence Plaintiff from naming Jay-Z herein.' NewsNation has reached out to Jay-Z's lawyer for comment. What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? Diddy has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Russian state news agencies say ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad...	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad fled to Moscow on Sunday, Russian media reported, hours after a stunning rebel advance took over the capital of Damascus and ended the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule. The Russian agencies, Tass and RIA, cited an unidentified Kremlin source on Assad and his family being given asylum in Moscow, his longtime ally and protector. The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the reports but contacted the Kremlin for comment. RIA also said Moscow had received guarantees from Syrian insurgents of the security of Russian military bases and diplomatic posts in Syria. Assad reportedly left Syria early Sunday, and Syrians have been pouring into streets echoing with celebratory gunfire after a stunning rebel advance reached the capital, ending the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule. The swiftly moving events have raised questions about the future of the country and the wider region. Russia has requested an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council discuss the situation in Syria, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the U.N., Dmitry Polyansky, posted on Telegram. Joyful crowds gathered in squares in Damascus, waving the Syrian revolutionary flag in scenes that recalled the early days of the Arab Spring uprising, before a brutal crackdown and the rise of an insurgency plunged the country into a nearly 14-year civil war. Others gleefully ransacked the presidential palace and residence after Assad and other top officials vanished. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former al-Qaida commander who cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance, leads the biggest rebel faction and is poised to chart the country's future. In his first public appearance since fighters entered the Damascus suburbs Saturday, al-Golani visited the sprawling Umayyad Mosque and called Assad's fall 'a victory to the Islamic nation.' Calling himself by his given name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and not his nom de guerre, he told hundreds of people that Assad had made Syria 'a farm for Iran’s greed.' The rebels face the daunting task of healing bitter divisions in a country ravaged by war and still split among armed factions. Turkey-backed opposition fighters are battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group is still active in some remote areas. Syrian state television broadcast a rebel statement early Sunday saying Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been released. They called on people to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The rebels later announced a curfew in Damascus from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m. The rebels said they freed people held at the notorious Saydnaya prison, where rights groups say thousands were tortured and killed. A video circulating online purported to show rebels breaking open cell doors and freeing dozens of female prisoners, many of whom appeared shocked. At least one small child was seen among them. 'This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where is he,' said one relative, Bassam Masr. 'I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years.' Rebel commander Anas Salkhadi later appeared on state TV and sought to reassure Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, saying: 'Syria is for everyone, no exceptions. Syria is for Druze, Sunnis, Alawites, and all sects.' 'We will not deal with people the way the Assad family did,' he added. Celebrations in the capital Damascus residents prayed in mosques and celebrated in squares, calling, 'God is great.' People chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teenage boys picked up weapons apparently discarded by security forces and fired into the air. Revelers filled Umayyad Square, where the Defense Ministry is located. Some waved the three-starred Syrian flag that predates the Assad government and was adopted by the revolutionaries. Elsewhere, many parts of the capital were empty and shops were closed. Soldiers and police left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos showed families wandering the presidential palace, some carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'It’s like a dream. I need someone to wake me up,' said opposition fighter Abu Laith, adding the rebels were welcomed in Damascus with 'love.' At the Justice Ministry, where rebels stood guard, Judge Khitam Haddad said they were protecting documents from the chaos. Outside, some residents sought information about relatives who disappeared under Assad. The rebels 'have felt the pain of the people,' said one woman, giving only her first name, Heba. She worried about possible revenge killings by the rebels, many of whom appeared to be underage. Syria’s al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood.' It added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing past government statements, saying it 'only carried out the instructions.' A statement from the Alawite sect that has formed the core of Assad's base called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' The rebels mainly come from the Sunni Muslim majority in Syria, which also has sizable Druze, Christian and Kurdish communities. In Qamishli in the northeast, a Kurdish man slapped a statue of the late leader Hafez Assad with his shoe. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. A video shared on Syrian opposition media showed armed men escorting him from his office and to the Four Seasons hotel on Sunday. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Calls for an orderly transition The rebel advances since Nov. 27 were the largest in recent years, and saw the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs fall within days as the Syrian army melted away. Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which provided crucial support to Assad throughout the uprising, abandoned him as they reeled from other conflicts. The end of Assad’s rule was a major blow to Iran and its allies, already weakened by conflict with Israel. Iran, which had strongly backed him throughout the civil war, said Syrians should decide their future 'without destructive, coercive, foreign intervention.' The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said Israeli troops had seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established in 1974, saying it was to protect Israeli residents after Syrian troops abandoned positions. Israel's military later warned residents of five southern Syria communities to stay home for their safety, and didn’t respond to questions. Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it. The international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied, and the Arab League on Sunday condemned what it called Israel’s efforts to take advantage of Assad’s downfall occupy more territory. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Al-Golani, has sought to recast the group as a moderate and tolerant force. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead.' The U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday. They included Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed al-Ansari, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, said they agreed on the need 'to engage all parties on the ground,' including the HTS, and that the main concern is 'stability and safe transition.' ___ Sewell reported from Beirut.

US will remain in eastern Syria and seek to prevent IS resurgence...	MANAMA, Bahrain (Reuters) —The United States will maintain its presence in eastern Syria and will take measures necessary to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Daniel Shapiro said on Sunday. Speaking hours after Syrian rebels announced they had toppled Bashar al-Assad's government, Shapiro called on all parties to protect civilians, particularly minorities, and to respect international norms. 'We are aware that the chaotic and dynamic circumstances on the ground in Syria could give ISIS space to find the ability to become active, to plan external operations, and we're determined to work with those partners to continue to degrade their capabilities,' he told the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain's capital. '(We're determined) to ensure (Islamic State's) enduring defeat, to ensure the secure detention of ISIS fighters and the repatriation of displaced persons,' Shapiro added. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which spearheaded the rebel advances across western Syria, was formerly an al Qaeda affiliate known as the Nusra Front until its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, severed ties with the global jihadist movement in 2016. Western governments, which have shunned the Assad-led state for years, must decide how to deal with a new administration in which HTS looks set to have influence. HTS is a globally designated terrorist group.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/us-will-remain-in-eastern-syria-and-seek-to-prevent-is-resurgence-pentagon-says/	2024-12-08T03:49:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24343438098826.jpg?w=900
Syrian government falls to fast-moving rebels, ending 50 years of...	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The Syrian government collapsed early Sunday, falling to a lightning rebel offensive that seized control of the capital of Damascus and sent crowds into the streets to celebrate the end of the Assad family's 50 years of iron rule. Syrian state television aired a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been set free. The man who read the statement said the opposition group, known as the Operations Room to Conquer Damascus, called on all rebel fighters and citizens to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The statement emerged hours after the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus following a remarkably swift advance across the country. Many of the capital’s residents were in disbelief at the speed at which Assad lost his hold on the country after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million and drew in several foreign powers. Celebrations erupt across the capital As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the city’s mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting 'God is great.' People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teen boys picked up weapons that had apparently been discarded by security forces and fired them in the air. Revelers filled Umayyad Square in the city center, where the Defense Ministry is located. Men fired celebratory gunshots into the air and some waved the three-starred Syrian flag that predates the Assad government and was adopted by the revolutionaries. A few kilometers (miles) away, Syrians stormed the presidential palace, tearing up portraits of the toppled president. Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos from Damascus showed families wandering into the presidential palace, with some emerging carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'I did not sleep last night, and I refused to sleep until I heard the news of his fall,' said Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, who works in the electricity sector. 'From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them (the opposition forces) a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.' Syria’s al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. We believe and trust that Syria will be for all Syrians.' The newspaper added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing government statements in the past. 'We only carried out the instructions and published the news they sent us,' it said. 'It quickly became clear now that it was false.' A statement from the Alawite sect — to which Assad belongs and which has formed the core of his base — called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' Assad's whereabouts are unknown Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said in a video statement that the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. A video shared on Syrian opposition media showed a group of armed men escorting him out of his office and to the Four Seasons hotel on Sunday. The prime minister had earlier told the Al Arabiya news network that he does not know where Assad and the defense minister are. He said he lost communication with Assad late Saturday. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. A senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, which had sought to rehabilitate Assad's image and has welcomed high-profile exiles in recent years, declined to comment on his whereabouts when asked by reporters at a conference in Bahrain. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Assad has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital. There was no immediate comment from Iran, which had been Assad’s staunchest supporter. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. AP footage showed broken windows and documents scattered in the entryway. Opposition forces had not reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. Calls for an orderly transition as it remains unclear what comes next The rebel advances since Nov. 27 were the largest in recent years, and saw the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs fall in a matter of days as the Syrian army melted away. Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which provided crucial support to Assad throughout the uprising, abandoned him in the final days as they reeled from other conflicts. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group’s image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. HTS set up a 'salvation government' in 2017 to administer a large region in northwestern Syria under its control. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead. One can only hope they rise to the occasion.' The U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad’s chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday. The participants included Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman and an adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that they agreed on the need 'to engage all parties on the ground,' including the HTS, and that the main concern is 'stability and safe transition.' The Israeli military said Sunday it has deployed forces in a demilitarized buffer zone along its northern frontier with Syria following the rebel offensive there. The military, which said it also sent troops to 'other places necessary for its defense,' said the deployment was meant to provide security for residents of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war and the international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied. ___ Sewell reported from Beirut.

Forever chemicals tainting food supply, destroying American farme...	(NewsNation) — It’s 4 a.m. in Maine, and just like his father and grandfather before him on this land, dairy farmer Fred Stone makes the frigid journey through the snow to milk the cows. 'It was always known as cows first, people second, and that’s the way it’s always been,' Stone told NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves. 'I wish that snow wasn’t cold, and I wish rain wasn’t wet, and I wish I still didn’t love my cows. But the more people I meet, the more I love my cows.' Stone has chosen each of their names and knows them by heart. In the warm barn, he greets Moon Beam, Blue and Storm Chaser. 'There’s no phoniness about the, you know exactly where you stand, and they’re all different,' said Stone. 'Their personalities are all completely different.' His whole life he says his care for his cows has been rewarded with what he calls 'liquid gold.' His family has owned this farm since 1914, and for more than a century, their high-quality milk and cream have gone to market. Now, he milks them only to pour every drop down the drain. 'You either laugh or cry, and I ran out of tears a long time ago,' said Stone. Fred Stone’s milk is contaminated, heavily tainted with PFAS, or 'forever chemicals,' linked with cancer and other serious health issues. 'This has broken our hearts and crushed our spirit, and I don’t know if we’ll ever get that back,' said Fred’s wife, Laura Stone. In 2016, an innocuous, routine water test on their property revealed high levels of PFAS — human-made chemicals the Stones had never heard of before. Deported veterans seek pardons from Biden They volunteered to test their soil, cows and milk. All came back high. Fred Stone said their milk inspector informed him that the USDA was considering the possible extermination of his cows. 'I said, ‘That’s a hell of an idea. I’ll tell you what, I’ll take the cows down to the extermination site… and I’ll stand there and I’ll take the first bullet, and you can kill the rest of them.' Fred Stone had to euthanize 80% of his cows. 'For a long while, we were, I guess you would call it — dead,' said Laura Stone. Fred installed a $23,000 water filtration system, but the contamination returned. He says he went $1.5 million in debt trying to save his farm, all the while dumping thousands of gallons of precious milk. The Stones have been dropped by their milk distributor. Fred Stone told NewsNation there is one thought in particular that haunts him now: 'At some point in time, hopefully not tomorrow, I’m going to have to tell my father and grandfather what happened to the dairy farm they entrusted me with. And that’s what keeps me up at night.' Fred Stone’s family has set up a GoFundMe, you can find it here. Organic farmers make a terrible discovery About 120 miles north of Fred Stone’s farm, a young couple pooled all of their money and put it into a dream. Adam Nordell and Johanna Davis brought their fiddle and banjo and put down roots, closing on a farm where they could settle down, grow organic produce, have a family — and build a whole life. And when it came to naming it, the choice was easy for these two musicians: 'Songbird Organic Farm.' 'We imagined that we would be here forever. We imagined that we would build a business that would support our family through our career and into our retirement, so we thought we were settling down for the long haul,' said Nordell. The idea of preventing development and preserving this farmland was also a man’s dying wish. The couple found the farm through a service that connects retiring farmers with the next generation. The original owner had developed pancreatic cancer. 'A terminal cancer diagnosis,' said Nordell, 'so he needed to move quickly to find the next farmers to take over management of this land.' Under Nordell and Davis’ care, the land and business flourished, and they raised their little boy. As news of the contamination on Fred Stone’s land spread, a customer asked Nordell and Davis if they’d heard of PFAS. They voluntarily tested their land. 'The results were high. Our drinking water tested about 400 times the state’s drinking water threshold,' said Nordell. Here are the billionaires stocking Trump’s next administration Maine’s PFAS threshold for drinking water is 20 parts per trillion. Nordell says their soil also tested high. He recalls the terror of that time: 'We were in free fall, do we have a business? Do we have a home here?' Then they had their blood tested for forever chemicals. Nordell says his and his wife’s blood levels are higher than chemical manufacturer employees who worked in PFAS factories. 'My blood levels after living for seven years on a farm that was spread with sludge four times, are higher than those workers in Decatur, Alabama,' said Nordell. Davis described a gut-wrenching conversation with her little boy: 'He said, ‘Is there PFAS, is it in my body and is that bad?' And I don’t even know what I said, I couldn’t answer. That’s not something that I want to have to talk to my kid about when he’s 5 years old.' The couple shut down operations, recalled their products, alerted customers and shuttered their organic farm. The family hasn’t picked up an instrument in a long time now, they say the music just isn’t in them anymore. Health is a constant worry. And there are questions that defy answers. What does a farmer do with a farm that can grow nothing? 'It’s weird, I get angry at the place. I get angry at the land. As if the ground underneath us has betrayed us,' said Nordell. 'But of course, this place is a victim too, this farm is a victim.' How forever chemicals became a part of American life When the contamination was discovered on Fred Stone’s land, he says he was considered an anomaly. Now, in the course of this two-year NewsNation investigation, a growing list of farmers are coming forward, saying they are grappling with the same discovery on their land. Advocates like Erin Brockovich are sounding the alarm. She says when it comes to forever chemicals, 'the storm is here. And it’s not just in Maine, it’s in every single state.' 'EPA, FDA, political leaders, where have you been? How did you miss this? Now we have an entire country, an entire country that is potentially in peril from this ‘forever chemical’ that has destroyed our land, destroyed our farming, destroyed water and destroyed public health and welfare. Wow, kudos, good job,' Brockovich said to NewsNation in an exclusive interview. PFAS are colloquially called 'forever chemicals' because they are nearly impossible to destroy. The class of chemicals, technically called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, were created from the top-secret WWII nuclear bomb Manhattan Project. After the war, 3M bought the patent to develop these newly-discovered chemicals, finding they did a remarkable job in resisting water, oil and stains. 3M created a blockbuster product: Scotch Guard. Beyond a range of industrial applications, PFAS made their way into almost every American home, in carpet and couches, dental floss and rain jackets, pizza boxes and shampoo. Under the company DuPont, forever chemicals entered our kitchens, in our non-stick Teflon cookware. 'It's in firefighter gear, or it's in flame retardant clothing we put babies in, it's in the furniture that we spray with Scotch Guard, so we don't stain something. It's in our makeup. It's everywhere. It's in our coffee cups,' said Brockovich. 'It’s everything. It’s pretty catastrophic, that a chemical like this has gotten into every aspect of our life.' Forever chemicals have become so ubiquitous that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says 97% of Americans now have detectable levels of PFAS in their blood. The USGS says at least 45% of our drinking water has one or more type of PFAS. But how did forever chemicals end up on valuable American farmland? The answer lies in a type of fertilizer, made from treated human sewage, called biosolids, or more colloquially, 'sludge,' and a system that spreads it directly on their land. Spreading fertilizer 'sludge' on prime American cropland 'We have this bright idea that we're going to take all this sewer sludge, and we're going to spread it on the land as fertilizer,' said Brockovich. Epidemiologist Patrick MacRoy explained how this sludge is produced. He says the process starts with the manufacturing of PFAS. '3M and others actually manufacture these chemicals,' said MacRoy, and these manufacturing plants discharge waste to a sewer system, which goes to a wastewater treatment facility. Simultaneously, there are the PFAS found in our homes, from the clothing that is stain resistant to cleaning products and sofas and carpets. MacRoy says when we clean an item in the washing machine, or dump a bucket down the drain, that PFAS-contaminated waste also goes to a wastewater treatment facility. 'They have to do something with all of those solids that settle out, and that’s what we call sludge,' said MacRoy. 'Particularly in the 1970’s, we start taking that sludge and applying it to farmland as fertilizer. You have this contaminated sludge that then goes to a local farm where it's spread out.' 'If you look at the PFAS that's on the farmland, it goes into crops (that humans eat) or goes into crops that are eaten by animals, that we then eat. That PFAS, is eaten by us,' said MacRoy. MacRoy points out that at no point in this process does the EPA require sludge to be tested for PFAS before being spread on farmland: 'EPA requires the sewer districts to test for a handful of heavy metals, but they never test for PFAS. It’s just not tested, no one knows.' New video shows CEO shooting suspect enter Central Park MacRoy says all 50 states are impacted by sludging. Forty-eight states still spread biosolids today, the only exceptions being Maine and Connecticut. The Environmental Working Group claims as much as 20 million acres of American farmland could be contaminated by forever chemicals. 'You have almost like a cycle that you take the hazardous waste, apply the sludge on the land, you now contaminate the land that contaminates the water, that's contaminated the food chain. We're into a real serious problem here with this forever chemical,' said Brockovich. Fred Stone kept the 1986 letter from Maine’s Department of Environmental Protection, which he says told him the sludge was safe to spread on his farm. 'They said it was a safe, safe material to use on our fields. And again, we were we were doing our civic duty by using it and keeping the material off from landfills and what have you. So yeah, it was great. It was a 'win-win situation’ for everybody involved,' said Stone. Stone ultimately ended up sludging his land every year from 1983 to 2004. When Adam Nordell and Johanna Davis purchased their farm, they didn’t know the land had been sludged four times by a farmer in the early 1990’s. 'They were told it was their civic duty to help with the societal problem of municipal sludge. So they got a bad deal. We got a bad deal. That was not a good idea,' said Nordell. Fred Stone says that without a federal safety net, he understands why other American farmers wouldn’t be jumping to test their land. 'You’re out there asking someone to shoot you and you’re giving them the gun and the bullets to do it with. And you know damn well that you’re committing financial suicide. That’s what we did,' said Stone. The paper trail: What did chemical companies know? NewsNation poured over court documents that show what Erin Brockovich calls 'the shell game.' 'It’s moving stuff around for you know, for the end result that makes them more money, and leaves destruction in its path,' said Brockovich. Epidemiologist Patrick MacRoy reviewed the documents with NewsNation. 'We have in front of us here a large stack of documents that come from the chemical companies themselves, documenting what they knew about PFAS chemicals, their harm to people and harm to the environment. Most of this was secret, just kept in chemical industry files, right until various lawsuits forced them to disclose it,' said MacRoy. He says the documents start with animal studies in the 1950s and 1960s, that showed impacts to the liver, kidneys and spleen, and acute oral toxicity. 'Going all the way back to 1963, 3M knew there were risks with these chemicals. They put it in their own manual, that they're toxic, and they need precautions,' said MacRoy. In 1970, a test on firefighting foam had to be abandoned when the substance left all the fish dead. Then, in 1973, a DuPont study showed PFAS in food packaging impacts the livers of dogs. And in 1975, the first indication that PFAS already flowed in the blood of Americans. 'This was just unrelated to PFAS research - just scientists looking at chemicals in human blood,' said MacRoy. 'The average person already has PFAS in their blood by 1975.' Court filings show that 3M soon replicates this in their own studies. A 1979 letter from their lawyers appears to advise the company to conceal that the chemical found in human blood was a type of PFAS. A year later, in 1978, DuPont warned 3M about the toxic effects of PFAS in our food packaging. And by the late 1970s to early 1980s, documents suggest 3M and DuPont were becoming aware that their own employees were getting sick. 'In 1981, 3M was concerned enough about the potential for birth defects as a result of these chemicals, that they actually reassigned all the female workers in the plant to jobs that didn't involve exposure,' said MacRoy. By 1984, PFAS starts to appear in water. Specifically, DuPont detects forever chemicals in Little Hocking, Ohio. They do not tell the water utility. 'The levels they found back then, would be considered very high today,' said MacRoy. And through the late 1980s through early 1990s, workers keep getting sick — from 3M finding elevating cancer rates among their workers, their male workers more likely to die from prostate cancer, to DuPont finding higher cancer rates in their Parkersburg plant workers. More than two decades after scientists told 3M the blood of Americans contained PFAS, in 1998, 3M finally alerted the EPA that the type of PFAS in their Scotch Guard builds up in the blood. 'USDA and EPA, how in the hell did this get by you? It didn't. You knew something for the sake of money for lobbying power, you turned a blind eye,' said Brockovich. In 1999, a whistleblower came forward; a scientist at 3M by the name of Dr. Richard Purdy stepped down and sent a copy of his resignation letter to the EPA. 'This letter basically says, you have asked me to try to help identify where the problems with the substance are. We've identified a huge list of concerns. We need to do more research, the management is shutting me down. And I feel ethically like I cannot work at 3M anymore, because they are ignoring the science they are ignoring our request to do more study,' said MacRoy. By 2000, 3M agrees to phase out some PFAS in the course of an EPA investigation. According to the 2010 Minnesota Attorney General Congressional Testimony, at this time, 3M publicly suggests it recently learned PFAS are in human blood, when they had known since 1975. In 2005 and 2006, the EPA fined DuPont $10.25 million and 3M $1.5 million respectively. A major headline came in 2023, with a multi-billion dollar federal settlement over PFAS contamination in our nation’s tap water, forever chemicals making their way into many U.S. public drinking water systems. 'There’s a reason why they’re settling these lawsuits now for water contamination, because the more we study it, the more we find problems, the larger the problem is going to be. They're rushing now to try to settle things before the full scope of the problem is even understood,' said MacRoy. NewsNation reached out to both 3M and DuPont. Statement from 3M: As the science and technology of PFAS, societal and regulatory expectations, and our expectations of ourselves have evolved, so has how we manage PFAS. 3M announced in 2000 the phase out of manufacturing of PFOA and PFOS worldwide. In December 2022, 3M announced we will exit all PFAS manufacturing and work to discontinue the use of PFAS across our product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M is committed to providing accurate information about PFAS with appropriate context. We have shared significant information about PFAS over the decades, including the results of studies 3M conducted on PFOS. 3M also published many of its findings regarding PFAS in publicly available scientific journals dating back to the early 1980s. Those journals were and remain available to the scientific community and the public. Statement from DuPont: In June 2019, DuPont de Nemours was established as a new multi-industrial specialty products company. DuPont de Nemours has never manufactured or sold PFOA, PFOS or firefighting foam. While DuPont is not a PFAS commodity chemical manufacturer, it does use select PFAS compounds within industrial processes pursuant to relevant environmental, health and safety rules and standards. Such uses are necessary to impart specific product performance criteria and only in products that are essential to safety and the critical functioning of society. Our use of PFAS is limited and is managed as a Substance of Concern (SoC) consistent with the company’s Chemical Management Policy – Substance of Concern. We are currently pursuing alternatives to PFAS where possible. Additionally, we have rigorous systems, processes, and protocols in place to ensure that PFAS are used safely, are controlled to the highest standards, and are minimized in our operations. We support science-based efforts to develop guidelines for PFAS and commit to meeting these requirements in our global operations. We will continue to ensure our products and processes are fully compliant with laws and regulations on PFAS. Safety, health and protecting the planet are core values at DuPont. We are committed to continuous improvement of our chemical stewardship process and to upholding the highest standards for the safe operation of facilities and the protection of our environment, our employees, our customers, and the people of the communities in which we do business. The role of the EPA 'The chemical industries hid the full extent of the problem from the EPA until the late 1990s. But starting in the late 1990s, EPA had all the information, and they’ve done very little,' said MacRoy. MacRoy says 'The single biggest thing I think EPA could do today would be to require testing for PFAS before putting sludge on farmland.' In June of 2023, NewsNation went to D.C. for an interview with Radhika Fox, then-assistant administrator for water at EPA. When asked why decisive action wasn’t taken by the EPA in the late 1990s, Fox replied: 'The important thing is we're taking action now. We’re taking swift action under the President’s leadership.' NewsNation asked why biosolid sludge application was still continuing if the EPA could not guarantee its safety. Fox replied that 'land application of biosolids is one of the critical uses of biosolids from the treatment plants that are treating our wastewater. And in many instances, it’s perfectly safe.' She advised: 'One of the best things that someone can do is really educate themselves about what’s going on in their local community. I suggest talking to your local water system to see what they're doing, are they testing for PFAS, are they treating for it? We are working very diligently to get this national drinking water standard in place. At the end of the day, it is a partnership with our states and with local communities to together protect the American people.' In April of 2024, the Biden-Harris administration issued the first-ever national drinking water standard, they say it will protect 100 million people from PFAS pollution. The EPA still allows sludging to take place in all 50 states without testing requirements. Ohio bill would require high-demand liquor bottles to be opened when sold A group of Texas farmers are currently suing the EPA. The lawsuit contends that in failing to regulate PFAS in biosolid sludge, the agency violated the Clean Water Act and Administrative Procedures Act. The EPA is currently trying to get this lawsuit dismissed. 'The relief they seek — an order directing EPA to identify PFAS in its next biennial report, and to regulate PFAS thereafter — is simply not available,' the EPA wrote in a September 2024 court filing. A celebration at Misty Brook Farm After 11 long months of contamination, the sound of milk being poured into glass bottles instead of down the drain is music to Brendan and Katia Holmes’ ears. They proudly peel and stick a bright yellow 'PFAS tested' sticker on each bottle, carton and jug going to market. They don’t have to, but they want the public to ask questions. They say honesty and trust are what made them choose this land to begin with from the moment they asked the previous owner how to 'get in and see the place.' 'I said, ‘Hey, is there a key to the house?’ He said, ‘Key to the house?! I haven’t locked it since I built it.’ I’m like, alright, that’s the place I want to live,' said Brendan Holmes. 'When we moved up here it was do or die, we were either going to go bankrupt or make it work.' In year one, Misty Brook Farm grossed about $15,000. By 2021, it grossed $2 million and employed 13 people. 'It’s a good feeling. It’s a milestone. My goal in life is to leave the piece of land that I’m farming in better shape than I got it. If I wanted to make money, I wouldn’t have gotten into dairy farming. Maybe I’d have gotten work for DuPont. But money I don’t care about money. I care about quality and integrity,' said Holmes. Which is why when a customer asked them if they’d ever tested their milk for forever chemicals, they immediately put up thousands of dollars of their own money for testing. And when the results came back high, they say there wasn’t hesitation. 'People have fight flight or freeze. I go straight to fight. And to me, I’m like, ok I’m not the only one that this has happened to. And my fight is, I’m going to make this public,' said Holmes. They told the public and broke the news to their boys. Katia recalls the family’s conversation: 'Johnny was like, ‘When do we have to stop selling the milk?’ And Brennan said, ‘Now.’ Johnny’s like, ‘What are we going to do daddy?’ And Brennan said, ‘Well, I don’t know... but we’ll figure it out.' 'The first days, weeks, months, we call it firefighting, we were definitely in survival mode,' said Katia. Brendan Holmes had choice words for the chemical companies that profited off of PFAS products and did not disclose what they knew for years. 'When they had the choice of do we go public with this or do we sweep this under the rug, they chose the rug,' said Holmes. He described the gravity farmers across the country are facing with forever chemical contamination, and the lack of a safety net or recourse when contamination is found. 'Suicide among dairy farmers and farmers in general is incredibly high because a lot of these farms are third fourth and fifth generation and you are going to be the person to lose it, your great great great grandfather cleared the land, and you’re the person whose going to have a bankruptcy auction because you can’t hold onto the land.' They dumped 26,000 gallons of milk. 'We pride ourselves on producing milk that mothers can feed their children, and then to have them call us up and be like, ‘Is my kid going to be ok because I drank your milk?’ And it wasn’t anything we knowingly did,' said Holmes. Testing revealed their cows had become contaminated from someone else’s sludged farm. The tainted feed for their cows in Maine was grown in Kentucky. 'We are not responsible necessarily for how it happened, how the sludge was spread 20 or 30 years ago that the contaminated soils were where the feed came from. But we are responsible for how we move forward,' said Katia. Their own family’s bloodwork also tested high for forever chemicals. The Holmes found themselves putting it all on the line, again. 'We borrowed the money and we bought 50 cows that were uncontaminated. $73,000 we borrowed for a new herd,' said Brendan. ‘Scumbag’ Florida realtor had client taken off life support, stole assets: Sheriff After 11 months, thousands in loans and testing, making sure every ounce of feed and water was untainted, enough time passed that all of their cows came back clean. Their milk is now at 'non-detect' levels of PFAS, and sales have resumed. Since the contamination primarily came from outside the borders of their land, they found themselves in a more tenable situation than farmers like Fred Stone. But Holmes says he knows PFAS contamination has a way of coming back. He worries another farm’s contaminated feed could taint his herd all over again. 'The thing that keeps me up at night — in 2016, we had a severe drought, and I had to buy five tractor-trailer loads of feed from Pennsylvania. I can’t verify what soil that feed from Pennsylvania came from. And (with another drought) I will be rolling the dice,' said Holmes. Update on farmers surviving PFAS contamination NewsNation is updating these farmers’ stories after our two-year investigation. Brendan and Katia Holmes are still selling milk at Misty Brook Farms, praying no contamination comes back. Adam Nordell and Johanna Davis successfully sold their farm to the Maine Farmland Trust, it will be used as a research site to understand how PFAS moves through food and water. They have dedicated themselves to advocacy. Fred and Laura Stone received new test results: All of their cows are contaminated with PFAS About 90% of their usable farmland is also contaminated Fred says the farm is currently more than $450,000 in debt Fred’s family has set up a GoFundMe to help with costs Maine has successfully made bipartisan change, becoming: The first state to ban sludging The first state to ban the sale of products containing PFAS The first state to create a PFAS fund to help farmers Forty-eight states, however, continue to sludge.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/prime/pfas-forever-chemicals-sludge-farmers/	2024-12-07T17:52:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-07-154333.png?w=900
Man who spent day with Hannah Kobayashi opens up to police: Repor...	(NewsNation) — Police have provided new details about Hannah Kobayashi's disappearance, revealing that the 30-year-old photographer voluntarily traveled to Mexico after spending a night with a stranger in Los Angeles, People.com reported. Kobayashi disappeared while traveling from Hawaii to New York, missing a connecting flight in Los Angeles. Family members said they received texts that were out of character from her before her phone was turned off. Investigators with the Los Angeles Police Department told People.com Kobayashi met an unidentified man at Los Angeles International Airport on Nov. 11. The pair spent approximately nine hours together, walking through downtown Los Angeles and ultimately falling asleep at Union Station. Hannah Kobayashi’s aunt parts ways with rest of family According to Lt. Doug Oldfield and Detective Omar Franco, the man said Kobayashi appeared coherent and engaged during their encounter. He also told police she discussed her life in Maui, personal matters and travel plans, including intentions to visit the Redwoods and New York, People.com reported. Hannah Kobayashi seen crossing into Mexico Surveillance video showed Kobayashi at LA's Grove Market and near the stadium where the LA Lakers play. She did not appear to be alone in some of the footage, leading her family to fear she had been trafficked. At 6:10 a.m. on Nov. 12, Kobayashi purchased a bus ticket and traveled to the Mexican border, arriving in Tijuana around noon. Her phone was left behind at LAX. Police have classified her disappearance as voluntary and ended their active investigation, though Kobayashi remains in their missing persons system. The family's search for her was complicated by the suicide of her father, Ryan Kobayashi. Hannah Kobayashi may have been green card marriage scam victim Her mother and sister resisted, saying the police had released inaccurate information and were not updating them on developments. They said they do not think Kobayashi intentionally missed her flight and believe she may have been a victim of a green card marriage scam after photos of what appeared to be a wedding between Kobayashi and an unknown man surfaced online. Missing Hawaii woman may have been victim of green card marriage scam 'A Facebook user sent what looked like a Hawaiian beach wedding photo of Hannah with another man with leis around their necks wearing white, and they said that they learned off of Reddit that there was this sham marriage for money and that this is the wedding picture that’s being circulated on Reddit,' said Sara Azari, the Kobayashi family attorney, to NewsNation. 'Of course, that came as a shock to Hannah’s sister.' Los Angeles Magazine, citing unnamed sources, said Kobayashi may have been involved in a secret marriage plot for money. The magazine characterized the marriage as an immigration scheme where Hannah was tricked out of the money that she was supposed to receive. The Argentinian man believed to be involved was on the flight from Maui to LAX on Nov. 8, and so was Kobayashi’s ex-boyfriend. Police said they welcome any information from Kobayashi herself. 'We don't have her side of the story,' Oldfield said. Kobayashi, who worked as a photographer and smoke shop employee in Hawaii, was originally scheduled to fly to New York from LAX on Nov. 8 but did not board the flight. Authorities said they found no evidence of criminal activity or foul play in her disappearance. NewsNation's Anna Kutz and Mills Hayes contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/hannah-kobayashi-unknown-man-discussed-report/	2024-12-07T15:41:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Kobayashi4.jpg?w=581
Insurgents reach gates of Syria’s capital, threatening to upend d...	BEIRUT (AP) — Insurgents' stunning march across Syria accelerated Saturday with news that they had reached the gates of the capital and that government forces had abandoned the central city of Homs. The government was forced to deny rumors that President Bashar Assad had fled the country. The loss of Homs is a potentially crippling blow for Assad. It stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader’s base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The pro-government Sham FM news outlet reported that government forces took positions outside Syria’s third-largest city, without elaborating. Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Syrian troops and members of different security agencies have withdrawn from the city, adding that rebels have entered parts of it. The insurgency announced later Saturday that it had taken over Homs. The city's capture is a major victory for the rebels, who have already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a lightning offensive that began Nov. 27. Analysts said rebel control of Homs would be a game-changer. The rebels' moves around Damascus, reported by the monitor and a rebel commander, came after the Syrian army withdrew from much of southern part of the country, leaving more areas, including several provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters. For the first time in the country’s long-running civil war, the government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus. The advances in the past week were among the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. The rapid rebel gains, coupled with the lack of support from Assad's erstwhile allies, posed the most serious threat to his rule since the start of the war. The U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, on Saturday called for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Speaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum in Qatar, he said the situation in Syria was changing by the minute. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad's chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' In Damascus, people rushed to stock up on supplies. Thousands went to Syria's border with Lebanon, trying to leave the country. Many shops in the capital were shuttered, a resident told The Associated Press, and those still open ran out of staples such as sugar. Some were selling items at three times the normal price. 'The situation is very strange. We are not used to that,' the resident said, insisting on anonymity, fearing retributions. 'People are worried whether there will be a battle (in Damascus) or not.' It was the first time that opposition forces reached the outskirts of Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The U.N. said it was moving noncritical staff outside the country as a precaution. Assad's status Syria’s state media denied social media rumors that Assad left the country, saying he is performing his duties in Damascus. He has had little, if any, help from his allies. Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad's forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular Israeli airstrikes. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday posted on social media that that the United States should avoid engaging militarily in Syria. Pedersen said a date for talks in Geneva on the implementation a U.N. resolution, adopted in 2015, and calling for a Syrian-led political process, would be announced later. The resolution calls for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections. Later Saturday, foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran, along with Pederson, gathered on the sidelines of the Doha Summit to discuss the situation in Syria. In a statement issued late Saturday, the participants affirmed their support for a political solution to the Syrian crisis 'that would lead to the end of military activity and protect civilians.' They also agreed on the importance of strengthening international efforts to increase aid to the Syrian people. The insurgents' march Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said insurgents were in the Damascus suburbs of Maadamiyah, Jaramana and Daraya. Opposition fighters were marching toward the Damascus suburb of Harasta, he added. A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces had begun the 'final stage' of their offensive by encircling Damascus. HTS controls much of northwest Syria and in 2017 set up a 'salvation government' to run day-to-day affairs in the region. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group’s image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. The shock offensive began Nov. 27, during which gunmen captured the northern city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest, and the central city of Hama, the country’s fourth largest city. Opposition activists said Saturday that a day earlier, insurgents entered Palmyra, which is home to invaluable archaeological sites had been in government hands since being taken from the Islamic State group in 2017. To the south, Syrian troops left much of the province of Quneitra including the main Baath City, activists said. Syrian Observatory said government troops have withdrawn from much of the two southern provinces. The Syrian army said in a statement that it carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by 'terrorists.' The army said it was setting up a 'strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,' apparently to defend Damascus from the south. The Syrian government has referred to opposition gunmen as terrorists since conflict broke out in March 2011. Diplomacy in Doha The foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey, meeting in Qatar, called for an end to the hostilities. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels. Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country’s underlying problems. 'Assad didn’t seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,' he said. Sheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria’s 'territorial integrity.' He said the war could 'damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency' to start a political process. ____ Karam reported from London.

Net is tightening' on UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter: NYC mayor	New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the 'net is tightening' on the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect as the manhunt for the executive's assassin entered its fourth day. 'The net is tightening,' Adams told reporters on Saturday, according to WNBC’s video. 'We're going to bring this person to justice. I don't want to do anything that's going to impede on that investigation.' When asked by a reporter if police had the suspect's name, Adams said, 'We don't want to release that now. If you do, you're basically giving a tip to the person we are fine with seeking, and we do not want to give him an upper hand at all. Let him continue to believe he can hide behind a mask.' When reached for comment by The Hill, a New York Police Department (NYPD) spokesperson said, 'We don't have an ID that we are confirming.' New video shows CEO shooting suspect enter Central Park Adams' remarks come as the search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson continues. The FBI announced late Friday that it has joined the NYPD in the search for the suspect who assassinated Thompson Wednesday morning in Manhattan right before the healthcare executive was set to address investors. The FBI is offering $50,000 for information leading to the shooter's arrest and conviction. Adams said the shooting was an 'intentional act' based on the preliminary investigation. Law enforcement officials have released the photos of the suspect. They have been collecting and testing DNA evidence near the scene, including a protein bar wrapper and a discarded water bottle. A cellphone and fake ID have been discovered, which authorities believe was owned by the shooter. The suspect has likely fled New York City on a bus, according to law enforcement officials. Killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO uncorks anger at insurance industry 'We have video of him entering the Port Authority bus terminal. We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,' NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said earlier. The suspect’s path to Hilton Hotel Midtown, a spot where the assassination took place, is also being analyzed. The bullet shells found at the scene had the words 'deny,' 'defend' and 'depose' written on them. 'It's a horrific incident in our city, and we want to make sure this person is removed off the streets of America, not only off the streets of New York,' Adams said on Saturday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/net-is-tightening-on-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooter-nyc-mayor/	2024-12-07T14:42:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GeC-s1nWcAA_Hyn.jpg?w=680
Trump allies chafe at Senate GOP resistance to nominees	Some allies of President-elect Trump are lashing out at Senate Republicans as a second Cabinet nominee appears imperiled, raising questions about the extent of Trump’s mandate and how much leeway he should get to build his second administration. Trump has so far already seen one Cabinet pick withdraw in the face of Senate GOP opposition, with former Rep. Matt Gaetz bowing out as the nominee to serve as attorney general amid questions about a House ethics report and misconduct. Now, Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth is facing headwinds among some Republicans concerned about allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking at previous jobs. But multiple Trump allies have argued the president-elect should have wide latitude from Senate Republicans after his convincing election win last month, and they have aired frustrations about the pushback Hegseth in particular is getting. Donald Trump Jr. and others took to social media to highlight how many Republican senators backed President Biden’s picks for Defense secretary (Lloyd Austin) and attorney general (Merrick Garland), suggesting those same lawmakers should fall in line to support Hegseth. 'What a disgrace. If you're a GOP Senator who voted for Lloyd Austin, but criticize @PeteHegseth, then maybe you're in the wrong political party!' Trump Jr. posted on X. The tensions underscore how some of Trump’s picks for his Cabinet were unorthodox or did not weigh confirmability, testing just how much he can bend Senate Republicans to his will. 'He wants people who he thinks are gonna get the job done, whether it’s being a disruptor, a reformer or getting the most out of that agency or department. Next, he’s looking for people who understand the America first principles and demonstrated loyalty over the past 10 years. So that overrode anything else,' one Trump ally told The Hill of the president-elect's nominees. 'At the same time, you’re seeing a situation where there’s a lot of Republican senators that need to grow a pair,' the ally added. 'They need to understand there’s a very narrow window to get things done. The American people have given him a mandate to say no more status quo.' Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a staunch Trump ally, penned an op-ed in Newsweek on Thursday decrying how Senate Republicans were 'scuttling' some of Trump’s nominees. 'Why do Republicans insist on snatching defeat from the jaws of victory?' Biggs wrote. 'We won the election. We have a mandate. We have slim majorities in Congress, but the American people sent Washington, D.C. a signal to end business as usual.' Republicans, after spending four years in the minority, won back the majority in the Senate in November by securing 53 seats. That was despite GOP candidates losing in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, all states Trump carried over Vice President Harris. As a result, Trump’s nominees can only afford up to three GOP defections assuming all Democrats vote against them. That has led to some early issues for a few of his picks. Gaetz, the former congressman who was Trump’s first pick to lead the Justice Department, struggled to win over senators from the outset amid concerns about a looming House Ethics report about his behavior and broader questions about sexual misconduct. Trump expended little political capital to try and push Gaetz across the finish line, and the former congressman withdrew from consideration roughly a week after he was first announced. The resistance from senators to Hegseth has drawn more pushback from Trump’s allies, however. The former Fox News host and Army veteran has seen his nomination pushed to the brink in the face of mounting allegations of sexual misconduct, excessive drinking and other controversial behavior in his previous jobs. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), among other GOP senators, have signaled they are not ready to back Hegseth’s nomination. 'The President deserves a presumption that the people he nominates should be the ones who serve in those positions. This is about Trump's agenda. It's putting America First,' Elbridge Colby, who served in the Pentagon during Trump’s first term, said Friday on CNBC. Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday that Hegseth was doing 'very well' and had strong support. But Trump has so far not worked the phones or publicly pressured senators to back Hegseth, and he has spoken to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) about leading the Pentagon in the event Hegseth withdraws. The Hegseth nomination is unlikely to be the last one to face intense scrutiny from Republicans, however, potentially setting up further clashes between Trump’s supporters and GOP senators. Tulsi Gabbard, who is Trump’s choice to serve as director of national intelligence, has already been met with skepticism from some lawmakers who worry about her past comments parroting Russian propaganda and her 2017 meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services, is likely to be grilled over his anti-vaccine rhetoric and other controversial views on raw milk and fluoride. Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist tapped to serve as FBI director, is expected to face a tough confirmation battle, and senators have already said they have questions about Trump’s choice of former Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) to serve as IRS commissioner. Trump’s critics have pushed back on the idea that the incoming administration has a sweeping mandate from the public. While Trump won the seven battleground states in November, he did not crack 50 percent support nationally, and his popular vote margin was under 2 percentage points. 'To the extent that there was any mandate that has emerged from this most recent election, it is that the American people want us to work hard to lower the high cost of living and to bring down grocery prices, gas prices, the cost of childcare, and housing costs,' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters Friday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-allies-chafe-at-senate-gop-resistance-to-nominees/	2024-12-07T12:57:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/trump-allies_samuels_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Hamas releases hostage video claiming to show living hostage	JERUSALEM, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Hamas released a video claiming to show Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker in captivity on Saturday. In the video a man who introduces himself as Matan Zangauker, 24, can be seen pleading with the Israeli leaders to make a deal that would bring captives being held by Hamas in Gaza back to Israel. Mediating countries, including Qatar, see increased momentum for a possible deal that could allow the 100 hostages being held in Gaza to be released in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners after Israel signed a landmark ceasefire deal with Hezbollah in Lebanon last month. Donald Trump's Middle East envoy has traveled to Qatar and Israel to try to kickstart the U.S. president-elect's diplomatic push for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal before he takes office on Jan. 20, a source briefed on the talks told Reuters. New video shows CEO shooting suspect enter Central Park Hamas has released several videos of hostages begging to be released throughout the war as it enters its fifteenth month, but Israeli officials have dismissed the short, edited clips as psychological propaganda meant to put pressure on the government. The Hostage Families Forum, which represents hostage family members, called the video 'proof of life' and said that it 'provides further evidence that after more than 420 days in captivity, there are hostages still alive and enduring severe suffering'.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/hamas-releases-hostage-video-claiming-to-show-living-hostage/	2024-12-07T12:02:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2188135178.jpg?w=900
Trump's new coalition puts female nominees at forefront	Women are set to play a key role in President-elect Trump’s administration, as he nominates and appoints a number of them to high-level posts. Trump has so far named eight women to Cabinet-level positions — double the four initially named for his first term. His appointment of Susie Wiles to be his chief of staff makes her the first woman to hold that position in U.S. history. And he has chosen other women for high-level posts, such as press secretary and surgeon general. The president-elect’s allies say the appointments are emblematic of Trump’s push to elevate women amid criticism about his past comments and alleged treatment of women in the past. And they come on the heels of a historic election where female voters were a key bloc behind his victory. 'You're not seeing an administration that’s sort of an old boys club,' said one former Trump administration official. The president-elect's picks have yet to be confirmed, but his appointment of more women to his administration’s inner circle appears as part of a 'quest' to build a new coalition, said Micki McElya, a history professor at the University of Connecticut. 'He's certainly promoting more women to top jobs than he did the first time,' McElya said. Trump has so far nominated Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, while Linda McMahon, who served in Trump’s Small Business Administrator in his first administration, has been nominated to serve as his Education secretary. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) is Trump’s nominee for Homeland Security Secretary, and Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Oregon) is his nominee to be Labor Secretary. Attorney and policy adviser Brooke Rollins is his Agriculture secretary nominee. Former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) has been picked to lead Trump’s Small Business Administration. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi became his nominee for attorney general after his first choice, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), withdrew. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, would make history as the first woman of Pacific heritage to hold the role. 'This is still the best country and the most diverse country in the world, and you see that in his Cabinet picks, but it’s happening organically,' said Roma Daravi, former deputy director of strategic communications in Trump’s White House. 'All of these people, extremely diverse around him, you get that when you stop looking for color and gender,' she added. But besides Gabbard, and Chavez-DeRemer, who is a Latina, Trump’s high-level female picks are largely white women — representing a critical demographic that helped boost him to victory against Vice President Kamala Harris. His picks appear as 'a part of a continued appeal to the white women voters who have been so important and really powerful to Trump's new coalition,' said McElya. 'I think coming right out of the gate with the first woman to be in a position of chief of staff, as we are coming off of what would have been a historic first in terms of the presidency ... I think there was something very ... pointed about coming right off of that victory and saying, ‘I am promoting this woman to this position of leadership.’' Samantha Dravis, a former official in the first Trump administration, contended Trump is surrounding himself with smart picks. 'He’s got women around him who provide him with sound and good counsel and who get things done,' she said. 'All of these women have on their own merits the education, the expertise, the experience to be in these particular roles,' she said. 'So, I wouldn’t say this is a president who is selecting women simply because they’re women.' A total of seven women served in Trump’s first Cabinet at different points from 2017 to the beginning of 2021. Additionally, Trump had a number of prominent women representing his administration in front of the press including his former press secretaries Sarah Sanders, Kayleigh McEnany, and Stephanie Grisham, who also served as White House communications director for a period. Mercedes Schlapp worked as the White House director of strategic communications, and Kellyanne Conway, who ran Trump’s 2016 campaign, worked as a senior counselor. 'Trump had many women in the past administration as well,' said Republican strategist Ashley Davis, who served in the George W. Bush administration. 'He supports strong women and rewards their hard work. It actually doesn’t surprise me.' By contrast, President Biden has appointed 13 women to Cabinet or Cabinet-level positions during his tenure, according to data compiled by the Center for American Women and Politics, the most of any administration in U.S. history. Daravi, who worked for McMahon in Trump’s Small Business Administration, noted that many of the women Trump appointed during his first administration are still in his orbit. 'All of these people still are surrounding him,' Daravi said. 'Some are taking roles in the administration. Some are taking roles in their own public positions,' she said, noting Sanders’ election as governor of Arkansas. This time around, Trump has tapped Karoline Leavitt for White House press secretary. At 27 years old, Leavitt will make history as the youngest person to hold the position. Experts say that the picks for the second administration have a few characteristics in common. A number of Trump’s chosen names 'are seemingly younger than is often the case with these particular nominations,' noted Lilly Goren, political science professor at Carroll University. 'I think most of the commonality is disruptors, good on camera, good on controversy. And large donors, like McMahon,' McElya said. Goren argued that the picks appear more as a sign of with whom Trump’s comfortable — who's worked with him before, or whom he’s assured is loyal — than a strategic play to get more women in his circle. Another factor complicating any analysis of Trump’s appointees is the churn that’s all but expected of a Trump administration, Goren added. In his first term, Cabinet turnover broke records — and a handful of Trump’s second-term nominees have already withdrawn. 'He went through so many different people in different roles in his first administration,' Goren said. 'I am not necessarily sure how long each of these people will be in their position if they are confirmed by the Senate,' she said of his second-term choices. Trump’s critics say the president-elect has a poor track record with women, pointing to sexual misconduct allegations against him as well as his past comments about his female critics and political opponents. That’s evidenced in some of his male picks for his top administration roles, McElya said. Several of Trump’s Cabinet picks — including Gaetz — face allegations of sexual misconduct. Trump himself was found liable last year for sexual abuse. But Republicans and Trump allies argue that the president-elect is not getting enough credit for his effort to appoint and nominate more women to the administration. 'One thing that’s been frustrating to me is that you just don’t see President Trump getting credit for that,' said the former Trump administration official. 'Republican women seem to just constantly get attacked or maligned by the media instead of being praised for the fact that we are putting women in so many important and consequential roles,' the official added. Davis noted that women, regardless of party, are held to a higher standard. 'I always say we work harder and prepare longer and harder because we are always watched differently than our male colleagues. I don’t think it is different with R’s and D’s or who you work for,' Davis said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-new-coalition-puts-female-nominees-at-forefront/	2024-12-07T11:39:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/trump-women_manchester_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
San Diego Border Patrol agents on alert after cartel threats	(NewsNation) — Mexican cartels could be planning to shoot Border Patrol agents in the San Diego sector in response to a previous incident, according to an internal memo exclusively obtained by NewsNation. Border Patrol warned agents in a memo on Thursday that the potential retaliation shooting could happen in the coming days. The threats follow a Nov. 27 incident at the border in the Chula Vista area within the San Diego sector when an agent's vehicle struck someone entering the country illegally. Border Patrol believes the individual involved was a cartel member. 'Therefore, cartel leaders are angered, claiming the incident occurred without cause or remorse,' the memo said. Border Patrol sent a memo to its agents on Thursday, Dec. 7, 2024, warning them of possible cartel violence. The cartel threatened to shoot at agents, according to Border Patrol. Migrant crossings at points of entry reach new levels A video of the incident has circulated on social media, showing several men had just illegally scaled one fence along the border, and they were working on crossing another into the U.S. Images show a group of men on the ground, likely cartel operatives who were helping people cross into the U.S. illegally. Border Patrol said the agent driving the vehicle was responding to this and he was fixated on the two men climbing the wall, and that's when he collided with the suspected cartel members on the ground. Now, top leaders from transnational criminal organizations are directing their members to fire at Border Patrol agents in retaliation. #EXCLUSIVE Top Mexican cartel leaders are ordering that members retaliate against agents in the San Diego sector by shooting at them—The order comes in response to a Border Patrol agent hitting a suspected cartel member with their patrol vehicle during what CBP describes as a… pic.twitter.com/XwuTDJU3lR&mdash; Ali Bradley (@AliBradleyTV) December 6, 2024 'The information received indicated the shooting could possibly occur over the next few days,' the memo said. 'All Agents, regardless of duty assignment, should remain vigilant.' Sources within Border Patrol leadership told NewsNation that any time the cartel threatens to shoot at agents, it should be taken seriously, and the San Diego sector should be on high alert. Agents turn to e-bikes to patrol the border The U.S. Attorney's Office, along with Customs and Border Protection and the Office of Professional Responsibility, are investigating the agent-involved car collision. In October, the Sinaloa Cartel was given permission to fire at agents in the U.S., and law enforcement said the escalation in violence is concerning. 'This is the difference of the evolution of the cartels. They fear no one anymore, especially the U.S. law enforcement,' said Victor Avila, a former agent with Homeland Security. 'We know that they have no regard, and they do whatever they want in Mexico, and they're running a parallel government over there.' The cartel runs a $13 billion-a-year industry, Congress estimates. 'In fact they do have the resources, and in fact they do have the capabilities and will use them against us,' Avila said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-patrol-warns-agents-cartel-threats/	2024-12-07T09:35:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2157517525.jpg?w=900
Here are the billionaires stocking Trump’s next administration	President-elect Trump has named several billionaires to top roles in his next administration — a combination worth over $360 billion and that includes the world’s richest person. Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO, brings the vast bulk of that wealth: a net worth of more than $346 billion, with that value fluctuating day by day. But even without Musk, the remaining billionaires who are worth a combined more than $15 billion outpace Trump’s first administration, which at the time was the wealthiest in modern history, at $6.2 billion. Trump himself is reportedly worth an estimated $5.6 billion. Here are the billionaires expected to stock Trump’s next administration. Elon Musk The richest person in the world was tapped to co-lead the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an advisory board tasked with looking at how to decrease government waste through cutting the federal workforce, government programs and regulations. Musk, who was on Capitol Hill on Thursday meeting with lawmakers, is worth more than $346 billion as of Friday. His net worth fluctuates regularly based on his business ventures and the market; Musk is the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, formerly known as Twitter. Vivek Ramaswamy Vivek Ramaswamy is the other co-lead of DOGE. He ran for president in the 2024 GOP presidential primary before he dropped out and put his full support behind Trump. At 39 years old, he is worth $1 billion and is one of the 20 youngest billionaires in the U.S. The biotech entrepreneur founded pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences in 2014 and it went public in 2021. He stepped down as CEO of Roivant in 2021 when he first turned to politics. Scott Bessent Trump appointed Scott Bessent to be Treasury secretary, a role other major businessmen were jockeying for. Bessent, if confirmed by the Senate, would lead Trump’s economic team, including being responsible for imposing his aggressive tariff and tax plans The South Carolina-based businessman is the founder and CEO of the hedge fund Key Square Group, which reportedly managed billions of dollars and at times has also struggled with losses. He previously was an executive with Soros Fund Management, the firm of Democratic donor George Soros. Howard Lutnick Howard Lutnick, who is the co-chair for Trump’s transition team, was picked for Commerce secretary after angling for the Treasury top job. Lutnick is worth more than $1.5 billion. He is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and gained national prominence for overseeing the company’s response following the 9/11 attacks that killed more than 600 of its employees working inside the World Trade Center in New York. Linda McMahon Linda McMahon is the other co-chair of Trump’s transition and was picked by the president-elect to lead the Education Department. McMahon co-founded World Wrestling Entertainment with her husband, Vince McMahon, who has a net worth of $3 billion. The couple was accused in a lawsuit in October of knowing about a ringside announcer who allegedly abused young boys for years and doing nothing about it. Jacob Isaacman Trump named Jacob Isaacman to lead NASA in the incoming administration, appointing a tech entrepreneur who recently worked with Musk when he helped fund a SpaceX flight he was aboard in September. He has a net worth of $1.7 billion. Isaacman is the CEO of the processing firm Shift4 Payments, which he founded at 16 years old in 1999. He then founded defense firm Draken International in 2011 and later sold it to Blackstone. Warren Stephens Trump appointed Stephens to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, which would send him to England for one of the most coveted diplomatic roles. Stephens is worth $3.4 billion. The Arkansas-based billionaire has been chair and CEO of his investment banking company Stephens Inc., for three decades. The bank was founded by his uncle and father and after Stephens became CEO in 1986, he bought out his cousins. Stephen Feinberg Stephen Feinberg was tapped to serve as deputy Defense secretary this week, while Trump’s choice for Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has faced growing scrutiny over sexual assault, mismanagement of finances and excessive drinking allegations. Feinberg’s net worth is $5 billion. He is the co-founder of the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which invests in the grocery chain Albertsons and controversially was invested in the gun manufacturer that made the rifle used in the 2012 massacre in Sandy Hook, Conn. Kelly Loeffler Kelly Loeffler, a former Georgia senator, was named to serve as administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Wednesday. She is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, who is worth $1.1 billion. Sprecher is the CEO of the stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange. Before serving in the Senate, Loeffler was CEO at digital asset company Bakkt, which Intercontinental Exchange formed. She was also a co-owner of the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream before selling the team in 2021. Charles Kushner Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was named the U.S. ambassador to France. The real estate firm he founded, Kushner Companies, has a market value of nearly $3 billion. Kushner previously served two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to charges of tax evasion, lying to the Federal Election Commission and retaliating against a federal witness. Trump pardoned him during the final month of his first term in 2021.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/here-are-the-billionaires-stocking-trumps-next-administration/	2024-12-07T03:41:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Trump-billionaires_120624_Illustration_Courtney-JonesAlex-BrandonJohn-Raoux-Mike-Stewart-and-Evan-VucciAPand-Adobe-Stock.png?w=900
New video shows CEO shooting suspect enter Central Park	(NewsNation) — Exclusive never-before-seen footage obtained by NewsNation shows the suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's death entering Central Park from the bike lane on 6th Avenue, just minutes after the fatal shooting. Thompson, 50, was shot just before 7 a.m. Wednesday near a hotel on 54th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, sources told NewsNation. The suspect, described by police as a 'light-skinned male' wearing a light brown or cream-colored jacket and a distinctive gray backpack, fled the scene on foot before hopping on a Citibike. UnitedHealthcare CEO killing: Police find gunman’s backpack The exclusive video shows new angles of his escape path, including the suspect riding up 6th Avenue, past 58th Street, before darting across the street and riding right into the darkness of Central Park. Just 15 minutes later, he’s spotted again leaving Central Park from the west side at 77th Street, without his distinctive backpack. Police say he then turned up on 86th Street, minus his bike, and headed north to the Port Authority Bus Station via taxi. Authorities say there’s no video of him leaving, so they assume he boarded a bus, including a possibly interstate route. Who is the suspect in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? On Friday, police told NewsNation they found the gray backpack the gunman was shown wearing in surveillance video in Central Park. The bag is currently being processed for evidence, and authorities have not released any information about what was inside or where it was found within the park. Just moments before the backpack was found, a 'Banfield' producer was in the park retracing the gunman’s path. She saw investigators searching the area, capturing an exclusive video of authorities looking for the suspect’s bag. NewsNation also obtained the exclusive never-before-seen video of the gunman riding his bike into Central Park — just moments before he dumped the bag. NYPD release photos of alleged suspect. The New York Police Department released photos of a person of interest wanted for questioning in connection to the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (NYPD) UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting time discrepancy The exclusive video is time-stamped at 6:45 a.m. Police say Thompson was gunned down at 6:44 or 6:45 a.m. Wednesday, which means the shooting may have happened a few minutes earlier than reported. Tracing the UnitedHealthCare CEO killer’s steps NYPD: 'Reason to believe' suspect left NYC In New York, authorities have deployed police drones, helicopters and dogs in their comprehensive search for the shooter and have a 'massive presence' in Manhattan, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said. 'We have the drones up. We have aviation out. We have K-9 out,' he said. 'An incident like this happens — we don’t spare any expense.' As of Friday evening, NYPD has reason to believe the suspect has left the city, police sources confirmed to NewsNation's Rich McHugh. The NYPD is offering up to $10,000 for information that leads to an arrest in the case.

Verdict reached in Daniel Penny's manslaughter trial	(NewsNation) — The judge in the Daniel Penny trial dismissed the manslaughter charge against the former Marine on Friday afternoon. The judge accepted the motion to dismiss the first count against Penny before sending the jury home for the weekend. They are scheduled to return Monday morning to deliberate on the second count. 'What I'm gonna do is this, manslaughter in second degree is dismissed, you are now free to consider count 2. Whether that makes any difference, I have no idea, but I direct you to focus deliberations on count 2. Render a verdict on that one,' he said. Penny has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges in the death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old experiencing homelessness. Penny placed Neely in a chokehold for nearly six minutes after the man threatened to kill other passengers on the subway. The jury, made up of five men and seven women, deliberated after closing arguments in the trial began Monday. Defense attorneys representing Penny petitioned a judge last week to have the charges against their client dismissed, but the judge ruled that the case would move to closing arguments. The defense rested earlier Friday after electing not to have Penny testify in his own defense. Deliberations began after the seven-week trial that included 40 witnesses. Jury members also watched hours of video during the trial and listened to recordings of 911 calls that were placed following the incident. During their deliberations, the jury sent a series of notes to the judge, requesting key pieces of evidence, including cell phone video footage of Penny keeping the chokehold on Neely. The jury also requested that the judge read definitions of 'recklessness' and 'negligence', which spoke to the issue of Penny's justification for his actions. Jordan Neely’s cause of death is disputed Central to the case was whether the hold that Penny put on Neely led to the man’s death. The medical examiner, key to the prosecution, said the reason for Neely’s death was the chokehold, but the defense’s experts said this was not the case. He said it was a combination of four factors: restraint and struggle, sickle cell crisis, a synthetic drug in his system called K-2 and schizophrenia. Penny told officers in an interview room that Neely told passengers on the subway, 'I’m gonna kill everybody. I’m gonna go to prison forever. I don’t care. I’m gonna do this.' New York police officers respond to the scene where a fight was reported on a subway train, Monday, May 1, 2023, in New York. A man suffering an apparent mental health episode aboard a New York City subway died on Monday after being placed in a headlock by a fellow rider, according to police officials and video of the encounter. Jordan Neely, 30, was shouting and pacing aboard an F train in Manhattan witnesses and police said, when he was taken to the floor by another passenger. (Paul Martinka via AP) The defense’s clinical pathologist, Dr. Satish Chundru, testified that Neely’s injuries sustained in the 2023 incident, along with video shot by passengers, did not indicate that Neely died from the chokehold applied by Penny. Chundru, citing medical records, testified that the location and extent of the bruising Neely sustained, along with other factors, led him to conclude that the chokehold was not fatal. In addition to the bruising on Neely’s neck, Chundru testified that there was a small amount of petechiae — small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding — on his eyelids. Chundru concluded that Neely died from 'the combined effects' of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Prosecutors maintained that Penny's actions are directly connected to Neely's death. 'I’m sure that you had absolutely no question in your mind about what caused Jordan Neely's death. It’s too obvious,' Yoran said during her closing argument. 'This is a clear case of death by chokehold.' Daniel Penny encounters Jordan Neely Jurors learned during the trial that Neely was begging for money on May 1, 2023, but that he began to shout to passengers that he was willing to die or go to jail. Daniel Penny, accused of choking a distressed Black subway rider to death, arrives for opening statements in New York, Friday, Nov. 1, 2024.(AP Photo/Kena Betancur) Testimony included that Neely, who sometimes entertained passengers as an Elvis impersonator aboard the subway, began acting erratically and began making threats to passengers, witnesses said. Penny has said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, 'I will kill.' Penny put his arm around Neely’s neck, took him to the floor, and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving at roughly the last minute, witnesses said. Penny’s defense attorneys asked jury members to put themselves in the shoes of those aboard the train, while prosecutors countered that Penny acted too aggressively and was forceful and reckless in responding to Penny. Defense attorney Steven Raiser told jurors during his closing argument that Neely was filled with rage when he entered the train and was not afraid of any consequences. However, prosecutors argued that despite Neely’s actions, Penny went too far. 'You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing, no matter what it is that they are saying,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran told jurors during her closing argument, according to The Associated Press. Raiser told jurors this week that his client could not release Neely from the hold without putting others in danger. He also said that Penny never applied enough pressure to Neely to cause his death. Prosecutors disagreed, citing Penny’s military experience. 'He was trained in this,' Yoran said during her closing argument, referring to the chokehold, according to The New York Times, 'and yet he continued with the foreseeable and tragic results.'

Hannah Kobayashi's aunt parts ways with rest of family	(NewsNation) — The aunt of missing woman Hannah Kobayashi announced she is parting ways with Kobayashi's mother and sister in her effort to locate her niece. Larie Pidgeon told NewsNation that she made the decision to part ways with her sister and daughter and said she saw no need to use funds raised by the family on a lawyer instead of a private investigator. Pidgeon also said she is not associated with her sister's GoFundMe account and never has been. Hannah Kobayashi: Timeline of missing Maui woman’s case 'My sole focus remains on finding Hannah and ensuring her safety and well-being. It has now been 25 days since anyone has heard from her, and I am determined to continue my search,' she said. 'I am preparing to travel to Mexico personally to further the efforts to locate her and verify that she is acting of her own free will and is truly safe.' Kobayashi disappeared while on a trip from Hawaii to New York, missing a connecting flight in Los Angeles. Family members said they received texts that were out of character from her before her phone was turned off. Surveillance video showed Kobayashi at LA's Grove Market and near the stadium where the LA Lakers play. She did not appear to be alone in some of the footage, leading her family to fear she had been trafficked. The family's search for her was complicated by the suicide of her father, Ryan Kobayashi. Police later said Hannah Kobayashi intentionally skipped her flight and instead went to Mexico on foot, classifying her case as a voluntary missing persons case. Her mother and sister pushed back, saying police had released inaccurate information and were not updating them on developments. Zoe Penrod disappeared in the midst of postpartum psychosis They said they do not think Kobayashi intentionally missed her flight and believe she may have been a victim of a green card marriage scam after photos of what appeared to be a wedding between Kobayashi and an unknown man surfaced online. 'A Facebook user sent what looked like a Hawaiian beach wedding photo of Hannah with another man with leis around their necks wearing white, and they said that they learned off of Reddit that there was this sham marriage for money and that this is the wedding picture that’s being circulated on Reddit,' said Sara Azari, the Kobayashi family attorney, to NewsNation. 'Of course, that came as a shock to Hannah’s sister.' When asked about Pidgeon's statement, Azari implied Pidgeon was motivated by raising her profile as an influencer.

Daniel Penny trial: Judge gives Allen charge to jury	(NewsNation) — The judge in the trial of Daniel Penny, who is charged in the death of Jordan Neely after placing him in a chokehold for several minutes on a New York City subway, implored jurors to reach a verdict Friday. Judge Maxwell Wiley gave jurors the Allen charge on Friday, which are instructions reminding the jurors of how much time and money has gone into the case and how imperative it is that they reach a decision. This comes after jurors told Wiley they are unable to come to a unanimous decision on the manslaughter charge against Penny, who also faces one for criminally negligent homicide. Penny has pleaded not guilty. Missouri lawmaker proposes bounty system to report migrants Deliberations on the count of manslaughter resumed after jurors were given the Allen charge. Jurors have sent multiple different notes to the judge requesting key pieces of evidence since it began deliberating Tuesday. The central question they face is whether Penny was justified in placing the chokehold on Neely on May 1, 2023. Witnesses said Neely boarded a train in Manhattan and started acting erratically. Penny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck and head, and took him to the floor.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/daniel-penny-trial-allen-charge-jury/	2024-12-06T09:26:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673bd442284430.97894311.jpeg?w=900
This is my Chernobyl:' Texas ranchers watch cows die because of ...	Watch the full special 'Going Broke: Forever Chemicals in America' on Saturday at 9/8c on NewsNation. Find your channel here. (NewsNation) — Texas ranchers Tony and Karen Coleman say it started with the fish, their silver bodies discovered floating in the water. Then, Karen’s prized horses. Now, the cows are dying, developing a signature staggering gait before wasting, often writhing on the ground in their final moments, their lowing loud and panicked. Even calves, appearing to be born in perfect condition, are dying the next day on their ranch. 'It’s like a nightmare you can’t wake up from,' said Tony Coleman. 'You go home at night and you don’t really sleep well, because you know the next day is coming, and you know what it’s going to bring. I don’t think there’s enough words. It’s like ripping your heart out.' T-K Ranch is a family operation, inherited from Karen Coleman's father in Johnson County, Texas. She says these cows are his legacy. Missouri lawmaker proposes bounty system to report migrants (Tony and Karen Coleman) 'It’s the worst anguish you can imagine,' Karen Coleman told NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves. 'I wouldn’t wish this experience on my worst enemy.' The Colemans say 39 of their animals have died since the start of 2023; they have about 130 cattle left. Testing by the county revealed contamination that curiously extended from the fertilizer spread on the neighbor’s farmland across the street — to the soil and water on the Colemans' properties, as well as their animals. Tony and Karen Coleman say their own blood is now also testing high for Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. What are PFAS? PFAS are commonly called 'forever chemicals' because they are almost impossible to break down. PFAS are completely human-made, created from the top secret World War II nuclear bomb Manhattan Project. After the war, 3M bought the patent to develop these newly discovered chemicals and found they did a remarkable job in resisting water, oil and stains. 3M created the blockbuster product Scotch Guard. PFAS quickly became nearly ubiquitous in American lives, making their way into food packaging and firefighting foam; products ranging from makeup to dental floss; in our homes in carpets and couches — and under the company DuPont, in our Teflon non-stick pans. 'It’s in firefighting gear, it’s in the flame retardant clothing we put babies in, it’s in the furniture that we spray scotch guard on,' Environmental Advocate Erin Brockovich said. 'It’s in our makeup, it’s everywhere. It’s in our coffee cups. It’s in everything. It’s pretty catastrophic, that a chemical like this has gotten into every aspect of our life.' (Tony and Karen Coleman) PFAS are linked with a range of serious health issues, including cancer, damage to the liver, to the thyroid and fertility. According to the CDC, PFAS can now be found in the blood of 97% of Americans. The United States Geological Survey believes it’s in 45% of our drinking water. The Colemans had never heard of PFAS before their animals began dying. They have since discovered that their neighbor’s farmland was 'sludged' — spread with a type of fertilizer made from treated human sewage called biosolids. The issue is that biosolids can be contaminated with a variety of chemicals or hazardous materials, including PFAS. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does require biosolid sludge to be tested for toxins like certain heavy metals. It does not, however, require sludge to be monitored for PFAS before it’s spread on farmland. The Environmental Working Group claims that nearly 20 million acres of American cropland has been spread with sludge, and 48 out of 50 states still spread sludge on farmland. PFAS Contamination Lawsuit Now, the Colemans are part of group of Texas farmers who have filed a PFAS contamination lawsuit against the Enviromental Protection Agency. The lawsuit contends that in failing to regulate PFAS in biosolids sludge, the agency violated the Clean Water Act and Administrative Procedures Act. The EPA is currently trying to get this lawsuit dismissed. 'The relief they seek— an order directing EPA to identify PFAS in its next biennial report, and to regulate PFAS thereafter—is simply not available,' the EPA wrote in a September 2024 court filing. The EPA could not immediately be reached for comment on the Colemans’ case. Kevin McCarthy: Gaetz lied to Trump before AG nomination Tony Coleman says he has this message for the EPA: 'Why? I wouldn’t bother nobody, I was just raising some cows. Why wouldn't you protect me like you were supposed to? And why don’t you have the gonads to admit you were wrong?' The Colemans say they are facing financial ruin. Tony already describes working 19-hour days, and says he is now looking for a third job to make ends meet. They say it is not illegal for them to keep selling meat from their contaminated cattle — the only issue is their conscience. Both say they refuse to poison their fellow Americans. 'What kind of human would inject something that you know is not healthy into our food system?' Tony Coleman asks. 'That makes us no better than the folks who knew the stuff they spread was no good.'

Recordings implicate killed Kentucky judge in alleged sextortion ...	(NewsNation) — NewsNation has exclusively obtained audio recordings that could tie a now-dead Kentucky judge to a sex-for-favors scandal one week after the suspect, a former sheriff, pleaded not guilty to killing him. District Judge Kevin Mullins, 54, was in his chambers at a courthouse in Whitesburg, Kentucky, on Sept. 19 when Letcher County Sheriff Shawn M. 'Mickey' Stines, 43, allegedly shot and killed him. The recordings are from the criminal investigation into a Letcher County deputy sheriff who went to prison earlier this year for rape and sodomy of a female inmate in 2022. 'He does have some videotapes of some stuff in the judge’s chambers… just with girls, sexual and stuff,' said Sabrina Adkins, who has spoken publicly about her claims of former Deputy Sheriff Ben Fields using his position of power to pressure her and other women to have sex in exchange for favorable treatment. Adkins' attorney, Ned Pillersdorf, told NewsNation, 'it's like they were running a brothel out of that courtroom.' California school shooter had extensive criminal history, was possibly homeless, officials say She and another woman filed a civil rights lawsuit against Fields in 2022, at which point Stines fired him. Fields pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in the county jail, the Mountain Eagle reported. Stines was also named in the lawsuit for not properly training or supervising Fields. Stines was deposed in the ongoing lawsuit days before Mullins’ killing and said he was not aware of any wrongdoing at the time. Adkins told police she saw one of the videos, which she claims shows the deputy sheriff and 'some higher ups' having sex in Mullins' chambers in exchange for granting the inmates bail to get out of jail. JonBenét Ramsey Netflix director urges Boulder PD to DNA test The investigator in the audio asks Adkins to clarify who she saw in the video. 'I seen Judge Mullins having sex with a girl,' she said. 'Where was it at?' the investigator asked. 'In his office, in the judge’s chambers,' she responded. UnitedHealthcare CEO killing: Photos of person of interest released She knew it was the judge’s chamber because she had been there before. According to the lawsuit she filed, Fields told her they could 'work something out' when she informed him she couldn’t afford to pay for her ankle monitor for her house arrest in 2021. Stines was arrested at the courthouse where Mullins was killed and charged with first-degree murder. He was arraigned Nov. 25 on new charges of murder of a public official, which he pleaded not guilty to through his lawyer. Mullins served as a judge for 15 years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/witness-kentucky-judge-mullins-traded-favors-for-sex/	2024-12-06T06:05:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/judge.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Someone who the New York Police Department says is wanted for questioning in the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson took a bus from Georgia and used a fake ID to book his transportation and lodging at a hostel in New York City. At this point, the gunman who shot and killed Thompson just before 7 a.m. in front of a Hilton hotel in Midtown Wednesday is still on the loose. Police released a picture of a person who they say is a person of interest in the killing Thursday. Sources tell NewsNation they believe the pictures show the shooter. Investigators visited the hostel they believe the person of interest was staying in on Thursday, searching for new evidence and speaking to possible eyewitnesses. One female worker — who reportedly was flirting with him — asked him to lower his mask. Missouri lawmaker proposes bounty system to report migrants Police haven't hosted a press conference with new information since Wednesday, but one former lieutenant commander with the NYPD told NewsNation anchor Elizabeth Vargas that doesn't mean law enforcement hasn't made progress in identifying or tracking down the killer. 'I think there's a lot more that they have right now,' Retired Lt. Commander Joe Cardinale said on 'Vargas Reports.' 'I think right now they have the photos out that will help identify him but they will have other evidence that they will hold close to the vest right now until they start furthering the case down the line.' Sources say a cell phone recovered near the scene of the crime is a burner device. Also left at the scene were shell casings with the words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' on them. Some have speculated that the words are connected to a book published in 2010 about health insurance claims, and how companies reject request for medical companies. The author of the book, called 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' declined to comment to NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killing-person-of-interest-fake-id-hostel/	2024-12-06T04:55:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GeC-s1nWcAA_Hyn.jpg?w=680
Missing Hawaii woman may have been victim of green card marriage ...	(NewsNation) — A new twist in the voluntary missing person mystery involving Hannah Kobayashi reveals the 31-year-old Maui woman may have been caught up in a green card fake marriage scam, which the FBI is investigating. Kobayashi has been the center of a massive search since she vanished in Los Angeles last month after missing a connecting flight from LAX to New York on Nov. 8. Police later ruled this a voluntary missing person case after reviewing video footage of the woman crossing the border into Mexico on foot. Recently, photos of what appears to be Kobayashi getting married have circulated on social media. Hannah Kobayashi’s sister: ‘Let us know you are safe’ 'A Facebook user sent what looked like a Hawaiian beach wedding photo of Hannah with another man with leis around their necks wearing white, and they said that they learned off of Reddit that there was this sham marriage for money and that this is the wedding picture that's being circulated on Reddit,' said Sara Azari, the Kobayashi family attorney, to NewsNation. 'Of course, that came as a shock to Hannah's sister.' Los Angeles Magazine, citing unnamed sources, said Kobayashi may have been involved in a secret marriage plot for money. The magazine characterized the marriage as an immigration scheme where Hannah was tricked out of the money that she was supposed to receive. The Argentinian man believed to be involved was on the flight from Maui to LAX on Nov. 8, and so was Kobayashi’s ex-boyfriend. Her family has been pushing back on police's claims that she voluntarily left, saying they found out about that video hours before the public did. 'They’re desperate for answers. They want to know that Hannah is safe. This is not like her to do this, so they're just overwhelmed and in shock and concerned,' Azari said. 'We now have to be the LAPD here, which is why I came in with my team. We are going to have to go to Mexico.' Hannah Kobayashi: Timeline of missing Maui woman’s case Kobayashi was headed from Hawaii to New York but missed her connecting flight in Los Angeles. She spent a few days in LA, and her family said they received bizarre texts from her on Nov. 11. Texts said things like, 'I got hacked, stripped of my identity, I can't fly.' The family says Hannah's phone has been off since then, which was also the day her family reported her missing. One day later, on Nov. 12, Hannah was seen on video crossing into Mexico around noon by herself and with luggage. The family flew to California to search for her. Hannah's father, Ryan Kobayashi, died by suicide on Nov. 24 after days of searching for his daughter. The family is asking the public in the U.S. and Mexico to be on the lookout for Hannah and not to dismiss the case just because police say she left voluntarily.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/hannah-kobayashi-missing-hawaii-woman-marriage-scam/	2024-12-06T04:40:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Kobayashi3.jpg?w=526
California school shooter had extensive criminal history, was pos...	Law enforcement officials identified on Thursday the alleged gunman who injured two children at a faith-based school in Butte County, California, before fatally shooting himself on Wednesday. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea identified the alleged shooter as Glenn Litton, 56, who reportedly had a lengthy criminal history dating back to his teens and who may have lacked a permanent residence. Litton allegedly used an alias to enter Feather River Adventist School near Oroville on Wednesday shortly after noon to talk with the principal about enrolling his grandson. The private school is run by the Northern California Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists. Honea said school staff described the meeting on Wednesday as 'cordial,' and that it did not raise any concerns. Triple child abduction at Virginia bus stop prompts Amber Alert Honea said investigators had determined that while Litton has a daughter, he does not have a grandson and that that information may have just been a ruse to gain access to the campus. According to Honea, investigators found 'writings' from Litton that read: 'Countermeasures involving child executions has now been imposed at the Seventh Day Adventist School in California, United States by the International Alliance. I, Lieutenant Glenn Litton of the Alliance carried out countermeasure in necessitated response to Americas involvement with Genocide and Oppression of Palestinians along with attacks towards Yemen.' Honea said deputies and federal investigators have not determined if that group exists but asked the public to share any information about it if they have it. 'How it was that he conflated what’s going on in Palestine and Yemen with the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, I can’t speculate. I’m not sure that we’ll ever know that,' Honea said. Butte County District Attorney Michael Ramsey said a federal probation office noted in 2015 that Litton was mentally ill and that he possibly had been since he was a teen, although officials had not confirmed any diagnosis. Honea also said that Litton did not appear to have any current connection to the school, although as a boy, Litton did attend a school run by the same church in nearby Paradise. Missing West Virginia woman’s body found in shallow grave Over several decades, Litton was involved in 'criminal matters' throughout California, including spending time in prison for theft and being convicted of forgery, identity theft and theft in Butte County in 2003. He served several years in prison before being released in 2006, Honea said. FBI Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said Litton also pleaded guilty in August 2015 to aggravated identity theft in California, and he pleaded the same to similar charges in Nevada the following year, ultimately serving two years in prison for those sentences. Police are still trying to gather more information on Litton, asking the public to call 530-538-7322 or 1-800-CALLFBI. Tips can also be sent to the FBI at tips.fbi.gov. In November, Litton was allegedly arrested in South San Francisco on theft charges and sent to San Bernardino County, where he had a warrant for burglary. He was later released on his own recognizance and made his way back to Chico. Recently, he was staying in hotels in the Chico area, Honea said, adding that Litton was 'best described as being homeless,' and that he was spending time between Sacramento and Chico. As a convicted felon, Litton was not legally allowed to own firearms. After Wednesday's shooting, responding officers found a handgun near his body. According to Honea, it was a ghost gun, and Litton had arranged a similar appointment to supposedly enroll a family member at another school in Red Bluff run by the same church.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/california-school-shooter-had-extensive-criminal-history-was-possibly-homeless-officials-say/	2024-12-05T22:21:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Glenn-Litton-Butte-County-Sheriff.jpg?w=900
Initial damage from Northern California earthquake appears minima...	(NewsNation) — An earthquake felt across Northern California Thursday morning initially appeared to cause minor damage across the affected areas. The quake struck late morning with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). However, the USGS later revised that magnitude to 7.0 and then to 7.3. At least 5.3 million people in California were under a tsunami warning after the earthquake, the USGS said in a yellow alert, which predicted localized but minimal damage. The quake struck in the Pacific Ocean about 5 1/2 miles west of Ferndale, a small city in coastal Humboldt County, and was followed by smaller aftershocks that were felt as far south as San Francisco, where residents felt a rolling motion for several seconds. 7.0 earthquake off Northern California prompts brief tsunami warning Minor damage has been reported as of Thursday afternoon. Local news outlets and reporters posted videos on social media showing products knocked off shelves and scattered on the floors of grocery stores. The door of a local Ferndale hotel appeared to have torn off, and several bottles were shattered over the hotel’s bar floor. The hotel owners did not immediately return a phone call from NewsNation. More than 1.3 million people lived close enough to the quake that they could have felt it, the USGS estimated. The agency is forecasting aftershocks registering 3.0 or greater could occur throughout the upcoming week. California Gov. Gavin Newsom activated the State Operations Center shortly after the hit to coordinate information and response efforts with state and local first responders. The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, known as BART, had stopped traffic in all directions through the underwater tunnel between San Francisco and Oakland. The San Francisco Zoo announced it was closing due to a national weather emergency and tsunami warning. Guests were evacuated and animals secured as staff moved to higher ground. The earthquake was the largest to hit Northern California since the 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquake, and it also had an epicenter in Humboldt County.

(NewsNation) — The person who killed the head of one of America's biggest insurance companies left behind shell casings and a discarded cell phone at the scene that are now being tested, the New York Police Department said. The words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings, police sources said. Police are calling United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson's death outside a Hilton in Midtown while walking to the company's annual investor conference 'brazen' and 'targeted.' According to law enforcement, the killer shot Thompson in the back and leg before fleeing on a bike and disappearing into Central Park. At one point, the shooter's gun jammed, but they were able to clear it and fire again before taking off. This was a premeditated attack, police said. NBC News reports Thompson's wife said he was threatened in the past, alluding to possible issues with health insurance coverage. Surveillance photos released by police show the suspect at a Starbucks just minutes before the shooting. He may have left a water bottle and candy bar wrapper there, police said. Forensic tests are being run on both. Former ballerina, Ashley Benefield, sentenced to decades in prison Who was Brian Thompson? Thompson, 50, was named CEO of UnitedHealthcare in 2021 and oversaw its insurance division. In 2023, he helped the company bring in $281 billion in revenue. Between his base pay, bonuses and stock option, Thompson is said to have made over $10 million last year. Family members said in a statement that Thompson was a loving father to two boys and a talented man who lived life to the fullest. Earlier this year, Thompson was sued by the Hollywood Firefighters' Pension Fund for insider trading and fraud. Executives at United Healthcare were being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegedly running a monopoly and unfairly blocking out competitors.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/deny-depose-defend-united-healthcare-ceo-killers-shell-casings/	2024-12-05T06:21:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24339564731972.jpg?w=900
Daniel Penny trial trending toward possibility of hung jury	(NewsNation) — The jury in the high-profile trial of Daniel Penny continues to weigh the ex-Marine’s justification for placing Jordan Neely in a chokehold for several minutes on a New York City subway, but may wind up deadlocked. The jury has sent five different notes to the judge requesting key pieces of evidence since it began deliberations on Tuesday. The central issue facing the seven women and five men is whether Penny was justified in placing Neely in the chokehold after witnesses said Neely was threatening passengers on the train. Penny has pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Who is the suspect in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting? Among the evidence the jury has requested are transcripts from testimony from some of the 40 witnesses who testified during the seven-week trial and cell phone video of Penny placing Neely in the chokehold for nearly six minutes. On Wednesday night, the jury requested a specific part of the testimony of the medical examiner in which she discussed issuing a death certificate without toxicology results. The jury has also requested video of New York City police body cam footage along with video of Penny’s interviews with New York City police investigators. Part of the testimony the jury re-heard Wednesday came from New York City medical examiner Dr. Cynthia Harris, who testified said the autopsy report and video shot by bystanders and investigative reports provided her all the information she needed to reach the conclusion she did in determining the cause of Neely’s death. 'No toxicological result imaginable was going to change my opinion,' Harris said, even if they showed 'enough fentanyl to put down an elephant.' Toxicology results later showed the presence of the drug K2 – a synthetic marijuana - in Neely’s system. A pathologist who testified for the defense said that Neely died from a combination of factors rather than from the chokehold as the prosecution maintains.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/daniel-penny-trial-possibly-hung-jury/	2024-12-05T06:07:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6733e689e52421.05794187.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will meet with House Republicans Thursday as they look to cut trillions of dollars from the government budget under President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural Department of Government Efficiency. Trump appointed the two tech entrepreneurs to head the effort and rein in government spending. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., invited Musk and Ramaswamy to Capitol Hill to go over their plan. 'We're excited. I invited Elon and Vivek to come to the Hill because the three of us were talking a lot about ideas, but I wanted to involve more of the members,' Johnson said, 'and I think most will be there because there's a lot of interest in this, and we'll have a brainstorming session and kind of set the table for what's to come.' Musk and Ramaswamy have not publicly given specifics on what their plan is to slash thousands of regulations and make massive cuts to the federal workforce. However, they have said that fewer regulations mean fewer employees are required to enforce them. Bitcoin tops $100,000 on optimism over Trump crypto plans The two also proposed requiring federal employees to go into the office five days a week, which they said they believe may bring a wave of voluntary resignations. At Thursday’s meeting, Musk and Ramaswamy may bring up annual federal expenditures they say are either unauthorized by Congress or used in ways Congress never intended. Such examples include $535 million a year for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, $1.5 billion in grants for international organizations and around $300 million for progressive groups like Planned Parenthood – drops in the bucket compared to their stated goal of cutting $2 trillion from the budget. The DOGE team has gotten support from some Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who posted his support to X. The department does not have authority to cut budgets itself; it will advise the Office of Management and Budgets. Ross Vought is Trump's nominee to head that agency.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-musk-ramaswamy-meet-house-republicans/	2024-12-05T06:05:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/doge_lee-shapero_split_AP.jpg?w=900
Supreme Court leans toward upholding Tennessee's restrictions on ...	The Supreme Court’s conservatives appeared to lean toward upholding Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors in a blockbuster showdown over transgender rights Wednesday. Over 2 1/2 hours of arguments, several conservative justices questioned the Biden administration’s assertion of 'overwhelming' evidence that the benefits of giving some adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria puberty blockers and hormone treatments outweigh the risks. 'I wonder if you would like to stand by this statement, or if you think it would now be appropriate to modify that and withdraw the statement,' said Justice Samuel Alito, repeatedly referencing several European countries that have recently moved to restrict some gender-affirming care 'If it’s evolving like that and changing, and England is pulling back and Sweden is pulling back, it strikes me as a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this court to come in, the nine of us, and constitutionalize the whole area,' Justice Brett Kavanaugh similarly noted. Opponents of U.S. laws banning gender-affirming care for trans youth have said prohibitions imposed by Republican-led states go much further than European policies, which limit but do not categorically ban care. 'This is no ordinary medical regulation,' Pratik Shah, head of Supreme Court and appellate practice at Akin Gump, said of Tennessee's law. Tennessee’s law, S.B. 1, prohibits medical providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone treatments for the purpose of enabling a transgender minor to live consistent with their gender identity. The law also bans gender-affirming surgeries, though that provision is not at issue before the high court. Providers who violate the law can face $25,000 civil fines. The administration’s challenge of Tennessee’s restrictions stands to impact similar laws passed in roughly half the country, setting up a high-stakes battle that has attracted national attention and demonstrations outside the courthouse Wednesday. The dispute comes as Republicans increasingly lean into anti-transgender messaging, with millions spent on related campaign ads this cycle and a blitz of recent legislation restricting the bathrooms transgender Americans use, sports teams they join and medical care they receive. At the heart of the current battle is what level of scrutiny the law should receive. The Biden administration asserts Tennessee’s ban should be treated as a form of sex discrimination. For decades, the court has subjected such cases to 'intermediate scrutiny,' which requires the government to show the law is substantially related to an important interest. 'S.B. 1 regulates by drawing sex-based lines and declares that those lines are designed to encourage minors to appreciate their sex,' U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said. Tennessee said its law classifies by medical purpose, not sex, so it only needs to clear a lower level of scrutiny, known as 'rational-basis review.' 'Just as using morphine to manage pain differs from using it to assist suicide, using hormones and puberty blockers to address a physical condition is far different from using it to address psychological distress associated with one’s body,' Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice began his argument. 'Why isn’t this simply a case of age classification?' conservative Justice Clarence Thomas pressed the government, sympathizing with Tennessee’s position. LGBTQ advocates are holding out hope for a repeat surprise victory at the conservative-majority Supreme Court after Justice Neil Gorsuch, President-elect Trump’s first appointee, wrote the court’s majority opinion in 2020 ruling that an employer firing someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Biden administration insists the same reasoning applies to the Equal Protection Clause and Tennessee’s gender-affirming care ban should be invalidated. But during Wednesday’s arguments, Gorsuch didn’t ask a single question. He spent most of the time reading documents or holding a pen to his chin as he listened to the attorneys. The court’s liberals, meanwhile, sympathized with the Biden administration’s citation of major medical organizations that consider gender-affirming care safe and medically necessary. 'The evidence is very clear that there are some children who actually need this treatment, isn’t there,' Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. The Justice Department is challenging the law, alongside three transgender adolescents in the state, their parents and a Tennessee doctor who treats gender dysphoria. The case’s high stakes have attracted significant attention, with dozens of outside groups filing briefs backing each side. The Justice Department’s challenge drew support from Democratic attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C.; various LGBTQ advocacy groups; 164 Democratic lawmakers; Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.), who is set to become the first openly transgender member of Congress; actor Elliot Page; and the American Bar Association. Tennessee officials are backed by 25 Republican state attorneys general; various conservative legal groups; the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and dozens of athletes who oppose against transgender women competing in women's competition, including former swimmer Riley Gaines and former tennis star Martina Navratilova. Competing rallies — one organized by conservative organizations including the Alliance Defending Freedom and Do No Harm, and one held by the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal — drew upward of 1,000 people outside the court Wednesday. 'There’s a really strong precedent that the state has an important role to protect children from harm, and I think that's exactly what Tennessee's law does,' said Hannah Daniel, director of public policy at the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. 'I’m hopeful that the justices will see that as well.' 'I'm all for supporting kids, providing them with the therapy and the treatment they need, but not this kind of irreversible drug,' said Laura Hanford, a consultant and visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. Hanford, of Fairfax, Va., said she has been advocating against gender identity protections since 2015, when her local school board approved adding information about transgender people to its sex education curriculum. 'The encouraging thing now is a lot more people are aware of the issue,' Hanford said, gesturing to the growing throng of people gathered outside the court. Transgender rights advocates waved Pride flags and held signs encouraging lawmakers and the justices inside the court to protect access to gender-affirming care, which major medical associations say can be lifesaving. One attendee from Alliance, Ohio, carried an 18-foot flagpole with him as he wove through the crowd. A progress Pride flag, a redesign of the classic rainbow flag representing the movement, and an American flag billowed over onlookers’ heads. 'This belongs to every American of every imaginable identity,' he said of the U.S. flag, 'and it's time we took it back and use it to represent freedom and equality for everybody.' Daniel Trujillo, a transgender teenager from Arizona, came to the Supreme Court with his mother, Lizette, to rally in support of gender-affirming care for trans youth. When the Supreme Court hands down its ruling this summer, Daniel Trujillo will have already turned 18, meaning his access to care, for now, will not be impacted. 'I know what it's like and how important it's been for me to receive gender-affirming care, and I know how positively it has impacted my life. I know that without it, life would have been a lot harder. I really don't want that for my friends and my family. I care about my people.' Actor Annette Bening, who also attended the rally organized by the ACLU, called transgender rights 'the civil rights issue of our time.' 'Our trans kid and all trans folks need to be seen and heard,' said Bening, whose son, Stephen, came out as transgender as a teenager. Following Wednesday’s arguments, ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, just after becoming the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court, encouraged transgender youths and their families to hold out hope that the justices will rule on their side, but said the community and its allies will continue to defend trans rights even if the court decides to uphold Tennessee’s law. 'Our fight for justice did not begin today,' he said. 'It will not end in June, whenever the court decides.' 'I know the months ahead and the years ahead are terrifying. I know that we have been the subject of relentless and unjustified attacks,' Strangio said, referring to promises by the incoming Trump administration that threaten to roll back transgender rights. 'We are in it together. I love being trans, I love being with you and we are going to take care of each other.' A decision in the case, United States v. Skrmetti, is expected by summer.

Two boys, ages 5 and 6, shot at Northern California religious sch...	Two boys, ages 5 and 6, were hospitalized after they were shot at a religious school and the suspected gunman is dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot in the Northern California community of Palermo on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Butte County Sheriff's Office. The agency said that at about 1 p.m. it received calls from Feather River Adventist School, a campus run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, located about ten miles south of Oroville and about 60 miles north of Sacramento. The school's website says it serves children K-8, has been at its current location since 1965, and an update from 2022 says it had nearly 35 students.

(Michael Weber/The Chico Enterprise-Record via AP)Police tape blocks a road outside the Feather River Adventist School after a shooting Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024, near Oroville, Calif. (Michael Weber/The Chico Enterprise-Record via AP) Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said that the preliminary investigation indicates that the suspect, an adult man, came onto the campus to meet with the principal to discuss the possibility of enrolling a student. Shortly after that, the principal heard shots being fired and school officials determined that the boys were shot, Honea said. Sheriff Honea said that the boys were taken to a hospital, one by helicopter. The suspected gunman is believed to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot, and the suspected weapon was a handgun, Honea said. The remaining students were sequestered in the gym and eventually taken to the Oroville Church of the Nazarene in Oroville to be reunited with their parents. 'This is horribly tragic. It is hard to come up with the words. We’re operating on adrenaline, doing the things that need to be done…we worked hard to make sure that students are reunified with their parents,' Honea said to media gathered near the school. Honea said that there was no indication that the suspect had any contact with the school until Wednesday and that there did not appear to be a relation between the suspect and the children shot or the school. Honea also said that officials did not believe that a child was present during the meeting with the administrator. The suspect is believed to have been dropped off by a gray 4-door sedan that may have been a rideshare vehicle and that left immediately after, Honea said, adding that anyone with information about the suspect or the vehicle call 530-538-7322. 'We’re no stranger to those kinds of things, but when you’re talking about little kids like this, who can’t defend themselves, it really does tear at the heart,' Honea said.

What does the US import from Mexico, China and Canada?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is picking a fight with America's top trading partners, and that could come at a steep cost to U.S. consumers. Trump is threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. He's also vowed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. How will Trump's tariffs impact everyday Americans? Tariffs — which are taxes on goods imported from other countries — are paid by American companies but ultimately get passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices, economists warn. In 2023, the U.S. imported over $3.1 trillion worth of goods — making it the world's largest importer of goods. Three countries — Mexico, China and Canada — accounted for over 40% of the total value of all goods the U.S. imported. If Trump follows through on his plans, it could drive up prices on a range of goods, including cars from Mexico, smartphones from China and oil from Canada. Here's what the U.S. imports from its top three trading partners. The following trade data is from the U.S. Census Bureau unless otherwise noted. Small business owners brace for Trump’s proposed tariffs What does the US import from Mexico? Major imports from Mexico: Passenger vehicles, car parts, trucks, computers, fruits and vegetables For the first time in more than two decades, Mexico surpassed China in 2023 as the leading source of goods imported to the United States. Part of that is due to Mexico's growing auto industry, which means tariffs could drive up prices for American car buyers. General Motors makes Chevrolet Silverado pickups in Mexico. It's also where Stellantis makes Dodge Rams. A 25% tariff would increase the cost of vehicles and car parts, which accounted for $130 billion worth of U.S. imports from Mexico last year. According to Mexico's finance minister, Trump's tariffs would raise the price of pickup trucks by $3,000. The average price for a new full-size pickup is already north of $65,000. Mexico is the world’s seventh-largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, producing 3.5 million vehicles annually, according to the International Trade Administration. Of those, 88% are exported, and 76% are destined for the United States. Even American-made cars could become more expensive. That's because Mexico represents 43% of all U.S. auto part imports, larger than any other country, Reuters reported. Consumers could also see higher prices at the grocery store, especially in the produce section. In 2023, Mexico supplied 63% of U.S. vegetable imports and 47% of fruit and nut imports, according to the USDA. Mexico also supplies the vast majority of beer imported to the U.S., about 80%. Mexico: Trump tariffs will make pickups $3,000 more expensive What does the US import from China? Major imports from China: Smartphones, laptops, toys and games, lithium-ion batteries Americans could see higher prices for consumer electronics if Trump imposes additional tariffs on China. Last year, the U.S. imported nearly $45 billion worth of smartphones from China, over 75% of total U.S. smartphone imports. The vast majority of video game consoles imported into the U.S. also came from China. While it's true the U.S. has generally become less dependent on China in recent years, that's not the case when it comes to consumer electronics and lithium-ion batteries. In fact, China’s share in US battery imports has actually increased since 2017, the Atlantic Council noted in a recent report. If Trump goes a step further — following through on the tariffs he proposed on the campaign trail — consumers could see laptop and tablet prices rise 46% and smartphone prices jump 26%, according to a recent Consumer Technology Association report. Toys could also get more expensive. The U.S. imported over $42 billion worth of toys, games and sporting goods in 2023, 75% of which came from China. What does the US import from Canada? Major imports from Canada: Crude oil, vehicles, machinery, plastics Canada is the largest source of U.S. energy imports, and a 25% tariff would drive up prices at the gas pump. Last year, 60% of U.S. crude oil imports came from Canada, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In major U.S. markets where refiners process Canadian oil — like the Midwest, Great Lakes and Rockies — gas prices could rise as much as 75 cents per gallon, according to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. 'You can't simply process different oil overnight. It would take investments/years,' De Haan wrote on X. 'More US supply wouldn't help.' Canada is also the fifth largest producer of natural gas, exporting about half of its supply to the U.S. last year. American homebuilders also rely on Canadian lumber, meaning the cost of building a house could rise. 'There is no getting around the fact that the U.S. must rely on Canada to fully meet its lumber needs,' Chuck Fowke, then-chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, wrote in a 2022 Seattle Times op-ed. Fowke pointed out that roughly 30% of the lumber consumed in the U.S. was imported, and more than 85% of the imports came from Canada.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/us-import-mexico-china-canada/	2024-12-04T15:02:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1244944189-1.jpg?w=900
Who is the suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting?	(NewsNation) — Authorities are searching for the gunman who fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Wednesday, and little is still known about him or why he attacked the executive. Thompson, 50, was shot just before 7 a.m. near a hotel on 54th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, sources told NewsNation. The gunman had been anticipating Thompson to arrive at the hotel for an investors meeting, police said. This was a 'premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,' NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a news conference. The suspect was 'lying in wait for several minutes.' This undated photo provided by UnitedHealth Group shows UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson. (AP Photo/UnitedHealth Group via AP) UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting: Who was Brian Thompson? New York City Mayor Eric Adams has vowed to catch the gunman. 'This was not what appears to be a just random act of violence. It seems to be clearly targeted by an individual, and we will apprehend that individual,' he said. What do we know about the suspect? The shooter appears to be a 'light-skinned male. He’s wearing a light brown or cream-colored jacket, a black face mask, black and white sneakers, and a very distinctive gray backpack,' NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. Many people passed the person by, but he 'appeared to wait for his intended target,' according to Tisch. NYPD release photos of alleged suspect. As Thompson arrived at the Hilton, the shooter stepped out from behind a car and fired multiple rounds, striking Thompson in the leg and back. Kenny said it appeared that the 'gun malfunctions as he clears the jam and begins to fire again.' The suspect then ran through an alley, hopped on an electric Citi Bike and rode through Central Park on Center Drive. UnitedHealthcare CEO is killed in a ‘targeted shooting’ outside a New York hotel, officials say 'I hear a shot,' a witness told Nexstar local affiliate WPIX. 'When I look around, I saw a guy with a gun. He shot three times, then he starts running.' Investigators recovered several 9 mm shell casings from outside the hotel and a cell phone from the alleyway through which the suspect fled. They were also searching Thompson's hotel room and interviewing his UnitedHealthcare colleagues, Kenny said. While the shooting was targeted, police say they still don’t know a motive for the attack. A photo of the suspect was released by the NYPD. What is happening with the manhunt? A search for the suspect is ongoing as of 3 p.m. ET. Authorities have deployed police drones, helicopters and dogs in an effort to find the shooter and have a 'massive presence' in Manhattan following the shooting, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said. 'We have the drones up. We have aviation out. We have canine out,' he said. 'An incident like this happens — we don’t spare any expense.' The electric bike the shooter took off in has a GPS system, which authorities are tracking, they said. 'The last we see with him on that bike is in Central Park,' Kenny said. 'There are GPS on those bikes. We’ll be working with the company.' The NYPD is offering up to $10,000 for information that leads to an arrest in the case.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/suspect-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting/	2024-12-04T13:04:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/MTN-Homicide_photo3.jpg?w=900
Illegal immigration cost US taxpayers $150.7B: DOGE	(NewsNation) — American taxpayers shelled out more than $150 billion on immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2023 alone, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) estimates. DOGE, which is expected to become a federal agency in Donald Trump's upcoming administration, said in a social media posting the spending compares to projects such as building the Hoover Dam, funding World War I and constructing the atomic bomb and accounted for 2% of the overall U.S. budget. Newsweek reported that if accurate, the $150.7 billion spent on illegal immigration would rival the $151 billion that the government spent in 2023 to provide income security programs to military veterans and their families in 2023. Unaccompanied minors apprehended at border surges under Biden Meanwhile, sanctuary cities like New York, Chicago, and Denver have also paid millions and sometimes even billions on new arrivals since 2022. Data shows that New York City, which has provided shelter, food, and other services for 223,000 migrants since 2022, has paid $ 5.22 billion for the care of new arrivals. Chicago, which has reported 51,643 new arrivals that have been bused there from the southern border by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, has spent $574.5 million. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said that the city would not 'cower in fear' to Washington and has remained committed to protecting migrants. However, Johnson recently announced that the city will be ending its New Arrivals Mission at the end of the year. The city will begin a One System Initiative in January, in which Chicago’s existing shelter system for those experiencing homelessness will be combined with shelters that have been designated for new arrivals. The city is facing a budget shortfall of $1 billion, according to city data. Residents have criticized the first-term mayor, including some who expressed anger with Johnson at a recent City Council meeting. One woman said the city could begin addressing its financial woes by stopping providing 'illegals with everything.' Denver officials report that the Mile High City, which has cared for 42,911 new arrivals since 2022, has paid out $356 million to provide services for immigrants bused there from Texas. Trump ‘border czar’ offers NYC mayor a call to expedite deportations Yet as President-elect Donald Trump and his border czar Tom Homan call for mass deportations and have threatened to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal enforcement efforts, mayors in those cities are refusing to back down. New York Mayor Eric Adams said this week that he is open to deporting immigrants with criminal backgrounds, which Homan has said will be the primary focus of mass deportation efforts. The city’s comptroller said that New York spent $1.47 billion on asylum-seeker shelter and services in the fiscal year that ended in June 2023. Of those funds, only $438 million were reimbursed by the state. The New York Post reported that in fiscal year 2024, New York committed $3.07 billion to immigrant care and that the state would be reimbursing $1.3 billion. Despite the spending, however, Adams said that he won’t allow Homan to come in and do what he pleases. Adams said he is open to sitting down with Homan in the coming weeks to discuss the administration’s plans for dealing with immigrants who 'are harming our citizens.' But unlike other progressives who are afraid to speak out against illegal immigration out of fear of so-called 'cancel culture,' Adams distanced himself from that group. 'Well, cancel me because I’m going to protect the people of the city,' Adams told reporters this week. 'And if you come into this country, in this city, and think you’re going to harm innocent New Yorkers and innocent migrants and asylum-seekers, this is not the mayor you want to be in the city under.

AI will be in the workplace in 2025. What jobs could be most affe...	(NewsNation) — The U.S. is leading the world in artificial intelligence innovation and that could have serious implications for American workers. Cognitive tasks once limited to humans — reading, writing, synthesizing information — can now be done more efficiently with generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini; companies have taken notice. App uses AI to predict when you’ll die Microsoft dubbed 2024 'the year AI at work gets real' and said the tech is already being 'woven into the workplace at an unexpected scale.' Over the past year, nearly 60% of companies have implemented software, equipment, or technology to automate tasks previously completed by employees, according to a survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond. Goldman Sachs estimates that 'roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation.' The technological changes have been so swift that now some wonder if 'learn to code' is bad advice. The 10 fastest-growing jobs over the next decade AI optimists argue it will make workers more productive and allow them to spend extra time on meaningful tasks. Others warn AI could cause some jobs to disappear completely. The truth may be somewhere in between. 'You may not be replaced by AI but you could be replaced by somebody who knows how to use AI,' said Allison Shrivastava, an associate economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab. Here's what to know about the future of AI and which skills to prioritize going forward. Which jobs are 'at risk' to AI automation and why? For decades automation was mainly a blue-collar concern but generative AI is expected to have a greater impact on white-collar jobs, particularly administrative roles. That's because AI can process large amounts of data accurately and efficiently. It's a shift that's likely to change jobs centered around data entry and email sorting. 'Most of the industries that face the greatest exposure to generative AI today are those that just a few years ago were ranked at the bottom of automation risk,' the Brookings Institution noted in a recent report. Brookings said more than 30% of all workers could see at least 50% of their occupation’s tasks disrupted by generative AI. Tasks in office and administrative support roles — bookkeepers, customer service representatives, office clerks — are especially likely to be automated. Other professions like insurance underwriters, tax preparers and legal secretaries also face high automation risk, according to the report. Keep in mind: jobs that are 'at risk' for automation aren't necessarily going to disappear completely. In many cases, disruption doesn't mean destruction — roles will still exist except certain tasks will be done by AI. The 10 jobs expected to decline over the next decade With that said, several jobs are projected to decline over the next decade. Typists, data entry keyers and telemarketers are among the fastest-shrinking occupations, according to the latest Labor Department estimates. Cashiers are also expected to be much less common by 2033, with employment projected to drop by 353,000 — the biggest total decline across all job categories, according to the Labor Department. Employment of customer service representatives and office clerks is forecasted to drop by 150,000 jobs each over the next decade. Meanwhile, jobs that require a significant social or emotional component are less likely to be replaced by AI. The healthcare and social assistance sector is set to boom, with nurse practitioners and physician assistants expected to be two of the fastest-growing jobs through 2033. Other hands-on roles like barbers, firefighters and child care workers also have low AI exposure, a Pew Research report found. Will AI replace jobs or make them better? It's too early to know the full extent of AI's impact on jobs but many workers — and experts — are hopeful. The optimistic view is that AI will automate the tasks nobody wants to do, freeing up employees to do work they enjoy. Teachers could spend less time writing lesson plans and more time working with students. Nurses may be able to get through paperwork faster and provide more care to patients. As Ryan Rolanski, the CEO of LinkedIn, wrote in Wired earlier this year: '(AI) doesn’t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable — and more human — parts of their jobs.' The AI revolution will also create entirely new jobs. There will be AI trainers who help develop the tools, along with AI prompt gurus who specialize in producing new types of content. Others, like Michael Strain at the American Enterprise Institute, point out that AI will help many workers become more productive, making them more valuable to businesses. In turn, wages could rise. There's also a potential labor shortage to consider. The American workforce is getting older and fewer people are having children. Adults ages 65 and older are projected to be 8.6% of the labor force in 2032, up from 5.2% in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. AI could help fill the productivity gap as more workers age out of the labor force. A recent global survey from Google and Ipsos found that most people (68%) who have used an AI application in the past year are excited about the possibilities. Of those, 63% of workers believed that in 25 years AI will have a positive impact on work-life balance. How can workers prepare for AI at work? Experts suggest workers should start learning how to use generative AI tools, many of which are free. Workers who can take advantage of AI at their jobs now will have a leg up in the future. Shrivastava recommends practicing writing ChatGPT prompts and understanding how the chatbot interprets those prompts. 'It's more difficult than you would initially think and that's definitely a huge skill to practice,' she said. For many employers, the AI future is already here. The share of job postings mentioning GenAI or related terms has skyrocketed over the past year, up 3.5 times in the U.S., according to research from the Indeed Hiring Lab. A recent Google Workspace study of 'young leaders,' ages 22 to 39, found 82% are already leveraging AI tools in their work. The report was based on a survey of over 1,000 U.S.-based knowledge workers who aspire to hold a leadership position. At the same time, it's also worth improving the so-called soft skills that generative AI can't replace. Interpersonal skills like emotional intelligence, teamwork and leadership are likely to become more important, not less. 'Those are really invaluable, and they're not going to be replaced anytime soon,' Shrivastava said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/ai/ai-2025-jobs-affected-most/	2024-12-04T11:39:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/666c50d2aab174.02755220.jpeg?w=900
Prison lockdowns are prolonging amid staff shortages	(NewsNation) — Prison staff shortages and inmate overcrowding have led to longer and more intense lockdowns confining prisoners to their cells for weeks and even months at a time. While lockdowns are common and used for security or safety concerns they typically last hours or days, but that is now commonly occurring year-round in some prisons, reports Stateline. A number of prisons across the county have increasingly implemented prolonged lockdowns, which have contributed to violence between prisoners and staff, increased drug use and deaths by suicide and harms rehabilitation efforts, the outlet reported. Justice Department announces sweeping reforms to curb suicides in federal prisons and jails During lockdowns prisoners are essentially isolated and cut off from access to work, classes, religious services and visits can be limited or completely banned. Meals are also provided in cells, the outlet reported. Lockdowns are occurring largely as a response to sustained staff shortages coupled with an increase in prison populations. 'What’s unusual here is that you’ve got these more sustained lockdowns,' Michele Deitch, the director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, told Stateline. 'People are not in that situation because of disciplinary reasons. They’re in there for the convenience and management of the institution.' State prison populations also grew by 2% between 2021 and 2022, according to the most recent data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. That upward trajectory could increase as several states, including Arizona, Oregon, Colorado and Georgia, have recently passed tough on crime laws. This is happening as prisons struggle with staff retention. In 2023, the number of people working in state prisons fell to its lowest level this century, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Judge finds New York City in contempt over jail conditions, moves closer to a federal takeover The Illinois Department of Corrections operation and management reports show a major uptick in the number of lockdowns across facilities, with 635 in the fiscal year 2019 and 1,814 in fiscal year 2024, the outlet reported. In Wisconsin, at least two prisons went into lockdown for more than a year, the outlet reported. In one of these facilities, the Waupun Correctional Institution, at least five incarcerated people have died since June 2023 and nine current and former staff members are facing felony charges in connection with two of the deaths, Stateline reported. 'You’re going to see a lot more tension rising among the population, which could lead to more assaults and other kinds of abuses. You’re more likely to see people using drugs or something to kind of escape from all of that,' Deitch told the outlet.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/prison-lockdowns-staff-shortages/	2024-12-04T10:10:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/jail-cell-bars-generic-big_35856378_ver1.0-1-1-1-1-2-1.jpg?w=900

Hannah Kobayashi’s sister: ‘Let us know you are safe’	(NewsNation) — The family of Hannah Kobayashi, the Maui woman who went off the grid after missing a connecting flight at LAX and has since been spotted crossing into Mexico on foot, is skeptical of the police’s official story. 'I said this from day one, I feel like she is in danger. I feel like this is completely out of character for her. I've known her my entire life,' sister Sydni Kobayashi said Tuesday. Loved ones flew to California to form a search party following concerning texts and then radio silence from Kobayashi. During the search, Hannah’s father, Ryan Kobayashi, was found dead in a parking lot near LAX on Nov. 24. 'If she had seen what happened with my father and his passing, she would have definitely reached out by now,' Sydni Kobayashi said. 'There's no way that she wouldn't have reached out, knowing the person that she is.' Hannah Kobayashi crossed into Mexico, no foul play suspected: Police Hannah Kobayashi's sister: Mexico trip 'bizarre' Authorities updated the public Monday evening with the latest details on Kobayashi’s disappearance. Hannah Kobayashi was seen on security footage crossing the U.S. border on foot into Mexico, alone, with luggage and seemingly unharmed, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The case is now classified as a voluntary missing person case. Sara Azari, a legal analyst for NewsNation who has been retained to represent the Kobayashi family, tells 'Banfield' that the case's new designation 'doesn't make it any lesser of a disappearance and a missing person case' to the family. Hannah Kobayashi: Timeline of Hawaiian woman’s disappearance Sydni Kobayashi told NewsNation she found her sister's crossing into Mexico 'bizarre' because it was her first trip to Los Angeles, and 'she's never mentioned going to Mexico,' adding: 'It just doesn't make sense to me.' 'It feels like someone else is involved or controlling her or doing something,' Sydni said. Kobayashi's family have unresolved questions Notably, Azari pointed out that Hannah Kobayashi had planned and flown on this trip with an ex-boyfriend. 'Did anybody talk to flight attendants to see if there was any interaction on this flight between her and the ex-boyfriend? I mean, we're just, there's a lot of questions and there's no answers,' Azari said. Sydni added that the handling of her 'baby sister's' case has concerned the family, as they were kept in the dark about her movement to Mexico until the Monday news conference. 'Had we have known that she had crossed the border on the 12th, that would have given us so much more of a different direction of where to look and what to do, as far as this is concerned,' Sydni Kobayashi said. She also added that LAPD hasn't shared that footage of the tunnel to Mexico with the family, so they can't even confirm whether it is their missing loved one. Close Thank you for signing up!

Donald Trump may replace Pete Hegseth with Ron DeSantis: WSJ	President-elect Trump is rumored to be considering replacing his Defense Secretary pick, former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Trump is mulling another Cabinet pick switch-up as Republican Senators have concerns about sexual assault allegations against Hegseth. If he were to choose DeSantis, it would be a shocking turn for the president-elect. Garland, DOJ leads ask staffers to stay through Trump term: Report The Florida Governor ran a GOP presidential primary bid against Trump, and the two traded insults during the campaign. Still, the Journal noted that DeSantis was a well-known conservative who served in the military. Hegseth is facing growing scrutiny from GOP senators after new revelations over the weekend included allegations of alcohol abuse and previous sexual misconduct. He plans to meet with the House Republican Study Committee on Wednesday. While House members don’t have a say in the confirmation process, it could be seen as a pressure tactic to back the former 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend' host. Hegseth held his third round of meetings with senators and brought his wife, former Fox News producer Jennifer Cunningham Rauchet. Biden’s pardon of son Hunter was ‘tragic’: Dean Phillips The Journal’s report comes just after Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said the team isn’t concerned with their choice of Hegseth amid the controversial reports. DeSantis, who attempted to make amends as Trump seized the GOP nomination, will be ineligible to run for governor again once his term ends in 2027. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who was initially tapped to be Trump’s attorney general but withdrew amid his own sexual misconduct allegations, has been floated to fill DeSantis’s seat when his term ends. The Hill has reached out to the Trump transition team for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/donald-trump-pete-hegseth-ron-desantis-wsj/	2024-12-03T20:29:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1836205157.jpg?w=900
John Ramsey: 'Good chance' DNA evidence solves JonBenét's killing	(NewsNation) — John Ramsey believes there’s a 'good chance' police can still solve the decades-old cold case of his 6-year-old daughter, JonBenét Ramsey. 'We want them (police) to do more,' Ramsey said during an appearance on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'If they use the latest DNA technology, collaborate with labs, and use familial genealogy research, which successfully finds solutions to old cold cases. If they do that, there's a good chance we can solve it.' Ramsey said he and his late wife, Patsy Ramsey, understood why authorities initially considered them suspects. 'We were in the home. We think it’s horrible, but we accept that,' Ramsey said. 'But don’t stop there. That was their conclusion.' He expressed frustration with the investigation, claiming authorities tried to build a case against him and Patsy. JonBenét Ramsey: Geraldo Rivera apologizes to her dad for mock trial Police in Boulder, Colorado, have said there are fresh leads in the case. The news comes following a recent Netflix documentary that shed light on one of the most shocking murder cases in modern history. John and Patsy Ramsey reported their daughter missing on Dec. 26, 1996, telling police they found a ransom note in the house. She was found dead several hours later in the basement of the family’s home, having been beaten and strangled. Hannah Kobayashi skipped her flight on purpose, police say At the time, the case gained attention in part because JonBenét competed in child beauty pageants. Videos and photos of the pageants included some that many people found to be suggestive in nature. Police and media focused on John and Patsy Ramsey as suspects initially, though other theories included an intruder who had entered the home, possibly while the family was out celebrating Christmas. No one has ever been charged in the case, though multiple suspects have been investigated over the years. Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn released a video in response to the docuseries and noted there are aspects of the case that can't be discussed publicly. 'What I can tell you, though, is that we have thoroughly investigated multiple people identified as suspects throughout the years, and we continue to be open-minded about what occurred as we investigate the tips that come into detectives,' he said. 'I can also tell you that detectives are regularly investigating some aspects of this terrible crime, and I receive updates frequently.' There was some progress made on the case in 2023, when the former police chief started a task force, bringing different agencies together to look at the case.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/vargasreports/john-ramsey-dna-evidence-jonbenet-killing/	2024-12-03T16:33:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AE241B4D2D7E6D9B4A4E007CDFBA8A56.jpg?w=896
Trump’s DEA nominee withdraws from consideration just days after ...	President-elect Trump’s choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced on Tuesday he is withdrawing from consideration just three days after Trump made his nomination known. Florida's Hillsborough County Sherriff Chad Chronister said in a post on X Tuesday evening that he would instead tend to his current duties overseeing an area of the Sunshine State that includes Tampa Bay. 'Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I’ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration,' Chronister said. 'There is more work to be done for the citizens of Hillsborough County and a lot of initiatives I am committed to fulfilling,' Chronister continued. 'I sincerely appreciate the nomination, outpouring of support by the American people, and look forward to continuing my service as Sheriff of Hillsborough County.' The Hill has reached out to Trump's spokesperson for a response to Chronister's announcement. Trump announced Chronister as his choice to lead the DEA in a Truth Social post on Saturday, tapping the local sheriff to take charge of the agency tasked with seizing illegal substances ranging from fentanyl to other opioids. 'I am pleased to nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister for Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA),' Trump wrote. 'For over 32 years, Sheriff Chad Chronister has served the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, and received countless commendations and awards for keeping his community SAFE,' Trump added. Chronister' background is mostly in law enforcement. He graduated from the FBI National Academy’s 260th Session, was co-chair of the Regional Domestic Security Task Force for Region IV Tampa Bay and had a tenure as a council member of the Florida Attorney General’s Statewide Council on Human Trafficking. His withdrawal marks the second Trump nominee to do so. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who had been tapped to be attorney general, withdrew his candidacy eight days after Trump shocked the political world with his pick to run the lead law enforcement agency. Gaetz was previously investigated by the Justice Department as part of a broader sex trafficking probe, including allegations involving an underage woman. The department ultimately decided not to pursue charges, and Gaetz has strongly denied any wrongdoing. The Florida Republican's quick withdrawal suggests he had realized he was unlikely to win the votes necessary to be confirmed in the Senate.

Missouri lawmaker proposes bounty system to report migrants	(NewsNation) — A bill introduced in the Missouri Senate would give residents a $1,000 payout for reporting migrants who entered the country illegally. The proposal is one of at least seven bills introduced in the state's legislature to focus on immigration, all sponsored by Republican legislators. Sen.-elect David Gregory proposed the legislation, which would create an online portal for people to make reports to the State Highway Patrol and be eligible for the payout. Cyber Monday 2024 Deals -- Top Cyber Week deals still live -- Top gifts under $100 -- Best stocking stuffers BestReviews is reader-supported and may earn an affiliate commission. Texas couple’s dream border orchard turns into a nightmare Senate Bill 72 would also develop a 'Missouri Illegal Alien Certified Bounty Hunter Program,' which would certify people to be bounty hunters for the specific purpose of finding and detaining immigrants without proper documents. Anyone licensed as a bail bond agent would be eligible to apply for the program. Anyone detained in Missouri without proper documents, having knowingly entered the state, would be guilty of 'trespass by an illegal alien.' That would mean they could not receive any public benefit, vote in any election, get a permit or license to drive or ever become a legal resident of the state. The plan comes as there are legal questions over what roles states play in addressing immigration, an area typically handled by the federal government. The Biden administration is currently challenging a Texas law that would allow the arrest and attempted removal of people who cross the southern border illegally. The Supreme Court also previously struck down an effort by Arizona to create state-level offenses for illegal immigration. President-elect Donald Trump ran with immigration as a major part of his platform and has promised a major crackdown as soon as he is in office, including plans for mass deportations. Trump has said he would use the military to help deport the nearly 11 million people believed to be in the U.S. illegally, though it isn't clear how such deportations would work logistically or legally. Migrant caravan with 1,500 people coming up from Mexico Opponents of the plan have argued that it would have a detrimental impact on the economy, particularly regarding agriculture. Republicans have pushed back, alleging that immigrants are committing crimes and distributing drugs in the U.S. Other Republican proposals in the state would create a new immigration offense with penalties including jail time and removal, requiring businesses to ensure all employees are documented and a proposal to fine cities $25,000 per day for sanctuary policies. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson also authorized $2.2 million to fund a deployment of Highway Patrol and National Guard soldiers to Texas to assist in the state's 'Operation Lonestar' efforts to secure the border earlier this year.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/missouri-lawmaker-bounty-migrants/	2024-12-03T14:12:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/e48afe4f53c848dbba762976005d1bc0-e1718208604626.jpg?w=800
Health care access for trans minors to be decided by Supreme Cour...	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments for the first time Wednesday on state bans of transgender medical care for young people in a case poised to impact transition health care across the nation. In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court will consider whether a Tennessee law banning medical treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy for minors violates the Equal Protection clause, which requires that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Families challenging the ban say their children are being denied critical medical care, while the state argues that it must protect minors from 'serious risks' and outcomes. Tennessee and at least 25 other Republican-controlled states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for young people. More than half of those bans are being challenged in courts, making the Skrmetti case highly consequential for gender-affirming medical care. Explained: What transgender and gender-diverse terminology mean What is the case about? This case centers around a 2023 Tennessee law called Senate Bill 1 that restricts certain medical treatments for transgender minors, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sex-transition surgeries that would further 'a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex.' Senate Bill 1 does carve out exceptions for these treatments being used for other medical conditions but not gender dysphoria or any psychological conditions. Ohio governor signs bill limiting bathroom use by transgender students After the law passed, Samantha and Brian Williams of Nashville, their 15-year-old transgender daughter, two other plaintiff families filing anonymously and Memphis-based medical doctor Dr. Susan Lacy filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the law. The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal are representing them. President Joe Biden's administration supports the challenge to Tennessee’s law, but the federal government’s position is expected to change after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. FILE - Advocates gather for a rally at the state Capitol complex in Nashville, Tenn., to oppose a series of bills that target the LGBTQ community, Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Jonathan Mattise, File) The group argued for a preliminary injunction to prevent the law from taking effect until it goes through the legal process. A lower court ruled in favor, finding that the laws likely infringed on parents’ fundamental rights to direct their children's medical care and discriminated based on sex. However, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling and allowed the law to go into effect until the higher court decided its legality. What do opponents of the ban say? Those arguing against the ban say it discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status, making it a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The ban permits these same hormone medications when they are provided to an individual who is 'consistent' with a person’s sex designated at birth but not to a transgender person, which is discrimination, the ACLU said. They argue that under the law, a doctor could prescribe estrogen to a 'cisgender teenage girl for any clinical diagnosis but could not do the same for a transgender girl diagnosed with gender dysphoria.' Nancy Mace: Capitol transgender bathroom rules protect women 'We are simply asking the Supreme Court to recognize that when a law treats people differently based on their sex, the same equal protection principles apply regardless of whether the group impacted by the law happens to be transgender,' Chase Strangio, an attorney arguing for the plaintiffs, said. Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation’s highest court. The families say gender-affirming medical care is life-saving for their children. 'I am so afraid of what this law will mean for her. We don’t want to leave Tennessee, but this legislation would force us to either routinely leave our state to get our daughter the medical care she desperately needs or to uproot our entire lives and leave Tennessee altogether,' plaintiff Samantha Williams said in a statement. What do supporters of the ban say? Tennessee’s attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, argues that the state ban doesn’t discriminate based on sex but rather 'draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes' and that 'boys and girls fall on both sides of that line.' He also argues that the state has the right to protect young people from 'irreversible, unproven medical procedures' that carry potential long-term risks. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti (AP Photo/George Walker IV) 'Lawmakers recognized that there is little to no credible evidence to justify the serious risks these procedures present to youth and joined a growing number of European countries in restricting their use on minors with gender-identity issues,' Skrmetti said in advance of oral arguments, according to Tennessee Lookout. Court rejects request to sideline San Jose State volleyball player on grounds she’s transgender Arguments made in court filings stated that European countries have started pulling back from gender-affirming medical care because of concerns about safety and effectiveness, the outlet reported. Tennessee lawmakers considered European restrictions and listened to accounts 'of regret and harm' from people who switched back to their original sex, the brief stated. What are the potential implications of the case? There are about 300,000 people between the ages of 13 and 17 who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, a think tank that researches gender identity. The case could chart the course for these thousands not only on existing bans but also on what states could do in the future. 'Upholding the law would leave room for Congress to ban gender-affirming care. We don’t know how broadly the court would define that. We don’t know what exceptions it would create, but it would leave room for them to legislate in this area in a way that would have impact on even those states that have taken a different approach' than Tennessee, Olatunde C.A. Johnson, a professor at Columbia Law School, told Roll Call. Groups advocating against the ban say implications could spill over from minors into adult care. 'Certainly, how the Court comes out in this Skrmetti case will have some impact on laws that further restrict care for adults,' Cynthia Weaver, Human Rights Campaign senior director of litigation, told Time. 'It may also encourage or discourage other states to contemplate further restrictions on adult care.'

Texas couple's dream border orchard turns into a nightmare	(NewsNation) — Magali and Hugo Urbina purchased a sprawling pecan orchard in their hometown of Eagle Pass, Texas in 2021, planning to make the property their dream retirement destination without knowing they would soon find themselves at the center of an international crisis. But three years later, after Eagle Pass became ground zero for the crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, the couple said that their farm and their lives had become a living hell. An estimated 1 million immigrants have crossed the border at Eagle Pass and the couple told NewsNation that their property, Heavenly Farms, has become a staging ground for undocumented migrants. Since then, the couple – who were born in Eagle Pass and returned home after purchasing the orchard – said that they have expressed a range of emotions that move between anger, disappointment, and frustration. Migrant caravan with 1,500 people coming up from Mexico 'It seemed at the time that both the state of Texas was (moving) in one direction and the federal government and was going in another direction,' Hugo Urbina told NewsNation. 'You’re like, we need to work toward a common ground toward fixing the problem. You can’t just have people crossing into the United States illegally that way.' Magali Urbina agrees and said the couple constantly thought there had to be a better solution rather than seeing seemingly endless lines of immigrants on their orchard waiting to be processed by immigration officials. The experience caused the couple to reconsider their political loyalties. The Urbinas were part of a movement that shifted Maverick County in its support for President-elect Donald Trump. Magali Urbina said that in 2022, she viewed the migrant crisis from a humanitarian perspective. But as the flood of undocumented immigrants continued onto their property over the past 2 1/2 years, the couple helped to flip their county for the Republicans in the 2024 election. 'I understand that they’re coming for a better life – most of them are,' she told NewsNation. Despite her empathy, Magali Urbina said that the lines the couple witnessed on their property included parents with their babies along with teenagers who were often crossing into the United States without supervision. Despite objections from their friends and family, the couple told NewsNation they voted for Trump in November after saying they saw all they needed to see in their own backyard. 'It was overwhelming,' Magali Urbina said. 'It really was.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/texas-couples-dream-border-orchard-nightmare/	2024-12-03T11:42:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/667f733a9ad7f8.64557103.jpeg?w=900

Nearly 1 in 3 gift-givers expect to go into debt this year: Surve...	(NewsNation) — 'Tis the season of spending and according to a new survey nearly a third of holiday gift-givers expect to go into debt this year. A LendingTree survey of nearly 2,050 U.S. consumers found that 30% of those who plan to give gifts this year are prepared to break their budgets and go into debt. Meanwhile, nearly half (47%) said they've gone into debt due to holiday spending in the past. Most Americans worried about affording gifts this year 'Debt has become one of those things that people dread about the holidays, along with travel nightmares and awkward family conversations,' Matt Schultz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst, said in the report. Among those who have gone into debt due to gift-giving, 46% blamed inflation and the rising costs of presents. This year, almost a third of Americans are opting out of gift-giving altogether, with most citing cost as the reason, LendingTree found. Another sign of the times: Cash is the top gift preference, followed by gift cards, experiences and clothes. Of the gift-givers surveyed, roughly 40% said they would trade all their gifts for the equivalent cash value if they could. 5 tips to avoid overspending this holiday season The survey's findings underscore the financial stress many Americans are feeling after a period of rampant inflation. While price hikes have eased, many have noticed that what goes up, doesn't always come down. Nevertheless, the National Retail Federation expects holiday spending to hit a record $902 per person this year. And most shoppers (74%) plan to use credit cards, according to NerdWallet. A separate CreditKarma report found that about a third of consumers are heading into the shopping season with more than $5,000 in debt. How to avoid overspending during the holidays Holiday shopping surveys show a consistent trend: Americans feel pressure to spend big on their loved ones. Schultz thinks communication is key to reducing that stress. 'If you’re struggling financially and need to dial back the gift-giving this holiday season, tell people,' he said. 'Most of your loved ones don’t want you to go into debt for a holiday party or gift, so they’ll understand.' Elizabeth Ayoola, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet, agreed that a transparent conversation can go a long way, even if it's with yourself. 'It's important to remember that you are not a failure because you cannot afford to buy expensive gifts,' she told NewsNation in a recent interview. LendingTree's survey found that most Americans (63%) who’ve gone into debt for holiday gifts have regretted it. These are five steps you can take to avoid overspending this holiday season: Set a budget (and expectations) Look at what you spent last year and set a spending limit based on your current situation. Then, be clear with your loved ones. Avoid 'spaving' this holiday season Be careful of deals that require you to spend more to save more. Is free shipping worth it if you have to spend $100? Consider paying with cash It's never been easier to spend money but research shows it hurts more to pay with cash. That pain can push you to spend less. Take a break from social media Targeted ads can wear you down and cause you to buy things you don't need. Consider logging off Instagram and Facebook for a while to avoid the temptation. Create shopping hurdles Make it harder to spend money. Remove credit card details from your web browser to add an extra obstacle and cut back on impulse spending.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gift-givers-debt/	2024-12-03T10:14:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2186867047.jpg?w=900
House Republicans say Biden investigations 'not off the table'	(NewsNation) — House Republicans say President Joe Biden's pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, will not mean the end of investigations into the Biden family. A Republican source familiar with the investigation said the White House has continued to obstruct the investigation, citing papers from the National Archives that have not been turned over. 'The Committee continues to pursue this information, and will not take any future steps as it relates to the Biden family investigation off the table, including possibly interviewing Hunter Biden again,' the source said. 'The Committee’s work thus far has exposed the truth to the American people, paving the way for President Trump to clean house within the Deep State to prevent further cover-ups for the Biden Crime Family.' Trump FCC chair pick talks how to ‘smash the censorship cartel’ Republicans have launched multiple investigations into the Biden family, trying to link Biden to his son's business dealings. Of the investigations, no evidence has surfaced that proves the president was involved in his son's business deals or influenced policy based on his family's interests. Biden pardoned his son on Sunday, a reversal of his previous position when he repeatedly said he would not use his pardon power on behalf of Hunter Biden. The pardon was one of the most sweeping in recent history, with Biden ensuring his son could not be charged with any federal crimes committed between 2014 and 2024. Republicans criticized Biden's reversal along with a number of Democrats. Others questioned whether the move would mean that Hunter Biden has lost his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Abbott threatens to pull funding from hospital after doctor’s TikTok Hunter Biden still has his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination when it comes to any state charges or potential future charges that don’t fall under the purview of Joe Biden’s pardon, trial attorney John Fishwick told NewsNation. However, since he is essentially immune from any charges during a ten-year period, he no longer needs to assert his Fifth Amendment rights. That opens the door for him to be called upon in investigations of others including his father, he said. So he doesn’t 'lose' his rights, they just no longer apply, Fishwick said, calling the situation 'uncharted territory.' It could mean that Hunter Biden could be compelled to testify against his father before Congress if the investigations continue with the next session of Congress where Republicans will control both the House and the Senate.

Daniel Penny trial jury deliberations to begin soon	(NewsNation) — Jury deliberations could begin on Tuesday in the trial of Daniel Penny, the Marine veteran who is accused of choking a man to death on a New York City subway in 2023. Prosecutors are expected to wrap up their closing arguments in the trial, which began in November and has included 40 witnesses over the past seven weeks. Penny is charged with manslaughter and reckless homicide in the death of Jordan Neely. Prosecutors have argued that while Penny is justified in defending himself, he went too far in placing a chokehold on Neely, a man experiencing homelessness who was witnessed threatening passengers and behaving erratically. JonBenét Ramsey: Geraldo Rivera apologizes to her dad for mock trial Penny’s attorneys maintain that their client likely saved lives after Neely reportedly threatened to kill fellow passengers. The central issue of the trial is which way Penny’s actions should be perceived. Neely arrived at court on Monday with bystanders chanting, 'guilty, guilty, guilty' as the architecture student made his way to the courthouse. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg attended Monday's closing arguments and was seated with Neely's family. Penny’s attorneys said that their client risked his life for other passengers. They also asked jurors to put themselves in the shoes of subway passengers, but prosecutors argued that Penny used 'way too much force for way too long.' They also argued that society cannot tolerate an 'unjust and untimely death' of a fellow American based on what could have been empty threats. Neely was found to have a synthetic form of marijuana in his system and suffered from several medical conditions at the time of his death, experts have testified during the trial. Neely also had a warrant out for his arrest at the time. The jury is made up of seven women and five men and there is no timeline for how long deliberations could take before a verdict is returned.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/daniel-penny-trial-jury-deliberations-to-begin-soon/	2024-12-03T07:58:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180010175.jpg?w=900
Biden’s pardon of son Hunter threatens to tarnish legacy	President Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter in his final full month in the White House is threatening to erode his legacy as he prepares to leave office. Biden is set to conclude his one term as president with a string of notable legislative achievements, a fundamentally strong economy and having navigated the end of a once in a generation pandemic. But his final few months, which included his refusal to drop his reelection bid until late July and his decision to pardon Hunter Biden after repeatedly saying he would not do so, is casting a cloud over the Biden presidency. 'It’s been astonishing to watch Biden cast a long shadow over his many achievements in office simply by acting as many presidents do, which is from a place of an outsized ego,' said Alexis Coe, a presidential historian and biographer. 'If Biden had dropped out of the race in 2022 on a high note after the midterms, everything that came after would have been towards the end of his biography,' Coe said. 'He’s had a lifelong record of public service. Now almost everything that he has accomplished will be crammed into the beginning, and the pardon will be one of many things that dominates the rest. I would love to be wrong about that.' The president announced unexpectedly late Sunday as he departed for a week-long trip to Africa that he was issuing a complete pardon of his son Hunter Biden absolving him of a conviction on federal gun charges and of a guilty plea on federal tax charges. The decision sent shockwaves through the political world, eliciting criticism from Republicans and even some Democrats. Critics raised the fact that Biden had personally said a pardon for his son was off the table repeatedly for months and that the president had spent his time in office stressing the importance of respect for the rule of law and the independence of the justice system. Biden's respect for institutions and the Justice Department in particular was seen as especially valuable following four years of a Trump administration that frequently ignored guardrails and injected politics into investigations. 'It's just unfortunate that the president, in his attempt to protect his son, has left his own legacy so vulnerable,' said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at Columbia University and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library. 'This feeds the general cynicism among Republicans, but I think some Democrats, too...about politics and our national institutions,' he added. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) was one of several Senate Democrats to criticize Biden’s move. Bennet posted on X that Biden's decision 'put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans’ faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all.' Elie Honig, a former U.S. attorney who now serves as an analyst for CNN, said on the network that the pardon could adversely affect Biden’s legacy, even as he acknowledged there was a 'reasonable argument' that Hunter Biden was treated differently because of his name. 'Joe Biden, let’s be clear here, he lied to us for a long time. He said categorically I will not pardon my own son,' Honig said. 'He said ‘I will take it off the table.’ And he couched it in very high-minded terminology, ‘I respect the Justice Department, I respect the jury’s verdict.’ Well now he’s gone back on that.' Biden in his statement Sunday argued his son would not have faced the gun charges if his name were not Hunter Biden and that 'raw politics' had infected his son’s cases. He also expressed concern that the incoming Trump administration and GOP-controlled Congress would continue to target Hunter Biden. A day before the president announced the pardon, Trump said he would nominate loyalist Kash Patel, who has pledged to go after those deemed to have wronged Trump, to lead the FBI. 'In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here,' Biden said. 'Enough is enough.' Biden and his top aides said repeatedly during Hunter Biden’s legal troubles that the president would not pardon his son, including as recently as Nov. 7, after President-elect Trump won a second term. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday that the president 'wrestled' with the decision and 'agonized over it.' 'Two things could be true,' Jean-Pierre said. 'The president does believe in the justice system and the Department of Justice. And he also believes his son was singled out politically.' Jean-Pierre pointed to other legal experts who defended Biden’s actions, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, who called the pardon 'warranted.' 'Had his name been Joe Smith the resolution would have been - fundamentally and more fairly - a declination,' Holder posted on X. Others noted Trump himself had expressed an openness to a pardon for Hunter Biden when asked about the idea in late October. 'Trump plays by no rules. Abuses the law. He would’ve pardoned Hunter and called you a coward for not doing it,' Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state lawmaker, posted on X. The pardon comes at the end of what has been a consequential and politically difficult final year for Biden in the White House. A disastrous debate performance in late June set off weeks of clamoring from Democrats about whether Biden should step aside. He ultimately ended his reelection bid in late July, giving Vice President Harris a little over 100 days to mount a campaign against Trump. Harris was soundly defeated in November’s election, with some Democrats pointing fingers at Biden for setting her up to fail by seeking a second term despite widespread concerns about his age that the White House repeatedly blew off. Some experts cautioned against assuming Biden’s use of the pardon power on his son would be a lasting image of his presidency, however. Some of his legislative achievements, such as the Inflation Reduction Act or CHIPS and Science Act, are likely to bear out investments in the years to come, and they pointed to his work restoring international alliances between Trump terms as potentially consequential. 'Even though he didn’t stop Trump from returning to power, he did defeat Trump. He did stand up for the rule of law. And he did, for most of his presidency, he did attempt to restore trust and faith in the electoral process,' said Matt Dallek, a political historian and professor at George Washington University. 'He may well be remembered as the last president of the post-world War II era where America was interventionist and believed in international alliances and committed to being a leader for better and for worse around the world,' Dallek said. 'And I don’t know that the pardon will change even his standing up for democratic norms in general.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hunter-biden/bidens-pardon-of-son-hunter-threatens-to-tarnish-legacy/	2024-12-03T04:50:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Biden-legacy_120324_AP_Ben-Curtis.png?w=900
Palestinians say Hamas, Fatah close to agreement on committee for...	CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian officials say Fatah and Hamas are closing in on an agreement to appoint a committee of politically independent technocrats to administer the Gaza Strip after the war. It would effectively end Hamas' rule and could help advance ceasefire talks with Israel. The rival factions have made several failed attempts to reconcile since Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007. Israel has meanwhile ruled out any postwar role in Gaza for either Hamas or Fatah, which dominates the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. A Palestinian Authority official on Tuesday confirmed that an agreement had been reached following weeks of negotiations in Cairo. The official said the committee would have 12-15 members, most of them from Gaza. It would report to the Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and work with local and international parties to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. A Hamas official said that Hamas and Fatah had agreed on the general terms but were still negotiating over some details and the individuals who would serve on the committee. The official said an agreement would be announced after a meeting of all Palestinian factions in Cairo, without providing a timeline. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the talks. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is dismantled and scores of hostages are returned. He says Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza, with civilian affairs administered by local Palestinians unaffiliated with the Palestinian Authority or Hamas. No Palestinians have publicly volunteered for such a role, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with the Israeli military. The United States has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern both the West Bank and Gaza ahead of eventual statehood. The Israeli government, which is opposed to Palestinian statehood, is reportedly discussing a postwar plan with the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 and backs a rival Fatah faction. The Hamas official said the emerging Palestinian agreement would fulfill one of Israel’s war goals by ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza. It’s unclear if Israeli officials would see it that way. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank, recognizes Israel and cooperates with it on security matters, a policy that is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, many of whom view it as a subcontractor of the occupation. Israel says the authority has not done enough to combat militancy or curb incitement. The committee would assume its responsibilities after a ceasefire agreement with Israel, the Hamas official said. American and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker such an agreement, but the negotiations have repeatedly stalled. Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages remain inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were combatants. The offensive has leveled much of the coastal territory and displaced the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents. ___ Federman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-palestinians-say-hamas-and-fatah-are-close-to-an-agreement-on-a-committee-to-administer-postwar-gaza/	2024-12-03T01:08:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/674ecb8f33fbd1.74768352.jpeg?w=900
JonBenét Ramsey: Geraldo Rivera apologizes to her dad for mock tr...	(NewsNation) — John Bennett Ramsey, the father of murdered 6-year-old JonBenét Ramsey, joined 'CUOMO' just weeks ahead of the 28th anniversary of her Christmas death. Ramsey was joined by NewsNation correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera, whose 1997 mock trial surrounding the case appeared in Netflix’s new documentary, 'Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey?' The film focuses on mistakes from police and media personnel in the years following her murder, which Ramsey called 'primitive behavior' that was 'disgraceful.' Rivera told Ramsey, 'I deeply apologize to you for what you and your family have suffered' in reference to his special. However, he added that 'mock trials and moot courts ... are not that unprecedented.' Man breaks into Florida home, stabs sleeping woman: Deputies JonBenét Ramsey mock trial by Geraldo Rivera The documentary features clips from the defunct daytime talk show, 'The Geraldo Rivera Show,' where the eponymous host conducted a mock trial about the Ramseys’ culpability for their daughter’s death. His 'jury' found the parents liable, which sent Patsy Ramsey to bed 'for about two days because I was just so mortified,' she said in a previously recorded interview. During the show, a child abuse expert also posited that she believed JonBenét Ramsey had been 'sexually stimulated,' referencing a video of the child playing a saxophone as masturbation. Rivera apologized for his mock trial's inflammatory comments and conclusion, telling John Ramsey, 'When I say I am sorry, I don't apologize for my reporting ... but I don't know what happened. I just want you to know that I lament contributing to the hurt that you have endured.' 'I don't think anyone deserves to go through what you went through,' he added. 'That's my bottom line.' 'Let me first say, Geraldo, I accept your apology and thank you,' Ramsey responded. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

JonBenét Ramsey, who competed in beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her family’s home in the college town of Boulder the day after Christmas in 1996. Her body was found several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenét Ramsey competing in pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States. JonBenét Ramsey was bludgeoned and strangled. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever prosecuted.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Police were widely criticized for mishandling the early investigation into her death amid speculation that her family was responsible. 'I think the police fed false information, misleading information, to the media ... before even the evidence had been recovered, looked at,' Ramsey told NewsNation. However, a prosecutor cleared her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and brother Burke in 2008 based on new DNA evidence from JonBenet’s clothing that pointed to the involvement of an 'unexplained third party' in her slaying. Menendez brothers case timeline: Murder to resentencing The announcement by former district attorney Mary Lacy came two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer. Lacy called the Ramseys 'victims of this crime.' In 2021, police said in their annual update that DNA hadn’t been ruled out to help solve the case, and in 2022, they noted that some evidence could be 'consumed' if DNA testing is done on it. John Bennett Ramsey calls for further DNA testing Boulder police found DNA evidence on JonBenét’s body, and years later, found DNA from the same male on her tights. Ramsey says he’s learned that, at the time, several items were sent to a DNA lab, and some of them were not tested but returned to the police. He says today, labs can do so much more — but only if they are allowed to do new tests and only if the DNA is in a particular format. 'So the retesting needs to be done. Hopefully, we get a good sample and in the right format that then they could do the genealogy research,' John Ramsey said. 'I believe if we do that, there's a really good chance we can solve it.' In a previous NewsNation interview, John Ramsey pointed to expanding the DNA database search. He said police have only access to the FBI’s CODIS database, which holds genealogical data from felons. Police ‘optimistic’ that JonBenét Ramsey case can be solved Where does JonBenét Ramsey's case stand now? According to NewsNation local affiliate KDVR's reporting, in 1999, a grand jury had recommended an indictment be filed against Patsy and John in connection to her death. In 2006, a man confessed to killing JonBenét and was arrested, but DNA evidence also cleared him. (Original Caption) The grave of JonBenet Ramsey, it is still not known who murdered her.

Hannah Kobayashi crossed into Mexico, no foul play suspected: Pol...	(NewsNation) — Authorities updated the public Monday evening with the latest details on 30-year-old Maui resident Hannah Kobayashi, who has been the center of a massive search since she vanished in Los Angeles in early November. Kobayashi was seen on security footage crossing the U.S. border on foot into Mexico, alone, with luggage and seemingly unharmed, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The case is now classified as a voluntary missing person case. FBI offers reward in case of missing Maine teen Stefanie Damron Kobayashi disappeared after missing her connecting flight in Los Angeles, crossed the border into Mexico, law enforcement sources told multiple outlets. Kobayashi reportedly crossed the border between Nov. 12 and 13, per NBC News affiliate reports. The sources told multiple outlets there was no evidence of foul play in her disappearance. In a Nov. 26 Board of Police Commissioners meeting, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said the investigation determined Kobayashi purposefully skipped her LAX flight. Kobayashi disappeared and stopped contacting her family just days after. In the final texts sent to loved ones, Kobayashi said, 'I got hacked, stripped of my identity, I can’t fly.' Another reads: 'I got tricked pretty much into giving away my funds for someone I thought I loved. I’ve been on the streets.' The concerning messages have led family members to believe she could've been trafficked, drugged or coerced during her time in Los Angeles. Family flew out to help search for her, and her father, Ryan Kobayashi, died by suicide on Nov. 24. Hannah Kobayashi: Timeline of Hawaiian woman’s disappearance Kobayashi’s sister and mother released a statement on Facebook Saturday night, claiming investigators have reported inaccurate information on the case. They also allege the police department has not communicated new developments with them. 'We are doing everything in our power to locate Hannah. Based on information, surveillance footage reviewed and information shared with us, these are the facts known to my mother and I: It does not appear that Hannah intentionally missed her flight. My mother and I were unaware about the alleged findings presented at the Los Angeles Police Commission meeting until multiple videos of the meeting were sent to us by multiple citizens. These alleged findings have yet to be relayed to my mother and I directly from the Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department or any detective involved in Hannah’s case. My mother and I would later learn that the police commission is a five-member committee made up of five civilians, not law enforcement, who are not directly involved in Hannah’s missing persons case. Specific facts contained in that report were inaccurate, such as Hannah’s age. Hannah is 30 years old, not 23. Also, Hannah was reported missing to Law Enforcement on November 11th, not November 13th, as stated by the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. The lack of communication surrounding some important details has left us feeling excluded from potentially crucial developments. However, we do remain hopeful and optimistic that the Los Angeles Police Department is doing everything in their power to assist us in locating Hannah. We are devastated by Hannah’s disappearance and now my father Ryan’s passing. It is completely out of character for Hannah to simply disappear without a trace. We remain deeply concerned about Hannah’s safety, her well-being and her current state of mind. Hannah, if you happen to see this, know that we are not going to give up or stop searching until we find you. We know that this is something you would never do on your own accord, unless you felt some type of threat or you were unwell. We know how much you love all of us, and we love you deeply. While we will continue our search for Hannah widely, we will be focusing on the Southern California area, specifically all regions of Los Angeles, Long Beach, and all regions of San Diego. We extend our deepest gratitude to everyone who continues to hold our family in their prayers and to those positively contributing to our search efforts.

House Democrat on Biden pardon of son: 'He got this one wrong'	(The Hill/NewsNation) — Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., criticized President Joe Biden for pardoning his son Hunter on federal charges, saying the president 'got this one wrong.' 'It is critically important that we try to build up American confidence in our judicial system and the Department of Justice,' Stanton said Monday on 'The Hill on NewsNation.' 'And this decision by the president to pardon his son where he suggests it was a political prosecution, I think, undermines the Department of Justice and hurts this important institution and the rule of law.' Stanton, who was one of many Democrats who called for Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race, is not the only member of the party criticizing Biden's move. Trump warns of ‘hell to pay’ if Hamas doesn’t release hostages 'While as a father I certainly understand President @JoeBiden’s natural desire to help his son by pardoning him, I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country,' Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said on X on Sunday. 'This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.' In June, Hunter Biden, 54, was found guilty in a federal case on three felony charges over his purchase and possession of a gun in 2018, violating the law by concealing drug use. He was set to face sentencing in his federal gun case Wednesday. In September, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges, avoiding a trial. 'This wasn’t a politically-motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies, and was convicted by a jury of his peers,' Stanton wrote in a post on X in response to President Biden's pardon announcement late Sunday. Charlamagne tha God knocks Democrats after Hunter Biden pardon President Biden and his team initially emphasized that there were no plans to pardon Hunter Biden, with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying two days after President-elect Donald Trump’s victory that the answer was still 'no' when asked about a possible pardon. Biden, however, argued late Sunday that the charges against his son were politically motivated. 'There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution,' he said in a statement. 'In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.' Stanton said that he would return to Washington to discuss the issue with his colleagues, indicating that other Democrats may also speak out against the pardon. 'I respect President Biden, and he has been an honorable person throughout his time in public life. I don't know why he changed his mind on this most important issue,' Stanton told NewsNation.

Menendez brothers case timeline: Murder to resentencing	(NewsNation) — Erik and Lyle Menendez captured national attention in 1989 and beyond after the siblings killed their parents, but the two gained new widespread interest thanks to a Netflix special. In the months following the premiere of 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,' relatives of the brothers came forward in support of a reduced sentence. Following an initial mistrial, the Menendez brothers were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 without possibility of parole.

Suitcase murder trial: Sarah Boone sentenced to life for boyfrien...	(NewsNation) — Sarah Boone has been sentenced to life in prison for leaving her boyfriend, Jorge Torres, in a suitcase to die back in 2020. Four years after she was arrested for Torres’ death, Boone was found guilty of second-degree murder in late October after 90 minutes of deliberation. Her lawyer, James Owens, told NewsNation he’d encouraged her to take a plea deal prior to the verdict. She was 'shocked' by the guilty verdict and thought maybe the jury would convict her of a lesser charge, according to Owens. What was Sarah Boone accused of? Boone initially told the Orange County Sheriff’s Office that she and Torres had been playing hide-and-seek on Feb. 23, 2020, in their Winter Park, Florida, residence when they thought it would be funny for Torres to get into the suitcase. Boone zipped her boyfriend into the suitcase during the alleged game of hide-and-seek, leaving him inside overnight. They had been drinking and she decided to go to sleep, thinking her boyfriend could get out of the suitcase on his own, she told detectives. When she woke up the next morning, she didn’t find Torres but then remembered he was in the suitcase. She unzipped the suitcase and found him unresponsive, according to the arrest report. Suitcase murder: Sarah Boone’s lawyer ‘strongly’ urged plea deal Detectives charged Boone with murder after they found videos on her cellphone showing Torres yelling from inside the suitcase that he couldn’t breathe and repeatedly calling out Boone’s name, according to the arrest report. Suitcase murder trial During her trial, Boone testified that past violent incidents between her and Torres caused her to perceive a threat of imminent harm and that she acted in self-defense by keeping him in the suitcase. 'Yeah, that’s what you do when you choke me,' Boone said in one of the cellphone videos from that night, according to the arrest report. 'Oh, that’s what I feel like when you cheat on me.' An autopsy report said Torres had scratches on his back and neck and contusions to his shoulder, skull and forehead from blunt force trauma, as well as a cut near his busted lip. NewsNation's Liz Jassin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/sarah-boone-sentenced-to-life/	2024-12-02T13:08:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/gettyimages-2180251558-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Did Hunter Biden lose his 5th amendment rights with pardon?	(NewsNation) —Hunter Biden’s pardon by Joe Biden has sparked questions on whether the president’s son can assert his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination if ever forced to testify against his father in future investigations. Many who want to see Biden investigated believe since Hunter can't be charged federally with any crime committed between 2014 and 2024 under Biden's pardon, he is now fair game in criminal investigations of other Biden family members. 'Does this mean Hunter Biden just lost his 5th amendment right to refuse to testify on actions from 2014-2024? Asking for a friend,' far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec wrote on X. What other family members received presidential pardons In his clemency announcement, the president called his son’s treatment a 'miscarriage of justice' and pointed to political motivation behind federal felony gun and tax convictions of his son. The president’s sweeping pardon covers not just the gun and tax offenses against the younger Biden, but also any other 'offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014, through December 1, 2024.' Hunter Biden filed a court declaration accepting the pardon just hours after the president’s announcement. Does Hunter Biden still have Fifth Amendment rights? Hunter Biden still has his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination when it comes to any state charges or potential future charges that don’t fall under the purview of Joe Biden’s pardon, trial attorney John Fishwick told NewsNation. However, since he is essentially immune from any charges during a ten-year period, he no longer needs to assert his Fifth Amendment rights and that opens the door for him to be called upon in investigations of others including his father, he said. So he doesn't 'lose' his rights, they just no longer apply, Fishwick said calling the situation 'uncharted territory.' The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from self-incrimination, which is the act of providing information that could be used against them in a criminal case. Hunter Biden’s charges weren’t politically motivated: Trial attorney | Morning in America Under a pardon, an individual can no longer be criminally prosecuted for anything covered under it. Could Hunter Biden be compelled to testify against Joe Biden? Hunter Biden can be compelled to testify against his father because he is no longer at risk of criminal prosecution under federal law, Fishwick said. 'The pardon that his father gave him is incredibly broad, which would cover everything so there's a strong argument that he could be compelled to testify because he cannot incriminate himself,' he said. If Congress or the Department of Justice conducts any internal investigation of Joe Biden, his son can be called to testify and he will have to, he said. However, his legal team will fight vigorously against him having to testify and could say he isn’t compelled to testify because of potential future charges or because he needs to assert his Fifth Amendment rights under state charges that could still come about from him testifying, he said. 'His lawyers are going to look for creative ways to prevent him from testifying, and that would be a good way to try to stop it,' he said. 'Whether that wins or not remains to be seen, but they will be all in to prevent him from testifying.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hunter-biden-5th-amendment-pardon/	2024-12-02T12:08:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66bd0266d52bb9.54530315.jpeg?w=900
4-year-old girl found alone at border remains in US custody	(NewsNation) — Officials with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the U.S. Border Patrol continue to see a surge of minors after they said they have encountered more than 100 unaccompanied minors along the U.S.-Mexico border over the past week. Among the children who have been found in the United States is a 4-year-old girl from Honduras who officials said they found alone after she was smuggled by coyotes throughout South America. The mother of the girl told NewsNation that she is still waiting for a phone call from U.S. immigration officials about when her daughter will be released. The toddler has been in the custody of border officials for more than a week. Democratic senators say they bungled border security in 2024 The girl’s mother said she was provided photos of her daughter by Mexican smugglers who were responsible for getting the girl into the United States. At times, the smugglers allowed the girl to communicate with her mother by FaceTime. The woman told NewsNation that the smuggler eventually stopped answering her phone calls regarding her daughter. She said that she believed that her daughter was kidnapped and was unaccounted for before she received confirmation from border officials that the young girl was in their custody. Sources told NewsNation that the surge in unaccompanied children is taking place in Maverick County, Texas, along with neighboring Val Verde County. Maverick County is an area known to be controlled by criminal smugglers despite not having a heavy presence of Mexican cartel members. Ex-KCK detective Roger Golubski found dead before trial Surveillance footage has shown a young girl being smuggled into the country across the Rio Grande River. A girl matching the description of the child seen in the footage was later found in a vehicle that was pulled over by police. The girl’s mother, a Mexican national living in North America, told police that she said $8,000 to a smuggling organization to have her daughter brought into the U.S. Officials have charged a man in the incident and told NewsNation that the girl’s mother could also face criminal charges.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/4-year-old-girl-alone-border-us-custody/	2024-12-02T11:38:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/Texas-DPS-car-door-1.jpg?w=876
What other family members received presidential pardons	(NewsNation)—On Sunday, President Joe Biden issued a pardon for his son Hunter after previously saying that he would not. He not only reversed course as he prepares to leave the White House but also became the latest U.S. President to pardon a family member. In his clemency announcement, the president called his son’s treatment a 'miscarriage of justice' and pointed to political motivation behind his son’s charges. 'Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' Biden said in a statement issued by the White House. Lawmakers react to Hunter Biden pardon With Sunday’s announcement, Biden became only the third president to make such a declaration for a relative. But other notable personalities have been granted pardons throughout history as former U.S. presidents have used their authority to issue pardons. Hunter Biden pardoned by his father Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in September, three months after he was convicted in a separate gun trial in June. After Biden was found guilty of the tax charges, the White House remained adamant that the president would not issue a pardon for his son. Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on the criminal charges more than a month before President-elect Donald Trump begins his second term in the White House. In the statement issued on Sunday, President Biden said that he wrestled with his decision but said that 'raw politics' had infected the judicial process and led to a miscarriage of justice. Hunter Biden was facing up to 17 years in prison and up to a $450,000 fine for the tax charges and up to 25 years in prison for the felony gun charges. The president’s sweeping pardon covers not just the gun and tax offenses against the younger Biden, but also any other 'offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014, through December 1, 2024. In response, Trump called Biden’s decision 'an abuse and miscarriage of justice' and questioned on Truth Social whether the pardon would be extended to those who had been convicted in connection with the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots. Donald Trump pardons his in-law Trump, who will be inaugurated on January 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in November, issued several presidential pardons at the end of his first term, including one to the father of his son-in-law. Charles Kushner, who Trump nominated as his Ambassador to France, is the father of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared. In a social media post, Trump referred to the elder Kushner – a real estate developer – as a 'tremendous business leader, philanthropist and dealmaker. Trump pardoned Charles Kushner in 2020 after Kushner had pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges and to making illegal campaign donations. Charles Kushner wades through the media with his legal team and wife to the U.S. District Courthouse on August 18, 2004, in Newark, New Jersey. Kushner, a New Jersey developer and a major campaign contributor to Democrats including embattled Gov. Jim McGreevey, is expected to plead guilty to federal charges that he hired a prostitute to try to silence a witness in a federal investigation. (Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images) According to reports, Charles Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden camera and the recording sent to his sister, the man’s wife, prosecutors said. Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion and witness tampering, the Associated Press reported. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison — the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Bill Clinton pardons half-brother In 2001, President Bill Clinton issued a pardon for his half-brother, Roger Clinton, who had previously been convicted of drug-related charges. The pardon came on Clinton’s final day in office on January 20, 2001. ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan says US has ‘no other option’ than mass deportations Roger Clinton, the son of Bill Clinton’s mother, Virginia Dell Kelly, and his stepfather pleaded guilty in 1985 to selling cocaine to an undercover police officer in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported. Roger Clinton spent a year in prison, but the presidential pardon cleared his criminal record, the Post reported. The report also indicated that Roger Clinton had provided President Clinton with a list of people to pardon but had not paid to make the recommendations. Those listed were not included in those whom Bill Clinton issued pardoned. Other notable presidential pardons Richard Nixon The former president who became embroiled in scandal during Watergate, was issued a pre-emptive pardon by President Gerald Ford despite never being charged or convicted of federal crimes. In this Jan. 27, 1963, file photo President Richard Nixon speaks during his first news conference as president in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo, File) Nixon and several of his aides were found to have committed illegal activities during Nixon’s bid for re-election in 1972. Nixon, who was also accused of covering up the scandal that was brought to light by two Washington Post reporters, became the first U.S. President to resign as impeachment hearings against him were ongoing. After Nixon left office on August 9, 1974, Ford was sworn into office and became the 38th President of the United States. Trump threatens ‘100% Tariffs’ on countries that buck US dollar Ford was immediately asked about Nixon’s actions and began to ask White House counsel Phil Buchen to look into the legal precedent of pardoning a former president, according to The Ford Museum Library. On Sept. 8, 1974, Ford addressed the nation from the Oval Office and announced his decision to issue a 'full, free, and absolute pardon for Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.' The pardon included offenses that Nixon committed or may have committed. Jimmy Hoffa Hoffa, the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was serving a 13-year prison sentence when he was pardoned by Nixon in 1971. Nixon commuted Hoffa’s sentence after the former union boss had served four years and nine months in prison after he was sentenced to eight years for jury tampering and five years for pension fund fraud, the Washington Post reported. Although Hoffa was technically not pardoned, which would have cleared his criminal record, Hoffa received the commutation of his sentence, which allowed him to leave prison early. Years later, rumors surfaced that Nixon received a big cash payoff from Hoffa. The Arizona Republic reported in 1979 that Hoffa paid Nixon $500,000 for his release, the Washington Post reported. However, FBI sources told the newspaper that a 19-page diary that included word of the payoff had been fabricated. Patty Hearst The granddaughter of newspaper magnate William Rudolph Hearst was reportedly kidnapped at the hands of a radical guerrilla group that called itself the Symbionese Liberation Army. However, she then said that she had voluntarily joined the group and was later involved in a bank robbery. Hearst was photographed with an assault rifle during the robbery of the San Francisco bank and later claimed in court that she had been brainwashed and assaulted while being held. President Jimmy Carter commuted Hearst’s seven-year prison sentence after she was convicted of bank robbery charges in 1976. She was freed from jail and later received a full sentence from Clinton in 2001. Like with Roger Clinton, Hearst received the full pardon hours before Bill Clinton left office. Hearst, who served just seven months of her prison sentence before Carter commuted the sentence, had her right to vote and hold public office reinstated. However, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the pardon did not expunge her criminal conviction.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/family-members-received-presidential-pardons/	2024-12-02T07:29:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/family_gangitano_AP.jpg?w=900

100+ unaccompanied kids found at US border: Texas official	(NewsNation) — Just this week, dozens of children were found alone at the U.S.-Mexico border, including a 10-year-old boy who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border on Thanksgiving Day and a 4-year-old girl from Honduras found by officials. According to Texas Department of Public Safety Lt. Chris Olivarez, more than 100 unaccompanied children have encountered agents on the nation's southern border since Sunday, Nov. 24. 'I want the American people to see the impacts of this current border situation that we've been in for the last three plus years, and how it impacts unaccompanied children are coming across that border,' Olivarez told 'NewsNation Prime.' According to Olivarez, the children they've encountered ranged from 2 years old to 17 years old. ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan says US has ‘no other option’ than mass deportations The unnamed 4-year-old girl had a note with her when she encountered agents, with a phone number and first name. Her mother told NewsNation she is already in the U.S. and said she left her child in the hands of criminal smugglers in Honduras and Mexico in hopes of being reunited. 'I found a coyote and I paid for them to bring her to me,' the woman said. 'She came alone. It was just the coyote. The last time I talked to my daughter was Saturday, and I haven’t heard anything since they told me the coyote had already handed her over to another coyote, but I don’t know anything else about her.' It's 'all too common,' Olivarez explained, adding that he fears the influx of unaccompanied minors will only get worse.

Olivarez pointed to 'whatever agreement' the Biden administration made with Mexico to get its border crossings numbers down, saying: 'There is no safety mechanisms. There is no protocols in place to protect unaccompanied children.' The 4-year-old's mother shared photos of her daughter with NewsNation. The photos, sent to the mother by a human smuggler while her daughter was still in Mexico, show more children in the background. The mother tells NewsNation that her daughter is still under U.S. immigration custody and it’s unclear if or when she will be released to her in South Carolina.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/kids-minors-mexico-border/	2024-12-01T18:51:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2155236116.jpg?w=789

Hunter Biden pardoned for tax, gun charges by President Joe Biden	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has issued a pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, the White House announced Sunday night. Previously, Joe Biden had remained adamant that he would not pardon Hunter, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in September. He was also convicted in a separate criminal gun case in June. In his clemency announcement, the president called his son's treatment a 'miscarriage of justice' and pointed to political motivation behind his son's charges. 'Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' Biden said in a statement. Hunter Biden filed a court declaration accepting the pardon just hours after the president's announcement. In a statement, Hunter Biden said: 'I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport ... I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.' Lawmakers react to Hunter Biden pardon Trump and other Republicans have for years attacked the Biden family as being criminally corrupt, with a particular focus on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings. House Republicans sought to make Hunter Biden’s business a central part of its impeachment inquiry into President Biden. But their report failed to uncover a smoking gun, instead relying on largely debunked threads, disputed testimony, and circumstantial evidence that failed to directly tie any official action from President Biden to his family’s business dealings. President Joe Biden hugs his son Hunter Biden after addressing the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, July 24, 2024, about his decision to drop his Democratic reelection bid. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, Pool) 'No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong,' his statement continued. 'There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution.

Hunter Biden pardoned for tax, gun charges by President Joe Biden	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has issued a pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, the White House announced Sunday night. Previously, Joe Biden had remained adamant that he would not pardon Hunter, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in September. He was also convicted in a separate criminal gun case in June. In his clemency announcement, the president called his son's treatment a 'miscarriage of justice' and pointed to political motivation behind his son's charges. The billionaires of Trump’s proposed administration 'Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' Biden said in a statement. Trump and other Republicans have for years attacked the Biden family as being criminally corrupt, with a particular focus on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings. House Republicans sought to make Hunter Biden’s business a central part of its impeachment inquiry into President Biden. But their report failed to uncover a smoking gun, instead relying on largely debunked threads, disputed testimony, and circumstantial evidence that failed to directly tie any official action from President Biden to his family’s business dealings. 'No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong,' his statement continued. 'There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.' Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced in December in both of the cases. The 'full and unconditional pardon' will cover both his gun charges conviction and guilty plea. Massad Boulos named as senior Trump advisor on Arab affairs Could Trump overturn Hunter Biden's pardon?

Border Czar' Tom Homan says US has 'no other option' than mass d...	(NewsNation) — Incoming 'Border Czar' Tom Homan discussed his vision for the border with 'NewsNation Now' saying he sees 'no other option' than to carry out mass deportations. Homan, who toured Texas this week, rebuked the notion that mass deportations are anything other than a necessity. Sanctuary cities plan to resist Trump’s mass deportation plans '[Critics] saying, well, that's that's radical, it's racist, it's un-American. It's just ridiculous,' Homan said. 'Of course, there has to be an historic deportation operation, because we have no other option. 'If it doesn't happen, we're sending out messages to the entire world; you can cross the border legally, which is a crime. You can be released into the United States, either go to court or not show up in court and get an order removal, and we're not going to remove you. The whole world is going to come to this country.' Homan also pushed back on sanctuary cities in Democratic states like Colorado, Illinois, and New York, suggesting if they choose not to help ICE, the alternative could be worse. 'if you don't want to help, I've given them a warning, do not impede us. Do not knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien from ICE authorities, because that is a crime, and we'll prosecute those crimes. WATCH: Texas builds border wall at ranch it wants to gift Trump for deportations 'I would think it would be a nonpartisan issue to remove public safety threats out of the community,' he added. Homan does hope that sanctuary cities 'will sit down at the table with us and discuss this.' Full Tom Homan interview transcript Q: You said the federal government would take up Texas’ offer of land for the mass deportation operation. What’s that plan going to look like? How many people, how long will they be held for? 'I'm still working on the plan, but the acres they gave us, we'll use it for, you know, incoming processing and departure locations. So haven't got the plan fully baked yet, but that offers great. It's going to say the taxpayers a lot of money from, you know, acquiring land separate from this. So, we'll use that for distribution. We use that for logistics. I appreciate Gov. [Greg] Abbott’s willingness to help us out with that land, because, again, it saves the taxpayers a lot of money by doing that.' Trump ‘border czar’ willing to ‘jail’ Denver mayor over deportation position Q: You’ve talked tough on illegal immigration. You've got the resume to back it up. Will the deportations be at the scale that Trump has expressed — what he promised along the campaign trail — and will military members be used to carry them out? 'Look, I there's a lot of pushback. I hear from, you know, mass deportation people saying, ‘Well, that's radical. It's racist. It's un-American.’ It's just ridiculous at the end of the historic, historic illegal immigration where millions of people enter this country illegally, and based on immigration court data over the last 10 years, nearly nine out of 10 of these people will end up with an order of removal because they simply don't qualify for asylum. What they did is commit asylum fraud. So, when you have millions of people coming across the border, nine out of 10 will get an order of removal for an immigration judge. Of course, there has to be a historic deportation operation, because we have no other option. If the court order doesn't mean anything, if the judge order doesn't mean anything, then what are we doing? You might as well just shut down immigration court. Might as well just forget about due process. You might just take the border patrol off the border. There's no consequences. If you want to claim asylum, if you want to see a judge, we'll make that possible. But the end of that, if you’re order removed, that's what has to happen. Because if it doesn't happen, we're sending a message to the entire world: You can cross the border illegally, which is a crime, you can be released United States, either go to court or not show up in court and get an order removal, and we're not going to remove you. The whole world is going to come to this country.' Tom Homan, Trump’s new border leader, tours border Q: You say you're not just going to turn off the faucet, turn off the fire hose, but carry out these deportations for the criminals first. But if you're an illegal immigrant here, that's breaking the law to begin with. So, does that put everybody in the same category, or could it? I wouldn’t say same category. The president has been very clear, so have I, that right out of the gate, we're going to concentrate on public safety threats and national security threats. And we got plenty of them. Because if you look at the stats, you compare the Trump administration to the Biden administration, the removal of criminal aliens has decreased 74%. We know a lot of criminals came across this border in the last four years. We’ve got a big block of criminal aliens we got to locate and remove from the country, and that's why I've been pushing back on the sanctuary cities and the mayors and governors who are speaking out against it. I cannot believe, as an elected mayor or elected governor, you do not want public safety threats out of your community. Well, if you don't just get out of the way because ICE will do it for you, but I would think it would be a nonpartisan issue to remove public safety threat to the community. But getting back to your point, if you're in a country illegally, you're not off the table. It's not okay to be in this country legally. You enter the country illegally, which is a crime. You've been ordered removed by a judge, you got a problem.' Mass deportations could hinder US agriculture Q: You say, get out of the way, ICE will take care of it for you. So, we've got the Denver Mayor Mike Johnston saying they're prepared for the worst. Would it? Would it come to you guys, getting them out of the way? When you say that, what does that mean? Exactly? 'Well, I've been very clear, if they don't want to help, fine, don't help. I find incredible you don't want to help remove public safety threats, but if you don't want to help, I've given warning. Do not impede us. Do not knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien from ICE authorities, because that is a crime, and we'll prosecute those crimes. When I was an agent, many years ago, I prosecuted US citizens for harboring illegal alien their home, harboring an illegal alien their place of employment. I got no problem, you know, prosecuting others who want to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. And I'm hoping they don't do that. I'm hoping a lot of this is just rhetoric … They don't want ICE in their neighborhoods, but understand that their actions are going to result in exactly that. If they would let me in their jails, the sanctuary city jails — we're not even given access —let me in your jail so I can arrest the bad guy, the guy you already locked in a jail cell. That means less officers in your neighborhood, because if you don't let me in your jail and you release this guy, the bad guy, we're going to go into neighborhood and find him with a whole team of people, and we're probably going to find others, others that weren't even on a radar, and they're going to go too. So, more agents in the jail means less agents in your neighborhood. So, fighting against ICE, not letting them in the jail, is going to give you the exact same results you don't want. So, I would think they’d to sit at the table and work with us on this.' Rand Paul: Denver mayor could be removed over deportation resistance Q: Let's go ahead and take a look at this headline from USA Today. It says 'Tom Homan vs. Stephen Miller: Who will decide Trump's mass deportation agenda' So, I guess Miller has a bit more of an aggressive approach. Which method do you think the administration is going to go with, yours or his? Or somewhere in the middle? Are you working together? Look, I don't believe half the stuff I read in the media, because they take things. They've exaggerated things I've said, they don't include things I've actually said. Steve Miller is a smart guy. He was the architect of many of Trump's first policies in the first administration that were proven effective. It was a game changer. It was the most successful border security plan ever in the history of this nation. So. me and Steve Miller, we’re connected at the hip. We’ll we be working side by side, and we're on the same page. I guarantee that. Q: I imagine you probably seen this heartbreaking video captured this week of children abandoned at the border. I'm going to let our viewers take a look … How are you going to help these vulnerable asylum seekers? Well, thank God that child is alive, because in my career, I’ve held dead children, I’ve held dying children. I talked to little girls as young as nine that were raped by member of the criminal cartel. And that's why this thing, that's why securing the border so important. Securing the border saves lives. So, look, 31% of women that make that journey through the cartels, they're sexually assaulted. Under Joe Biden, you got almost 4,000 illegal aliens have died across that border. You got a quarter million Americans have died from fentanyl overdoses. Joe Biden's open border policies are killing Americans in record numbers, killing migrants in record numbers. When President Trump had illegal immigration down 83 to 90%. When 90% less people are coming, how many little girls like this weren't left on the border? How many, how many children didn't die across that river? How many women weren't sexually assaulted? How many Americans didn't die from fentanyl because the border was secure? How many women children weren't sex trafficking to United States President Trump's policies were humane. People want to call inhumane and racist, no, they weren't. His policies saved thousands of lives, and we're going to do it again. Trump’s mass deportation plans create anxiety among immigrants Securing the border saves lives. For the people who want to come to this border and claim asylum, you have right to do that. But we won't have the remain in Mexico program in place. You can wait in Mexico for your asylum hearing. And when we did that under Trump administration, that took about two months. They stopped coming because they knew they had a fraudulent asylum claim. They weren't willing to spend all their money, give it to the criminal cartels, just to wait in Mexico. If you really escaping fear and persecution from your homeland, you will wait in Mexico for your hearing. If you win your hearing, welcome to United States. If you don't, we don't have to look for you. Trump’s policies were the most effective policies of my career, and I started 1984 as a border patrol agent. We're going to go back to those policies and build upon them and finish the job we started. Q: What would you say to Americans who are no doubt going to be troubled seeing difficult imagery once these mass deportations start, and how bad is it going to get? I mean, family separations? Will that be prevalent? 'Well, we want to see the image. We're going to show the images on the Trump administration. We’ll be very transparent in what we're doing. I guarantee you the left side media is going to show a mother crying or child, they'll grab some image. But I want people to know. Go talk to the hundreds of angel moms and dads that I've spoken to, and heard their stories where they buried their children. It was a matter of separation. They buried their children because their children was killed by an illegal alien. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Talk to the talk to the parents of the quarter million kids, young men and women who died from fentanyl poisoning, from a poison China sells to Mexican cartels and pushes across this border. The Mexican cartels have killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in the world. That's why I'm saying secure borders save lives, and we can't secure the border if we don't run this deportation operation. We got to send a message to the whole world: Y ou can come to the greatest nation on Earth, but you got to do it legally, not illegally. Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime. When you overwhelm the system, like they have the last four years, that overwhelms the border patrol, where most border patrols are no longer on patrol, because we're taking care of this humanitarian crisis.' Canada braces for surge of immigrants hoping to move from US Q: It looks like there was sort of a case of, he said she said, with Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum reporting very different versions of a phone call that they had last week. Trump saying Mexico would agree to stop illegal immigration through Mexico, and she asserted that she had promised no major policy changes. What's with the different accounts here? 'I would think that President Mexico would do her job for the Mexican people. The cartels are running that country. A big part of that Mexican government, Mexican military are corrupt because the cartels pay them a lot of money. So, you know, they certainly don't want the gravy train to end. Bottom line is, it's against the law in Mexico to traffic in women and children, but they've been allowing it for years. It's against law Mexico for people from other country to transit to the country, to come to United States, but they've been allowing it. President Trump's asking to do the right thing for people. Like I just said, 4,000 migrants have died across the US-Mexican border in this administration. Isn't that meaningful to the president of Mexico? And that's not counting the thousands that die in Mexico, the thousands that are dying in the Darién Gap in Panama. This is about life and death. I would think the president of Mexico would do the right thing for the Mexican people, and that would be secure the border. We can have fair trade. We have a great relationship, but you can't let cross-border crime take over either nation. So, I'm hoping she'll do the right thing. If she doesn't, I guarantee you Trump will give consequences to Mexico like he's threatened before. He'll do it again and he'll put him in place.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-czar-tom-homan-deportations/	2024-12-01T14:17:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-961479070.jpg?w=900
The billionaires of Trump's proposed administration	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump is a money man, and the billionaire himself will lead a wealthy White House Cabinet should all of his nominations gain Senate approval. The President-elect has a net worth of $5.7 billion, as of Dec. 1, according to Forbes, and he has chosen a slew of fellow billionaires to serve in his second administration. His proposed Cabinet, with Senate confirmation, will include former professional wrestler and WWE co-founder Linda McMahon, Wall Street executive Howard Lutnick, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and hedge fund money manager Scott Bessent -- all billionaires. Donald Trump's new admin.: Who has he chosen so far? Their combined net worths total $10.7 billion, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report's calculations. That's $4.5 billion more than Trump's first-term Cabinet. In comparison, President Joe Biden's Cabinet total net worth was $118 million -- with an M. Trump also selected tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead his inaugural Department of Government Efficiency. These positions do not require Senate confirmation, but they raise the overall net worth of Trump's incoming administration to $344.4 billion.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/the-billionaires-of-trumps-proposed-administration/	2024-12-01T09:07:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Trump-jail_060624_Photo_getty.png?w=900
Heavy snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in a dee...	LOWVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in Buffalo. In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect snow off Lake Ontario can dump several feet of snow at a time, there was up to 46 inches (117 centimeters) in the Barnes Corners area. 'We just keep digging out,' Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said Sunday 'We were out all day yesterday, plowing.' Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck for much of the winter, 'and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a snowblower.' His advice? 'If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow down.' Mikaela Shiffrin suffers abdominal puncture wound in skiing crash In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and provide food and hot drinks. A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’ stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather Risk Communication Center in New York. 'Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over the stadium longer,' the center said in a post on the social media site X. A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy lake-effect snow has produced 'treacherous' conditions that are causing even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to clear city roads. The city estimated Sunday morning that there were 'about 100 cars throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of the way so plows can get through.' Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in western New York along a nearly 134-mile stretch to the Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday, with additional snowfall of 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimeters) possible. In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state to assist. 'I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle, but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy holiday weekend,' she said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more expected through Monday night. Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61 centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan. There were 27 inches (69 centimeters) of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 2 feet (61 centimeters) in Munising, in the eastern area. Lake-effect snow could add more than a foot (30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday. Gaylord, Michigan, received 24.8 inches (63 centimeters) of snow Friday, setting a new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous record of 17 inches (43 centimeters) was set March 9, 1942. The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80 acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809 hectares). It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort's season opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said. 'Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,' Hoeh said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/heavy-snow-and-numbing-temperatures-keep-parts-of-the-us-in-a-deep-freeze/	2024-12-01T08:24:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24336484174642.jpg?w=900
DACA recipients worry protection from deportation won't last anot...	PHOENIX (AP) — Reyna Montoya was 10 when she and her family fled violence in Tijuana and illegally immigrated to the U.S. Growing up in Arizona, she worried even a minor traffic violation could lead to her deportation. She didn't feel relief until 11 years later in 2012, when she received a letter confirming she had been accepted to a new program for immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. 'All of the sudden, all these possibilities opened up,' Montoya said, fighting back tears. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program granted her and hundreds of thousands of others two-year, renewable permits to live and work in the U.S. legally. But as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, after an unsuccessful bid to end DACA in his first term, the roughly 535,000 current recipients are bracing yet again for a whirlwind of uncertainty. Meanwhile, a years-long challenge to DACA could ultimately render it illegal, leaving people like Montoya without a shield from deportation. 'I have to take his (Trump's) words very seriously, that when they say ‘mass deportation,’ it also includes people like me,' said Montoya, who runs Aliento, an Arizona-based advocacy organization for immigrant rights. Uncertainty is nothing new for DACA recipients. As many matured from school age to adulthood, they have witnessed a barrage of legal threats to the program. DACA hasn't accepted new applicants since 2021, when a federal judge deemed it illegal and ordered that new applications not be processed, though current recipients could still renew their permits. The Biden administration appealed the ruling, and the case is currently pending. For those who secured and renewed DACA permits, the benefits have been life-changing. With DACA, Montoya for the first time was able to work legally, get health and dental care, and obtain a driver's license. Many recipients had hoped Vice President Kamala Harris would win the presidency and continue fighting for them. But the reelection of Trump, who has repeatedly accused immigrants of fueling violent crime and 'poisoning the blood' of the United States, has heightened their fears that DACA could end and they could face deportation. Out of caution, some are rushing to renew their permits, according to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which has been providing free legal aid to help them through the extensive process. Others are preparing for potential family separations. Phoenix native and DACA recipient Pedro Gonzalez-Aboyte said he and his immigrant parents, along with his two U.S.-born brothers, recently discussed the possibility of being split. Gonzalez-Aboyte recalled his parents, who immigrated from Mexico, saying that even if they were unable to stay in the country, 'as long as the three of you are here and you're OK, then that's what we want.' 'That was a very real conversation we had,' Gonzalez-Aboyte said. Officials for the Trump transition team did not respond to emailed requests for comment. While it is unclear how Trump could impact DACA this time, he has suggested scaling back other programs that offer temporary protection for immigrants and is staffing his incoming administration with immigration hardliners, including Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan. During his first term, Trump tried to rescind DACA. But in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded his administration ended the program improperly, though it didn't rule on the program's legality. But DACA's fate won’t be immediately left up to Trump, if at all. A three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — regarded as the country's most conservative appeals court — heard arguments in October concerning the legality of DACA. The case, initially filed by Texas and other Republican-led states in 2018, now focuses on a Biden administration rule intended to preserve and fortify DACA. Attorneys for DACA opponents argued that immigrants in the country illegally are a financial burden on states. Meanwhile, the Biden administration, along with intervenors, contend that Texas has not shown the costs it cites are traceable to the policy and, therefore, lacks standing. The panel doesn’t have a deadline to issue a ruling. Regardless, its ruling will likely be appealed, potentially elevating the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell University, said the most likely scenario is the panel affirming that DACA is illegal and that the case goes before the Supreme Court. He doesn't anticipate Trump immediately trying to end DACA but didn't rule out the possibility. 'I don't know that they could actually terminate the program any faster than the current ligation is going,' he said. 'They could still do it, but they've got an awful lot of immigration policy matters on their plate.'

DACA recipients worry protection from deportation won't last anot...	PHOENIX (AP) — Reyna Montoya was 10 when she and her family fled violence in Tijuana and illegally immigrated to the U.S. Growing up in Arizona, she worried even a minor traffic violation could lead to her deportation. She didn't feel relief until 11 years later in 2012, when she received a letter confirming she had been accepted to a new program for immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. 'All of the sudden, all these possibilities opened up,' Montoya said, fighting back tears. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program granted her and hundreds of thousands of others two-year, renewable permits to live and work in the U.S. legally. But as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, after an unsuccessful bid to end DACA in his first term, the roughly 535,000 current recipients are bracing yet again for a whirlwind of uncertainty. Meanwhile, a years-long challenge to DACA could ultimately render it illegal, leaving people like Montoya without a shield from deportation. 'I have to take his (Trump's) words very seriously, that when they say ‘mass deportation,’ it also includes people like me,' said Montoya, who runs Aliento, an Arizona-based advocacy organization for immigrant rights. Uncertainty is nothing new for DACA recipients. As many matured from school age to adulthood, they have witnessed a barrage of legal threats to the program. DACA hasn't accepted new applicants since 2021, when a federal judge deemed it illegal and ordered that new applications not be processed, though current recipients could still renew their permits. The Biden administration appealed the ruling, and the case is currently pending. For those who secured and renewed DACA permits, the benefits have been life-changing. With DACA, Montoya for the first time was able to work legally, get health and dental care, and obtain a driver's license. Many recipients had hoped Vice President Kamala Harris would win the presidency and continue fighting for them. But the reelection of Trump, who has repeatedly accused immigrants of fueling violent crime and 'poisoning the blood' of the United States, has heightened their fears that DACA could end and they could face deportation. Out of caution, some are rushing to renew their permits, according to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which has been providing free legal aid to help them through the extensive process. Others are preparing for potential family separations. Phoenix native and DACA recipient Pedro Gonzalez-Aboyte said he and his immigrant parents, along with his two U.S.-born brothers, recently discussed the possibility of being split. Gonzalez-Aboyte recalled his parents, who immigrated from Mexico, saying that even if they were unable to stay in the country, 'as long as the three of you are here and you're OK, then that's what we want.' 'That was a very real conversation we had,' Gonzalez-Aboyte said. Officials for the Trump transition team did not respond to emailed requests for comment. While it is unclear how Trump could impact DACA this time, he has suggested scaling back other programs that offer temporary protection for immigrants and is staffing his incoming administration with immigration hardliners, including Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan. During his first term, Trump tried to rescind DACA. But in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded his administration ended the program improperly, though it didn't rule on the program's legality. But DACA's fate won’t be immediately left up to Trump, if at all. A three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — regarded as the country's most conservative appeals court — heard arguments in October concerning the legality of DACA. The case, initially filed by Texas and other Republican-led states in 2018, now focuses on a Biden administration rule intended to preserve and fortify DACA. Attorneys for DACA opponents argued that immigrants in the country illegally are a financial burden on states. Meanwhile, the Biden administration, along with intervenors, contend that Texas has not shown the costs it cites are traceable to the policy and, therefore, lacks standing. The panel doesn’t have a deadline to issue a ruling. Regardless, its ruling will likely be appealed, potentially elevating the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell University, said the most likely scenario is the panel affirming that DACA is illegal and that the case goes before the Supreme Court. He doesn't anticipate Trump immediately trying to end DACA but didn't rule out the possibility. 'I don't know that they could actually terminate the program any faster than the current ligation is going,' he said. 'They could still do it, but they've got an awful lot of immigration policy matters on their plate.' Yale-Loehr said the Biden administration is limited in how it could help DACA recipients at this stage, but it could enable recipients to renew their permits early and process them as quickly as possible.

Israeli strikes hit southern Lebanon, but tense ceasefire holds	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli jets Sunday launched an airstrike over a southern Lebanese border village, while troops shelled other border towns and villages still under Israeli control, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. The attacks come days after a US-brokered ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike in the village of Yaroun, nor did the Hezbollah militant group. Israel continues to call on displaced Lebanese not to return to dozens of southern villages in this current stage of the ceasefire. It also continues to impose a daily curfew for people moving across the Litani River between 5 pm and 7 am. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and the Lebanese military have been critical of Israeli strikes and overflights since the ceasefire went into effect, accusing Israel of violating the agreement. The military said it had filed complaints, but no clear military action has been taken by Hezbollah in response, meaning that the tense cessation of hostilities has not yet broken down. When Israel has issued statements about these strikes, it says they were done to thwart possible Hezbollah attacks. The United States military announced Friday that Major General Jasper Jeffers alongside senior U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein will co-chair a new U.S.-led monitoring committee that includes France, the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL, Lebanon, and Israel. Hochstein led over a year of shuttle diplomacy to broker the ceasefire deal, and his role will be temporary until a permanent civilian co-chair is appointed. Lebanon meanwhile is trying to pick up the pieces and return to some level of normal life after the war that decimated large swaths of its south and east, displacing an estimated 1.2 million people. The Lebanese military said it detonated unexploded munitions left over from Israeli strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Elsewhere, the Lebanese Civil Defense said it removed five bodies from under the rubble in two southern Lebanese towns over the past 24 hours. The first phase of the ceasefire is a 60-day cessation of hostilities where Hezbollah militants are supposed to withdraw from southern Lebanon north of the Litani River and Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon into northern Israel. Lebanese troops are to deploy in large numbers in the south, effectively being the only armed force in control of the south alongside UNIFIL peacekeepers. But challenges still remain at this current stage. Many families who want to bury their dead deep in southern Lebanon are unable to do so at this point. The Lebanese Health Ministry and military allocated a plot of land in the coastal city of Tyre for those people to be temporarily laid to rest. Dr. Wissam Ghazal of the Health Ministry in Tyre said almost 200 bodies have been temporarily buried in that plot of land, until the situation near the border calms down. 'Until now, we haven’t been able to go to our village, and our hearts are burning because our martyrs are buried in this manner,' said Om Ali, who asked to be called by a nickname that means 'Ali’s mother' in Arabic. Her husband was a combatant killed in the war from the border town of Aita el-Shaab, just a stone’s throw from the tense border. 'We hope the crisis ends soon so we can go and bury them properly as soon as possible, because truly, leaving the entrusted ones buried in a non-permanent place like this is very difficult,' she said. In the meantime, cash-strapped Lebanon is trying to fundraise as much money as it can to help rebuild the country the war cost some $8.5 billion in damages and losses according to the World Bank, and to help recruit and train troops to deploy 10,000 personnel into southern Lebanon. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri also called for parliament to convene to elect a president next month to break a gridlock of over two years and reactivate the country's crippled state institutions. — Chehayeb reported from Beirut.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israeli-strikes-hit-southern-lebanon-but-tense-ceasefire-holds/	2024-12-01T07:53:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/674c87870e6557.88729908.jpeg?w=900
Hamas releases new hostage video of American-Israeli Edan Alexand...	(NewsNation) — The parents of Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas for 421 days, are urging immediate action to secure the release of their son and other captives. Hamas released a propaganda video Saturday showing 20-year-old Alexander alive, marking his first proof of life since being kidnapped during the Oct. 7 attack that killed over 1,000 Israelis. 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us,' Alexander said, mentioning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent $5 million offer for the hostages’ return. Edan's mother, Yael Alexander, told demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening she was shaking upon seeing her son: 'I didn't see Edan for 421 days and to suddenly see him alive, when he cried, I just wanted to hold him.' An Israeli strike in Gaza kills World Central Kitchen workers. Israel says 1 was an Oct. 7 attacker The family is calling on President-elect Donald Trump and President Joe Biden to work together to negotiate the hostages' release. They stressed the urgency, noting that 101 hostages remain in captivity. Edan Alexander, who volunteered for the Israel Defense Forces after high school in 2022, was serving near the Gaza border when captured. In the video, he pleads for Trump to use U.S. influence to bring the hostages home. The U.S. National Security Council condemned Hamas, stating the war in Gaza could end immediately if the terrorist group agreed to release the hostages. Currently, Hamas continues to hold several Americans, including Itay Chen, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Omer Neutra, Gadi Haggai, and Keith Segal. American Hersh Golberg Polin was killed during the initial attack. Netanyahu has spoken with the Alexander family, suggesting conditions are right to negotiate a hostage release. Mother hopes to be reunited with toddler found alone at border '(Netanyahu) reassured me and promised that now, after reaching an arrangement in Lebanon, conditions are right to free you all and bring you home,' Yael said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently returned from Israel, reported that Trump is determined to secure the hostages' freedom and supports a ceasefire that includes a hostage deal. Trump has stated he wants the hostages returned before his potential inauguration on Jan. 20, warning that 'Hamas will be paying a big price' if they are not released. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count but say over half the dead were women and children.

Top 5 education policies Trump may pursue his second term	President-elect Trump has big changes coming for the education world in his second administration. While Trump’s education plans have not been fully laid out, the issues he wants to tackle would fundamentally change how schools operate, from potentially abolishing the Department of Education to advancing a federal school choice program. Here are the top five education policies Trump could enact: Abolishing the Department of Education The most talked about issue Trump has pushed in the education field is abolishing the federal Department of Education. The move is championed by supporters who see the department as a waste of taxpayer money and argue other agencies can take on its essential tasks. While Trump has not said how he would eliminate Education, Project 2025, a conservative blueprint designed for him, lays out a plan striking what it sees as unnecessary programs and moving others such as the Office of Civil Rights to the Justice Department. Homeschooling on the rise after pandemic: Study Killing the department would require buy-in from Congress, which will be under complete Republican control next year. 'I think, making education truly local, and by truly local, I mean parents' is needed, said Vicki Murray, director of the Center for Education at Washington Policy Center and part of Trump's transition team back in 2016. 'Because there's nothing more local than an empowered parent. So, I think that is the underlying theme of President Elect Trump's education policy areas,' Murray added. Federal school choice Federal school choice legislation is a major possibility in the next four years, with Trump citing it as one of his Education secretary nominee's top priorities. Linda McMahon will 'fight tirelessly to expand ‘Choice’ to every State in America,' Trump said in his nomination announcement. The Educational Choice for Children Act, previously introduced in Congress but never signed into law, aims to incentivize donations to nonprofit organizations that provide K-12 scholarships that parents can use to send their children to private schools or other educational pathways besides public schools. The legislation was previously signed on to by Trump’s running mate, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. Parents fume over ‘peculiar’ Las Vegas charter school lesson plan Jeanne Allen, founder and CEO of the Center for Education reform, sees the possibility of Trump 'creating a federal program or creating more appetite and ease of funding for school choice programs.' Opponents of school choice fear the federal government will try to impose a mandate on states that don't support the movement. 'We are definitely worried about how the incoming administration may push privatization at the federal level. Whether there will be any compelling states to have voucher programs is also something that we are monitoring,' said Qubilah Huddleston, the manager of Ed Trust’s policy positions on equitable school funding. Student loans Trump has made no specific promises on how he will handle student loan debt, but he has been openly critical of President Biden's efforts on the issue, signaling an end to relief. Biden forgave the most student debt in presidential history, at more than $170 billion. The president also created a new income-drive repayment plan called SAVE that has so far held up in the courts. The Department of Education is also currently going through the negotiated rulemaking process to forgive even more student loans for people in certain situations such as financial hardship. Trump could pull out of both of these initiatives, a likely scenario considering Republican lawsuits against them. In his first term, Trump wanted to phase out the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and limit borrower defense, but did not have support from Congress. 'I think student loans [...] should come under a lot more scrutiny, and I think that's a welcome area of inquiry and a long overdue debate. But the idea of free student loans, student loan forgiveness for some, but not for all, is not the correct policy path at all,' Murray said. Title IX and transgender students Trump has made it clear he will be making changes to Title IX and how transgender students are treated in schools. The president-elect wants to change Biden’s Title IX revisions that gave discrimination protections based on a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. He called the change a 'day one' priority. 'The left-wing gender insanity being pushed at our children is an act of child abuse. Very simple. Here’s my plan to stop the chemical, physical and emotional mutilation of our youth,' Trump said in a video back in January. He has also been open about his desire to ban transgender Americans from the sports teams and locker rooms they choose to use. He has 'been very vocal about withholding federal funds for colleges that have DEI policies and programs where biological males are allowed to compete in women's sports and be in women's locker rooms,' Murray said.

'Rather than indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual and political material, which is what we’re doing now, our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world,' Trump said in a September video. For K-12 schools, Trump has said teaching of critical race theory would result in funds taken away, although only a small fraction of funding for schools comes through the federal government. 'There's been a lot of controversy about politicization in the curriculum and in children's classrooms, whether that's Critical Race Theory, diversity equity, inclusion policies, failing to inform parents about their children's health decisions,' Murray said. 'We have to be very careful of that.' Federal money can have more sway at the college level, and Trump has threatened that cash over DEI programs, which some Republican-controlled states such as Florida have outlawed for state universities. The president-elect said he would 'tax endowments, impose budget reconciliation, and fine institutions ‘up to the entire amount of their endowment’ if they are perceived as having promoted ‘wokeism,’ [which] risks eroding academic freedom, institutional autonomy and the democratic purposes of higher education,' said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/trump-education-policies-dei/	2024-11-30T12:21:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Education-5-things_112824_AP_Alex-Brandon.png?w=900
Israeli strike in Gaza kills World Central Kitchen workers. Israe...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people including employees of World Central Kitchen, and the charity said it was 'urgently seeking more details' after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war. WCK said it was 'heartbroken' by the airstrike and that it had no knowledge anyone in the car had alleged ties to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, saying it was 'working with incomplete information.' It said it was pausing operations in Gaza. The charity's work in Gaza was temporarily suspended earlier this year after an Israeli strike killed seven of its workers, most of them foreigners. The Israeli military in a statement said the alleged Oct. 7 attacker had taken part in the assault on the kibbutz of Nir Oz, and it asked 'senior officials from the international community and the WCK administration to clarify' how he had come to work for the charity. The violence in Gaza raged even as a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appeared to hold, despite sporadic episodes that have tested its fragility. The strike on the vehicle highlighted what aid agencies call the dangerous work of delivering aid in Gaza, where the war has displaced much of the 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger. Palestinian health official Muneer Alboursh confirmed the strike. At Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, a woman held up an employee badge bearing the WCK logo, the word 'contractor' and the name of a man said to have been killed. Belongings — burned phones, a watch and stickers with the WCK logo — lay on the hospital floor. Nazmi Ahmed said his nephew worked for WCK for the past year. He said he was driving to the charity's kitchens and warehouses. 'Today, he went out as usual to work ... and was targeted without prior warning and without any reason,' Ahmed said. In April, a strike on a WCK aid convoy killed seven workers — three British citizens, Polish and Australian nationals, a Canadian-American dual national and a Palestinian. The Israeli military called the strike a mistake. That strike prompted an international outcry and the brief suspension of aid to Gaza by several groups, including WCK. Another Palestinian WCK worker was killed in August by shrapnel from an Israeli airstrike, the group said. Another Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a car near a food distribution point in Khan Younis, killing 13 people including children. Nasser hospital in Khan Younis received the bodies. 'They were distributing aid, vegetables, and we saw the missile landing,' said witness Rami Al-Sori. A woman sat on the ground and wept. Ceasefire appears to hold Efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have faltered repeatedly. But the U.S.- and France-brokered deal for Lebanon appears to be holding after it took effect on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel's military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities, Hezbollah or activists monitoring the conflict there. Israeli aircraft have struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, citing violations, several times since the truce. The Israeli strike in Syria came as insurgents breached the country's largest city, Aleppo, in a shock offensive that brought fresh uncertainty to the region. The truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah calls for an initial two-month ceasefire in which the militants are to withdraw north of Lebanon's Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. Many Lebanese, some of the 1.2 million displaced, streamed south to their homes, despite warnings by the Israeli and Lebanese militaries to stay away from certain areas. 'Day by day, we will return to our normal lives,' said Mustafa Badawi, a cafe owner in Tyre. The toll of conflicts Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said an Israeli drone strike on the village of Rub Thalatheen killed two people and wounded two others. It said another strike hit a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun, and Lebanon’s Health Ministry said three were wounded, including a 7-year-old. Israel's military said it had been operating to distance 'suspects' in the region, without elaborating. Israel says it reserves the right to strike against any perceived violations. Israel has made returning the tens of thousands of displaced Israelis home the goal of the war. But Israelis have been apprehensive about returning. 'No, it will not be like before,' said one Israeli evacuee, Lavie Eini. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas and its assault on southern Israel. Israel and Hezbollah kept up cross-border fire for nearly a year until Israel escalated with an attack that detonated hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. It then launched an intense aerial bombardment campaign that killed Hezbollah leaders including Hassan Nasrallah, and launched a ground invasion in early October. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. Hamas’ October 2023 attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. On Saturday, Hamas released a video of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander. Speaking under duress, Alexander referred to being held for 420 days and mentioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent $5 million offer for the hostages' return. 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us,' Alexander said. Netanyahu's office said the prime minister spoke with Alexander's family after the release of the 'brutal psychological warfare video' that held 'an important and exciting sign of life.' Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count but say over half the dead were women and children. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel, and Mroue reported from Beirut.

Trump may rely on acting secretaries if nominees fail to muster G...	President-elect Trump may need to rely on acting secretaries to fill out his Cabinet as a number of key nominations draw significant concern from key GOP senators. When Senate confirmations are in limbo, especially if there is pushback from lawmakers, presidents can slip nominees into acting roles for at least 210 days. Trump did so across more than 20 Cabinet-level jobs in his first term. Trump’s picks like Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for Health and Human Services secretary, among others, are sure to face some opposition from Senate Republicans. Hegseth, Kennedy, and Linda McMahon, the president-elect’s pick for Education secretary, all are expected to field questions from senators over allegations of sexual misconduct or enabling sexual abuse. Trump’s original pick for attorney general, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), dropped out of the confirmation process just over a week after being named amid allegations of having sex with minors, which he has denied. Senators will question other nominees, like Gabbard, over if they’re qualified for the role or have any conflicts of interests. By February 2020, acting secretaries under the Trump administration served a total of 2,736 combined days, across 22 Cabinet-level jobs, according to a Washington Post analysis. During his first four years in office, Trump had acting officials serve more than three times as much as former President Obama had during his eight years in office. Under Obama, there were 2,202 combined days in which acting officials served. 'I could foresee a situation where he definitely does that, given that he has a record of doing it.' one former Trump administration official said. 'I mean, Chad Wolf was there for how long?' The official was referring to Wolf’s extended stint as acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which lasted 14 months. Some lawmakers pointed in his direction as a prime example of why they are worried at the prospect of acting officials taking the helm of some departments and agencies b because Wolf was unable to carry out parts of Trump’s immigration plans. A federal judge in late 2020 invalidated his decision to limit work permits via the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for migrants illegally brought to the U.S. when they were children because Wolf did not have the legal authority to make such a move as acting secretary, rather than being confirmed by the Senate. 'Always a concern for that now,' one Senate Republican told The Hill. 'Biden had several acting, [and] acting cannot make some decisions.' The most glaring example of Trump’s penchant for relying on acting heads centered around the Office of Management and Budget where Russell Vought served as acting director for a year and a half before winning full Senate confirmation. He served in that role while then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney took on the role of acting White House chief of staff. Trump also relied on acting secretaries for sizable stretches elsewhere in his Cabinet. Patrick Shanahan became the longest-serving acting head of the Pentagon with his six-month tenure. Some took on big tasks, like Trump’s last acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller who made a trip to Afghanistan in December 2020 while the Trump administration was working to reduce the U.S. military forces in the country following Trump’s election defeat that year. Former Environmental Protection Agency Administer Andrew Wheeler eventually won full confirmation to lead the agency, but not before having the acting label attached for eight months. However, sources are indicating that Trump world and the transition team is more prepared for this go-around and not moving as haphazardly as 2017. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, said that the plan currently involves stacking departments and agencies to ensure that those underneath a potential acting secretary can keep them up and running effectively. 'You’re going to see people that may be entering an agency that hasn’t been there before, but the deputy secretary is going to be more experienced [and] more seasoned,' Mullin said. 'That’s why you’re going to see it stacked.' Acting roles fall under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which means they are subject to its time limitations and can only run an agency for so long before needing Senate confirmation. Once a vacancy occurs, an acting official is able to serve for 210 days — or nearly seven months — in the role, with that timeline potentially expanding depending on the fate of a Senate confirmation process. If a nominee is rejected, the acting official may serve in the role for an additional 210 days, with the clock resetting while another nominee is under consideration. President Biden’s acting labor secretary Julie Su, who was serving as deputy secretary before former Secretary Marty Walsh left the top post, was unable to win full Senate confirmation to succeed Walsh after moderate lawmakers refused to back her nomination, which also garnered universal GOP opposition. This has left her in her current posture throughout the remainder of the Biden administration. She has been able to serve as acting secretary indefinitely though because she was already confirmed by the Senate for her role as deputy secretary, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said last year. Despite his history, some predict Trump won’t rely on acting secretaries, given the GOP-control of the Senate by a three-vote margin. 'Presidents have generally only resorted to recess appointments and acting leaders after their own party has lost control of the Senate and they’re politically stuck,' said Bruce Mehlman, a GOP lobbyist and former official under President George W. Bush. 'I suspect president-elect Trump intends to get his nominees confirmed by the GOP Senate.' On top of that, selecting nominees that are sure to face tough confirmation fights brings their own challenges to the overall administration and can serve as a distraction from other top properties of the incoming president. A second former administration official during Trump’s first term warned that spending political capital to help controversial nominees puts the Trump agenda at risk. 'This is also related to the apparent bad decision to kick 2025 appropriations until next year with a CR. This will further complicate the confirmation process and take time and energy away from President Trump’s real agenda,' the second ex-official said. 'As in combat, conservation of resources should be a top concern.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/trump-may-rely-on-acting-secretaries-if-nominees-fail-to-muster-gop-support/	2024-11-30T07:07:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Acting_113024_AP_Evan-Vucci.png?w=900
Trump tariffs threaten to crack open North American economies	MEXICO CITY — President-elect Trump’s pledge to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada threatens to upend decades of North American integration, a bumpy process that’s recast the two U.S. neighbors as providers of raw and finished goods for the world’s biggest economy. In some ways, Canada and Mexico have traded places over the past three decades. Before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico was a mid-tier petrostate without a competitive industrial base. Now, its economy is dependent mostly on manufacturing, tourism, agricultural exports and cash sent home by Mexicans abroad. Meanwhile, Canada went from a small but advanced manufacturing economy to an oil and gas giant, funneling massive amounts of hydrocarbons to the United States. Those transformations have both taken place to fit neatly into the U.S. economy’s larger needs. But that three-way integration is facing headwinds, not least from Trump, who on Monday threatened United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) partners with 25 percent across-the-board tariffs on day one of his presidency in retaliation for their roles in migration and the illicit fentanyl trade. 'Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!' Trump posted on Truth Social. At risk, beyond the harmony of North American diplomatic relations, are the fundamentals of the continent’s manufacturing base. 'The value chains — the value chains have been designed around the context of integration,' said Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico’s former secretary of Economy and lead negotiator on the USMCA Value chains or supply chains — producing and assembling parts throughout the continent before putting them into a final product — have become a key competitive advantage for North American industry writ large, and the raison d’être for a broad segment of Mexican industry. Those chains only exist in Mexico thanks to massive infrastructure investments, ranging from road and rail connections to gas pipelines to industrial parks that can cover nearly 10,000 acres. And the value chains extend beyond automotive or TV manufacturers. For example, the gas pipelines in Mexico are pumping U.S. natural gas. Overall U.S. exports of the hydrocarbon, including pipeline exports and liquefied natural gas exports on ships, have ballooned since 2014, when the United States sold 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas abroad, to 7.6 trillion cubic feet in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Pipeline exports go exclusively to Canada and Mexico. In 2014, Canadian imports began to plateau at around a trillion yearly cubic feet of gas, and Mexican pipeline imports took off, reaching 2.24 trillion cubic feet in 2023, according to EIA. Though energy and manufacturing are by far the biggest segments in North American trade, food supplies have also gone through a massive transformation, opening markets for U.S. grain and Mexican produce that have boosted rural areas in both countries. 'These are American farmers’ three largest export markets,' said Farmers for Free Trade Board President Bob Hemesath, an Iowa corn, soybean and hog farmer, referring to Canada, China and Mexico. 'America exported $84.7 billion in food and ag to these three countries alone last year, constituting nearly half of all food and ag exports. Mexico and Canada also have been partners in USMCA and NAFTA, agreements that have grown U.S. ag exports to those countries by nearly 300 percent,' Hemesath added. 'We don’t yet know exactly what action President Trump will take when he enters office. But we do know that a renewed trade war will hurt American farmers. A trade war will mean retaliatory tariffs, lost ag trade markets, a leg up for farm exporters in South America and elsewhere, and billions in lost exports.' Trump, who opposed NAFTA, has in the past threatened to blow up the economic integration that resulted from the 1994 deal. He forced the negotiation of USMCA to replace NAFTA during his first term, and though the two deals had many similarities, at the USMCA signing ceremony he declared the end of 'the NAFTA nightmare' and called the new agreement a 'truly fair and reciprocal trade deal that will keep jobs, wealth and growth right here in America.' Renewed attacks against USMCA are frustrating for some of NAFTA and USMCA’s defenders, most of whom were not pining for a renegotiation of the original deal in 2017. 'Well, basically, what it loses is credibility. Because, as you remember, this agreement was negotiated by the Trump administration, and when a country is not backing its words, in this case, negotiated by the incoming president, well, the first thing you lose is credibility,' Guajardo said. 'Who is going to believe you next time you give your word to an agreement, regardless of the nature of the agreement?' That broader concern, with greater geopolitical considerations, is making some observers weary. 'Violating the terms of our own agreements only ruins our reputation and loses everyone's trust in the USA. And making our mutual defense alliances ‘pay as you go’ Mafia-style protection rackets will not help,' said a former U.S. trade negotiator who asked for anonymity to speak frankly. But there’s a broad recognition that the instability is a feature, not a bug, of Trump’s diplomatic style. Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) of Laredo, a vocal proponent of U.S.-Mexico trade, told NewsNation’s Blake Burman on 'The Hill' that Trump will at the very least get Mexico’s attention with the threats. 'Well, let me put it this way: Laredo’s the largest port; we handle 40 percent of all the trade between the U.S. and Mexico. I know this is a way to negotiate, get some leverage. I know that Mexico will come to the table,' said Cuellar. 'But nobody wants a 25 percent tariff on them, and the Mexicans are threatening to do the same thing, and we don’t wanna get into that.' In 2019, Trump successfully leveraged tariff threats against former Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to force Mexico to enhance its internal immigration enforcement. President Claudia Sheinbaum, López Obrador’s successor and protégé, responded to the renewed threats with a letter raising other grievances, including U.S. illicit gun exports and drug consumption, and vowing tit-for-tat tariffs on U.S. goods. Mexico is the biggest importer of U.S. goods, including energy products such as natural gas. 'President Trump, migration and drug consumption in the United States cannot be addressed through threats or tariffs. What is needed is cooperation and mutual understanding to tackle these significant challenges,' wrote Sheinbaum. 'For every tariff, there will be a response in kind, until we put at risk our shared enterprises. Yes, shared. For instance, among Mexico’s main exporters to the United States are General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford Motor Company, which arrived in Mexico 80 years ago. Why impose a tariff that would jeopardize them? Such a measure would be unacceptable and would lead to inflation and job losses in both the United States and Mexico.' Sheinbaum’s U.S.-Mexico vision — excluding Canada — was a mirror image of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s own reaction, touting U.S.-Canada relations and subtly taking digs at Mexico. Trudeau also reportedly met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday. 'Trump is always using divide and conquer-type techniques. At some point, I believe that that should be a well understood by the other two parties, it is a boat that we're all sharing. There are a lot of Canadian companies in Mexico,' Guajardo said. 'Canada has a lot to lose if Mexico is not in the agreement.' 'So regardless of political rhetoric, that is arising by the next elections in Canada, I think that at the end, most corporate Canadians and Mexico will have to look at this, as we did in the first negotiation,' he added. That bet that cooler heads will prevail also hinges on the incoming Trump administration’s appetite for risk. There is broad agreement among economists that a trade war with Canada and Mexico would raise prices for American consumers, but both countries’ relationships with the United States are asymmetrical, meaning they each stand to lose much more than Trump. And part of Canada’s argument against Mexico — that the Latin American country has a much more extensive trade relationship with China — could backfire, giving Mexico leverage in bilateral negotiations to say it will have no choice but to further expand those ties. Yet even that leverage would likely prove insufficient in the face of a Trump administration willing to tank North American integration. 'Mexico could probably negotiate a bilateral agreement or perhaps sectoral accords with the USA under new and most likely disadvantageous and asymmetric conditions,' said Victor Arriaga, a former Mexican diplomat and editor of a daily newsletter in Mexico on U.S. politics. 'China is no substitute for USMCA; in terms of costs and chain supplies, the U.S. market would still remain attractive. Access to the U.S. market of goods produced in Mexico with Chinese technology would eventually face difficulties. Historically, Mexico’s attempts to diversify trade partners have had limited success.' But consequences for the United States, even if commercially advantageous, could generate global shockwaves. 'When the U.K. left the EU it only screwed itself, but if we leave the USMCA and NATO and all our other alliances, it will screw the world,' said the former U.S. trade negotiator.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-threaten-to-crack-open-north-american-economies/	2024-11-30T06:51:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/riffs-Mex.Can_113024_AP_Evan-Vucci_2e752b.png?w=900
New York state and Michigan brace for lake-effect snow that could...	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The first big snow of the season threatened to bury towns in New York along lakes Erie and Ontario during a hectic holiday travel and shopping weekend. In Michigan, heavy lake-effect snow in northern parts of the state was expected to continue into the weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Gaylord. Some areas of the Upper Peninsula could see up to 3 feet (0.9 meters) of snow Sunday night through to Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Lily Chapman said. As flakes began flying Friday, New York state forecasters warned 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) of blowing and drifting snow could fall in Watertown and other areas east of Lake Ontario through Monday. After an unusually mild fall, as much as 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) of snow were possible along Lake Erie and south of Buffalo from lake-effect bands notorious for pummeling the region with snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) per hour. Lake-effect snow happens when warm moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. 'The lake is 50 degrees (10 degrees Celsius). We’re about six degrees above where we should be this time of year, that’s why we’re seeing these heavy lake-effect events,' Erie County Public Works Commissioner William Geary said. 'The outlook for the next two weeks into December, we’ll probably see some more.' New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a disaster emergency for the targeted counties, allowing state agencies to mobilize resources. Rapidly deteriorating conditions Friday caused closures along Interstate 90, and tandem and commercial vehicles were banned from Interstate 86 in western New York and much of U.S. Route 219 beginning Friday afternoon. 'There’s a considerable number of vehicles going off the road on the 219 currently,' Gregory Butcher, Erie County deputy director for preparedness and homeland security, said at an afternoon briefing. ATVs and snowmobiles were being placed around the county to help first responders if necessary, Butcher said. The Buffalo Bills called for volunteers to potentially shovel snow at Highmark Stadium, where over 2 feet (0.6 meters) of snow was possible before Sunday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers. Last year, a major lake-effect storm forced the NFL to push back the Bills wild-card playoff home game against Pittsburgh from Sunday to Monday. 'It’s going to be slow going, there’s no doubt about that,' Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said, adding the heaviest snow is expected to be over by kickoff. The team, meanwhile, was preparing to play in any conditions. 'We’re trying to stay on top of it,' coach Sean McDermott said Friday. The Bills are 9-2, their best start since 1992, and with a win Sunday they would clinch their fifth straight AFC East title. Lake-effect snow also covered parts of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in a system that is expected to last through the weekend. The area was blanketed in snow by Friday afternoon, with some places already measuring more than a foot (0.3 meters) of snow. 'We’ve got this westerly, northwesterly flow regime and this chilly air mass over the U.P.,' said Chapman of the National Weather Service. 'So it’s a pretty good setup for this long duration lake-effect snowfall event.' Gusty winds, especially near the Great Lakes, has impacted visibility in Michigan and Chapman urged caution on the roads. Joe DeLizio, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Gaylord, said visibility on roads was low but he hadn’t been made aware of any major accidents so far. 'Haven’t heard too much as far as problems, but obviously travel is pretty difficult,' DeLizio said. ___ AP Sports Writer John Wawrow contributed from Orchard Park, New York.

2 Tren de Aragua members tied to viral Aurora video arrested in N...	(NewsNation) — Two Tren de Aragua gang members tied to a viral video showing armed men at an Aurora, Colorado apartment complex were arrested in New York City this week, law enforcement sources confirmed to NewsNation. Danyeer Aramillo Meneses, 23, and Edilson Pena Angulo, 25 — members of the notorious Venezuelan street gang — were taken into federal custody during a Tuesday night raid, sources told NewsNation. Both men were in the U.S. illegally, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesperson said in a statement. Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua now in 16 states: Report The two Tren de Aragua members were allegedly among the armed men seen in a viral security camera video that garnered international attention. In the video, men can be seen walking up a stairwell carrying weapons at an Aurora apartment complex. Pena and Aramillo were also suspected of being involved in an Aug. 18 shooting in Aurora. Both men were charged with two felonies, first-degree burglary and menacing with a firearm, in the Aurora case but hadn't been arrested until now. Tren de Aragua's footprint increasing in the US How they got to New York City or when they arrived is unclear. Sources told NewsNation that the two are in federal custody but their federal indictments remain under seal so it remains to be seen what new charges they could be facing. U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) originally encountered Pena in El, Paso, Texas on April 29, 2023, after he entered the country illegally. USBP issued him a notice to appear and released him on his own recognizance, according to the ICE spokesperson. He was later arrested in Colorado on local charges. An immigration judge ordered Pena removed to Venezuela on Feb. 23, 2024, after he didn't appear in court, the spokesperson said. USBP encountered Aramillo on Sept. 10, 2023, in El Paso, Texas after he entered the United States illegally. He was issued a notice to appear and released. The Aurora Police Department issued an arrest warrant for Aramillo on local charges on Aug. 19, the ICE spokesperson said. Both men are now in ICE custody pending criminal and immigration proceedings. Tuesday's raid was carried out by an NYPD gang task force in coordination with federal agents. The latest arrests are part of an ongoing crackdown by law enforcement as the Venezuelan gang continues to expand its foothold in the United States. Tren de Aragua is one of the fastest-growing transnational criminal organizations and the gang has reportedly established itself in 16 U.S. states. Earlier this month, Jose Ibarra, a Tren de Aragua member, was sentenced to life without parole in the death of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/tren-de-aragua-members-arrested/	2024-11-29T13:44:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/190B0DADE97D5D1AF956F5E9190B77D7.jpg?w=900

10-year-old found alone at US-Mexico border on Thanksgiving	(NewsNation) — Texas State Troopers rescued a 10-year-old boy after he crossed the U.S.-Mexico border on Thanksgiving Day. The boy, from El Salvador, was ditched by smugglers and left crying in a remote area, unaware if he was in the U.S. or Mexico. The boy said his mother was already in the U.S. and was turned over to Customs and Border Patrol. The only thing the boy had on him was a phone, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. US faith-based missionaries build homes for Mexican poor south of the border 'As many of us are celebrating Thanksgiving with our families &amp; friends. Let’s not forget many children will not get to enjoy the holidays or see their families because they have been placed in a dire situation due to open border conditions, and many more who are trafficked across the southern border are exploited and exposed to a dangerous criminal environment during their journey to the US,' Texas DPS spokesperson Chris Olivarez, said on X, formerly Twitter. Earlier this week, Texas DPS troopers encountered a 4-year-old girl who was also smuggled across the border in Maverick County. She too was alone without her parents. She was carrying only a scrap of paper with a phone number and the name 'Mama Patty.' NewsNation’s Jorge Ventura was able to make contact with a woman in South Carolina who claimed to be the girl’s mother. She said she paid a smuggler $4,500 in Honduras to bring her daughter across the U.S.-Mexico border.

Notre Dame Cathedral's 5-year rebuild post-fire: timeline	(NewsNation) — The Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris is set to reopen to visitors beginning Dec. 8, more than five years after an accidental fire destroyed the roof's iconic 12th-century spires and interior. Visited by more than 12 million people a year before the fire, the Notre Dame Cathedral had not had major repairs since the mid-1800s, according to the nonprofit Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris. Reconstruction began in 2022 after a two-year 'safety phase' to get the monument stable enough for workers. The restoration project raised $1 billion in pledged donations, with around $148 million remaining for future preservation, as of this month. Here's a timeline of the repairs to restore the 861-year-old Gotchic-era landmark to its beauty. Fire breaks out at Notre Dame Cathedral TOPSHOT - Smoke billows as flames burn through the roof of the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral on April 15, 2019, in the French capital Paris. A huge fire swept through the roof of the famed Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris on April 15, 2019, sending flames and huge clouds of grey smoke billowing into the sky. The flames and smoke plumed from the spire and roof of the gothic cathedral, visited by millions of people a year. A spokesman for the cathedral told AFP that the wooden structure supporting the roof was being gutted by the blaze. (Photo by Fabien Barrau / AFP) (Photo by FABIEN BARRAU/AFP via Getty Images) April 15, 2019: A fire erupted in the upper part of the cathedral, causing extensive damage to the wooden roof, upper walls and wooden spires. Many of the art and religious artifacts were moved to safety, though some suffered smoke damage. Officials at the time said the exact cause of the fire was unknown, but they believed either a short electrical circuit or a cigarette could have sparked the flames. Its stained-glass windows were spared, and no one died. April 17, 2019: French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to have the site rebuilt in five years, the Associated Press reported.

A team of scaffolders, rope technicians, aerial platform workers and crane operators worked to remove the wooden spire at the top of the building, which weighed 200 tons and dangled over 300 feet high, threatening to collapse into the cathedral. Then, workers had to build a scaffolding structure inside to protect the vaults and supportive framework. This $197 million safety phase also included installing tarps above the vaults to protect them from rain and lead decontamination as well as wrapping and protecting gargoyles.

BUY NOW Who has the best Apple Black Friday deals? Amazon usually offers the most reliable Black Friday deals, followed by other big retailers like Best Buy. Don’t forget cellphone providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, who may have deep discounts not just on iPhones but also iPads, Apple Watches and accessories. Apple itself isn’t known for major discounts on its website or at the Apple Store, but you might get an Apple gift card with your purchase. Which Apple products have the biggest discounts on Black Friday? Apple’s iPads are probably the most likely to receive big discounts this Black Friday, as Apple wants to move inventory, especially of its older iPad Mini, Air and Pro models. We’re also likely to see discounts on previous models of Apple Watches, especially the Apple Watch 8 and Ultra first-generation, since the Series 9 and Ultra 2 just came out. MacBook Air laptops are also looking good for discounts this shopping season. Don’t look for iPhones to go on sale, at least not from the big-box retailers. Instead, check your cellular provider. That said, older models reduce in price when new lines are released, which makes them better deals right now. How to find the best deals on Apple products We’ll be updating this page frequently throughout the Black Friday shopping event. For more Black Friday Apple deals, check Mac blogs and Apple news sites, which often have their own sections dedicated to Apple discounts, as well as couponing and smart shopping sites.

Amazon workers on strike from Black Friday to Cyber Monday	(WFXR) - Amazons workers across 20 countries, including the United States, are striking against what the organizing labor union calls anti-worker and anti-democratic practices. This is the fifth year UNI Global Union has spearheaded the 'Make Amazon Pay' movement with the aim to hold Amazon accountable for 'labor abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy.' US consumer price increases accelerated last month with inflation pressures resilient 'Bezos’s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers’ desire for justice – for union representation – can’t be stopped,' Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union, said. 'We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all. Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said the group is misleading and promotes a false narrative. 'The fact is at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities—all from day one. We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world, and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings,' Hards said. According to UNI, demonstrations are expected in major cities in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/amazon-workers-strike-black-friday-cyber-monday/	2024-11-28T14:44:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/2024-11-21T101736Z_1494844242_MT1PRA78274840_RTRMADP_3_PA-IMAGES.jpg?w=900
Northeast hit with rain, snow amid Thanksgiving Day festivities	The U.S. Northeast has been hit with a winter storm that has brought rain and snow amid Thanksgiving Day festivities and disrupted travel plans for those moving around on the holiday. A 'dynamic mid-latitude cyclone' is spreading scattered showers and thunderstorms onto the East Coast on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Moderate to heavy snow is likely to blanket parts of the interior Northeast while warnings and winter storm watches are in effect in parts of central New England, according to NWS. The Upper Great Lakes may get anywhere from four to eight inches of rain on Thursday. 'In the wake of this front, as temperatures cool further, lake effect snows should expand and intensify as they interact with record warm Great Lakes temperatures for late November,' NWS said while projecting that Florida will be mild to warm over the holiday. This year, over 80 million Americans are expected to travel for Thanksgiving, according to AAA. Nearly 72 million will be driving a car to their destinations to celebrate the holiday. With the winter storm hovering over the Northeast, winter storm advisories are issues in parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York. Rain has hit cities more south like Baltimore and Washington. Despite the rain in New York City, marchers kicked off the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade Thursday morning with a bevy of marching bands, clowns and performances from various artists. The parade saw 22 floats, 15 inflatables, 17 character balloons, 11 marching bands, 700 clowns, singers, performance groups and WNBA champion New York Liberty, The Associated Press (AP) reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/northeast-rain-snow-thanksgiving/	2024-11-28T13:17:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ThanksgivingMacysparade2024.jpg?w=900
Stowaway found on Delta flight from New York City to Paris	(NewsNation) — A Delta Air Lines passenger managed to board a flight from New York City to France without a ticket this week. The flight, Delta 264, was going from New York John F. Kennedy International Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on Tuesday. U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials said the woman bypassed ID and boarding pass checks before getting on the plane but did get physically screened for prohibited items, which she did not have, according to Reuters. 'TSA will independently review the circumstances of this incident at our travel document checker station at JFK,' TSA told Reuters in a statement. See the 10 worst airports for on-time Thanksgiving travel: Report It's unclear if the woman was arrested when the plane landed in France, but police were called to the airport.

The company said it will not comment further at this time given the ongoing investigations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/stowaway-found-delta-flight-from-new-york-city-paris/	2024-11-28T13:08:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671c3af1901688.24453822.jpeg?w=900
Trump says he's planning 'large-scale' ad campaign on fentanyl cr...	President-elect Trump announced plans to launch a 'large-scale' ad campaign on Wednesday with the goal of educating Americans on the effects of fentanyl. 'I will be working on a large scale United States Advertising Campaign, explaining how bad Fentanyl is for people to use - Millions of lives being so needlessly destroyed. By the time the Campaign is over, everyone will know how really bad the horror of this Drug is,' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. The drug is considered a synthetic opioid that resulted in the death of 74,000 last year and 76,000 in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Biden administration created a Trilateral Fentanyl Committee with the U.S., Mexico and Canada to halt the transport of the illegal drug throughout the neighboring countries. President Biden also met with China’s President Xi Jinping in 2023, which resulted in resumed counternarcotics cooperation with the nation, where a majority of chemical precursors for fentanyl are manufactured. Trump hasn’t shared much on how he plans to approach the internal fentanyl crisis in his administration, but he has already warned foreign leaders that high tariffs would be put in place if drugs and illegal immigrants continue to enter the U.S. Trump promised to impose a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office until 'Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country.' He also urged China to give 'any drug dealers' caught shipping fentanyl into the United States the death penalty. If not, the former president said he would add an additional 10 percent on top of any other tariffs placed on the nation. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc responded to Trump’s comments by stating the country places 'the highest priority on border security.' Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum reportedly said she would send a letter to Trump with hopes of sparking an open line of communication. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, admitted 'no one will win a trade war or a tariff war.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fentanyl/trump-says-hes-planning-large-scale-ad-campaign-on-fentanyl-crisis/	2024-11-28T08:55:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zoom-TrumpMAGA_093024_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=900
Covenant House brightens Thanksgiving for homeless youth	(NewsNation) — As Americans gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, an estimated 4.2 million young people across the nation are struggling with homelessness. Covenant House, a national nonprofit organization that provides hope and support to unsheltered young people in cities like Chicago, is trying to brighten the holiday for those it serves.

Covenant House is not just a homeless shelter, but a sanctuary for the millions of American at-risk young people who do not have a permanent place to call home. At locations around the country, the shelters will be providing Thanksgiving meals for clients as part of ongoing efforts to help young adults get back on their feet. The organization has provided support services to more than 1.5 million clients since 1972. Covenant House offers job training as well as mental health support services that help to provide many of those at-risk teens a second chance. 'You have to make a bunch of short-term goals and long-term goals to help yourself,' Sonmontez Paramore, one of the clients Covenant House serves said. 'You can look at the resources, you can get all the help you need, but only you can really help yourself.' Much of Covenant House’s funding comes from its annual Sleep-Out event, a fundraiser that provides people with an idea of what it is like to experience homelessness. A recent event in New York City raised $1.2 million that helps Covenant House continue to serve the country’s youth.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/covenant-house-brightens-thanksgiving-for-homeless-youth/	2024-11-28T05:22:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/1bccc838-70bc-4ac3-a596-d043631475bc_59300e.jpg?w=800
Photos: 100 years of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade	(Stacker) - The 98th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will feature 28 clown crews, 26 floats, 16 giant balloons, 11 marching bands, five performance groups, three 'baloonicles'—cold-air inflatables driven down the parade route, and numerous performers. The parade in New York City, presented by department store chain Macy's, was first held in 1924 under the heading 'Macy's Christmas Parade' to promote holiday sales and spotlight the newly expanded and, at the time, largest in the world Herald Square store in Manhattan. The success of the event led organizers to turn the spectacle into an annual tradition. Each year, the parade ends outside the same Herald Square Macy's location. Stacker curated a selection of photographs from the past century of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to help illustrate the history of the iconic event. Bettmann // Getty Images The event has been televised nationally since 1953 on NBC. The parade at first featured Central Park Zoo animals escorted by Macy's employees and professional entertainers for 6 miles from 145th Street in north Manhattan's Harlem to Macy's. A quarter of a million onlookers lined the streets. Real animals were replaced with balloons in 1927; that same year, the name of the event was changed to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The longest-running parade float is the event's unofficial mascot, Tom Turkey. Tom features moving wings, head, and eyes and usually functions as the lead float in the parade. Bringing up the caboose in virtually all the parades is Santa Claus who ushers in the holiday shopping season with his arrival at Macy's Herald Square. The parade offers a glimpse into pop culture of the time, from beloved children's entertainment to hit Broadway shows and musical acts. The Radio City Rockettes, formed in 1925, have performed in the parade annually since 1957. In 1933, the outside temperature was 69 degrees F, the warmest it's been; 2018 was the coldest day in parade history at 19 degrees F. In 2022, for the first time, the event featured a trio of women hosts. Today, more than 44 million people tune in to watch the parade. Keep reading to learn more about the parade's history and see some iconic shots of the event. Bettmann // Getty Images 1924: Macy's first parade In Macy's first Thanksgiving parade, Santa Claus sat atop a float pulled by a team of horses down Broadway. That year floats, bands, and Central Park Zoo animals were featured in the procession. At the parade's end, Santa Claus was crowned 'King of the Kiddies' on Macy's balcony at the 34th Street entrance. Macy's quickly announced the parade would be an annual event. Underwood Archives // Getty Images 1928: Fish and tigers The large balloons that replaced live zoo animals in 1927 were filled with regular air and had no release valves—they were simply let go to pop in the air following the parade. 1928 marked the first year of Macy's inflating balloons with helium to allow them to float. They were also outfitted with valves so the helium could gradually escape rather than waiting for the balloon to inevitably pop, and featured a return address so anyone who found them could return them and receive a reward. In this photo from 1928, a 35-foot fish and 60-foot-long tiger were featured prominently in the parade. A $100 prize was offered for each balloon recovered after its release. Bettmann // Getty Images 1931: Hippo on parade The Thanksgiving parade enjoyed rapid growth throughout the 1930s, with more than 1 million revelors lining the parade route in 1933. In this 1931 photo, a giant hippopotamus balloon makes its way down Broadway. A blue hippo balloon—possibly this one—released after the parade was still at large several days later, thought to be somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean.

The original Felix the Cat character balloon made its parade debut in 1927, but was destroyed after its post-parade release by a high tension wire in 1931. The Terrible Turk also was destroyed the same year by an electric sign. In 1932, Macy's Tom Cat balloon got stuck in the propeller of a plane when the aviator flying the plane tried recovering the balloon for a reward. While the plane eventually landed safely, that event marked the final year of releasing balloons after the parades and offering prizes for their return to Macy's. Camerique // Getty Images 1939: View from the top Pinnochio, Tin Man, and Uncle Sam make their way along the parade route in 1939. Mickey Mouse made his debut five years earlier with a balloon designed in part by Walt Disney; Mickey's handlers were also dressed as mice. New iterations of Mickey appeared over the next 70 years as the character evolved. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was canceled from 1942-1944 because of supply shortages during World War II, namely helium and rubber. Festivities returned in 1945. The Christmas classic 'Miracle on 34th Street' was released in 1947 and prominently features actual footage from the 1946 parade. 1948 marked the parade's first network television broadcast. Bettmann // Getty Images 1949: Teddy bear on parade The 23rd annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was held Nov. 24, 1949. In this photo, a teddy bear makes its way through Times Square. This parade marked the second appearance for the bear. Other balloons made their debut: Freida the Dachshund, Howdy Doody on the Flying Trapeze, and Macy's Hobo Clown. Bettmann // Getty Images 1952: Space explorer Macy's original character The Giant Spaceman made his debut in 1952's parade, measuring 70 feet long and 40 feet wide and weighing 600 pounds. More than 25 gallons of paint went into painting the astronaut. An estimated 2.25 million people lined the streets for the festivities that year.

Bettmann // Getty Images 1958: 'I am what I am' Popeye makes his way through Times Square in the 1959 parade. A year earlier, another helium shortage meant balloons were inflated with air and hung from construction cranes to make their way through the parade route. Also in 1958, the first celebrity performances were added with the Benny Goodman sextet. Live music proved a challenge technically and logistically. The parade was transitioning to the now-familiar lip syncing by 1964.

The year marks the first balloon featuring Bullwinkle Moose and the first year for floats with Pinocchio, The Racetrack Grandstand, Cinderella, Peacock, Ferris Wheel, Brigadoon, Meet the Mets, and Santa's Sleigh. Several years later, in 1968, Macy's creative team figured out how to design floats up to 40 feet tall and 28 feet wide that could fold into 12.5-by-8-foot boxes for strategic transportation from New Jersey to Manhattan via the Lincoln Tunnel.

In the coming years, safety concerns troubled '90s-era parades—namely the wind. Strong gusts in 1993 pushed a Sonic the Hedgehog balloon into a Columbus Circle lamppost that broke and hurt a child and off-duty police officer. Four years later, intense winds caused a Cat in the Hat balloon to hit a lamppost, hurling debris into the air that fractured the skull of a spectator who spent 24 days in a coma. The incident, among others, led then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to form a task force. Evan Agostini/Liaison // Getty Images 1995: 'Soaring Spirit' The Soaring Spirit Canoe float, pictured here in 1995, made its debut in the parade in 1986.

See the 10 worst airports for on-time Thanksgiving travel: report	(NEXSTAR) – Depending on what airport your friends or relatives are flying out of, you may want to show a little extra compassion this Thanksgiving. A new study by travel site Kayak ranked the nation's top 50 airports – those with the highest search volumes – by the percentage of flight delays last year on both Thanksgiving and Christmas. While many large, bustling airports landed among the least on-time – think New York's JFK, or Chicago's ORD – the data showed that the size of the airport wasn't always a reliable indicator of delays. The worst in the country was relatively tiny FLL in Fort Lauderdale, where 34% of Thanksgiving flights (and 39% on Christmas!) were delayed. Photo said to show Amelia Earhart’s plane is something else entirely, exploration company says SFO was also among the ten worst, with 24% of flights delayed on Thanksgiving, but travelers who flew out of San Jose likely had a far smoother experience. SJC ranked fifth for the most on-time airports with only 12% of flights delayed last Thanksgiving.

The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) is already bracing for a Thanksgiving travel rush that is expected to break records. The TSA is preparing to screen roughly 2.9 million people on Wednesday and over 3 million on Sunday. Airlines must pay you back for flight cancellations, major delays. How much will you get under new rule? 'These will likely be some of the busiest travel days in U.S. history,' Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Monday. As for dodging flight delays, Kayak's study revealed a clear pattern – the earlier the better. On Thanksgiving last year, delays affected just 10% of flights departing at 5 a.m., a number that nearly doubled by 10 a.m. Overall, however, delays are down in recent years. Kayak found that Thanksgiving cancellations in 2023 dropped by a whopping 28% compared with 2022 – a trend that will hopefully continue in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/see-the-10-worst-airports-for-on-time-thanksgiving-travel-report/	2024-11-28T03:54:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24331776304738.jpg?w=900
Israel says ceasefire with Hezbollah violated, fires on south Leb...	BEIRUT (AP) — At least two people were wounded by Israeli fire in southern Lebanon on Thursday, according to state media. The Israeli military said it had fired at people trying to return to certain areas on the second day of a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. The agreement, brokered by the United States and France, includes an initial two-month cease-fire in which Hezbollah militants are to withdraw north of the Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. The buffer zone would be patrolled by Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said two people were wounded by Israeli fire in Markaba, close to the border, without providing further details. It said Israel fired artillery in three other locations near the border. There were no immediate reports of casualties. An Associated Press reporter in northern Israel near the border heard Israeli drones buzzing overhead and the sound of artillery strikes from the Lebanese side. The Israeli military said in a statement that 'several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire.' It said troops 'opened fire toward them' and would 'actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement.' Israeli officials have said forces will be withdrawn gradually as it ensures that the agreement is being enforced. Israel has warned people not to return to areas where troops are deployed, and says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah if it violates the terms of the truce. A Lebanese military official said Lebanese troops would gradually deploy in the south as Israeli troops withdraw. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media. The ceasefire agreement announced late Tuesday ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that began a day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets, drones and missiles in solidarity. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict steadily intensified for nearly a year before boiling over into all-out war in mid-September. The war in Gaza is still raging with no end in sight. More than 3,760 people were killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. Some 1.2 million people were displaced in Lebanon, and thousands began streaming back to their homes on Wednesday despite warnings from the Lebanese military and the Israeli army to stay out of certain areas. Some 50,000 people were displaced on the Israeli side, but few have returned and the communities near the northern border are still largely deserted. ___ Frankel reported from northern Israel.
