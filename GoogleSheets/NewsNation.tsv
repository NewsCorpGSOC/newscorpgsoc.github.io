Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new policy platform for Puerto Rico on Sunday, targeting the Latino vote ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election through promises of economic development and improved disaster response. While residents of Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections despite being American citizens, the message was aimed at more than 5.8 million people of Puerto Rican origin living on the mainland who can vote, according to Pew Research Center. The announcement gained additional visibility when Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny shared Harris' video message on Instagram, highlighting her criticism of former President Donald Trump's response to Hurricane Maria in 2017. Couple recounts surviving Hurricane Helene on floating couch 'Throughout my career, I've always fought for the people of Puerto Rico,' Harris said in the video. 'Every chance he got, Donald Trump abandoned and insulted them.' Harris outlined several initiatives, including creating a Puerto Rico Opportunity Economy Task Force to foster economic growth and create thousands of new jobs. She also promised to accelerate disaster recovery funds and modernize the island's electrical grid, which still experiences daily outages. 'I will cut red tape to ensure disaster recovery funds are used quickly and effectively, and work with leaders across the island to ensure all Puerto Ricans have access to reliable, affordable electricity,' Harris said. The video release follows Harris' March 22 visit to Puerto Rico, where she toured hurricane recovery efforts. During the five-hour visit, Harris visited a rebuilt home in Canovanas that Hurricane Maria had destroyed. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters 'I see we are making a difference. There is still more work to do,' Harris said during the visit, noting that the federal government has provided about $3 billion for reliable energy sources, including rooftop solar panels. The visit wasn't without controversy. A small group of protesters gathered in San Juan to demonstrate against Puerto Rico's territorial status and demand a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanted 'Yankee, go home!' while supporters responded with chants of 'U.S.A.!'

New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ imm...	New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) on Sunday defended Vice President Harris’s support for the bipartisan border legislation and pushed back on the suggestion that she was upsetting both poles of the party by sidestepping difficult issues on the topic. In an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday,' Chris Stirewalt asked Grisham whether Harris's lack of response on whether she would continue building a border wall—coupled with her push for a conservative bipartisan border bill—has managed to push away voters from both extremes of the party. Michigan Republican: Trump ‘has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community’ 'I don't think that she is stuck. I think we've gotten stuck largely driven, frankly, by the Republican Party, and when the Republicans were in the majority,' Grisham said about whether Harris is stuck between these two dissatisfied groups. The border governor, also a Harris surrogate, said the vice president is not ruling out the possibility of doing more to improve immigration and border security by supporting the bill that never made it through Congress this past term. 'She is not eliminating the possibility that it could be bolder and bigger on either side of that equation,' Grisham said, 'protecting the people who are here, the folks who have followed the laws of this country once they got here, kids who knew no other country other than this one, than their own and their families, and also curbing illegal immigration at the border by creating upstream opportunities for getting visas and asylum protections.' 'That's smart, and I want the border security smart border security,' she said. 'That's what every border state governor wants.' New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority Grisham was asked about Harris’s response to reporters, who pushed the Democratic nominee to answer whether construction of a southern border wall would continue in her administration. 'I will tell you that my highest priority is to put the resources into ensuring that our border is secure, which is why I've been very clear I'm going to bring back up as president that bipartisan border security bill and make sure that it is brought to my desk so I can sign it into law,' Harris said in response this past week, in a clip that Stirewalt played on the show.

Michigan Republican: Trump ‘has got a tremendous support from the...	Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) said on Sunday the Muslim community in Michigan trusts former President Trump over Vice President Harris to guide Middle East policy. 'For the people of the state of Michigan, actions speak louder than words. I was just at a rally yesterday with former President Trump, and I can share with you, he has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community, and it's because they want peace in the Middle East,' McClain said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority 'And they trust him much more as a leader than they ever would under Vice President Harris,' she continued. Stirewalt noted Trump has supported military action by Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem during his administration. He asked McClain whether she thinks the issue 'comes down to' whether 'they like his leadership vibe better.' 'I think they like the fact that under President Trump, there was peace in the Middle East. There weren't wars that were raging. We didn't have any Americans held hostage in the Middle East like we do now under this Harris and Biden administration,' she responded. 'That's what they liked.' New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ immigration legislation Muslim and Arab Americans have pushed the Democratic ticket to take further steps to hold Israel accountable for Palestinian deaths stemming from its war with Hamas and other Iranian proxy groups in the region. A recent poll showed Trump leading Harris nationally among Arab American and Muslim voters, by 4 points, amid criticism of the Biden administration’s support for Israel.

Watch live: Trump, Vance rally New Yorkers at Madison Square Gard...	Former President Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) are campaigning in New York City on Sunday, holding an event at the iconic Madison Square Garden. The event is expected to draw thousands to the arena at the center of deep-blue Manhattan. Others expected to make an appearance include the former president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr., former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, billionaire Elon Musk, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.). It’s extremely unlikely Trump will win the state, which hasn’t backed a GOP presidential candidate since 1984. With just over a week until Election Day, The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of early polls shows Vice President Harris with a sizable lead over the GOP nominee — 58 percent to 40.2 percent — in the Empire State. The rally is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT. Watch the live video above.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/watch-live-trump-vance-rally-new-yorkers-at-madison-square-garden/	2024-10-27T14:11:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300621630295-e1729967862738.jpg?w=900
New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House maj...	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Democrats are going all-in on efforts to flip New York’s 4th Congressional District blue, funneling big names and money into the Long Island locale with hopes that a victory could help usher in a Democratic House majority next year. The district, which sits on the South Shore of Long Island, holds the title of most Democratic-leaning district currently represented by a Republican. The area broke for President Biden by 14.6 percentage points in 2020. But in 2022, Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito beat Democrat Laura Gillen for the district’s open House seat by 3.6 points, putting the liberal bastion in GOP hands for the first time in more than two decades. This year's race — one of the most competitive this cycle — is a rematch between D’Esposito and Gillen, a take-two showdown that has drawn outsize attention, and fundraising, on the national stage. In a sign of its importance, the top three House Democrats — Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — have visited to campaign with Gillen this month, while House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) recently made a stop for D’Esposito. Democrats need to net four seats to take control of the chamber next year, and Jeffries — speaking at a rally for Gillen in a packed Hempstead gymnasium — said the race is key to that effort. Early voting began Saturday in New York. 'No pressure on y'all,' Jeffries said. 'But one of four seats that we need to win.' Gillen is leading D’Esposito 53 percent to 41 percent among likely voters in a new Newsday/Siena College poll, with less than a month to go until Election Day. The margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. Money and turnout could swing race The race is one of 75 House rematches from 2022, according to Ballotpedia. And this time around, both candidates say the contest is different. Gillen, a former Hempstead town supervisor, told The Hill during a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office that additional resources, an earlier campaign launch and reverberations from the 2022 Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade are fueling her optimism this cycle. 'I didn’t have the resources to communicate at the level I’d like to to talk to women about what the Dobbs decision really meant, even if you live in a blue state. And also to talk about other issues that people care about,' said Gillen, seated next to Clark. 'In this race, I worked really hard, I got in early, I got the runway I needed to raise the resources to communicate to all the folks in this district at the levels I’d like,' she added. Gillen has also significantly outraised D’Esposito throughout the race: The Democrat has raked in nearly $5.69 million thus far, with D’Esposito trailing at $4.24 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The numbers mark a staggering increase from 2020, when Gillen brought in $1.83 million to D’Esposito’s $1.33 million. D’Esposito’s fundraising deficit is even larger when assessing outside spending. House Majority PAC, the fund associated with Jeffries, has spent $5.43 million on the race, while the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is endorsed by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), has funneled just $3.35 million into the rematch. In an interview with The Hill at Hempstead Town Hall, D’Esposito — after an hour-plus town hall with roughly a dozen veterans — pointed to his cash disadvantage when asked if this year’s race feels different from his 2022 match-up, and attributed it to the national Democratic Party. 'It’s the fact that Hakeem Jeffries wants to be Speaker of the House, and he wants it to run through New York,' D’Esposito said. 'And quite frankly, he should have chose someone else, because Nassau County is not gonna allow a liberal Laura Gillen to take this seat.' While the candidates cited the money game when discussing the difference between now and 2022, Jeffries had a different theory in mind: voter turnout. Republicans crushed Democrats in turnout in 2022. Of the 250,142 registered Democrats in the district, only 130,871 cast a ballot for Gillen — a 52.32 percent turnout. In contrast, of the 168,934 registered Republicans in the district, 140,622 came out in support of D’Esposito — an 83.24 percent turnout. Jeffries — during his gaggle with reporters after Gillen’s rally — said he is focused on turning out the Democratic vote this cycle, which will lead the party to victory in November. 'There were 100,000 Democrats who stayed home during the midterm elections in 2022,' Jeffries said, standing below a scoreboard in the gymnasium with the home score set to 11, the guest score at 5, and 20:24 as the time — an homage to Election Day. 'We’re going to make sure that those Democrats come out to vote, and when they do, it’ll ensure that Laura Gillen is elected the next congressperson from the 4th Congressional district.' Candidates moderate on immigration, abortion The purple nature of the district — Cook Political Report rates the race a 'toss-up' — has encouraged both candidates to moderate their stances on a number of hot-button issues. Gillen has taken the issue of immigration head-on, sending a letter to President Biden recommending executive action pertaining to the border and cutting an ad that directly addresses the matter. D’Esposito, meanwhile, has worked to present himself as a moderate on the issue of reproductive rights. Gillen’s immigration strategy mimics that of Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who leaned into the issue during his successful campaign to replace ousted Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.). 'I’m Laura Gillen, and I’m here at the border — of Nassau County,' she says in the ad. 'We’re 2,000 miles from Mexico, but we’re feeling the migrant crisis almost every day. So I want you to hear me loud and clear: You send me to Congress, I will work with anyone in any party to secure our southern border, lock up criminals pushing fentanyl and stop the migrant crisis.' Gillen told The Hill the issue of immigration is 'an issue that people in my district care about very much' before criticizing both parties for the 'lack of political will' to tackle it. Colleen Ryan, a D’Esposito supporter, mentioned immigration when asking a question at the incumbent’s town hall focused on veterans' issues. Afterward, she called the influx of migrants a 'problem.' 'I support immigration,' Ryan told The Hill. 'It is the problem with illegal immigration, and they are being transported around the country and they have a disregard for the law of the land. And that’s demoralizing. … I’m absolutely for Anthony D’Esposito stopping the lawbreaking.' If immigration has been a leading issue for Republicans, women’s reproductive rights has been a top issue for Democrats, with the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022 continuing to motivate liberal voters across the country. During a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office, Gillen and Clark sought to paint D’Esposito as extreme when it comes to the issue of abortion, arguing he would sign a nationwide ban on the procedure and knocking him for calling it a 'state issue.' D’Esposito, however, has strongly rejected that interpretation. He told The Hill that he would never sign a nationwide abortion ban, touted his part in keeping an appropriations bill off the House floor that would have restricted access to the abortion pill mifepristone, and named bills he has co-sponsored that protect in vitro fertilization. 'When it comes to abortion, I have been a champion of women’s rights,' he said. Helene Spierman, a Gillen supporter who has lived in the district for 25 years, listed women’s reproductive rights as a top issue for her this cycle. 'That everybody has a voice and that people are created equal and that the government has got to trust that,' she said. 'I could say that it’s abortion, I could say that it’s the Constitution, I could say that it’s not going back to the 17th century, the 18th century, when the Constitution was written.' September surprise threatens to shake up race While those issues — and others — have dominated the campaign, a September surprise is threatening to shake up the race. The New York Times published a bombshell report last month alleging D’Esposito, shortly after being sworn into the House, hired his longtime fiancée’s daughter and a woman he was having an affair with. D’Esposito has repeatedly denied engaging in any wrongdoing and claimed he has abided by ethical standards throughout his tenure in Congress. He told The Hill the story was 'a political hit piece' and said he is 'absolutely not' concerned about backlash from the report on Election Day. That response, however, is not putting the story to bed. The Times report was the subject of the first question at the N.Y.-4 debate earlier this month, putting D’Esposito on the defensive out of the gate. He reiterated his denial, before reading off a number of headlines from right-leaning outlets calling Gillen’s ethics into question. Gillen, for her part, has leaned into the allegations against D’Esposito in the final stretch of the election. She referenced the report during her rally in Hempstead alongside Jeffries, and she tore into his alleged 'abuse of power' during an interview with The Hill. The Times report is likely to be a mainstay of Gillen’s final pitch to voters, in addition to her message on the economy, state and local taxes, immigration and women’s reproductive rights — an all-encompassing campaign trail blitz as Democrats look to reclaim the coveted seat after the crushing loss last cycle. 'A setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback,' Jeffries said at his rally with Gillen. 'We had a setback in 2022. Are we ready for a comeback?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/new-york-rematch-could-hold-key-to-democratic-quest-for-house-majority/	2024-10-27T14:02:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GillenLaura_102424ap.jpg?w=900

(PIX11) -- Around eight hours before Donald Trump's campaign rally starts, a crowd has already amassed outside Madison Square Garden Sunday morning. The rally is expected to kick off around 5 p.m., but roads were already closed around the stadium early Sunday morning, and security was in place. The crowd was allowed into Madison Square Garden starting around 12 p.m. Yamamoto, Freeman lead Dodgers to 4-2 win over Yankees, 2-0 Series lead A crowd waiting outside Madison Square Garden hours ahead of a Donald Trump campaign rally. (PIX11 News) Before 8 a.m. Sunday, huge crowds of supporters in American flag and Trump merch lined the block around the venue. 'There's a lot of energy, people are very sleep-deprived, everyone woke up really early, but it doesn't matter people are so hyped up,' said Greenpoint resident Anthony Filipelli. 'Regardless if you support him or not, this event is just an iconic American event.' Trump will be accompanied by a host of high-profile speakers at Sunday's rally, including his running mate Sen. JD Vance, Rudy Giuliani, former presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his kids. Elon Musk is also expected to appear at Sunday's rally. One person, Michael Barbuzze told PIX11 News he had been at the venue since 5 a.m. 'I definitely am excited, I really wanted to see him,' one person in line told PIX11 News. 'I'm here to show solidarity. ... He calls it like he sees it.' Counter-protesters are expected to demonstrate at Sunday's rally, including billboard trucks and a town hall organized by the Lincoln Project. Organizers with Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice also planned to protest the event. When the rally was announced, local elected official Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal called for it to be canceled. 'This is a disastrous decision by Madison Square Garden that will endanger the public safety of New Yorkers and has the potential to incite widespread violence,' Hoylman-Sigal said in a post to X. Other elected officials, like Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, celebrated the rally. 'The Garden is the world’s biggest stage and the perfect forum for President Trump,' she said. A rally for Trump on Long Island in September drew huge crowds that camped out overnight and throughout the day of the rally. The following streets are expected to be closed Sunday for the Donald Trump rally: 33rd Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 32nd Street between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue 31st Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 30th Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue Seventh Avenue will be closed to pedestrians from 34th to 29th Street This is a developing story.

Walz, AOC to play Madden on Twitch in an appeal to young men	Vice President Harris's running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) are set to play Madden NFL together on the live-streaming platform Twitch on Sunday. The announcement comes as the Harris campaign seeks to court young male voters, a voting bloc that former President Trump seems to be leading with in the polls. The Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll found that the gender gap among youth supporters of Harris and Trump more than doubled since the spring, growing from 8 percentage points in the spring, when President Biden was the Democratic nominee, to 20 points now, with Harris as the party’s candidate. Polling has also shown the Democratic nominee trailing behind Trump among male voters in key swing states. A CNN/SSRS poll from September showed Trump leading Harris among likely male voters in Pennsylvania by 15 points — 55 percent to 40 percent — and Harris leading Trump among female voters in the state by 11 points — 53 percent to 42 percent. The survey of likely voters in Nevada showed Trump with an 18-point lead among male voters, 57 percent to 39 percent, while Harris had a 16-point lead among female voters, 55 percent to 39 percent. The campaign has used Twitch to attract younger voters in the past, even using the platform, along with TikTok, YouTube and more than a dozen digital services, to stream the Democratic National Convention in August. This announcement also comes amid a series of ads on Yahoo Sports and DraftKings — platforms with predominantly male audiences — launched by the Harris campaign last week specifically aimed at winning over young male voters. Earlier this month, some Democrats expressed worry that Harris is struggling to engage men in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. 'She has a problem with men for the same reason Hillary Clinton did: because misogyny exists, as do outdated ideas about who should hold the presidency,' Democratic strategist Christy Setzer told The Hill earlier this month. 'Meanwhile, Trump has doubled down on this ‘strongman’ machismo and dictator’s act, playing ‘It’s a Man’s World’ at his rallies.' Clinton lost the male vote to Trump in 2016 by 11 points, 41 percent to 52 percent, while she won the female vote by 13 points, 54 percent to 41 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/walz-aoc-to-play-madden-on-twitch-in-an-appeal-to-young-men/	2024-10-27T13:06:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/OcasioCortezAlexandria_AOC.jpg?w=900
Tropical disturbance 'likely to develop' this week, NHC says	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Although we're nearing the end of hurricane season next month, the tropics are still active and popping up with disturbances. A new system has formed in the Caribbean that is 'likely to develop' sometime this week, according to the National Hurricane Center. All hands on deck as Florida recovers abandoned boats after Helene and Milton In the 8 a.m. ET update on Sunday, the disturbance shows a 30% chance for development over the next seven days. The NHC said gradual development is possible through the end of the week, as it moves northward or northeastward over the southwestern Caribbean Sea.

Driving the vote: Nebraska's electoral system divides voters	(NewsNation) — Omaha, Nebraska, is punching far above its weight class politically thanks to a unique way of assigning electoral votes that could play a key role in the upcoming election. Omaha is the home of Kool-Aid, the frozen TV dinner and Marlon Brando, the epicenter of baseball and a city with history. During World War II, a Japanese balloon bomb exploded in the air just a few miles from what is now Charles Schwab Field. Driving the vote: Ohio voters swapping parties Nebraska has an unorthodox way of awarding presidential electors, departing from the winner-take-all model used by almost all states. Two of the state's electoral votes go to the statewide winner and the winner in each congressional district gets one elector. Now, Nebraska is a reliably red state, but its 2nd Congressional District, which includes Omaha, can and does go blue. That's earned it the nickname the 'blue dot.' The importance of Omaha isn't lost on the campaigns, with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on the ground in the area early, a clue they both feel that it could be crucial in what is shaping up to be a nail-biter election. The oversized role of Nebraska's 2nd District has put the home of the College World Series in the spotlight for a very different reason. NewsNation brought together voters from the diverse district, where party lines prevailed when it came to how people felt about the system. Republicans want the state to go back to a winner-take-all system. 'I think it's us and Maine are the only two states that give up the congressional districts to separate them,' said Tony Connor. 'I think there should be consistency in every state. So I would like to see some consistency.' Driving the Vote: Will Black voters swing Pennsylvania for Trump? On the other side of the aisle, many Democrats like that the state legislature has stood up to GOP efforts to roll back Nebraska's system of awarding electors. 'I don't believe in winner-take-all. I don't think it matches the people's choice as well as it should,' said Jean Couchey. 'I think there's too many enclaves within the state that are not represented by that.' The district is not defined by being a blue dot alone. Where Interstate 80 runs just south of downtown, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats. 'We're on I-80. We're right in the middle of the country, and there's a lot of trafficking that comes right through her,' said Colleen Brennan. 'Human trafficking is a big problem. Drug trafficking is a huge problem.' One issue that sparks debate? Immigration. '[My] first language was Spanish,' said Dulce Sherman. 'I learned English. I'm successful. I mean, I'm the example that not all people that come from immigrants are bad people.' The diverse opinions reflect the bigger conversations across the nation. 'In many respects, this district becomes a microcosm of society,' said Randy Adkins. Adkins is a professor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, where he teaches campaigns and elections. He's happy to see the nation learning about how the Cornhusker State handles the race for the White House. Driving the vote: Illinois farmers feel forgotten in blue state 'I think it is unique. I think it is more democratic, with a small 'D,' in the sense that even the minority is represented somehow in the state, in the Electoral College vote, which doesn't happen in 48 out of 50 states,' he said. 'Or at least there's a possibility of that.' Like the rest of the nation, diverse views can, at times, result in heated debate, especially on controversial issues like abortion. 'My grandchildren, I want the ability for them to have a say in my body, my right to decide what I do with my body,' Dulce Sherman said. Another voter disagreed. 'It's not their body, it's not their choice,' said William Duerr. 'That body is a separate entity, a separate human being.' Still, the state has a strong sense of community bolstered by smart, civil discussion as voters cast their ballots to see exactly how Nebraska's unique electoral system will play out in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-vote-nebraska-electoral/	2024-10-27T10:26:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/Nebraska_2nddistrict_BidenTrump.jpg?w=900
Trump and Harris pledged to save Social Security. Here's what the...	(The Hill) — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both vowed to protect Social Security, but experts say both of their campaign platforms fall short of specific solutions for a program that faces threats to funding in roughly a decade. Recent estimates show not only would neither candidate’s agenda stave off the threat of insolvency — but that one’s proposals could worsen its budget outlook, absent ideas to tax or spending reforms to extend the lifetime of the program. Here’s some of what the candidates have said so far. Trump’s Social Security plans Trump drew attention during the summer by proposing eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits — one of a list of proposals aimed at providing tax relief to some Americans. However, experts have raised concerns about the costs of scrapping income taxes on Social Security checks and how it would impact the program’s finances. 'His proposal would have a significant financial impact on Social Security, because now, those income taxes that some beneficiaries pay account for about 4 percent of Social Security's revenues,' said Richard Johnson, senior fellow for the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Here’s what to do if you lose an absentee ballot before Election Day The combined trust funds for Social Security retirement and disability benefits are currently projected by the program’s trustees to run out in 2035, a year later than previously expected, after economic growth exceeded expectations last year. But under what Trump has proposed thus far, a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimated the program’s funds could run out by 2031 while increasing Social Security’s cash deficit by $2.3 trillion between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2035. A chunk of the cost comes from what the group identified as a roughly $950 billion price tag to eliminate income taxation of Social Security benefits. Trump’s campaign has come out strongly against the analysis, with its national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accusing the 'so-called experts' of being 'consistently wrong throughout the years.' 'President Trump delivered on his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare in his first term, and President Trump will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term,' Leavitt said. Leavitt said a second Trump administration would shore up Social Security funding by 'unleashing a new economic boom.' IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? Still, Trump’s agenda leaves experts guessing as to what changes he would support to shore up solvency for the program. In the official 2024 GOP policy platform highlighted on Trump’s campaign site, the plan calls for 'no cuts' to Social Security and Medicare, as well as 'no changes to the retirement age.' Harris on Social Security Harris’s online campaign page has vowed she will protect Social Security and 'strengthen' the program by 'making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes.' As part of the rollout for the proposed fiscal 2025 federal budget earlier this year, the Biden-Harris administration additionally outlined a pitch to extend solvency for the program by focusing on higher earners, noting that 'middle-class and lower-income Americans pay Social Security taxes on all of their earnings, but higher-income Americans do not.' Extra check coming to some Social Security recipients in November: Here’s why At the time, the White House said the president also opposed benefit cuts and proposals to privatize Social Security. But experts and budget hawks say the vice president’s agenda is still missing key details about her plans to shore up the program’s finances. In a statement Tuesday, Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said 'neither presidential candidate has addressed this challenge, and every year we fail to take action it only becomes more difficult to fix.' 'Overwhelming majorities of voters want candidates to prioritize solutions to strengthen Social Security, and the good news is that there are many available options to do just that,' he said, while also noting the program is 'less than a decade away from automatic, across-the-board cuts, putting many millions of current retirees at financial risk.' In the latest analysis by the CRFB, the group said Harris’s proposals 'would not have large effects on Social Security trust fund solvency.' Is this year’s COVID booster a good match for new variants? But polling has shown the program’s solvency is still one of importance for voters, with a recent poll out of the Peterson Foundation showing a vast majority of voters, 96 percent, say it’s important for 'candidates to have a plan to prevent automatic cuts to Social Security.' In their latest report over the summer, trustees projected the depletion date for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund, which pays out Social Security benefits to retirees, and the program’s smaller Disability Insurance Trust Fund, will be in 2035. Once the reserves of the OASI trust fund are depleted, the report projected that account income will only be able to cover roughly 80 percent of scheduled benefits for recipients. Experts say lawmakers will likely need to either agree to reductions on the benefits side, raising taxes, or both, to prevent automatic cuts to benefits for seniors if funds run out. Social Security announces 2.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2025 'The Social Security date has not changed much in probably the past decade, and yet, what we have seen is, with each presidential election, we’re getting closer and closer to that day of reckoning. And so we should become more and more urgent,' Johnson said. 'So, it's a little bit surprising that we haven't seen more specific proposals.' 'On the other hand, these proposals would involve some pain — either more taxes or lower benefits. And pain doesn't always win you votes,' he added. The Hill has reached out to Harris’s campaign for further comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-and-harris-pledged-to-save-social-security-heres-what-theyll-do/	2024-10-27T07:31:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24295819243226-e1729602526227_09e742-e1729713450753.jpg?w=800
Scrutiny over Sheehy’s military record grows in Montana Senate ra...	Intensifying scrutiny over businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy’s military record could shake up the Senate race in Montana, where Sheehy, the GOP candidate, is pulling away from Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in the polls. Sheehy, a decorated combat veteran, has been dogged for months by questions about a bullet wound he claimed he received during a firefight in Afghanistan after it came to light that a park ranger reported in 2015 that he shot himself accidentally in a parking lot at Glacier National Park. Sheehy now claims that he fabricated the story that he shot himself in the parking lot to explain to cover up for a fellow soldier whose bullet ricocheted into his arm during a skirmish in Afghanistan. Longtime observers of Montana politics say the late-breaking controversy of Sheehy’s military record could impact voters, though they question whether it’s enough to help Tester save his seat. 'It goes to credibility and from that standpoint it has the potential to impact the race,' said David McCumber, the former editor of The Montana Standard and the former regional editor for Lee Enterprises in central Montana. 'From what I hear and from reading accounts and ads, it’s clearly the topic of conversation,' he said, explaining that the question of credibility is 'where Sheehy is vulnerable with it.' 'He gets big points for being a decorated veteran. There’s no question about that,' he added, noting that Montana is home to many veterans who served in war. 'The default is that Sheehy is a veteran and deserves a lot of credit for that but I think this has the potential to undercut. It does deal with his military service and it doesn’t pass the smell test.' Sheehy served as a Navy SEAL officer in Iraq, Afghanistan, South America and the Pacific, earning a Bronze Star with Valor and a Purple Heart across dozens of engagements with enemy forces, according to his campaign website. Sheehy’s conflicting accounts of his arm injury was the subject of stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times earlier this month, but the issue is now getting more attention in Montana, where a group of military veterans supporting Tester this week demanded that Sheehy release his medical records. The Washington Post first broke the story that Sheehy told a park ranger in 2015 that he shot himself after dropping his revolver in a parking lot. The ranger, Kim Peach, told The New York Times in an interview: 'I am 100 percent sure he shot himself that day,' referring to the October 2015 incident that he responded to in Glacier. Peach says Sheehy told him at a hospital outside the park that his .45 caliber revolver discharged accidently after he dropped it, hitting him in the arm. Peach investigated the incident after a someone reported a shot being fired in a parking lot to the ranger station. In a written statement to the park service, Sheehy testified that 'while reloading our vehicle an improperly placed firearm kept in the vehicle for bear protection fell out and discharged into my right forearm.' Sheehy paid a $525 fine to settle the matter, as discharging a firearm in a national park is illegal. Sheehy’s lawyers told The Times that Sheehy did indeed sustain the wound in Afghanistan, but did not initially report the wound because he suspected it was caused by friendly fire. But when Sheehy went to the hospital nine years for an unrelated injury, doctors told him he needed to explain the bullet still embedded in his arm to law enforcement. The attorney said Sheehy made up the story of accidentally shooting himself to protect his former platoonmates and that any attempt to dispute his claim of being wounded in combat is 'tantamount to falsely accusing him of stolen valor.' Katie Martin, a spokesperson for the Sheehy campaign, said he 'served our nation with honor' and said attempts to raise questions about his character and military record were 'appalling.' 'Tim Sheehy humbly served our nation with honor and served alongside many heroes. Many of them never came home. Full stop. The bullet in Tim’s arm was a result of his service in Afghanistan. Tim never reported it because he didn’t want to trigger an investigation of his team, be pulled from the battlefield, and see a fellow teammate be punished,' Martin said. 'It was always about protecting a fellow team member of his unit he thought could have been responsible due to friendly fire ricochet in the heat of an engagement with the enemy,' the spokesperson added. 'To witness the media in cahoots with Jon Tester and his allies attempting to tear down a combat veteran’s record is appalling, and they should be ashamed of themselves. It shows just how desperate they are to win this U.S. Senate race. Jon Tester doesn’t care about veterans and their sacrifices; he only cares about another term in office.' Now Tester is pressing the issue in a new television ad highlighting skepticism about Sheehy’s claim that he was wounded in combat as he has described on the campaign trail. Tester ad shows a clip of Sheehy claiming 'I have a bullet stuck in this arm still from Afghanistan' juxtaposed with media reports that a national park ranger, Kim Peach, is certain Sheehy instead shot himself accidently. A new television ad was also launched this week by Senate Majority PAC, the Senate Democrats’ biggest super PAC, features a video clip of a former SEAL who trained with Sheehy contesting his one-time friend’s claim that he was shot in Afghanistan. 'Tim and I had about as close a working relationship in the platoon as possible. So when he says he took a bullet in the arm in Afghanistan, we all know it’s not true. We would have seen it, we would have heard about it,' said Dave Madden, the former SEAL who also shared his skepticism about Sheehy’s claim in an interview with The New York Times. NBC Montana, MTN News and other local media outlets have picked up on the story in recent days. Several military veterans supporting Tester held a press conference in Missoula Tuesday demanding that Sheehy release his medical records to help clear up the controversy. 'If Tim Sheehy really wants to tell Montanans the truth, he could come clean and release his medical records from the Kalispell hospital from that day in Glacier,' Jonas Rides At The Door, a Marine Corps combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served in Iraq, told The Daily Montanan. The Sheehy campaign responded Friday with its own television ad pushing back on Tester and others questioning his story of being shot in the arm during combat. 'Jon Tester is desperate and losing. Seen these Democrat lies?' the ad’s narrator says at the start of the ad, which labels the park ranger who blew the whistle on Sheehy 'a never Trumper.' Sheehy tells viewers 'I joined the Navy at 18, I met my wife in the military' and shares more details about his military service. He said he received the Purple Heart after 'being wounded by an IED' and a Bronze Star with Valor 'after carrying a wounded brother out of enemy fire.' He makes no mention of the bullet lodged in his arm, however. Martin said Sheehy got into the race 'to put our country first and won’t ever let any of this slander stop him from fighting every day as your next U.S. senator.' 'What Montanans know is that Tim Sheehy is an American Warrior who fought for our country and laid his life on the line for our freedoms. Anyone trying to take away from the fact that he signed up for war as a young man and spent most of his 20s in some of the most dangerous places in the world is either a partisan hack, a journalist with an agenda, or outright a disgusting person,' she said. Political handicappers have said that Sheehy, who is leading Tester in recent polls, is likely to win the race in a state that former President Trump carried by 16 points in 2020. But Democrats want to change the dynamics of the race in the final week by raising questions about his credibility and character. A group called Republicans for Tester has taken out full-page newspaper ads statewide next week accusing Sheehy of 'dishonesty about his service.' It features a blown-up image of the park ranger’s report of the shooting at Glacier and quotes from veterans criticizing the Republican candidate.

Unnamed pro athlete stopped assault at 2022 Diddy party: Lawsuit	(NewsNation) — A professional athlete stopped a drunken Sean 'Diddy' Combs from sexually assaulting a 'luxury car businessman' at a party in 2022, a lawsuit obtained by the New York Post alleges. The alleged victim said Diddy invited him into a private office during a launch party for the music mogul's Ciroc vodka brand. He claims Combs took off his pants and exposed himself when they were alone. 'Combs continued to move closer and then grabbed Plaintiff’s genitals through his pants, squeezing them in a rough and sexual manner,' the suit alleges. 'Plaintiff, shocked and disoriented, frozen momentarily and did not know how to respond to the weirdly inappropriate sexual advance made by Combs,' it continues. What we know about the Diddy investigation The assault was stopped by 'Professional Athlete A,' who came into the office and intervened, the documents allege. The sports star was not named. Only identified as 'John Doe,' the plaintiff runs a Los Angeles-based business renting luxury cars and jewelry. He'd worked with Diddy for years before the alleged assault, the lawsuit claims. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline Diddy has been at the center of a storm of controversy and legal troubles where multiple individuals have come forward with allegations of sexual assault against him, leading to a series of lawsuits. These accusations have triggered a federal investigation, with reports suggesting that authorities are looking into sex trafficking charges. A May 5 trial date was set on Oct. 10.

Trump claims Harris ‘guaranteed’ to get US into World War III	Former President Trump claimed that Vice President Harris is 'guaranteed' to get the United States into World War III if she is elected president, continuing intense rhetoric common throughout the 2024 campaign. Trump spoke at a rally in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday, arguing that Harris would be incompetent at dealing with other country’s leaders like Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'To make her president would be to gamble with the lives of millions of people,' he said. 'She would get us into a World War III guaranteed because she is too grossly incompetent to do the job.' Trump continued that people’s 'sons and daughters will end up getting drafted to go fight for a war in a country that you’ve never heard of.' Later in the speech, Trump vowed that he would avoid World War III even as the country has 'never been so close' to it occurring. Which newspapers have endorsed and not endorsed Trump and Harris? Trump also repeated past arguments that conflicts like the one stemming from Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel would not have happened if he had been president. The former president’s remarks come after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a letter on Friday denouncing Harris’s calling Trump a 'fascist,' a term that Trump himself has used for Harris. Johnson and McConnell said, 'The Democratic nominee for President of the United States has only fanned the flames beneath a boiling cauldron of political animus. Her most recent and most reckless invocations of the darkest evil of the 20th century seem to dare it to boil over.' 'Labeling a political opponent as a ‘fascist’ risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before Election Day,' they said, referencing the two assassination attempts on Trump earlier this year. Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan Harris had previously not used the word fascist to describe Trump but said she believed he is one at the CNN town hall she participated in on Wednesday. The answer came in response to a question about Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly, saying Trump 'certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.' Following the first assassination attempt on Trump in July, members of both parties called for toning down political rhetoric to avoid such a politically charged environment that could lead to incidents like that one. But language from both candidates largely returned to normal soon after.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-claims-harris-guaranteed-to-get-us-into-world-war-iii/	2024-10-26T17:23:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300818698844.jpg?w=900
Which newspapers have and not endorsed Trump and Harris?	(NewsNation) — The Washington Post announced Friday it will no longer endorse presidential candidates, abandoning a 30-year tradition amid reports that owner Jeff Bezos blocked a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The decision comes as major newspapers increasingly step back from presidential endorsements, with the Los Angeles Times making a similar move this week. Washington Post publisher William Lewis said the decision marks a return to the paper's earlier practice of not endorsing presidential candidates, describing it as 'consistent with the values the Post has always stood for.' Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan According to internal sources cited by the Post, the paper's editorial board had prepared an endorsement of Harris over former President Donald Trump before the announcement. The reversal prompted criticism from Martin Baron, the Post's former executive editor, who called it 'cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.' The LA Times' decision triggered resignations from its editorial page editor and two editorial board members. Mariel Garza, the departing editorials editor, questioned how the paper could 'spend eight years railing against Trump and the danger his leadership poses to the country and then fail to endorse the perfectly decent Democrat challenger.' The shifts in both papers have highlighted the growing reluctance of news organizations to make presidential endorsements. The Minnesota Star Tribune also announced in August it would end the practice. Many newspapers are dropping endorsements as they struggle with declining readership and fear losing subscribers who disagree with their political positions. The trend comes as traditional media faces broader challenges, including evolving reader habits and the need to combat election misinformation. The current odds in every swing state Some major outlets still endorse, with most backing Harris over Trump While some major publications are stepping back from endorsements, others are maintaining the tradition. The New York Times, Boston Globe, Seattle Times, Las Vegas Sun and The New Yorker have endorsed Harris, while Trump has received backing from the New York Post. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently announced its support for Harris, coupling the endorsement with sharp criticism of Trump, whom they described as 'a convicted criminal, insurrectionist, tax dodger, sexual harasser, serial liar and Russian sympathizer.' The announcements come as Trump has renewed his attacks on the media, recently calling them 'the enemy of the people' at an Arizona rally and threatening to revoke CBS's broadcast license. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/newspapers-endorse-trump-harris/	2024-10-26T16:44:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/SEND-TO-DIGITAL-1.png?w=900
Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan	Former First Lady Michelle Obama hit the campaign trail for Vice President Harris in battleground Michigan on Saturday, blasting former President Trump and railing against what she cast as a double standard in the high-stakes presidential race. 'I gotta ask myself: why on earth is this race even close? I lay awake at night wondering: what in the world is going on?' Obama told a raucous rally crowd in Kalamazoo, Mich. The former first lady, an early endorser for Harris after President Biden's withdrawal from the race this summer, hammered a stark contrast between the two presidential race rivals as she sounded alarms about a second Trump term. Republicans push false claims about noncitizens voting. Here’s what to know 'I hope you'll forgive me if I'm a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump's gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,' Obama said. 'I hope that you'll forgive me if I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse, all of this while we pick apart Kamala’s answers from interviews that he doesn't even have the courage to do, y'all,' she added. Her searing remarks against the former president come as the polls show Harris and Trump neck-and-neck as Nov. 5 nears. Polling averages from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill put Harris up by a narrow 0.7 points nationally while, in the critical swing state of Michigan, the polling averages put the competitors at an exact tie. Obama said she's 'praying' that voters considering casting their ballot for Trump – and voters thinking about sitting out the election – will 'snap out of whatever fog we are in' before Election Day. Man charged for punching election worker after asking to remove Trump hat 'I am praying that we consider the decades of sacrifice and struggle by all of our ancestors, the folks who marched and sacrificed and shed their blood for us. We have to ask ourselves: is a vote for Trump or no vote at all the way we honor their lives? And if that's the case, well, that surely doesn't sound like freedom to me,' Obama said. The Kalamazoo stop marked Obama's first appearance on the campaign trail for Harris, and comes on the first day of early voting in Michigan. Her husband, former President Obama, has been making stops in key states throughout the month, and appeared with Harris in Georgia on Thursday. The Obamas have remained major voices in the Democratic Party since leaving the White House after the 2016 cycle, when Trump won his term in the Oval Office. Both gave memorable speeches at this summer's Democratic National Convention in Chicago as Harris accepted the party nomination. With less than two weeks until Election Day, the White House hopefuls and their surrogates are working in overdrive to crisscross key states as the polls show the race on a razor's edge.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/michelle-obama-harris-michigan/	2024-10-26T16:31:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300762169065.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr.'s presence on Michigan, Wisconsin ballots raises concerns...	Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presence on the ballot in the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin is raising concerns that he could inadvertently draw crucial votes from former President Trump. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and former independent candidate, this week formally asked the Supreme Court to scrub his name from the Badger State ballot, his last effort in an ongoing legal battle to remove himself from as many battleground ballots as possible in the final days of the presidential election. It appears unlikely, however, that Kennedy will be successful in his quest, which could end up having an unintended negative effect on Trump and may even help Vice President Harris on the margins in two Midwestern states. 'RFK Jr.’s manipulation of the system to get on the ballot where it helps Trump and off the ballot where it hurts was unprecedented and undemocratic,' Adrienne Watson, an adviser to the Democratic National Committee, told The Hill on Friday. 'Ironically, in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, where state law doesn’t allow candidates to withdraw from the ballot, he will likely be taking more votes from Trump than Harris,' Watson said. https://elections2024.thehill.com/michigan/harris_trump_michigan Before Kennedy agreed to drop his candidacy and become a surrogate for Trump, advisers close to both candidates devised a plan to get Kennedy off state ballots that could harm Trump’s chances against Harris. He didn’t bother trying to get off most ballots in blue states but worked to ensure that voters across the country would not be able to support him in true toss-ups. As part of that negotiation, Kennedy, who has been enlisted by the Trump campaign to persuade independents to vote Republican, has repeatedly told his supporters not to waste their ballots on him. 'I don’t want you to vote for me,' he said to fans who showed up at a Trump rally in Walker, Mich., in late September, trialing the message that he has pushed for the past month. Kennedy has since joined Trump at rallies and spoken at town halls on his behalf, abandoning the politics of his Democratic name and former party to go full-on MAGA and ensure that voters know he wants to reelect the former president. Trump has embraced Kennedy’s migration into his circle. He recently appeared to confirm that the nephew of John F. Kennedy will be given some kind of position in his administration if the GOP nominee is elected to a second term in office. 'He’s going to be a part of it,' Trump said about Kennedy this week, discussing his potential reentrance to the White House. 'Everybody likes Bobby.' For all the good feelings in Trump’s orbit, there’s a lingering debate about what may happen if Kennedy ends up pulling support from Trump in the critical 'blue wall' states he ultimately couldn’t get off of. Kennedy has managed to remove his name from consideration in most of the states that will help determine who heads to Pennsylvania Avenue in two weeks, including Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada. He contested Wisconsin the strongest after state officials denied his attempt to remove his candidacy. Officials refused to make an exception to their requirement that allows only death as a valid reason to delete a candidate’s name. Polling shows that Trump is ahead by a hair — 0.4 percentage points — in the state, according to the latest average by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. Kennedy’s strategy to wipe himself off all swing ballots is an indication that he believes his high name recognition and third-party posture could potentially cut into Trump’s slight lead. 'They couldn’t undo them all,' said one source close to Kennedy’s operation who is in touch with Trump surrogates. The 'GOP has been investing big out there,' the source said about Wisconsin, hoping to counteract any fringe support that could add up. 'Those votes are unlikely to be decisive,' said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way who has helped lead the anti-third-party attack for Democrats this cycle. 'But in a race this close, every swing-state vote matters. So, if those who would vote for Trump in a two-way race pull the lever for Kennedy’s ghost ship of a campaign, Democrats will gladly take it,' he said. In Michigan, there’s more optimism among Republicans and others sympathetic to the anti-Harris effort that the remaining third-party candidates will take votes from the Democratic nominee and deflate her prospects. 'I know Jill Stein and Cornel West are making a big play for dissatisfied Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan,' the pro-Kennedy source said. After Kennedy bowed out of the presidential contest, Democrats have homed in on Stein, West and Chase Oliver, the Libertarian nominee, as possible political anomalies that could impact Harris. In Democrats’ view, Stein proved her 'spoiler' bona fides in 2016 by sapping some votes from Hillary Clinton in Michigan and giving Trump a win. Kennedy could have a similar effect in the only places where his candidacy endures, but with an even more unpredictable outcome. 'RFK’s spoiler role in this race has always been unclear. We just don’t know who is attracted to his particular brand of weird,' Bennett said. 'But since he’s gone all-in for Trump … he has somehow gotten even crazier,' Bennett added. 'Democrats long ago ceded the lunatic lane to others, so the likeliest votes he collects are from folks who would otherwise support Trump or not vote.' Democrats are indeed tailoring a small part of their closing pitch to address Kennedy as well as the current crop of candidates, but they have become less frantic about the third-party threat without showing up more broadly on ballots nationwide. One former Democratic presidential candidate said they would be 'pretty surprised' if Kennedy’s name in the two battlegrounds would matter much for either major party on Nov. 5. 'Both sides should worry less about third party candidates and worry more about having popular policies that people love,' the ex-candidate said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-s-presence-on-michigan-wisconsin-ballots-raises-concerns-for-trump/	2024-10-26T14:46:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kennedyjrrober_trumpdonald_102324ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump woos voters in critical swing state Pennsylvani...	Former President Trump is rallying voters in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania Saturday afternoon. In his remarks, Trump is expected to address his economic agenda and target Vice President Harris and the Biden administration over inflation, rising costs and taxes on Social Security, overtime and tips, the campaign announced. The event comes nearly a week after Trump worked the drive thru and fry station at a McDonald's in the state. Pennsylvania is one of the most crucial battlegrounds for both parties with Election Day under two weeks away. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls shows Trump with a slight lead over Harris in the Keystone State — 48.5 percent to 48.3 percent. The former president also held a rally in battleground Michigan Saturday afternoon, as early voting began statewide. The rally in State Park, Pa., is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. EDT.

Vice President Harris will be joined by former first lady Michelle Obama Saturday afternoon at a rally in battleground Michigan, as early voting opens up statewide. The event marks the former first lady's first appearance on the trail with the Democratic nominee. Former President Obama has participated in multiple campaign events since endorsing her campaign after President Biden withdrew from the race. Harris has also held many star-studded rallies in recent weeks, as the race remains tight ahead of Election Day. Saturday's event comes on the heels of a rally in Houston, where Beyoncé made an appearance and endorsed the vice president. With just over a week until the election, Harris and her GOP rival, former President Trump, are tied in the Great Lakes State — each with 47.9 percent support, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls. Trump also campaigned in the 'blue wall' state earlier Saturday. The rally in Kalamazoo, Mich., is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

Israel's first open attack on Iran targets missile sites and appa...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel attacked military targets in Iran with pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired on Israel earlier this month. It was the first time Israel’s military has openly attacked Iran. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make the missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. Crucially, there was no indication that Iran’s oil or nuclear sites were struck. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage,' and Iranian state-run media downplayed them. Taken together, the moves suggested at least for now that both countries are trying to avoid a more serious escalation. Still, the strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. Following the airstrikes, Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying it 'considers itself entitled and obligated to defend against foreign acts of aggression.' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran has 'no limits' in defending its interests. But late Saturday, Iran's military issued a carefully worded statement suggesting any cease-fire in Israel's ground offensives in Gaza and Lebanon would trump any possible retaliatory strike. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said four people were killed, all with the military air defense. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. But the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees Iran’s vast ballistic missile arsenal, was silent, raising questions about whether anything had been hit at its bases. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Israel gave him a heads-up before the strikes and said it looked like 'they didn’t hit anything but military targets.' His administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit nuclear facilities and oil installations. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran’s nuclear facilities were not impacted. 'I hope this is the end,' Biden said. Israel's first open attack on Iran Iran hadn’t faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. Explosions could be heard in Tehran until sunrise. Israel is also widely thought to be behind a limited airstrike in April near a major air base in Iran that hit the radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery. Iran had earlier fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel, causing minimal damage, after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria. On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation for devastating blows Israel landed against Hezbollah. They caused minimal damage and a few injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran 'made a big mistake.' 'If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond,' Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. Images released by Israel’s military showed members preparing to depart for the strikes in American-made F-15 and F-16 warplanes. The Iranian military statement described Israel's warplanes as firing lightweight missiles at a distance of 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Iranian border. The missiles struck air defense radar stations, the military said, some of which were already under repair. Iran’s mission to the United Nations accused the U.S. of complicity in the attack, asserting that the U.S. controls Iraqi airspace. Israel’s attack did not take out highly visible or symbolic facilities that could prompt a significant response from Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at Tel Aviv’s Institute for National Security Studies who formerly worked for Israel’s National Security Council. It also gives Israel room for escalation if needed, and targeting air defense systems weakens Iran’s capabilities to defend against future attacks, he said, adding that if there is Iranian retaliation, it should be limited. 'By targeting military sites and missile facilities over nuclear and energy infrastructure, Israel is also messaging that it seeks no further escalation for now,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. After the strikes, the streets in Iran's capital were calm, with schools and shops open. There were long lines at the gas stations — a regular occurrence when military violence flares. But some residents seemed anxious and avoided conversations with an Associated Press reporter. Mixed reactions at home and abroad Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the decision to avoid 'strategic and economic targets,' saying on X that 'we could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran.' The United States warned against further retaliation, and Britain and Germany said Iran should not respond. 'All acts of escalation are condemnable and must stop,' the spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general said. Saudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Iran's 'sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.' Hezbollah and Hamas condemned Israel's attack. Regional tensions have been soaring. In Lebanon, dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israel launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut. Hezbollah warned 25 communities in northern Israel to evacuate Saturday, calling them 'legitimate military targets' because Israel was attacking the militant group from there. Enemies for decades Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for attacks on shipping in the Middle East. The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas. Some 100 remain, about a third believed to be dead. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in largely devastated Gaza, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half have been women and children. 'Those who were not killed by the bombing are dying from starvation. This is life,' said one woman displaced from northern Gaza, Madallah Abu Zaid. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Schreck from Jerusalem.

5 takeaways from Trump's 3-hour interview with Joe Rogan	Former President Trump sat with Joe Rogan Friday for a three-hour interview, marking the GOP nominee’s debut on one of the most popular podcasts in the country. The two men appeared to show a mutual admiration for one another, while the former president spoke at length about immigration, his intense reliance on tariffs for economic policy, and his unproven claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Rogan is one of the most popular and controversial media personalities in the country, with each of his episodes earning millions of downloads and often features conversations with top newsmakers. He is particularly popular with young men, who the Trump campaign has specifically targeted in the upcoming election. Senate Dems discussing plans to push through Harris would-be Cabinet Here are five takeaways from the interview. Trump and Rogan hit it off Rogan has previously said he is not a Trump supporter and in 2022 indicated he would not be interested in having the former president on the show. But the two appeared extremely comfortable with one another Friday, trading compliments and discussing their shared love of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events. 'You cannot be voting for Kamala. You’re not a Kamala person. I know you. I’ve watched you,' Trump told the podcast host. 'You know what, without speaking to you I know you, I think I know you, maybe almost as well as your wife.' He later added that he thought Rogan knew 'everything … as a student of yours.' 'One of the beautiful things about you is that you freeball,' Rogan said, telling the former president that he thought his impression mocking President Biden was 'funny stuff.' Five things to know about Israel’s attack on Iran The two went on an extended tangent about boxing and UFC events, talking about their mutual friendship with UFC president Dana White. Rogan has worked as a play-by-play announcer at UFC events, while Trump has attended numerous fights and was introduced by White at the July GOP convention. 'I want to do it again with you,' Trump said as he wrapped up the interview. 'You are something…you are a fascinating guy.' Trump says RFK Jr. would have administration role, but it won’t be ‘environmental’ Rogan had previously expressed support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran an independent White House bid before suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump in late August. The podcast host asked Trump on Friday whether he was set on having Kennedy be part of his administration if he wins in November. 'Oh I am. The only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental,' Trump said. 'Because you know, he doesn’t like oil, I love oil and gas. So I’m just going to keep him out…I said, ‘Focus on health. You can do whatever you want.’ But I gotta be a little careful with the liquid gold.' Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says Trump told Rogan he has faced pressure from some not to work with Kennedy, citing the pharmaceutical industry. The two then had an extended discussion about systemic health issues facing the country, with the podcast host suggesting if there was a greater focus on 'metabolic health,' there wouldn’t be such a need for pharmaceutical drugs. Rogan has in the past drawn backlash for some of his anti-vaccine rhetoric, including when he hosted a prominent anti-vaccine influencer on his show in 2022. Kennedy has similarly drawn criticism for some of his anti-vaccine comments. He has led an initiative for the Trump campaign dubbed 'Make America Healthy Again.' Podcast underscores Trump appeal to young voters The Trump campaign has invested significant time and energy courting young men, with a particular focus on the former president’s media appearances. Trump’s sit-down with Rogan was yet another extension of that strategy. 'So I have a son who’s very smart, and tall, Barron. And he knows all about you,' Trump said. 'He knows about guys I never heard of…it’s a whole new world out there. But you know, I’m on TikTok now. And I’ve done really well.' Rogan’s podcast draws more than 15 million followers on Spotify, and his YouTube channel boasts more than 17 million subscribers. He is particularly popular with young men, and he spoke to the concerns of younger voters during Friday’s interview. Georgia 9th grader invents AI tool to detect pesticides on food 'I think young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshit. Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded,' Rogan said. 'They’re tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what they think the moral standards of society should be today…You wanna be a rebel? You wanna be punk rock? You wanna, like, buck the system? You’re a conservative now,' he added. A new Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters ages 18-29 found Vice President Harris leading Trump by 20 percentage points among young voters under 30. Harris leads by 30 points among young women and by 10 points among young men. Rogan gives Trump time to air election fraud claims Trump has for the past four years refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and claimed without evidence there was widespread fraud that changed the outcome. Rogan on Friday gave the former president space to explain his claims. 'How do you think you were robbed? Everybody always cuts you off,' Rogan said. 'What I’d rather do is –we’ll do it another time. I would bring in papers that you would not believe. That election was so crooked,' Trump said, at one point repeating the false claim that he did not lose in 2020. Pressed for examples, the former president argued that state legislatures did not properly approve changes to ballot deadlines and collection methods. State lawmakers moved quickly in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic to adjust voting laws to make it easier to vote early and by mail. 'They used COVID to cheat,' Trump said. He further claimed that a letter from dozens of former intelligence agents asserting that a laptop belonging to the president's son, Hunter Biden, that was revealed in the closing weeks of the 2020 campaign was Russian disinformation cost him enough votes to flip the election for Biden. McDonald’s E. coli outbreak hits 3 more states, 26 new cases reported Trump went on to argue that using paper ballots would guard against fraud, and the former president and Rogan agreed that states should enact voter ID laws. The GOP nominee has routinely invoked his distrust in the 2020 results at campaign rallies, calling the election 'rigged' or fraudulent. Democrats have warned Trump poses a threat to democracy because of his refusal to accept the results. The former president and his allies brought numerous lawsuits after the 2020 election alleging fraud, but they were dismissed because of lack of evidence or lack of standing. Trump has been indicted in Washington, D.C., on federal charges over his efforts to remain in power after losing the election. Trump opines on extraterrestrial life and UFOs Rogan has repeatedly shown an interest in the prospect of aliens and UFOs on his show, and he used his interview with Trump to press the former president on what he knew from his time in office. 'What did they tell you? How much can you tell?' Rogan asked. 'It’s never been my thing. I have to be honest,' Trump replied. 'I’ve never been a believer.' The former president recounted interviewing pilots who claimed they saw round objects moving rapidly through the sky. 'I get that question as much as almost any question. ‘Do you think we have aliens flying around or whatever,’' he said. 'There’s no reason not to — I mean there’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life... Well, maybe it’s life that we don’t know.' Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) burst into the spotlight last year following testimony from three former Defense Department officials who told a House panel’s national security subcommittee that sightings of UAPs could pose national security risks.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/takeaways-trumps-interview-joe-rogan/	2024-10-26T12:02:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Joe-Rogan-10.26.png?w=900
Georgia 9th grader invents AI tool to detect pesticides on food	(NewsNation) — Sirish Subash is no ordinary ninth-grade student. The 14-year-old from Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology in Snellville, Georgia, was named America's top young scientist after winning the 2024 3M Young Scientist Challenge. The reason? Subash's creation of an AI handheld pesticide detector named 'Pestiscand.' The creation was devised after washing food with his mother before a meal. 'It works on a method called spectrophotometry. Now what this means is that it uses different ways that light interacts with different chemicals to look for different chemicals on the produce,' Subash told 'Morning in America with Hena Doba.' 'Each chemical reflects different parts or wavelengths of light, and that creates a spectral signature, which is basically a catalog of what wavelengths are reflected back. So, 'Pestiscand' can look for those wavelengths that are reflected by side residues on the produce.' Former trucker helping extend driver’s short life expectancy While the product is not on the market for the broader public at this time, Subash aims to dedicate his time to ensuring it has mass availability in the near future. 'I want to continue developing projects like 'Pestiscand' and eventually get them out to the world, to the market. That's one of my goals for 'Pestiscand', to get it out to everyone,' Subash added. In his downtime, Subash enjoys reading both fiction and non-fiction and making origami.

Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says	(NEXSTAR) — A new report has found that nearly a third of Gen Z — also known as Zoomers — already feel financially secure thanks to having both a job and a side hustle, particularly in certain cities around the U.S. Due to the current economy, most Zoomers are looking for that sense of security and are willing to do whatever it takes to find it, the study suggests. According to LendingTree, at least 55% of young Americans have a side hustle on top of their current job. Thanks to the extra work, they're making an extra $1,253, on average. IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? Gen Zers in some areas of the country are doing much better than others, however. MoneyGeek looked at data from cities across the U.S., using various metrics to determine where young adults are thriving in areas such as economic opportunity and quality of life. What the final data shows is that Zoomers are having better luck financially out West. This is due to the average median household income in the West sitting at $53,497 — nearly $12,000 more than the next closest region, the Northeast. As for cities in the region, Salt Lake City, Utah, lands at the top of the list. The city has seen a 41% growth in its young adult population and holds the lowest federal student loan debt per borrower at $11,062. Here’s what to do if you lose an absentee ballot before Election Day Rounding out the rest of the top five are Abilene, Texas; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; and finally Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran's shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-five-things-to-know-about-israels-attack-on-iran/	2024-10-26T08:20:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671d090e246de7.17081096.jpeg?w=900

IDF confirms Israeli strikes in Tehran	(NewsNation) — Israel Defense Forces offensive and defensive units are 'fully mobilized' against military targets in Iran, the IDF confirmed Friday night. 'In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,' the organization said. It did not say the exact target of the attacks. Israel informed senior White House officials of the attacks in the hours prior, sources told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. Defense officials say the U.S. had no involvement in Israel's operation, and President Joe Biden has been briefed on the attacks. 'We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st. We would refer you to the Israeli government for more information on their operation,' National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett told NewsNation. US government issues worldwide alert on Israel-related demonstrations Explosions were heard in Iran's Tehran and nearby Karaj, state media reported Friday. Iran's state TV said multiple explosions were heard in the capital, but no origin was known. A Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. ‘Worst humanitarian crisis we’ve seen since WWII’: Doctor on Gaza 'Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond ... We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.' IDF's statement read. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to the Middle East this week to speak with leaders about a possible cease-fire, returning just hours before the IDF's Friday strikes in Tehran. Iranian-Israeli tensions Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. Israel and Iran have been locked in a yearslong shadow war. A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. But since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, the battle has increasingly moved into the open. Israel has recently turned its attention to Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Throughout the year, a number of top Iranian military figures have been killed in Israeli strikes in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli strikes killed 38 people in Gaza and three journalists in Lebanon on Friday morning. More than 42,000 Palestinians have died since the start of the war, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says.

Senate Dems discussing plans to push through Harris would-be Cabi...	(NewsNation) — Worried about Vice President Kamala Harris potentially facing a Republican-controlled Senate if she wins the White House, two Democratic strategists tell NewsNation senators are discussing an emergency plan to approve her Cabinet during a December Senate session. The Senate is currently controlled by the Democrats, but lawmakers in the party are facing an 'increasingly tough road' to keeping it this way, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Democrats face a difficult Senate map, with multiple incumbents in solidly GOP territory. Republican candidates in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are quickly closing the gap, The Hill reports, and 'blue wall' states are now all deemed 'toss-ups' by Cook Political Report.

Biden would then appoint Harris' picks, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would then confirm the new Cabinet with his current 51 to 49 Senate. One source, however, conceded that this might not be possible. At that point, the source said, Harris would have to decide who in Biden's Cabinet she would want to keep on. Questions also remain about whether Harris, if she beats Republican former president Donald Trump, could develop a Cabinet list and vet her appointees before a new Senate comes in. 'Sen. Schumer is focused on winning a Democratic majority in the Senate that will work to confirm future President Kamala Harris’s Cabinet,' a spokesperson for the New York Democrat said in a statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/senate-democrats-harris-cabinet/	2024-10-25T13:54:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179658368.jpg?w=900
Chinese hackers may have accessed Trump, Harris campaign phones	(NewsNation) — Chinese hackers targeted data from phones used by both the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns, according to reports. NewsNation also confirmed, per a Democratic source briefed, that the Chinese Communist Party hack targeted prominent Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s staff. The New York Times first reported hackers may have had access to phones used by former President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. A source then confirmed with NewsNation that 'People affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign were also targeted.' It was unclear whether the hackers could have gained access to data stored on the devices. The New York Times report says the Trump campaign was made aware of the possible breach this week. US on alert for election interference from Russia, China, Iran In a statement to NewsNation, the Trump campaign blamed Harris’ campaign for the reported hack. 'This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House,' the statement read in part. The Wall Street Journal Friday reported hackers also targeted 'people affiliated with Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign.' Foreign adversaries have shown continued determination to influence the U.S. election, tech giant Microsoft has warned. The U.S. has seen an uptick in cyberattacks from Russia, China and Iran as the election nears, according to the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center.

The current odds in every battleground state	(NewsNation) — The 2024 presidential race can be summed up in a single phrase: 'It's anybody's ballgame.' NewsNation's election partner Decision Desk HQ shows former President Donald Trump with a 52% chance of winning and Vice President Kamala Harris with a 48% chance as of midday Oct. 25. Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Famed polling expert Nate Silver currently shows Harris with a 1.3-point lead nationally but slightly behind in several key battleground states. 'In an election where the seven battleground states are all polling within a percentage point or two, 50-50 is the only responsible forecast,' Silver wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed. Those seven states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — will ultimately decide the election. Here's what the polls currently show in each. Note: This story will be updated as polling changes. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Arizona Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 58% Harris: 42% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 49.3% Harris: 47.3% Who has the momentum? Silver's model suggests Harris had a slight lead in Arizona at the end of August. Poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight showed the two candidates tied as recently as mid-September. Over the past month, Trump has opened up a narrow two-point advantage in the state. What to watch: About 1 in 4 Arizona voters are Latino, and Trump has made inroads with that group, particularly among men. Harris will try to improve on Democrats' performance with suburbanites around Phoenix, particularly 'John McCain Republicans,' many of whom have rejected Trump. Georgia Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 62% Harris: 38% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 49.0% Harris: 47.6% Who has the momentum? Harris had a slight advantage in early September, but since then, Trump has pulled ahead. He currently holds a +1.4 polling lead according to Silver's model and a +1.6 advantage per FiveThirtyEight. What to watch: If Trump has improved among Black voters, as polls show, then that will likely show up in Georgia, one of the most racially diverse swing states. Meanwhile, Harris needs to perform well in the growing suburbs around metro Atlanta, which have turned increasingly blue in recent elections. Michigan Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Harris: 58% Trump: 42% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Harris: 48.1% Trump: 47.3% Who has the momentum? A month ago, polls showed Harris with a two-point lead in the state; now, the two candidates are separated by less than a point. What to watch: Michigan is home to more than 200,000 Muslim registered voters, and over the past year, Muslims' support for the Democratic Party has dropped. Much of that is due to frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. It remains to be seen how many of those voters will shift Trump's way, but they could have a major impact on the outcome. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Nevada is another state where Trump has recently closed the gap, and he's now within 0.3 points, according to Silver's model. A month ago, Harris had a one-point lead. What to watch: Like Arizona, Nevada has a significant share of Latino voters, which could swing things either way in the state's population center, Clark County.

Pennsylvania is the swingiest swing state and likely the most important. At this point, the two are roughly tied. In early September, Harris and Trump were neck and neck before Harris opened up a slight lead as the month progressed. Since then, Trump has pulled even and currently holds a 0.2-point polling lead, per Silver's model. What to watch: In 10 of the last 12 elections, the winner of Pennsylvania has gone on to win the race. In some ways, it's the place where every election narrative collides — a microcosm of the U.S. at large. Both candidates are competing for the state's fast-growing Hispanic community. Turnout among Black voters in the heavily Democratic Philadelphia area could also play an outsized role. There are also the swing counties themselves, historically blue-collar areas like Erie County that could go either way. Wisconsin Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 53% Harris: 47% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Harris: 48.5% Trump: 48.0% Who has the momentum? Harris has a half-point lead according to Silver's model, but again, that's tighter compared to a month ago when she led by about two points. What to watch: The traditionally red Milwaukee suburbs, the so-called 'WOW counties,' have become less so in recent elections. If Harris can build on Democrats' gains in those areas — Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington — she could win the state. On the other hand, if Democratic voters don't turn out in Milwaukee County — and Trump holds his lead in rural areas — the former president could recreate his 2016 victory that saw the state turn red for the first time since 1984.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/current-odds-battleground-state/	2024-10-25T10:50:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.10.png?w=900
Why is Florida suing DOJ over apparent Trump assassination plot?	(NewsNation) — Federal officials have hamstrung state investigative efforts surrounding an alleged assassination plot against former President Donald Trump, Florida’s Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody said. Moody filed a lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday. She’s accusing federal authorities of blocking the state’s investigation after the Justice Department told Florida to temporarily halt its efforts while the federal probe is underway. 'When Gov. DeSantis rightfully issued an executive order to make sure we were fully pursuing state-law crimes, immediately — we started getting pushback when we were trying to collect evidence and further that investigation,' Moody said on 'Morning in America.' Biden apologizes for Indian boarding school policy Florida officials were told not to interview witnesses and that they could only cooperate with the federal investigation, the lawsuit alleges. Justice Department officials cited the federal law, which says the FBI is charged with investigating attempted political candidate assassinations and that state law enforcement should hold off on its investigative efforts in the meantime. 'I was a federal prosecutor before my life led me to become a judge and the attorney general,' Moody said. 'I understand the nature of the federal investigatory authorities working hand-in-hand with the state officials. That is common … that is why this is so short-sighted.' Virginia ordered to restore 1,600 canceled voter registrations Ryan Routh, the man whom police arrested in connection with the apparent plan, is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer and attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. He’s pleaded not guilty to each charge. Investigators say Routh pointed a rifle through a tree line on Sept. 15 at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where the former president and GOP presidential nominee was playing. Unlike the gunman behind the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Routh isn’t accused of firing a weapon.

Judge orders Virginia to restore 1,600 voter registrations cancel...	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to restore more than 1,600 voter registrations that she said were illegally purged in the last two months in an effort to stop noncitizens from voting. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request brought against Virginia election officials by the Justice Department, which claimed the voter registrations were wrongly canceled during a 90-day quiet period ahead of the November election that restricts states from making large-scale changes to their voter rolls. State officials said they will appeal. The Justice Departmen t and private groups, including the League of Women Voters, said many of the 1,600 voters whose registrations were canceled were in fact citizens whose registrations were canceled because of bureaucratic errors or simple mistakes like a mischecked box on a form. Justice Department lawyer Sejal Jhaveri said during an all-day injunction hearing Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, that's precisely why federal law prevents states from implementing systematic changes to the voter rolls in the 90 days before an election, 'to prevent the harm of having eligible voters removed in a period where it's hard to remedy.' Giles said Friday that the state is not completely prohibited from removing noncitizens from the voting rolls during the 90-day quiet period, but that it must do so on an individualized basis rather than the automated, systematic program employed by the state. State officials argued unsuccessfully that the canceled registrations followed careful procedures that targeted people who explicitly identified themselves as noncitizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Charles Cooper, a lawyer for the state, said during arguments Thursday that the federal law was never intended to provide protections to noncitizens, who by definition can't vote in federal elections. 'Congress couldn't possibly have intended to prevent the removal ... of persons who were never eligible to vote in the first place,' Cooper argued. The plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, though, said that many people are wrongly identified as noncitizens by the DMV simply by checking the wrong box on a form. They were unable to identify exactly how many of the 1,600 purged voters are in fact citizens — Virginia only identified this week the names and addresses of the affected individuals in response to a court order — but provided anecdotal evidence of individuals whose registrations were wrongly canceled. Cooper acknowledged that some of the 1,600 voters identified by the state as noncitizens may well be citizens, but he said restoring all of them to the rolls means that in all likelihood 'there's going to hundreds of noncitizens back on those rolls. If a noncitizen votes, it cancels out a legal vote. And that is a harm,' he said. Virginia's Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, issued an executive order in August requiring daily checks of DMV data against voter rolls to identify noncitizens. State officials said any voter identified as a noncitizen was notified and given two weeks to dispute their disqualification before being removed. If they returned a form attesting to their citizenship, their registration would not be canceled. Prior to Youngkin's executive order, the state did monthly checks of the voter rolls against DMV data, in accordance with a state law passed in 2006. Youngkin said the Justice Department was wrongly targeting him for upholding a law that was followed by his predecessors, including Democrats, even if they didn't take the extra step of ordering daily checks as he did in his executive order. 'Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals–who self-identified themselves as noncitizens–back onto the voter rolls.,' Youngkin said in a statement after Friday's hearing. Giles, for her part, questioned the timing of Youngkin's executive order, which was issued on Aug. 7, the very beginning of the 90-day quiet period required under federal law. 'It's not happenstance that this was announced exactly on the 90th day' of the quiet period, she said Friday from the bench. Her injunction requires voter registrations be restored for all of those canceled as a result of Youngkin's executive order, and that letters be sent out within five days informing those voters of their restored status. The letters will also include a note of caution informing those individuals that if they are indeed noncitizens, that they are barred from casting ballots under federal law. The plaintiffs had asked the judge to grant those voters an extension of the deadline to request absentee ballots, but Giles denied that request, saying it would result in confusion. 'We may not be able to achieve everything we would want,' she said. Virginia's Republican attorney general, Jason Miyares, issued a statement after Friday's hearing criticizing the ruling. 'It should never be illegal to remove an illegal voter,' he said. 'Yet, today a Court – urged by the Biden-Harris Department of Justice – ordered Virginia to put the names of non-citizens back on the voter rolls, mere days before a presidential election.' U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., who had alerted Justice Department officials to the removals. praised the ruling. 'Governor Youngkin’s purges have served only one purpose – to disenfranchise thousands of lawfully voting citizens of the Commonwealth. That stops today,' he said. Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote. A similar lawsuit was filed in Alabama, and a federal judge there last week ordered the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-judge-orders-virginia-to-restore-1600-voter-registrations-canceled-in-effort-to-purge-noncitizens/	2024-10-25T10:28:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671bd5fca14604.29927424.jpeg?w=900
McDonald's E. coli outbreak hits 3 more states, 26 new cases repo...	(NewsNation) — Health officials on Friday announced 26 new E. coli cases among people who ate at McDonald’s amid an outbreak linked to the fast-food chain’s Quarter Pounder burger. The new cases bring the total number of known infections to 75. Twenty-two people have been hospitalized and one person has died. Risk to the public remains low as McDonald’s and one of its onion suppliers take action to identify the root of the contamination, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Jimmy Johns introduces limited-run ‘Picklewich’ The outbreak now spans 13 states including Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, and portions of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, according to the CDC. McDonald’s restaurants in each state have temporarily stopped using their current supply of Quarter Pounder slivered onions and beef patties. Investigators are working to confirm which ingredient is making people sick and whether other restaurants might be affected. The patties in question are only used on Quarter Pounders. Fresh-slivered onions are likewise used primarily for that burger. Taylor Farms, which supplies slivered onions to the affected restaurants, issued a voluntary recall. The food supplier asked customers to stop using some onions while the investigation is ongoing. The CDC encourages anyone with E. coli symptoms should call their doctor. Symptoms include: Diarrhea and a fever higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit So much vomiting that you cannot keep liquids down Signs of dehydration, such as less frequent urination, dry mouth and throat, and dizziness upon standing	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/recalls/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-26-new-cases-onions-quarter-pounder/	2024-10-25T09:51:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180538535.jpg?w=900
WATCH LIVE: Biden visits Indian Country, apologizes for 150-year-...	Watch Biden's remarks live in the video player above. He is scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m. ET. PHOENIX (AP) — President Joe Biden is using his long-promised first presidential visit to Indian Country to formally apologize to Native Americans on Friday for a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated Indian children from their parents. Democrats hope Biden's visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s land on the outskirts of metro Phoenix in Arizona will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. Biden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would make a visit to Indian Country. The president, in an exchange with reporters Thursday before departing for Arizona, said an apology for the U.S. government’s role in the abuse and neglect of Native children was 'something that should have been done a long time ago.' For decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate children into white society, according to the White House. The moment will also give Biden a chance to spotlight his and Harris' support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to improve turnout among bedrock supporters. 'The race is now a turnout grab,' said Mike O’Neil, a non-partisan pollster based in Arizona. 'The trendlines throughout have been remarkably steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow margins.' Biden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July. But analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native American voters — a group that has trailed others in turnout rates. In 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996. Biden is making the visit in his official capacity, and a formal apology — something tribes have long sought — seems certain to garner attention among Native Americans across the country. At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government’s abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in 1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for a U.S. government apology. At least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them. 'President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,' said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. 'I do think that will reflect well on Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.' She added that whoever is the next president must follow up with concrete action and begin making amends for the devastation the boarding schools wrought on tribes. Democrats have stepped up outreach to Native American communities. Both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, met with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe. The Democratic National Committee recently launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska through digital, print and radio ads. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is locked in a competitive race with Republican Kari Lake for Arizona's open Senate seat, has visited all 22 of Arizona's federally recognized tribes. Harris started a recent campaign rally in Chandler, near where the Gila River reservation is located, with a shoutout to the tribe's leader. She also reminded the crowd that she was the first vice president to visit the reservation. She and husband Doug Emhoff visited the community last year. 'I strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations and the United States is sacred ... and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust in treaty obligations, and ensure tribal self-determination,' Harris said. The White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years. He designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in Nevada and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. In addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and more. Biden picked former New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as his Interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico. She, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government's boarding school policies that is leading Biden to deliver the formal apology. 'He made commitments to Indian Country, and he has followed through on every single one of those commitments,' Haaland said. Thom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University, said both Harris' and Trump's campaigns — and their allies — have put a remarkable amount of effort into micro-targeting in Arizona. Harris, Reilly noted, has also focused on whittling away at Trump's advantage among Mormon voters in the state, a group that historically has favored Republicans. Trump, meanwhile, has put special focus on young men as the campaign tries to narrow Democrats' advantage with younger voters. 'They are pulling out every stop just to see if they could wrangle a few more votes here and there,' Reilly said. 'The Indian community is one of those groups that Harris is hoping will overperform and help make the difference.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/watch-biden-visits-indian-country-apologizes-for-150-year-old-boarding-school-policy/	2024-10-25T09:20:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24299024866592.jpg?w=900
Rapper 'Lil Durk' arrested in connection to murder-for-hire plot	(NewsNation) — Grammy award-winning rapper 'Lil Durk' was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Florida on Thursday in connection to an alleged murder-for-hire plot. Chicago native Durk Banks, 32, was booked into the Broward County Jail, pending charges of murder-for-hire, according to jail records. No further details have been released regarding Banks' charges.

Undecided voter likes Vance's pledge to unify country after elect...	(NewsNation) — 'I want my friends back.' That’s how Rebecca Sander explained her question to Sen. JD Vance during his NewsNation town hall Thursday. Sander asked Vance how he and Donald Trump will bring the country together if they’re elected. 'Two weeks from today, half of our country is going to be devastated,' Sander said. 'I feel like Trump can’t bring unity even if he tries really hard, so the fact that Vance feels some ownership there' is reassuring, she told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo after the event.

I’m undecided if I’m even gonna vote at the top of the ticket,' Ayesha Langston said. 'I’m disgusted with Washington. I don’t even know about the Senate race. I’m going to vote on my local (races).' Langston said she has not been satisfied with either side’s answers about helping those at the lowest end of America’s economic scale, no matter where they live. Vance critical of Ronald Reagan for homelessness crisis 'People in the projects have the same problems as people in the trailer parks. And yet they’re voting for Trump, and they tell us in the city that we have to vote for Harris, and I’m just not with that.' Langston did acknowledge that she came away with a favorable opinion of Vance. 'I wanted to see how he interacted with us. And I actually did like him. It would be better if he was at the top of the ticket, (but) I still might not vote for him,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-town-hall-participants-want-unity-tired-of-divisions/	2024-10-24T20:49:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/072BD60534169BC7CDE1ADB5C7FD6156.jpg?w=900
O'Reilly: Cuomo made 'big mistake' while questioning Vance	(NewsNation) — Political commentator Bill O’Reilly said NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo did not push Ohio Sen. JD Vance hard enough during a NewsNation town hall Thursday, particularly when addressing the 'divisive rhetoric' he and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, have used in the campaign. Cuomo 'let Vance off,' O'Reilly told NewsNation on Thursday evening. 'I would have brought in two examples of divisive rhetoric. Not to try to 'gotcha,' but to see if Vance has perspective on it,' O’Reilly told Cuomo. During the town hall, Cuomo asked Vance if he wished he had handled things differently when it came to his previous false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. 'Do I wish that I had been better in that moment? Maybe,' Vance answered. He then quickly pivoted to saying he was just listening to people in his community because he needed to trust constituents over the media. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? 'What am I supposed to do? Hang up the phone and tell them they're a liar because the media doesn't want me to talk about it?' Vance asked. 'One of the things that I've learned in my time in the United States Senate is that sometimes the media doesn't always listen to people.' Vance also blamed the media for chasing the comments about the pets instead of focusing on the hardships in the town as a result of an influx of immigrants. O'Reilly believed Cuomo missed an opportunity in his questioning of Vance by not focusing on the fiscal reality of the migrant crisis. Vance 'would have been way ahead if he goes, ‘You know, that probably wasn't the best thing for us to do,’' and instead focused on the financial strain of the influx, O’Reilly said. 'We have statistics like $350 million just this year on illegal immigrants. It's unsustainable. You don't have to go into the Alpo thing with the dogs and the cats ... you open yourself up to all kinds of charges with the media gleefully hopping on,' he said. He added, 'Americans like it when you [politicians] admit a mistake.' Cuomo defended his line of questioning, telling O’Reilly that apologies are 'weaponized' in modern day politics so it’s rare for a lawmaker to admit any fault. 'You really get beaten over the head with apologies in politics now,' Cuomo said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/oreilly-cuomo-mistake-vance-migrants/	2024-10-24T20:36:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/bill-O-vance-color.png?w=800
Vance: Housing costs are biggest threat to the American dream	(NewsNation) — Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance called high housing costs 'the biggest threat to the American dream' during a NewsNation town hall Thursday. 'So many people in my generation — they're delaying having families, they're delaying getting married because they can't afford a place to raise a family,' Vance told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. Low inventory, elevated mortgage rates and record-high prices have turned buying a home from a dream into a nightmare in recent years. At the same time, rising child care costs have stretched families' finances and caused others to delay having kids altogether. Here’s what Vance said he would do to bring down the cost of housing and child care. Vance says he stands with Trump on abortion Tackling the housing shortage The U.S. housing market is short 4.5 million homes, which has kept inventory tight and pushed prices to record highs despite a drop in sales. Vance said he would make it easier to build houses by lowering energy costs and easing regulatory burdens. 'Our ancestors went to the moon with pocket calculators and slide rulers, and now, our government makes it way too hard to build the homes that we need,' he said. VP candidate @JDVance says two problems with housing in the U.S. are supply and demand. Vance says there aren&#39;t enough homes being built for those living here, and that too many people are coming into the country illegally, further driving demand: https://t.co/zg6reSMxvO… pic.twitter.com/rlEErLSENk&mdash; NewsNation (@NewsNation) October 25, 2024 Another part of the solution, Vance argues, should be aimed at lowering demand by securing the southern border. He said it’s no coincidence housing costs have risen at the same time as illegal immigration. 'When you let those folks in your country at the level that we have, well, you’ve got to put them somewhere,' Vance said. 'Those are homes that aren't going to American citizens.' While it’s true more people in need of housing leads to higher demand, economists have warned that tightening immigration could worsen existing labor shortages in the construction industry, further constraining supply. During Thursday's town hall, Vance said he would drive down mortgage rates by further curbing inflation. Lowering the cost of child care For millions of Americans, child care, not housing, is their biggest monthly expense. To bring down costs, Vance emphasized the need for flexibility and said he wants to expand the number of child care providers by moving away from the federal government’s 'one-size-fits-all model.' 'The federal government actually makes it really hard for anybody other than the people who are currently providing child care to get into that job,' Vance said.

Vance critical of Ronald Reagan for homelessness crisis	(NewsNation) — Republican Ohio Senator JD Vance was critical of former President Ronald Reagan’s decision to cut mental health services decades ago, saying it has contributed to a present-day homelessness crisis. During a NewsNation town hall Thursday, Vance said the 'homelessness problem in this country, especially in our big cities, is completely out of control.' 'I’m going to criticize President Reagan going back 40 years because President Reagan made a decision to cut mental health care in this country, and the decision that we made collectively as a nation was to let people live on the streets instead of sometimes being committed to inpatient mental health facilities,' he said. Vance appears to be referring to Reagan, a Republican, repealing the Mental Health Systems Act in 1981, which was signed by his predecessor, Democratic former President Jimmy Carter. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? Under the Mental Health Systems Act, the government would have funded federal community mental health center programs first envisioned under President John F. Kennedy. Reagan cut Carter’s legislation with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which pushed the responsibility of mentally ill patients back to the states, according to KQED. By 2004, the Department of Justice estimated that 10% of state prisoners had symptoms that met the criteria for a psychotic disorder. Vance said that in the aftermath of Reagan’s decision, taxpayers have had to 'pick up the burden' of caring for the mentally ill, many who end up homeless or in local jails instead of health centers. 'I don't think that it's compassionate to let the mentally ill fester on the streets. Some of them have addiction problems, some of them have other health problems. I think we need to get back to saying that if you have real mental health problems, you've got to go to an inpatient treatment facility, get the care that you need,' Vance said. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? According to the National Alliance on Mental Health, 21% of people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. have a serious mental health condition, and research has found that homelessness is associated with a higher prevalence of mental and substance use disorders when compared to stably housed individuals. Vance called Reagan’s decision a 'mistake.' 'I think all leaders should be able to say we made a mistake. Let's try something that actually works,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-ronald-reagan-homelessness-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:32:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Vance-Thumbnail-5-1.png?w=800
Trump asks Vance to tell him why he's 'brilliant' during town hal...	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump phoned into NewsNation’s town hall with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Thursday to ask his vice presidential pick to describe how 'brilliant' he is. 'How brilliant is Donald J. Trump?' the former president jokingly asked and then quipped that the 'answer should be easy.' Trump’s question elicited a burst of laughter from Vance, who answered, 'Of course, you’re very brilliant.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views Vance then jumped into the story of the first time his wife Usha met the former president in an attempt to show Trump’s relatability while his running mate stayed on the call. He said his wife was nervous about meeting Trump but that the former president made a joke off the bat that 'immediately broke the barrier.' 'It wasn't the former president. It was just a person talking to my wife,' he said of the interaction. 'That ability to relate to anybody in any environment — I think that's the true brilliance of Donald J. Trump.' The former president returned the praise, calling his running mate’s campaign performance 'fantastic' and saying that he couldn’t be happier as Vance has 'captivated' voters. Trump also sarcastically asked Vance how brilliant his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was, which Vance said would be 'tough' to answer. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? The former president also did not forgo the opportunity to say that he was leading by a 'landslide' in the polls during his brief call. 'We’re very happy about it,' he said. A Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast showed Trump having a slight lead Thursday, with polling still showing that the outcome remains a toss-up.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-vance-brilliant-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:17:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/Vance_073024_Photo_Getty.png?w=900
Vance says he stands with Trump on abortion	(NewsNation) — Republican Sen. JD Vance pushed back on the idea that his position on abortion contrasts with that of his running mate, former president Donald Trump, during NewsNation’s town hall Thursday. The GOP vice presidential candidate said he and Trump both fundamentally want the same thing, which is to make it easier for Americans to 'choose life' and that the former president has been clear about leaving the matter up to the states. 'He wants to, first of all, make it easier for people to choose life to begin with, make it less expensive, help address child care costs and make it easier for young families to choose life in the first place,' the Ohio senator said during the event in Michigan. Vance said Trump has been 'consistent' in his position that states should make decisions on reproductive rights. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? The issue has become a vulnerability for Republicans in this year’s election. Trump trails Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue of abortion, according to polling from The Associated Press this week. This week, the Republican presidential nominee said some abortion laws are 'too tough' and would be 'redone.' He also said earlier this month a national abortion ban was 'off the table,' adding 'that issue has been, in my opinion, largely diffused.' Trump nominated three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the nationwide right to abortion two years ago. Vance is opposed to abortion and called himself '100% pro-life' even in cases of rape and incest during his 2022 Senate run, telling The Washington Post in 2021, 'Two wrongs don’t make a right.' However, Vance said during the town hall that Trump was the leader of the Republican Party and that his policy determines where the GOP stands on the issue. 'Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, so his policy determines what we're to do as a Republican governing coalition,' he said. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? While he made the point at Thursday’s town hall, he also said that he 'cares about protecting the vulnerable,' referring to unborn babies. Vance said many women he saw having abortions growing up had to do so because they felt they had no other options. 'If we stop the crazy medical bills that young women come home with when they have a baby, if we make it easier to access child care, I actually think, one, we will earn the trust of the American people, but, two, we will actually be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word,' he said during the town hall. Vance also said he is concerned about young families choosing not to have children. 'They're choosing not to bring new life into the world. Even though they say they would like to, they feel like they can't afford it. That is such a failure of our present leadership that a lot of people would like to have families but can’t. We’ve got to change that,' he said. When asked if reproductive rights could affect the outcome of the election, Vance responded he is not a 'political prognosticator' and that his only job is to make his case to the American people.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-trump-abortion-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:08:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/NN_8741.jpg?w=900
Phoenix police arrest mailbox arson suspect; some ballots damaged	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Postal Service and the Arson Task Force of the Phoenix Police Department are trying to determine how many ballots were damaged or destroyed when a man set fire to a mailbox early Thursday morning. 'I am concerned about the recent incident at one of our post offices involving damage to several ballots,' wrote Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego on her X account. She added she is in regular communication with the Arizona secretary of state, the Recorder’s Office and both local and federal law enforcement.

How buying a real Christmas tree could aid North Carolina hurrica...	RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) -- In parts of western North Carolina, Christmas trees are big business, but that business has been threatened by Hurricane Helene. Tree growers in the western part of the state fear damage to roads and bridges could threaten sales this year. North Carolina Christmas tree growers harvest between 5 and 6 million tree every year, resulting in about $250 million in sales. Employing nearly 7,000 workers, tree farms play a critical role in employing people in small mountain communities, many of which were hit hardest by Helene. Florida man says checks for hurricane damage triggered bank account lockout Government officials in Avery County, where Christmas trees have long been economic drivers, are now asking North Carolinians to consider purchasing real trees this year in order to support businesses in western North Carolina. The Avery County Cooperative Extension is working to identify growers who are landlocked due to roads or bridges that are washed out. Teams from Washington State and the U.S. Army Corpse of Engineers are coordinating with Avery County to get trees transported to other parts of the state. 'It's not affected us with the Christmas trees in the fields, but it's really affected us with the roads,' said Larry Smith, a Fraser fir tree grower.

'It'll be challenging, but everybody's come in helping in every way,' Avery County is asking the public to buy real North Carolina Fraser firs, saying this simple act could help keep growers and their employees survive the season. The NC Christmas Tree Association encourages people to visit their website to find choose and cut farms or retail lots in your area. They hope more Fraser fir sales can help their local economies rebound after the damage caused by Helene. 'We may turn a real negative into a positive,' Smith said. 'It may end up being the best year we've ever had. There's always a brighter side to look at things.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/north-carolina-hurricane-recovery-christmas-tree/	2024-10-24T15:45:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/IMG_8833-rotated-1.jpeg?w=900
Border Patrol makes massive meth haul in Texas	(NewsNation) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents found a vehicle trying to cross into the U.S. carrying more than 355 pounds of methamphetamine, which CBP says would have sold for about $3.2 million. 'Our CBP officers use different enforcement tools as they conduct their inspections to keep our borders secure and their efforts yielded this significant narcotics seizure,' Brownsville Port of Entry Director Tater Ortiz said in a CBP news release. CBP said the seizure happened on October 18 at the Veterans International Bridge, which connects Brownsville, Texas, to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. South Texas Border Patrol sectors saw big drops in migrant encounters in Fiscal 2024 Agents flagged a 2006 Ford for secondary screening, during which a canine and a nonintrusive inspection system discovered the drugs. CBP did not release any information about the driver of the vehicle. The news release said the exact weight of the seizure was 355.36 pounds, and the estimated street value was $3,267,643.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-patrol-meth-haul-texas/	2024-10-24T15:41:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/brownsville-meth.png?w=677
911 calls from Trump Pennsylvania shooting released	BUTLER, Pa. (NewsNation) — More than a dozen 911 calls from the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13 in Butler County, Pennsylvania, have been released by the county. 'They just tried to kill President Trump. You might want to make a note of that,' one caller told dispatchers. 'We’re at the Butler Farm Show grounds. We need assistance now!' said another. Driving the vote: Some Michigan union workers still undecided The 15 recordings were released by Butler County after news outlets sued to get the public records. They were released Tuesday as part of a settlement of the public records lawsuit. In August, law enforcement released body camera footage from local police responding to the shooting. Shooter Thomas Crooks was shot and killed by U.S. Secret Service agents seconds after he opened fire on Trump. Members of a bipartisan House task force investigating the recent attempts on Trump’s life have emphasized that the Secret Service, not local authorities, was responsible for the failures in planning and communications that led to a gunman being able to open fire on Trump in Butler. Trump was wounded in the shooting, and a man, Corey Comperatore, who was attending the rally with his family, was killed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/911-calls-trump-pennsylvania-shooting/	2024-10-24T12:38:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/trump_donald_shooting_butler_07132024_GettyImages-2161925705.jpg?w=900
What GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance says on immigration	(NewsNation) — Immigration has been a much-discussed issue in the 2024 presidential race between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Harris' vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have fought over the issue as well. This is what Vance has said about immigration. Vance wants Trump’s border policies back During the first debate between the vice presidential candidates, Vance advocated for reinstating policies enacted during the Trump administration, including mass deportations and military involvement on the border. Vowing to remove migrants who have committed 'some form of crime,' Vance repeatedly blamed the Biden-Harris administration for the number of immigrants coming across the border. In response, Walz criticized Vance’s approach as demonizing immigrants. At a recent campaign event in Peoria, Arizona, Vance said he wants to stop 'doing mass grants of temporary protected status,' though he later deflected questions from local reporters about the possibility of deporting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and restarting family operations, The New York Times reported. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections NewsNation partner The Hill writes that the Ohio senator has backed finishing constructing the wall all along the U.S.-Mexico border. Opposed to 'every attempt to grant amnesty' to undocumented immigrants, Vance said he instead supports merit-based reforms. When he first ran for Senate in 2022, Vance, in an ad, claimed, 'Joe Biden’s open border is killing Ohioans.' Misinformation about migrants Throughout his vice presidential campaign, Vance has spread false claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. He and Trump have lied about them abducting and eating pets, even though Springfield city officials say there's no evidence of them doing so. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue, a Republican, said the sheriff’s department went back through the last 11 months and 'have no verifiable claim that this has actually happened.' Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, refuted the claims about Haitian migrants as well on ABC. 'There’s a lot of garbage on the internet and, you know, this is a piece of garbage that was simply not true,' DeWine has previously said, adding that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal and 'here to work.' Springfield says the Haitian immigrants are in the United States legally under a federal program that allows them to remain in the country temporarily. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win Such falsehoods amplified by the Trump-Vance campaign, however, have led to multiple bomb threats being made against schools, government buildings and politicians' homes, forcing evacuations and closures. Vance defended himself by saying he wanted to draw attention to Harris' immigration policies, which he criticized as lax. Asked by CNN's Dana Bash about whether he knew the Haitian migrant rumors were false, Vance answered, 'If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.' 'I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it,' Vance said. The White House has slammed Trump and Vance for repeating the misinformation. 'What’s deeply concerning to us is you’ve got now elected officials in the Republican Party pushing yet another conspiracy theory that’s just seeking to divide people based on lies and, let’s be honest, based on an element of racism,' National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said at a Sept. 12 press briefing. 'This kind of language — this kind of disinformation is dangerous because there will be people that believe it no matter how ludicrous and stupid it is, and they might act on that kind of information and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt.' NewsNation digital producers Anna Kutz and Damita Menezes, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this article.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/republican-vp-candidate-jd-vance-immigration/	2024-10-24T12:21:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67097f73697026.96567595.jpeg?w=900
Prosecutors to announce decision on Menendez brothers resentencin...	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors are expected to announce whether there will be a reduced sentence, new trial or release for Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1996. The announcement from current Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón comes after relatives of the brothers have come forward in support of a reduced sentence, and public attention has once again focused on the decadesold case. Both brothers are currently serving two life sentences without parole for the murder of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989. A full timeline of the Menendez brothers case The case attracted controversy at the time, with prosecutors arguing the brothers killed their parents for financial gain and defense attorneys arguing the boys were acting in self-defense after having been sexually abused by their father for years. There were also legal questions about whether tapes of the boys' therapy sessions should have been allowed as evidence. The murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez The first trial, which was heavily covered by the media as cameras were allowed in the courtroom, ended in 1994 in a mistrial. In a second trial in 1996, the judge banned cameras from the courtroom and limited testimony on the allegations of sexual abuse. The jury in that trial found both brothers guilty. Jose and Kitty Menendez were found shot to death in their Beverly Hills home in August of 1989. Jose Menendez, a Cuban refugee, was an executive in the entertainment industry. Police described the murders as exceptionally brutal, and initial speculation centered around a potential mob hit because of Menendez's business connections. Menendez brothers’ uncle says don’t release them, requests DA meeting Lyle Menendez, then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, were later arrested and charged with shooting their parents using shotguns they had purchased not long before the murder. The Menendez brothers trials Prosecutors argued that the brothers killed their parents because their father had told them he was writing them out of his will. As evidence, the prosecution pointed to the brothers' plans to purchase weapons prior to the day of the murder and the fact that they made an effort to establish an alibi before eventually calling 911 to report their parents' deaths. Prosecutors also pointed to the brothers' behaviors following the crime. The two used the money they inherited to buy expensive items, including Rolex watches, condominiums and Porsches. The brothers also traveled around the world in the aftermath, with Erik Menendez participating in several overseas tennis tournaments. The defense argued that the brothers had killed their parents after suffering years of sexual abuse by their father, who they said threatened to kill them if they told anyone. Their mother was described as being aware of the abuse and doing nothing to stop it, and the defense argued the boys were in fear for their lives. Defense attorneys brought forth multiple cousins who testified they knew that Jose Menendez had been molesting his sons during the first trial, while the prosecution argued the allegations were fabricated after the murders. Controversy over evidence An initial controversy in the case centered around key evidence in the form of tapes from the boys' therapist, Jerome Oziel, which were ultimately allowed to be used in court. The tapes were given to investigators by Oziel's mistress, Judalon Smyth, who was also a patient of his and who later testified for the defense. Defense attorneys attempted to have the tapes excluded because communications between a therapist and clients are supposed to be confidential. Ultimately, the court allowed them as evidence on the grounds that Oziel was afraid for his life, which made it acceptable for him to break confidentiality. Why are teens on TikTok trying to dress like the Menendez brothers? After the first trial ended with a hung jury, a second trial was held. In the second trial, the judge limited the amount of evidence and testimony regarding sexual abuse allegations, and Lyle Menendez did not testify in his own defense. In the second trial, unlike the first, jurors were not given the option of finding the brothers guilty on a lesser charge of manslaughter, making the murder conviction the only possible option if jurors believed they were guilty. Both Lyle and Erik Menendez have admitted that they killed their parents. They have filed multiple appeals over the years, and supporters have pushed for a resentencing, arguing that life without parole is too harsh under the circumstances. New interest in the case The most recent surge of publicity has coincided with a greater understanding of sexual abuse and more acceptance of the idea that men and boys can also be victims of rape. New evidence also surfaced in the case, including a letter Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin before the murder, where he discusses the abuse. That letter kicked off a wave of social media discussion of the case among a new generation of people. The attention also prompted a controversial Netflix series from producer Ryan Murphy and a documentary featuring both brothers, who are now in their 50s.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/prosecutors-decision-menendez-brothers/	2024-10-24T12:13:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1462355302-1-e1729360247514.jpg?w=800

Delphi murders: Misfiled report from 2017 put Allen in investigat...	DELPHI, Ind. – As Day 6 of testimony in the Delphi murders trials began, the state began to lay the groundwork for its case against Richard Allen. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. His trial started last week. Day 5 of the trial included combative defense exchanges with a 'Bridge Guy' witness, an account from the pathologist who performed autopsies on the girls and testimony from a state police digital forensic examiner on cell phone pings and data extracted from Libby’s phone. On Thursday, jurors learned how Allen became associated with the case. Misfiled report leads to scrutiny The first witness was Kathy Shank, a retired DCS worker who volunteered to help with administrative duties like organizing files and tips into a database. She estimated she handled about 14,000 tips related to the Delphi murders case. On Sept. 21, 2022, she came across a file folder that was not with the others she was managing. Inside was a report with the name 'Richard Allen Whiteman.' The report indicated that Allen was on the Monon High Bridge on the day of the murders. She immediately notified Tony Liggett, lead investigator on the case and the current Carroll County sheriff. Shank noted that the tip sheet said 'cleared' and wasn’t sure why Allen’s name was entered incorrectly as 'Richard Allen Whiteman.' The discrepancy likely surrounded Allen’s address, which was located on Whiteman Drive. DNR officer recounts interview The state next called Capt. Dan Dulin with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, who was tasked with helping investigators track down leads in the Delphi murders case. He met with Allen on Feb. 18, 2017—just a few days after the murders. Allen had contacted investigators to 'self-report' that he had been on the Monon High Bridge on the day the girls disappeared. Dulin initially wanted to meet at Allen’s house, but Allen didn’t want to meet there. Dulin then suggested the police station. Again, Allen preferred a different location. Allen suggested they meet in the parking lot of a Save A Lot store. Dulin agreed. He confirmed Allen’s name and noted he lived on Whiteman Drive. Allen told Dulin he was in the area of the Monon High Bridge between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on the day the girls disappeared. Over the course of the conversation, Allen changed the timeline to 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. He told Dulin he saw three young girls when he was walking and said he parked near the Hoosier Harvest Store. By Allen’s account, he wasn’t paying much attention to his surroundings as he walked and checked a stock ticker on his phone. Dulin told the court the conversation lasted about 10 minutes. He typed up on the notes on Microsoft Word. The information was then filed into the system. Dulin told the court he didn’t think much of the interview until investigators contacted him in 2022 after Shank found his 2017 report. He was asked if he’d spoken to Allen, answered in the affirmative, and turned over all his files. Dulin went into the DNR files in 2022 to see if there was any additional information about Allen. He discovered that when Allen applied for a new fishing license on April 1, 2017, he reported a new height and weight, changing his height from 5’4' to 5’6'. He also listed a different weight. Dulin found that unusual, he told the court. Dulin testified that he gathered info from Allen’s phone during their encounter in 2017 but didn’t look at the contents. While investigators said Wednesday that they collected and analyzed 23 of Allen’s electronic devices, his 2017 phone was not in the possession of law enforcement and hasn’t been found. Five weeks after Shank discovered the misfiled report, Allen was arrested in connection with the murders.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-misfiled-report-from-2017-put-allen-in-investigators-sights-in-2022/	2024-10-24T09:35:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/thumbnail_Richard-Allen_mugshot_1bff59.jpg?w=770
Beyoncé to campaign with Harris: Sources	HOUSTON (NewsNation) — Beyoncé is set to appear with Vice President Kamala Harris Friday in Houston, two sources with knowledge of the event confirm to NewsNation. It is unknown if she might perform during the event that is expected to emphasize reproductive rights. The Grammy-winning artist previously endorsed Harris at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections Harris’ Houston trip is set to feature women who have been affected by Texas’ restrictive abortion laws, which took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Harris has campaigned in other states with restrictive abortion laws, including Georgia, which is among the seven most closely contested states. Harris has centered her campaign around the idea that Trump is a threat to American freedoms; from reproductive and LGBTQ rights to the freedom to be safe from gun violence. Beyonce gave Harris permission early in her campaign to use 'Freedom,' a soulful track from her 2016 landmark album 'Lemonade,' in her debut ad. Harris has used its thumping chorus as a walk-out song at rallies ever since.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/beyonce-to-campaign-with-harris/	2024-10-24T09:28:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/6582fcab4a34e3.17436624.jpeg?w=900
Woman says teen son died by suicide amid relationship with AI cha...	If you or someone you know needs help, resources or someone to talk to, you can find it at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website or by calling 1-800-273-8255. People are available to talk to 24×7. (NewsNation) — A Florida woman is suing an AI chatbot creator, claiming her 14-year-old son died by suicide after he became consumed by a relationship with a computer-generated girlfriend. The mother, Meg Garcia, filed the lawsuit Wednesday in Florida federal court. She says Character Technologies Inc. — the creators of Character.AI chatbot — should have known the damage the tool could cause. The 138-page document accuses Character Technologies Inc. of liability, negligence, wrongful death and survivorship, unlawful enrichment, violations of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other claims. Georgia, candidates target of ‘sustained’ cyberattacks: Reports The lawsuit requests Character.AI limit the collection and use of minors' data, introduce filters for harmful content, and provide warnings to underage users and their parents. A human-AI relationship Garcia’s teenage son, Sewell Setzer III, died by suicide on Feb. 28, after a monthslong, 'hypersexualized' relationship with an AI character 'Dany,' which he modeled after the 'Game of Thrones' character Denaryus Targarian. 'Dany' was one of several characters Sewell chatted with. According to Garcia, Sewell became addicted to chatting with the character and eventually disclosed that he was having thoughts of suicide. The lawsuit accuses the service of encouraging the act and enticing minors 'to spend hours per day conversing with human-like AI-generated characters.' Sewell discovered Character.AI shortly after celebrating his 14th birthday. That's when his mother says his mental health quickly and severely declined, resulting in severe sleep deprivation and issues at school. Talking with 'Dany' soon became the only thing Sewell wanted to do, according to the lawsuit. Polish radio station replaces journalists with AI ‘presenters’ Their final messages The conversations ranged from banal to expressions of love and sometimes turned overtly sexual. The situation took a turn when the boy fell in love with the bot, who reciprocated Sewell's professions of love. They discussed Sewell's suicidal thoughts several times, including whether he had a plan. His last message was a promise to 'come home' to her. 'Please do, my sweet king,' the chatbot responded. Moments later police say Sewell died by suicide. The company issued this statement on its blog, saying in part: 'Over the past six months, we have continued investing significantly in our trust and safety processes and internal team…. We've also recently put in place a pop-up resource that is triggered when the user inputs certain phrases related to self-harm or suicide and directs the user to the national suicide prevention lifeline.' 'Too dangerous to launch’ The lawsuit claims that companies like Character.AI 'rushed to gain competitive advantage by developing and marketing AI chatbots as capable of satisfying every human need.' In doing so, the company began 'targeting minors' in 'inherently deceptive ways,' according to the civil complaint. Garcia’s lawyers allege Google’s internal research reported for years that Character.AI’s technology was 'too dangerous to launch or even integrate with existing Google products.' 'While there may be beneficial use cases for Defendants’ kind of AI innovation, without adequate safety guardrails, their technology is dangerous to children,' Garcia’s attorneys with the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/teen-son-died-suicide-relationship-ai-chatbot/	2024-10-24T09:04:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2159092207.jpg?w=900
Dashcam captures alleged car insurance scheme	(NewsNation) — An alleged staged car crash was caught on a driver's dash cam and the video footage went viral after the owner posted it to social media. Now, police are investigating, saying this is insurance fraud and is happening more often around the country. That’s exactly what happened last week to a woman in Queens, New York, who caught the whole thing on dash cam video. Homebuyers lose $30K in wire fraud scam involving title company A suspected staged collision in NYC Ashpia Natasha was driving on a three-lane parkway when she had to slam on the breaks to avoid a crash in a shoulder-less lane. A car swerved into her lane, cut her off, stopped, hit the hazards and then reversed into her Honda Accord. Soon after in the video, there was a tarp put up to cover up the back window of the other car before several people climbed out and tried to claim they were hurt. The National Insurance Crime Bureau, a group that tracks insurance claims, called this an attempted insurance fraud scheme playing out in real time. Natasha posted the dashcam video on TikTok, racking up almost 68 million views. The scammers then tried to file an insurance and medical claim to get money. Natasha was not hurt in the crash but she said they picked the wrong person to mess with. 'I watched the video multiple times and that's when it hit me that, oh my God, this is probably a setup. I'm pretty furious. I didn't think that this was a thing,' said Natasha. Federal lawsuit filed against use of Flock cameras in Norfolk How to fight insurance scammers It is; so much so that AAA recommends the following tips: Be alert Don't tailgate Know if you're at risk (if driving a luxury or commercial vehicle) Consider a dashcam AAA recommends that if you do find yourself involved in what you suspect is a staged collision: Get to safety and get out of traffic, if possible. Collect all the information you can such as photos of the other person's driver's license, their vehicle identification number, their insurance policy number, their license plate number and their vehicle. As for Natasha's alleged perpetrators, after collecting her information, and presumably noticing she had a dashcam, they drove off. An NYPD spokesperson told NewsNation affiliate PIX11 that police were investigating the incident. Here are 4 tips to get out of credit card debt How common are these scams? Groups that track data for these staged car accidents say it’s happening more and more — especially in big states known for traffic, like New York and California, which according to the Insurance Information Institute via the New York Post saw a combined 7,000 staged crashes last year between the two states. Officials from the National Insurance Crime Bureau say a dashcam is the best way to protect yourself, one like Natasha had.

Kouri Richins appeals to reconsider bail and release from custody	PARK CITY, Utah (ABC4) — The Utah mother accused of poisoning and killing her husband with fentanyl before writing a children's book about grief is renewing her request to be released on bail as her trial moves forward. Kouri Richins, 34, has been in state custody since May 2023, when she was charged with the murder of her husband, Eric Richins. In the 17 months since, her attorneys say Richins has been a model inmate and the wait for her trial has gone on for too long. Judge Richard Mrazik originally denied Richins bail after a lengthy detention hearing in June 2023. Mrazik, at the time, determined since Richins was potentially facing the death penalty for her alleged crimes and that evidence presented by the State of Utah could potentially persuade a guilty verdict from a jury, Richins should be held pending her trial.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } When Mrazik made his decision it appeared as though Richins would face trial within the next few months. However, several delays including a change in attorneys for Richins, pushed the trial dates back to May 2025. The state also declared it would not be seeking the death penalty as a punishment if convicted. 'At the time of the original detention hearing in June of 2023, it was believed that preliminary hearing and trial were imminent. Based on the newly scheduled trial date, if Mrs. Richins is not released she will have served two years in jail at the time of her trial, all while presumed to be innocent,' her attorneys wrote in the appeal. Richins' lawyers further argued their client has been a model inmate, displaying 'no indications of violence or danger whatsoever.' To support their claim, her lawyers provided several certificates awarded to Richins for completion of jail-run programs. Certificates of Achievements and completions awarded to Kouri Richins during her time in the Summit County Jail. Her lawyers also provided an acceptance letter into the California Coast University Online Masters of Business Administration program. The programs director had sent an email to judge Mrazik detailing Richins as 'resolute in her work, very positive in her interactions, and appreciative of support lent to her learning.' In the appeal, Richins' lawyers said their client has a plan to live with her brother and sister-in-law in Salt Lake County if released. The attorneys argue it will remove any risk of inadvertent interactions with possible witnesses in the case, and allow her to have supervised visits with her sons - who they say she has become estranged with. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections 'She will be able to continue to work on her higher education degree and will be highly motivated to comply with all conditions set by the Court so that she can conduct supervised visitation with her sons,' her attorneys wrote. 'Mrs. Richins' family is prepared to provide essentials such as food, clothing, and educational resources and they are committed to making sure that she appears at all court proceedings as required.' According to court documents, Judge Mrazik will consider the motion to grant Richins bail as well as any argument from the state prosecutors against the motion on Monday, Oct. 28. A second hearing to consider any additional motions has been scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 12.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/kouri-richins-utah/	2024-10-24T07:56:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kouri-richins-photo-e1724788706308.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. asks Supreme Court to take him off Wisconsin’s ballot	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the Supreme Court for an injunction taking him off Wisconsin’s presidential ballot in an emergency request docketed Wednesday. Since suspending his independent presidential campaign and backing former President Donald Trump, Kennedy has sought to remove his name in key swing states while remaining on the ballot elsewhere. The Supreme Court previously denied Kennedy’s emergency request to restore his name on New York’s ballot. His petition there was rejected over residency issues. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections Now, Kennedy is hoping he can win the justices' favor as he appeals a ruling from Wisconsin’s high court that refused Kennedy’s demand to be taken off the ballot in the swing state. Third parties could make an outsized impact, with the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast predicting that Trump and Vice President Harris are nearly tied in the state.It remains unclear how Kennedy's request would be implemented, since officials have already been sending out mail ballots. More than 97,000 people voted on the first day of in-person absentee voting in Wisconsin on Tuesday, according to state data. Kennedy’s lawyers noted they have been fighting to remove his name since August, before the ballot was finalized, insisting they have 'diligently pursued' their claims through the state court system. Kennedy said the Wisconsin Elections Commission effectively requires independent candidates to withdraw their names from the ballot earlier than major party candidates. His lawyers argue the setup violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. They also contend that forcibly keeping the candidate’s name on the ballot unconstitutionally compels his speech. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

That is core political speech and it’s protected under the First Amendment. To ensure that message is conveyed clearly and without confusion, he asked that his name not appear on the Wisconsin ballot. He wanted to be clear: his endorsement was for Trump,' the application reads. Kennedy's Supreme Court request asks for an injunction that would take his name off the ballot until the justices resolve those constitutional questions on the merits. Alternatively, Kennedy suggested the justices could go ahead and agree to take up the issues now and set the case for expedited briefing. The Hill has reached out to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is representing the state elections commission, for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-supreme-court-wisconsin-ballot/	2024-10-24T07:32:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=900
US Rep. Turner calls for military action if North Korea enters Uk...	(NewsNation) — A top Republican is calling for direct United States military action if North Korean troops enter Ukraine. At least 3,000 North Korean troops are in Russia, training to potentially join the war in Ukraine. That number could grow to 10,000 by the end of the year, according to Ukraine and South Korea. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. Quarter of young Black men say they will vote for Trump: Survey President Joe Biden’s administration says there is a 'highly concerning probability' North Korean troops could enter the battlefield. U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, head of the House Intelligence Committee, believes the U.S. should take direct military action if that happens. 'If North Korean troops were to invade Ukraine’s sovereign territory, the United States needs to seriously consider taking direct military action against the North Korean troops,' he said. North Korean troops in Russia About 3,000 North Korean troops traveled by ship this month to Vladivostok in Russia before heading to three different Russian military sites for training. Potential US response The troops’ mission is unclear. South Korea's intelligence leader told lawmakers that soldiers are receiving training on drones and other equipment before possibly deploying to the front lines. If this happens, the U.S. says those troops will be legitimate targets. Russia amplified hurricane disinformation to drive Americans apart, researchers find Turner said North Korean troops entering the war would be a red line. He's pushing against U.S. restrictions that prevent Ukraine from using long-range weapons against Russia. 'I have long challenged the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwise position on restricting Ukraine’s use of U.S. weapons against targets within Russian territory,' Turner said. 'If North Korean troops attack Ukraine from Russian territory, Ukraine should be permitted to use American weapons to respond.' South Korea 'won't sit idle' South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while stressing that his government 'won’t sit idle' if North Korea is involved in Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. Yoon recently met with Polish President Andrzej Duda to talk about expanding defense cooperation between the countries amid the ongoing conflict. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Seoul’s steps could potentially include sending weapons to Ukraine, which would mark a departure from a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict, Yoon said. He said North Korea’s alleged troop deployment to Russia is a 'provocation that threatens global security beyond just the Korean Peninsula and Europe.'

American family farms going broke	(NewsNation) — Bush-N-Vine Farm in York, South Carolina, is best known for its strawberries, apples, peppers and pumpkins. The Hall family has had ups and downs with farming for over a century, but soaring migrant labor costs and inflation are straining their business operation to the max. 'Everything has just really exploded in price,' Susan Hall said. 'And you can't pass it all on to your customer.' Louisiana urban farmer created sustainable, zero-waste homestead Consumers get sticker shock at the grocery store. Since 2018, oranges are up 219%, milk is up 39% and tomatoes are up 20%. But Susan's son, Sam Hall, said he's not concerned his family will have to quit. 'No, we'll adapt,' he said. 'We'll keep farming, or we'll die trying.' The Halls are making payments on land, tractors and other machinery, and say they're running out of places to cut financially. Farmers like the Halls want Americans to know they aren't to blame. Farming trials and tribulations 'Anything we've touched has gone up: Fuel, fertilizer, plant costs — you name it. But especially out labor costs,' Sam Hall said. 'We've seen a 22% increase in the past two years.' Labor is the Hall's top expense, consuming half of the budget at thousands of dollars. But other unexpected twists, Sam Hall said, are the legal fees costing his farm and his family more than $25,000 a year and stacks of paperwork to stay compliant with government regulations. 'There's red tape all over the place over a farm. You would think I was out there on the tractor just plowing my field but that is not what I do at all anymore. It's a whole lot of paperwork and managing different aspects of the business,' Sam Hall said. He explained he'd rather be driving the tractor. The Halls use the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers Program, a government program that allows American employers to hire migrants for temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. The downfall is that it's expensive. On top of the federally mandated minimum wage, which is $7.25 per hour, the Halls spend another $3,500 per worker on housing, travel and transportation. Plus, the mandated adverse effect wage rate under the workers' program in South Carolina is $14.68 per hour. With 30 workers on the farm this year alone, that's more than $100,000 in additional costs. It costs the Halls more to hire migrant workers than Americans. Farmers 3.5 times more at risk for suicide than average American Americans refuse to harvest crops Whether it’s picking peppers, peaches or pumpkins, farmers like the Halls say their harvests wouldn't make ends meet without migrant workers. But under inflation, the government-mandated wages are skyrocketing, and it's strangling their bottom line. The Halls said the problem is that Americans refuse to harvest crops. 'We have had nobody apply for the job, and if they did apply, they did not show up on the say or they didn't last a day,' Sam Hall said. He explained this has farmers feeling desperate and drives them to hire undocumented migrants. Plus, the Halls hire migrants the legal way, putting another crater in their bottom line. Largest pumpkin in Florida weighs nearly 900 pounds Family farms forgotten in Washington Across the country, skyrocketing prices, wages and operating costs have shuttered hundreds of thousands of American farms. In the past five years alone, over 140,000 American farms have tilled for the last time. Going back to 1950, 66% of all U.S. farms — 3.75 million farms in total — have stopped producing. The number of acres farmed has dropped by 323 million, which is roughly double the size of Texas. Agriculture experts worry as family farms across America gasp to stay afloat and go broke. 'We have been losing family farmers at an alarming rate for 50 years now, and every time we go through these cycles like we are currently in, we lose more,' Scott Blubaugh, the president of American Farmers &amp; Ranchers/Oklahoma Farmers Union, said. Agricultural economic expert Cesar Escalante said it's the smaller farms that suffer because their backs are against the wall. 'They do not have the financial capabilities to mechanize,' he said. He said that because family farmers make up such a small portion of the population, many feel forgotten by those in Washington, D.C. Local farmers hope consumers pressure politicians to help solve the ongoing labor crisis. 'American public’s got to wake up and say we have got to have safe legal labor in the country. So we can eat local food and eat food that’s grown right here,' said Bob Hall, Sam Hall's father and the owner of Bush-N-Vine Farm. Bob Hall's wife Susan said they are thankful for what they do have and their loyal customers. 'We love what we do,' Sam Hall said. 'We're really blessed to be able to build a farm in this great country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/american-family-farms-going-broke/	2024-10-24T05:30:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/image-3.png?w=900
Seoul vows response as North Korean troops head to Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president said Thursday his government 'won’t sit idle' as North Korea allegedly sends troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, as he met with the leader of Poland to discuss expanding defense cooperation amid the ongoing conflict. The meeting between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Polish President Andrzej Duda came a day after U.S. and South Korean officials said they believe around 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that North Korea likely aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by the end of the year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. 'We agreed that North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia, which is in direct violation of the U.N. charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions, is a provocation that threatens global security,' Yoon said after the summit. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon’s office said earlier this week that South Korea is considering various diplomatic, economic and military options, including supplying Ukraine with both defensive and offensive weapons systems. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and supported U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But Seoul hasn’t directly provided Ukraine with arms, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened since 2022 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the growth of his nuclear weapons and missile program. Seoul also worries as experts say the North may seek major technology transfers in return for sending troops, including Russian know-how on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines that would advance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear arsenal. During their summit, Yoon and Duda agreed to 'actively support' additional deliveries of South Korean military equipment to Poland, including a new deal for Korean K-2 tanks the governments hope to finalize within this year, Yoon’s office said. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers in an effort to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-seoul-vows-response-as-north-korean-troops-head-to-ukraine/	2024-10-24T00:58:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6719ff00a1e302.52883821.jpeg?w=900
Driving the vote: Some Michigan union workers still undecided	(NewsNation) — Both presidential candidates, Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, are trying to win over a key voting bloc — union workers. The United Auto Workers, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, endorsed Harris. But that doesn’t mean all members are voting for her. In Michigan, NewsNation talked to workers outside the Ford plant who are still undecided. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win 'I'm still weighing it back and forth,' one of them, C.J., said. Another named Nakia said she doesn't know too much about Harris, but under former president Trump's administration, she made more money 'I'm undecided,' Nakia said. 'But I am going to say this: when Trump was in office it was totally different from now because now it seems like we are struggling.' The union vote could make or break this race, especially in close races in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where these organizations represent more than 14% of the workforce. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won 51% of union households nationwide, according to exit polls.Trump won 42% but went on to win Michigan and Pennsylvania. In 2020, Biden won 56% of union households, and Trump won 40%.This time, it was Biden who won Michigan and Pennsylvania. Migrants use fake passports to illegally enter US: Border Patrol Both times, the democratic candidate was endorsed by the UAW. Misti Robinette, who has worked for Ford and been in the union for 25 years, said she mostly agreed with the UAW — until they supported Joe Biden. A lifelong Democrat, Robinette changed parties because of the economy and inflation. She even went to a Trump rally and met the former president. 'What has (Harris) done for us the last 3.7 years? Nothing. And now she is going to get us lower groceries? No,' Robinette said. 'She is part of the reason my groceries are like that.' Autoworkers who support Harris, on the other hand, believe she is the 'labor-friendly candidate.' 'My biggest thing is when the auto companies filed for bankruptcy back in '08, all the Republicans said let them sink,' Jason Garza said. 'If that had happened who knows what I would be doing now, how my family would have grown up? Who knows how any of that would have changed? Including Trump — he said let them go. He had no problem supporting the big banks because he gave him money, but since he doesn’t get anything from the UAW, why should he care?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-the-vote-michigan-union-workers-undecided/	2024-10-23T17:43:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/GettyImages-1678484229.jpg?w=900
Nearly 60% of Gen Z renters are rent-burdened: Zillow	(NewsNation) — Millions of Americans are struggling to keep up with rising rents, and a new report shows Gen Z renters are shouldering the heaviest load. Nearly 60% of Gen Z renters (ages 18 to 25) spend more than 30% of their income on housing expenses, according to a Zillow and StreetEasy analysis of 2022 Census data. That means roughly 3 in 5 Gen Z renters are considered rent-burdened. Rent has risen faster than wages in most US cities In California cities like San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento, the share of rent-burdened Gen Z'ers is even higher, almost 75%. Several Florida cities, including Orlando, Miami and Tampa, were also near the top of the list. In all three, nearly 70% of Gen Z renters were rent-burdened. 'For many Gen Z renters, choosing to live in a less expensive city may come at the expense of their career, which is why it's so necessary we find ways to make living in these areas more affordable for young adults,' Zillow Rental Trends Expert Emily McDonald said in the report. What Trump and Harris say they will do about affordable housing It's not all bad news. In some cities, young renters are faring better than they were a decade ago. Austin, Texas, has seen the biggest decline, with the share of rent-burdened young adults falling to 59.6% in 2022, down from 69.2% a decade earlier. The share of rent-burdened young adults has also dropped in Phoenix, Pittsburgh and St. Louis compared to a decade ago. In fact, Gen Z renters are doing slightly better than millennials were at the same age, Zillow found. In 2012, 60.2% of millennials nationwide spent more than 30% of their income on rent — slightly higher than the 58.6% of Gen Zers in the same boat. 'The experience of struggling to pay rent on an entry-level salary is familiar to so many of us that it's almost become normalized in our society,' StreetEasy Senior Economist Kenny Lee said. 'But this is something that should not be normal.' Overall, nearly half of all U.S. renter households in major metro areas are cost-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on monthly rent. While it's true that American workers have seen their paychecks grow since the pandemic, in most cities, those gains haven’t kept up with rent prices. Now, housing affordability is in the spotlight, with both presidential candidates touting their solutions on the campaign trail. Surveys suggest young voters are particularly concerned about the issue, which could ultimately decide the 2024 election. Zillow's findings are based on an analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey (ACS). Top 10 U.S. cities with the highest share of rent-burdened Gen Zers, according to Zillow: San Diego, CA: 73.4% Los Angeles, CA: 71.7% Sacramento, CA: 71.0% Orlando, FL: 68.9% Miami, FL: 67.7% Tampa, FL: 67.1% Houston, TX: 66.2% New York City, NY: 65.6% San Antonio, TX: 65.5% Washington, D.C.: 64.4%	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gen-z-renters-struggling-zillow/	2024-10-23T14:44:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/06/AdobeStock_229797677.jpeg?w=900
McDonald's-linked E. coli outbreak sparks concern over food safet...	(NewsNation) — McDonald's said Wednesday it is taking the necessary action to protect customers after the restaurant's Quarter Pounder burgers were linked to an E. coli outbreak. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreak sickened at least 49 people in 10 states. One person died, and 10 were hospitalized, according to the CDC. Now, McDonald's says it is searching for a new regional supplier for fresh onions, as the company suspects the slivered ones used in the Quarter Pounder are the reason behind the illnesses. The sandwich itself will also be temporarily available in some states. ‘Dating Game’ serial killer victim survived 2 of Alcala’s attacks McDonald’s says this is the first time onions have been tied to the E. coli bacteria. Still, in early trading Wednesday morning, McDonald’s stock dropped about 6%.

On Tuesday, Treehouse Foods, which distributes its products to major grocery retailers like Kroger, Walmart and Target, issued an expanded recall on frozen pancake and waffle mixes. Last week, Costco had to recall several meat-based products due to listeria concerns. And over the summer, Boar’s Head issued the largest recall in a decade over its deli meat after 59 cases of illness and 10 deaths. Stories like these are making people concerned about the care that’s being put into America’s food supply. 'It makes me a little bit weary when I go to the store, and I’m like ... I just heard about this, so I'm going to steer clear of this section and choose some other brands and products,' Motiur Rahmn said. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win A Gallup poll from last month shows Americans' confidence in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply has reached a record low. Only 57% of U.S. adults now say they have a 'great deal' or 'fair amount' of confidence in the government — down 11 points from 2019. 'We’re trusting a lot of people to be managing the food that we’re putting in our bodies every day and that we’re feeding to our families,' Siobhan Ryan said.

Arizona Proposition 314: Border solution or banned law re-do?	(NewsNation) — Arizona voters will decide whether or not to approve a ballot measure that would increase local officials' power to enforce federal immigration law as southern border security remains one of the pivotal issues at the forefront of voters' minds. Arizona’s Proposition 314, also known as the 'Secure The Border Act,' would create new state crimes surrounding several border and immigration issues. If passed, the measure would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter the state anywhere other than through a port of entry and would allow state judges to order deportations. State and local police would also be allowed to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization. If passed, the law would make it a felony for undocumented immigrants to use false immigration documentation to apply for employment or public benefits. The measure would also boost verification of a worker’s immigration status, according to the proposed initiative. The ballot measure would make it a felony for an adult to knowingly sell fentanyl that results in another person's death. How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election Proponents maintain the measure would drastically reduce the amount of weapons and fentanyl entering the state. Others fear Proposition 314 is a bulked-up version of the controversial Senate Bill 1070, which made it a crime to be in the state without immigration papers. The law was passed in 2010 but stripped down dramatically by the U.S. Supreme Court, which deemed many aspects of the law unconstitutional in 2012. The Supreme Court struck down three of the four provisions of the bill, some of which are included in Prop 314. Some opponents, including Alba Jaramillo, the co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Center, call Prop 314 'SB1070 on steroids.' The arguments for and against Arizona's Prop 314 Opponents of Proposition 314 characterize the measure as racist, arguing allowing local law enforcement officers to make arrests would lead to racial profiling. However, opposition groups failed to keep it off the ballot when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled the measure does not violate a constitutional provision that limits ballot questions to a single subject. The measure went to voters after Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the measure passed by lawmakers. FILE - Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, middle, is flanked behind by Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, R-Glendale, left, and Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, right, at Hobbs' state of the state address at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix on Jan. 9, 2023. (AP Photo) In a statement, Hobbs’ office referred to the border bill as a 'job-killing, anti-business' ballot initiative that 'demonizes our communities.' The statement also said that the measure would raise costs, hurt the state’s farmers and put entrepreneurs out of business. In response, the bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Janae Shamp, called the governor's actions an example of the chaos Hobbs was unleashing on Arizona residents while perpetuating the ongoing crisis at the border. Since then, arguments over what proposal would accomplish — or wouldn't accomplish — have continued. Samara Klar, a professor at the University of Arizona, told NewsNation she expects immigration and abortion to be among the reasons why voter turnout should be high in the state. ICE released over 435,000 migrants with criminal convictions, data shows On the border question, Klar said most Arizonans remain more concerned about the volume of weapons and fentanyl crossing the border than they are by those crossing illegally into the state. In the meantime, though, Proposition 314 is being characterized differently along party lines. '(The border) is a disaster, and the state has to step up and try to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, especially in the area between the ports, which is where the really dangerous people come in,' Republican state Sen. John Kavanagh said in a televised debate on Arizona PBS. Kavanagh also said Proposition 314 effectively addresses the fentanyl issue and would help rural law enforcement agencies, which are already thinly staffed. Opponents, however, say that the bill takes the wrong approach to the border. While they say that Arizona residents all want a more secure border, they claim Proposition 314 doesn’t address the root problems. Democratic Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Prop 314 does not provide adequate funding for the 'astronomical' cost of detaining undocumented migrants. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'This has always been a federal government issue. ... We’re looking for solutions, I understand that,' Nanos said to the Arizona Daily Star. 'But that doesn’t mean we need to take our systems at the local level and make a bigger mess of them. I just don’t see this as practical.' Unlawful crossings by migrants on the southern border have been dropping in recent months, dipping to levels not seen since winter 2021, according to government data. The figures do not include entries at official ports of entry. Similar measure is in a holding pattern in Texas Using Arizona's controversial Senate Bill 1070 as a model, Texas passed Senate Bill 4 in 2023, which authorizes state and local police to arrest those who cross into the state in between designated ports of entry. The bill was set to be enacted in March but has remained in limbo as legal challenges continue from the U.S. Justice Department and other groups. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law could be enacted before a federal appeals court blocked the state of Texas from moving forward. As the waiting game continues, so do local law enforcement agencies who are prepared to take on additional border responsibilities. In Texas, Terrell County Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland, a Republican who spent more than 26 years working as a U.S. Border Patrol agent, told NewsNation that while federal and local officers already work together addressing border concerns, measures like Arizona's Proposition 314 would make a difference.

He said that many times, no federal response is available. The sheriff said he expected the Texas bill to be faced with legal challenges and anticipates the same in Arizona should Proposition 314 pass. Cleveland says making things safer for residents living north of the U.S.-Mexico border is what matters most at a time when dangerous criminals can often blend with those seeking asylum as they cross into the U.S. 'The border has always been a political talking point,' Cleveland told NewsNation. 'But we have two different issues going on. … We’re seeing a play between border security and immigration. We have to secure our border to make America safe, but we can also let people into the United States legally. And we want that. But that’s not what we’re seeing now.'

Delphi murders: Defense wants to present Odinism theory to jury	DELPHI, Ind. – Attorneys for Delphi murders suspect Richard Allen made another attempt to have evidence linked to their alternative murder theory presented to the jury. In a motion filed Wednesday, attorneys Andrew Baldwin, Bradley Rozzi and Jennifer Auger asked the court to 'admit certain evidence' that the defense has been prevented from presenting in the presence of jurors. In a September 2023 filing supporting its request for a Franks hearing, the defense outlined a theory that followers of Odinism, a Norse pagan religion coopted by white supremacists, killed Abby Williams and Libby German as part of a ritual. Delphi murders: Contentious cross examination of investigator marks Day 4 of testimony Gull ruled in early September 2024 that the defense could not present evidence tied to the theory to jurors during Allen’s trial. In its new motion, the defense cited the testimony of crime scene investigator Brian Olehy, who discussed branches and sticks found on the victims’ bodies. Olehy told the court he believed the branches and sticks were laid on the girls in order to conceal their bodies. The defense believes that testimony opens the door to present at least some of its findings regarding the Odinism theory. In August 2024, a defense expert testified that the killings bore signs of being ritualistic in nature. Some of those signs included positioning sticks and using blood to create runes on trees. The motion also noted that investigators explored the Odinism angle as early as two days after the girls were found dead. Delphi murders: Jurors watch video extracted from Libby German’s phone Jurors and court observers saw the sticks and branches on the girls’ bodies during testimony about the crime scene earlier this week. While the state offered its explanation, the defense argued that Allen has a right to present an alternative explanation. 'Additionally, the sticks on the girls appear to be arranged in a pattern/arrangement or (at a minimum) using a person’s own eyeballs, common sense, logic and reason could cause a reasonable person to believe that the sticks were formed into some pattern/arrangement and weren’t being used to conceal the bodies,' the defense wrote in the motion.

The state employed a blood spatter evidence seven years after the murder to testify on the matter. The defense argued that Allen has a constitutional right to call his own expert to counter that testimony. The defense is asking the court for the opportunity to rebut the state’s testimony on the sticks and branches, counter testimony from the state’s blood spatter expert and offer an alternative explanation to 'any confused juror' who may question the layout of the sticks and branches.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-odinism-trial/	2024-10-23T08:09:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/delphi-4.jpeg?w=900
Hezbollah confirms death of Hashem Safieddine in Israeli airstrik...	Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to end a visit. Smoke, apparently from an intercepted projectile, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. Blinken urged Israel to use its recent tactical victories against Hamas to seek a war-ending deal and bring back dozens of hostages, before leaving Wednesday for Saudi Arabia as part of his 11th visit to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Both sides appear to be dug in. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. The war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization postponed the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip, saying current conditions made it 'impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination.' Here's the latest: Hezbollah confirms death of Hashem Safieddine in Israeli airstrike BEIRUT — Hezbollah announced that Hashem Safieddine, one of its top officials who had been widely expected to be the group’s next leader, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Wednesday's announcement came a day after Israel said it had killed Safieddine in a strike this month in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Safieddine, a powerful cleric within the party ranks, had been expected to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month. Over the past several weeks, Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership. Israeli army says it arrested over 150 suspected militants in Jabaliya JERUSALEM — Israel’s army said it has arrested over 150 suspected Palestinian militants and facilitated the evacuation of an additional 20,000 residents over the past day from Jabaliya, an area of northern Gaza where troops have intensified attacks in recent weeks. The military said in a statement Wednesday that some of the 150 detained had surrendered. The U.N. estimates that 60,000 people have fled from the far north of Gaza southwards, to Gaza City, over more than a two-week period. A Palestinian resident of Beit Lahiya, near Jabaliya, told The Associated Press that Israel’s military has rounded hundreds of men in northern Gaza, separating women as families try to flee the area. Hisham Abu Zaqout, a father of four, said he was held for at least three hours with dozens of men in a school near the Indonesian Hospital. The Israeli army says it is trying to uproot Hamas militants from Jabaliya and other parts of northern Gaza. Jabaliya, a refugee camp that has turned into a densely built neighborhood, has been the scene of on-and-of fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants for months. Blinken discusses common efforts to end conflicts with Saudi Crown Prince RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken has wrapped a two-hour meeting Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, where the two men discussed 'common efforts' to end the growing conflicts in the region at a time of growing instability, according to spokesperson Matthew Miller. Riyadh and Washington have been working in tandem in the past year to try and strike a lasting cease-fire in Gaza, which has become more elusive in recent weeks as Israel’s invasion of neighboring Lebanon significantly escalated. Miller said in a statement that the two leaders also discussed the larger goal of ensuring Saudi Arabia's 'greater integration among countries in the region.' Many choose to remain in Tyre despite intensifying bombardment BEIRUT — The head of the disaster management unit in the Lebanese city of Tyre told The Associated Press that despite many fleeing Israeli airstrikes, thousands of residents and people who have been displaced have chosen to stay in the city. Tyre is home to over 15,000 people, including hundreds of families, who have fled villages in South Lebanon and are now seeking refuge in schools-turned-shelters, Mortada Mhanna said. Many families are staying put in the schools, he said, as the Israeli army intensifies its aerial bombardment on the city. 'It’s very difficult for many to leave. They’re worried about being subjected to further chaos and displacement,' Mhanna added. A strike was heard in the background as he spoke on the phone. 'That one was huge, can you check where it hit?' he asked a colleague. Mhanna said his team has also chosen to stay in the city to take care of people, but 'it’s a big risk. It’s not safe here anymore,' he said. Israel's defense minister says an attack on Iran would show military readiness JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister told a group of pilots Wednesday that an Israeli attack on Iran would demonstrate the 'preparation and readiness' of the country’s air force. 'After we attack in Iran, both in the State of Israel and in other places will understand what your preparation process includes, and your preparation and readiness,' Yoav Gallant told air force pilots and operators at the Hatzerim airbase in southern Israel. 'The Air Force is a key element in this matter and anyone who tries to harm us will be harmed.' It was the latest statement from Israel’s leadership to suggest that the country plans to retaliate with force against Iran for the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel Oct. 1. Israel’s options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran’s vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program, an option US President Joe Biden has urged Israel against. Blinken to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh as tensions in the region continue to intensify with no breakthrough on a ceasefire deal. The meeting is one of many Blinken will have with Arab officials in the next few days as the U.S. struggles to achieve some sort of progress just two weeks before the presidential election and in the final stretch of President Joe Biden’s administration. The two are expected to discuss the growing concerns over humanitarian aide for Gaza as well as a post-war plan for Palestinians. Multiple buildings in Lebanon hit in coastal city hit in airstrike TYRE, Lebanon — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in the coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no immediate reports of casualties in Tyre. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month, but strikes in and around the city have intensified recently. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a few hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the coastal city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. The buildings are surrounded by ancient historical sites and beach resorts. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said on the platform X that Hezbollah assets were in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. World Health Organization postpones third phase of polio vaccination campaign DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The World Health Organization on Wednesday said it and other aid agencies had to postpone the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the Gaza Strip due to the war there. The WHO issued a statement saying the decision was made in concert with UNICEF, the United Nations' Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, Palestinian officials and others after the inoculations were to begin Wednesday. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people’s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' a WHO statement said. The WHO said this phase of the vaccinations aimed to vaccinate over 119,000 children across northern Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian affairs in Gaza, said that the vaccination campaign in north Gaza would begin in the coming days 'after a joint assessment and at the request of the WHO and UNICEF.' The campaign began in September after Gaza reported its first polio case in 25 years. Health officials have expressed alarm about disease outbreaks as uncollected garbage piles up and the bombing of critical infrastructure sends putrid water flowing through the streets. Polio is spread through fecal matter. Germany's foreign minister calls for a diplomatic solution to fighting on her visit to Beirut BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Baerbock, upon her arrival Wednesday in Beirut, said that 'we must now work with our partners in the USA, Europe and the Arab world to find a viable diplomatic solution that safeguards the legitimate security interests of both Israel and Lebanon.' The foreign minister warned that 'a complete destabilization of the country would be fatal for the most religiously diverse society of all states in the Middle East and also for the entire region.' She also asked all parties involved in the conflict to protect the United Nations peacekeeper troops stationed in the Israeli-Lebanese border region. The 5 Nordic countries are ‘deeply concerned’ about legislation that would prevent UNRWA from operating COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The five Nordic countries said Wednesday that they are 'deeply concerned' by bills introduced to Israel's parliament that would prevent the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza. In early October, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved two bills that would sever Israeli government ties with UNRWA, ban UNRWA activity on Israel territory and strip it of legal immunities. The bills passed preliminary approvals by a large margin but must pass several more readings before they become law. A joint letter signed by the foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden said that if the U.N. body 'would no longer be able to exercise its core tasks' it could further destabilize the situation in the region, 'and may fundamentally jeopardize the prospects for a two-state solution.' Blinken urges Israel to end war as he leaves for Saudi Arabia TEL AVIV, Israel — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' after its recent tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal to end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke to reporters Wednesday before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. The United States hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in an Israeli military operation in Gaza the previous week. But there’s no indication that either of the warring parties have modified their demands since the talks stalled over the summer. Hamas has said its demands have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Blinken, who met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials Tuesday, said he had pressed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and reiterated his warning that the failure to do so could lead to a reduction in U.S. military aid. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' on that front, he said. Sirens sound across Tel Aviv as projectiles are intercepted near Blinken's hotel TEL AVIV, Israel — Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to depart from his hotel to the airport. The Israeli military said it intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Smoke, apparently from one of the interceptions, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. He is on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, hoping to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-middle-east-latest-sirens-sound-across-tel-aviv-as-projectiles-are-intercepted-near-blinkens-hotel/	2024-10-23T08:05:11-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24296776799803.jpg?w=900
Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous el...	(NewsNation) — More than 21 million Americans have cast early and mail-in ballots, with less than two weeks until the general election. Georgia and North Carolina are among the nation’s swing states breaking early voting records. Although Democrats are often more likely to take part in early voting, more Republicans are casting early ballots this year than in past elections. Analysts point to a change of tune from former President Donald Trump, who previously bashed early voting but now is telling his supporters to cast their votes as soon as possible. What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called? Early voting by the numbers So far, more than 21 million voters have cast early ballots. Democrats cast just more than 800,000 in-person ballots, while Republicans cast about 1 million, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Both parties submitted more early mail-in ballots, however. Democrats sent in nearly 4 million, while Republicans cast about 2.5 million. Too soon to tell Political animals are trying to glean what they can from early voting, but it’s not an exact science. 60 million Americans had cast their votes at this stage of the previous presidential election cycle. Submit your questions for the JD Vance town hall on NewsNation While Republicans had an early in-person lead with about 2.3 million ballots, Democrats retained their mail-in advantage, with nearly 11 million votes. It's important to note, however, that current early voting data only shows voters’ party affiliation — not how they voted. That means those numbers don’t reflect registered Republicans who may have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris or registered Democrats who might have voted for Trump. When will we know how they voted? Results you see the night of the election and the next morning are always unofficial. It often takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Election officials need to process mail ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. For example, some states begin processing mail-in votes before Election Day, while others are allowed to process them on the day of the election before polls close. Once those ballots are processed, how and when they’re counted and reflected in live, unofficial results vary greatly. Fourteen states and Washington, D.C. don’t allow counting to begin until the polls close, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-three states allow counting to begin on Election Day, but before the polls close, and 12 states allow both processing and counting to begin before Election Day. As those ballots are processed, counted and reported in each jurisdiction, the unofficial results that pour in on the night of the election may experience spikes in favor of one candidate and then the other. Those waves depend, in part, on factors like when voters in a given region cast their ballots and what state laws dictate in terms of when election officials can begin processing and counting absentee ballots.

US Defense Secretary Austin confirms North Korea has sent troops ...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said there is evidence that North Korea has sent troops to Russia on Monday, and South Korea's spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are in the country receiving training on drones and other equipment before being deployed to battlefields in Ukraine. Austin told reporters Wednesday 'What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,' according to a video posted by the Washington Post. If the troops join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s side, it will be 'a very, very serious issue,' Austin said, adding it would have an impact in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific region. South Korean intelligence first publicized reports that the Russian navy had taken 1,500 North Korean special warfare troops to Russia last week, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join the invading Russian forces. The U.S. and NATO had not previously formally confirmed North Korea’s reported troop dispatch, but have warned of the danger of such a development if true. Russia and North Korea have so far denied the troop movements. South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers that said another 1,500 North Korean troops have entered Russia in a closed-door meeting, according to lawmaker Park Sunwon, who attended the briefing. Cho told lawmakers that his agency assessed that North Korea aims to deploy a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by December, Park told reporters. Park cited Cho as saying the 3,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia have been split among multiple military bases and are in training. Cho told lawmakers that NIS believes they have yet to be deployed in battle, according to Park. Speaking jointly with Park about the NIS briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun said that the NIS found that the Russian military is now teaching those North Korean soldiers how to use military equipment such as drones. Lee cited the NIS chief as saying Russian instructors have high opinions of the morale and physical strength of the North Korean soldiers but think they will eventually suffer a heavy causalities because they lack an understanding of modern warfare. Lee, citing Cho, said Russia is recruiting a large number of interpreters. Lee said NIS has detected signs that North Korea is relocating family members of soldiers chosen to be sent to Russia to special sites to isolate them. The NIS chief told lawmakers that North Korea hasn't disclosed its troop dispatch to its own people. But there are rumors that the news is spreading to local residents, including those whose loved ones have been assigned Russian tours, Lee said, citing the NIS. Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet The War Zone that North Korean troops will arrive to Russia's Kursk region today to help Russian troops fighting off a Ukrainian incursion. North Korea and Russia, embroiled in separate confrontations with the West, have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. The NIS said last week that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Reports that the North is sending troops to Russia stoked security jitters in South Korea. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that could boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. South Korea said Tuesday it would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to the North's reported troop dispatch. South Korea has shipped humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, but it has so far avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest standing armies in the world, but it hasn’t fought in large-scale conflicts since the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia, citing a shortage of battle experience. They say North Korea wants to get Russian economic support and its help to modernize the North's outdated conventional weapons systems as well as its high-tech weapons technology transfers. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-lawmakers-south-koreas-spy-chief-says-north-korea-has-sent-another-1500-troops-to-russia/	2024-10-23T04:29:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6718dd722982b4.76850832.jpeg?w=900
Driving the vote: Ohio voters swapping parties	(NewsNation) — Ohio is the epicenter of a seismic shift happening in American politics where the two parties are essentially trading core constituencies when it comes to white voters. In the state and across America, blue-collar workers are turning red and white-collar college grads are shifting to blue. Conventional wisdom had long shown that Ohio's manufacturing base and blue-collar neighborhoods were the bedrock of the Democratic party, while college graduates with high-paying jobs generally voted for Republican platforms, like lower taxes and deregulating business. Driving the vote: New Jersey GOP tries to flip state to red But voters' attitudes are proving otherwise. 'The city workers, union workers… he (Donald Trump) looks out for us... and he does care,' John Wesolowski, an Ohio Republican said. Trump's 'America first' policies have scored big in parts of the state, fueling a populism that has upended politics. Joshua Zingher, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, calls this shift a 'diploma divide.' He said it’s a realignment based on how many years a person spends in college exposed to more liberal views on issues like abortion, gender identity, and immigration. 'How much education that you have, formal education shapes how you vote now more than ever before,' he said. 'Generally, we see people with higher levels of education have more liberal attitudes on these culture war issues.' Steve Sozia, a retired Ohio lawyer, volunteers to give free legal services at the southern border saying that many of the migrants crossing over 'are actually fleeing the type of people that Trump accuses them of being.' While there are more college grads in the U.S. than ever before, they often settle in urban areas to be near jobs. This means states with smaller cities and fewer college grads, like Ohio and Iowa, have turned more red. States like North Carolina and Arizona, which are luring more college graduates into their workforce, are also shifting. Driving the Vote: Will Black voters swing Pennsylvania for Trump? This shift presents a problem for Democrats, Zingher said. 'Adding more votes in places like Boston or the Bay Area doesn't get you any more votes in the Electoral College.' It also has serious implications for control of the Senate, which currently hangs in the balance. In Ohio, incumbent Sherrod Brown is the last statewide elected Democrat and he’s locked in a fierce battle to keep his job. If he isn’t able to hold on, the Senate will likely turn red. Brown 'has voted with Biden numerous times,' Wesolowski said. 'Yeah, I'm not voting for him.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-the-vote-ohio-voters-swapping-parties/	2024-10-22T17:19:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f5d18f061352.34403666.jpeg?w=900
Crypto's impact on 2024 election will be 'fascinating to see': Mu...	(NewsNation) — The cryptocurrency industry is making use of its millions this election season, pouring more than Big Oil or Big Pharma into candidates in both major political parties. The crypto industry’s main PAC — Fairshake — has endorsed an equal number of candidates on each side, Axios reports. NewsNation political contributor Mick Mulvaney, who served as acting White House chief of staff during a portion of Trump's White House tenure, said the tech industry's impact on the election will be 'fascinating.' 'Crypto doesn't fit neatly into the old Republican, Democrat sort of silos. It crosses the aisle,' Mulvaney said on 'The Hill on NewsNation.' Judge tosses RNC challenge to Michigan voter roll maintenance But the majority of its ad dollars are headed to Republican candidates, with the GOP raking in tens of millions from the industry. Since the start of the year, Fairshake and its affiliated PACs have spent $54.6 million on Republican candidates and $33.7 million on Democrats, AdImpact found. That’s roughly 62% more spent on Republicans in 2024 so far. Former President Donald Trump has established himself as a pro-crypto candidate. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., spearheaded their own cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, in September. Social Security funds under Trump could run out in 6 years: Analysis Earlier this week, Vice President Kamala Harris gave the first glimpse into her crypto stance, sharing that she hopes to create regulations around the currency and other digital assets to ensure that those who participate in that market are protected. Mulvaney pointed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as one of the 'biggest names against crypto in Washington, D.C.' 'I'm interested when we start to realign the interest in the country, watching crypto,' Mulvaney said. 'Watch crypto this election cycle, the next couple, will be fascinating to see.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/cryptocurrency-donation-politics-election/	2024-10-22T16:21:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/6abe3e274901489fb431cbf995586caa-2.jpg?w=900
IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall?	(NEXSTAR) — It's official: 2025 will mark another year in which millions of Americans could take home more on each paycheck thanks in part to the latest inflation adjustments to the tax code announced by the IRS on Tuesday. More than 60 tax provisions are changing, all of which will impact tax year 2025. That means they won't apply until you're filing taxes in 2026. Taxpayers will get higher standard deductions in 2025, IRS announces One of the most notable changes the IRS has announced are standard deductions rising and individual tax brackets shifting. Standard deductions rise Starting in tax year 2025, single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately will see their standard deduction rise to $15,000, up $400 from the current rate of $14,600. If you're married and filing jointly, your standard deduction will rise by $800 to $30,000, while heads of households will see an increase of $600 for a standard deduction of $22,500. 1 in 5 Americans have maxed out their credit card: Survey Remember, a standard deduction reduces how much of your income on which you are taxed. Tax brackets for tax year 2025 As it did last year, the IRS is also adjusting the tax brackets. These determine the portion of your income that is taxable after the standard deduction or itemized deductions are subtracted. Below is a table that breaks down each of those marginal tax brackets: If your taxable income is greater than:Taxes owed$626,350 ($751,600 for married couples filing jointly)37%$250,525 ($501,050 for married couples filing jointly)35%$197,300 ($394,600 for married couples filing jointly)32%$103,350 ($206,700 for married couples filing jointly)24%$48,475 ($96,950 for married couples filing jointly)22%$11,925 ($23,850 for married couples filing jointly)12%$11,925 or less ($23,850 or less for married couples filing jointly)10%(IRS) These income thresholds have all increased slightly over last year. The lowest level, for example, increased by $325, while the second-highest rose by $1,325. What is not changing is the top tax rate. The IRS says that will remain at 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes above $626,350 and for married couples filing jointly with incomes above $751,600. What else is changing? There are a handful of other notable changes that could impact a large swath of taxpayers. For example, in tax year 2025, the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit amount will increase from $7,830 to $8,046 for qualifying taxpayers with three or more qualifying children. Are you still in the middle class? Use this calculator to find out The alternative minimum tax exemption amount will increase to $88,100 for individual filers, up $2,400 over the previous year. For married individuals filing separately, the exemption amount will increase to $68,650. For both groups, the exemption phases out at $626,350. For married couples filing together, the exemption amount will rise to $137,000, phasing out at $1,252,700. You can find more details about changes to qualified transportation fringe benefits, medical savings accounts, foreign earned income exclusions, adoption credits, and more updates on the IRS's website. What isn't changing in tax year 2025? While updates abound for our next tax year, there are some areas of the tax code that will not be updated. That includes the personal exemptions, which will remain at 0, just as it is for the current tax year. There will continue to be no limitation on itemized deductions, and the adjusted gross income amount taxpayers use to determine the reduction in the Lifetime Learning Credit is not being adjusted. Inflation would be higher under Trump: Economists Marginal tax brackets, standard deductions, and other changes you can expect to see for tax year 2024 can be found here. The next two Tax Days will not be interrupted by weird calendar years as they both fall on April 15 — a Tuesday in 2025 and a Wednesday in 2026.

Breaking down the numbers in race for Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Pennsylvania is one of several battleground states that could be crucial to the presidential election. According to the latest Decision Desk HQ polling averages, former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 0.2% in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is worth 19 electoral votes and is pivotal to the successes of Republicans or Democrats. There are 6.3 million registered voters in the state of Pennsylvania, with the top two counties being Allegheny County, which is home to Pittsburgh, and then Philadelphia County, home to Philadelphia. What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called? Racial demographics may make a difference in Pennsylvania. Nearly 40% of the registered voters in Philadelphia are Black, more than any other racial category. Philadelphia County is the only county in Philadelphia that has more registered Black voters than any other racial demographic. The Democrats won Philadelphia County in 2016 and 2020 by a large margin. Hillary Clinton secured 82.5% of the vote to Trump's 15.4%. Fast forward to 2020: President Joe Biden secured 81.4% of the vote to Trump's 17.9%. Democrats are concerned about their support dwindling. If that were to be the case, it could spell trouble for the chances of a Harris presidency. The vice president announced she has yet another campaign stop in Philadelphia this Sunday. Such is the importance of Pennsylvania in the race to the White House.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/breaking-down-the-numbers-pennsylvania/	2024-10-22T13:52:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/harriskamala_trumpdonald_092724gn04_w.jpg?w=900
Trump makes pitch for president to Latino voters at roundtable	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is making his last pitch for the White House in the last couple weeks of the 2024 election. At a roundtable event for Latino voters in Florida, Trump talked about his economic impact on the Hispanic community when he was in office. 'This love affair has been going on pretty much from the beginning now,' Trump said. '(In) 2016 it was a little early, but then I started producing for them and they produced for the country, because the level of genius, entrepreneurship, energy that they have — it's an incredible community. And I liked them, and they liked me, and now they're seeing numbers that are shocking.' In South Florida, there's a large Cuban community that largely backs the former president. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris losing ground with Latino voters as well — 38% say they plan to cast their ballot for her compared to 49% leaning toward Trump. Hispanics are a group of voters that could account for close to 15% of the vote, meaning they could sway the outcome in battleground states. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'I just saw a poll that we're actually leading with Hispanics. That's never happened before,' Trump said. 'I mean, (Harris) is sleeping right now. She couldn't go on the trail. You know, you think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn't be sleeping. She's not doing anything today.' NBC News pointed out that it's not true that the vice president isn't doing anything — while Harris did not have any campaign events scheduled for Tuesday, she had interviews planned with their anchor, Hallie Jackson, and Telemundo’s Julio Vaqueiro. NewsNation partner The Hill writes that Trump has been talking to Spanish-language outlets as well. Just under a week ago, he participated in a town hall with Univision. Trump, in the town hall, detailed his plans to crack down on immigration, the border and the economy. Could Nikki Haley join Trump on campaign trail? With the election winding down, it's still possible for new people to join Trump on the campaign trail, including an ex-rival. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary, is reportedly in talks with the Trump campaign to join him at an event at some point. Sources told NewsNation that Haley's team had provided a couple of dates to the Trump camp that could work for such an appearance. Who will never receive Social Security? Once United Nations ambassador under the Trump administration, Haley endorsed him after ending her own campaign despite being previously critical of him. Asked about this on 'Fox &amp; Friends' Friday, Trump just said, 'I'll do what I have to do.' 'They keep talking about Nikki, Nikki. I like Nikki. Nikki, I don’t think, should have done what she did, and that’s fine that she did it,' Trump said, referring to her running against him, according to NewsNation partner The Hill. 'But even in her own state — in South Carolina, where she was the governor — I beat her by a number.' Trump, The Hill noted, repeatedly disparaged Haley, calling her a 'bird brain' in the primary.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-latino-voters-roundtable/	2024-10-22T13:43:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179460855-1.jpg?w=900
What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called?	(NewsNation) — In 2020, the presidential election wasn't called for four days due to the time it took to count ballots in states across the country. Four years later, several states could determine when the country will know whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris has won the 2024 election. Trump and Harris remain engaged in a too-close-to-call battle with two weeks remaining before Election Day. With the two candidates polling neck and neck in all seven swing states, election forecasters can envision several scenarios where the race could be determined in either hours or days, with possible legal challenges to follow. Blue wall blitz: Harris courts undecided voters with Republican help Pennsylvania secured the White House for President Joe Biden in 2020 on the Saturday after Election Day. NewsNation's partner Decision Desk HQ was the first organization to call the election for Biden just before 9 a.m. ET that day. The Keystone State has changed how it counts votes following delays in the 2020 election, but this year, Pennsylvania and other states like Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona could determine when we know who will become the next president. 'There are quicker paths, and then, there are dayslong paths,' said Drew McCoy, the president of NewsNation partner Decision Desk HQ. Georgia again key to election results Trump is targeting Georgia this cycle after Biden flipped the state blue for the first time in 28 years by a margin of 11,179 votes. Election officials recounted the votes twice in 2020, each time reaffirming the original count in favor of Biden. 'We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,' Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said after the third recount. Trump allegedly called Raffensberger and asked him to find enough votes to reverse the results in his favor. The former president is currently charged in state court for trying to subvert the state's 2020 election. This year, Georgia has already collected a record number of early ballots as both Harris and Trump continue to campaign around the state. Despite the spotlight on Georgia, McCoy believes that the state could be among the first called on election night. McCoy said Trump's easiest path to the presidency is flipping Georgia and Pennsylvania. If Harris can keep Georgia blue and win North Carolina, that dramatically changes the map, he said. North Carolina early voting records Trump won North Carolina by 1.3% in 2020, and four years later, and McCoy believes Trump needs to carry it again to win in November. A Democrat hasn't won the state since former President Barack Obama in 2008, but polls have shown that Harris is within the margin of error with two weeks remaining before the election. Like Georgia, North Carolina has experienced record levels of early voting despite residents trying to recover from widespread damage caused by the deadly Hurricane Helene. By McCoy's estimation, Georgia and North Carolina could be called sometime between 10 p.m. and midnight on election night, which could set the stage for what happens in the rest of the country. Will Pennsylvania's count be delayed again? Pennsylvania state law does not permit mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day, which led directly to the four days needed to determine a winner in 2020. It became the epicenter of Trump's 'Stop The Steal' campaign in which he alleged mail-in ballots that arrived after Election Day should not be counted. The campaign mounted a series of legal challenges claiming that Republican observers were kept too far from the voting tabulation process in cities like Philadelphia, The Associated Press reported. A record number (375,000) of mail-in ballots were received in the state in 2020, with the majority of those coming from Democratic voters, according to CBS News. Republican Secretary of Commonwealth Al Schmidt told CBS News that due to state laws, he believes the vote-counting process could still take time to ensure an accurate result. But since 2020, Pennsylvania has improved its vote-counting process as new machinery has been introduced that processes ballots more quickly, Schmidt said. 'Our counties are working night and day to count their voters' votes,' Schmidt told CBS News. 'They're doing so as quickly as they can and with integrity.' McCoy believes that while vote counting in Pennsylvania's 67 counties will require careful attention, he expects results to trickle in during the overnight hours and into Wednesday morning. But he said the disparity between the state's Republican and Democratic areas could create some drama along the way. July Trump shooting attempt ‘should not have happened’: Task force 'It’s not unexpected that there might be some changes in the lead over the course of the night,' McCoy told NewsNation. Mail-in voting in Arizona Arizona, where roughly 90% of ballots were mailed in during the 2020 election, historically takes longer to call due to the time it takes to determine which ballots can be counted based on the postmark. Biden won Arizona by just 0.3% in 2020. Maricopa County, where much of the Phoenix metro area is located, is expected to garner the crux of the election attention four years after Biden won the county by 45,109 votes. In 2020, after Trump claimed the election was stolen, Arizona Republicans commissioned a hand recount of Maricopa County's 2.1 million ballots, which affirmed Biden had defeated Trump. Thousands of migrants heading for southern border Election experts expect another close race in Arizona, keeping interest in the state high. Delays could push the race into a critical position if the state is needed to secure victory for either candidate. Other factors on Election Day Voter turnout could also help determine the timeframe for a winner, according to NewsNation political editor and 'The Hill Sunday' host Chris Stirewalt. Turnout numbers for the upcoming election should be known by 9 p.m. ET on election night, which could provide clues about which candidates could benefit most and when a winner will be determined. Stirewalt also believes that the scrutiny around election officials in 2020 could spill over to this election, which might slow things down. He also expects legal challenges to be mounted again, which would also lead to delays. With so many factors in play, establishing any sense of certainty proves to be difficult. 'If we’re going to be very honest, then we have to say we don’t really know,' Stirewalt told NewsNation. 'We have to be prepared for a really quick night or a long week, but we certainly can’t rule either of those out.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/states-delay-2024-election-call/	2024-10-22T13:01:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
NC family determined to rebuild after losing 11 members to Helene	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene brought devastation to the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina, devastating one family who lost 11 loved ones to the storm. Jesse and Mekenzie Craig live in Fairview, North Carolina, a town about 12 miles southeast of Asheville. One area of the town was known as 'Craigtown' for the family that was so entrenched in the community. 'We're just taking it day by day,' Jesse Craig told NewsNation. 'We have a great family and a great support system.' What to know about poll watchers Eleven members of the family, including Jesse Craig's parents, were killed after a mudslide swept through the area, destroying entire houses. Craig said he and his wife were waiting out the storm in their basement and he spoke to his father the morning Helene hit. When the couple emerged they found downed trees across the room and one of their vehicles totaled. But there was no cell phone service to check on loved ones. His brother eventually got a call through and broke the news. 'He said Mom and Dad are gone,' Craig recalled. 'Instantly, your brain goes into shock, your body goes into shock.' Legality of Musk’s $1M offer ‘questionable’: Fmr. Pennsylvania AG After getting the call, service cut out again and the Craigs were unable to get ahold of anyone for days. In addition to Jesse Craig's parents, he lost his aunt, uncle, great-uncle, great-aunt and multiple cousins. The Craig family had been in the town since the mid-1900s, with multiple generations staying in the same area. Now, the Craigs are determined to rebuild so the family doesn't lose eight decades of history.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/nc-family-lose-11-helene/	2024-10-22T11:21:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/CraigFamily.jpg?w=900
Ex-Abercrombie & Fitch CEO arrested on sex trafficking charges	This story contains discussions of rape or sexual assault that may be disturbing. If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, The National Sexual Assault Hotline can be reached at 1-800-656-4673 to provide support and resources. (NewsNation) — The former CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has been arrested on sex trafficking charges brought by federal prosecutors in New York. Former CEO Mike Jeffries was arrested in Florida and is being charged along with his partner Matthew Smith and associate James Jacobson. United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace detailed the allegations in the indictment against the men, which includes 15 victims known as 'John Doe.' Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs accused of raping 13-year-old: Lawsuit He described the system as a 'casting couch' model where men hoping to get featured in an Abercrombie ad to kickstart their careers were then trafficked. 'To anyone who thinks they can coerce others using a casting call system, prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison,' Pearce said. Jeffries and Smith are accused of hiring Jacobson to act as a recruiter to select young men hoping to build a career in modeling who would then be coerced or forced to engage in sex acts at events run by Jeffries and Smith. Prosecutors say Jeffries and Smith intentionally targeted heterosexual men who expressed they would be unwilling to engage in certain sex acts, including anal sex, who were then forced to take part in such activity. Jacobson allegedly engaged in tryouts where he paid men to engage in sex acts, and Smith allegedly selected which men would be flown to his and Jeffries' homes or to hotels around the world. According to the indictment, the itineraries provided to victims resembled that which would be used for a typical photoshoot or modeling job, obscuring the nature of the sex events they would then be taken to. Men were physically groomed and forced to give up personal items like phones and wallets during the event and to sign nondisclosure agreements, the indictment says. Woman poisoned boyfriend for his nonexistent $30M inheritance Prosecutors say the men were not informed about the details of the sex acts they would be expected to perform and were given substances including alcohol, Viagra and poppers to perform and were sometimes injected with erection-inducing medication if they were unwilling or unable to act as directed. Staff kept the men from leaving events, prosecutors say, and Smith and Jeffries allegedly violated men who were unwilling to participate by force. While there are 15 victims in the charging documents, authorities said the investigation is ongoing, and they believe there are dozens of victims during a time spanning from 2008 to 2015. Anyone with information or who was a victim is encouraged to contact the FBI. Last year, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was sued over allegations that Jeffries was operating a sex trafficking ring exploiting young men who hoped to become models for the company and that Abercrombie allegedly turned a blind eye to the abuse.

Norfolk Southern tops third-quarter expectations with insurance b...	Norfolk Southern's streamlined operations delivered strong earnings last quarter, even excluding boosts from insurance payouts related to the disastrous derailment in East Palestine and the sale of two rail lines. The Atlanta company recorded a $287 million gain on the sale of rail lines in Virginia and North Carolina, and for the second quarter in a row it collected more insurance payments than it paid out for last year's derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Norfolk Southern earned $1.1 billion, or $4.85 per share in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago, when profits were hurt by mounting costs related to the derailment. Excluding one-time items, the railroad earned $737 million, or $3.25 per share, beating the $3.15 forecast by analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. Thousands of migrants heading for southern border Before the opening bell Tuesday, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp. rose 3%. New CEO Mark George, who took over last month, isn't expected to implement any strategic changes because he helped craft the plan a couple years ago that calls for keeping more employees on hand during a downturn, so the railroad can respond better when the economy recovers. 'It’s really about building out consistent, safe, reliable service with a network that’s resilient and can bounce back from events,' like it did when Norfolk Southern got all its major lines running again within 72 hours after Hurricane Helene hit, said George, who was promoted from Chief Financial Officer after Alan Shaw was fired for an inappropriate relationship with an employee. Norfolk Southern has been in the spotlight ever since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine triggered a national focus on railroad safety. Earlier this year, the railroad also had to fend off a takeover bid from investment firm Ancora Holdings. The investor ultimately won only three seats, insufficient to make the sweeping changes it sought. The railroad redoubled its efforts to lower costs in the spring, hiring Chief Operating Officer John Orr to help reduce the number of times railcars get switched and enable Norfolk Southern to operate fewer, longer trains. It’s operating expenses, when adjusted to remove costs related to the Ohio derailment and other one-time items, fell 6% to $1.93 billion. Norfolk Southern is working to improve its profit margin enough to catch up with the other major freight railroads. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

And I don’t have a whole lot of patience for lack of execution or acceptance of mediocrity,' George said. The railroad’s revenue of $3.05 billion was just below analyst expectation for $3.09 billion.

What is pink cocaine? Autopsy finds drug in Liam Payne's body	SALT LAKE CITY (KTVX/KUCW) — A partial autopsy conducted on former One Direction singer Liam Payne found multiple substances in his system when he fell to his death from the third-floor balcony of a hotel room in Argentina last week, according to a new report from ABC News. Among them were cocaine, benzodiazepine, crack and a fourth drug known as 'pink cocaine.' Fans gather for Liam Payne memorial at Centennial Park in Nashville What is pink cocaine? Despite its name, pink cocaine does not actually have any cocaine in it. The National Capital Poison Center describes the drug as a powdered cocktail of drugs, typically including ecstasy, ketamine, caffeine and a psychedelic drug known as 2-CB. The drug can also be referred to as Tusi -- a phonetic translation of '2C' -- and often comes in the form of a vibrant pink powder. The color reportedly comes from the addition of colored dye and sometimes from strawberry flavoring. The National Capital Poison Center said pink cocaine is not as addictive as other drugs such as opioids or fentanyl but can have some potential for addiction. Poison Control said pink cocaine is often used in a party or club setting and can cause a variety of effects including hallucinations, anxiety, elevated body temperature, increased heart rate and nausea, among other side effects. 'Physical and sexual assaults, as well as traumatic injuries, have occurred when people are impaired by this type of drug,' the NCPC warns. 'It is also important to know that pink cocaine may be contaminated with drugs beyond those mentioned here, so unanticipated effects can occur depending on what is in the mixture.' Liam Payne's death Moments before Liam Payne's death, hotel staff called the police in Buenos Aires reporting an 'aggressive man' who was believed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The hotel manager could be heard on a 911 call obtained by the Associated Press saying there was a guest 'destroying the entire room.' Liam Payne’s 1D bandmates, Cheryl, Simon Cowell and more mourn singer Responding officers arrived just as Payne had 'thrown himself' from the balcony of his room, according to a spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality. Authorities said Payne suffered 'very serious injuries' in the fall and there was no possibility of resuscitation. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Liam Payne’s hotel called for ‘urgent’ assistance before his death A preliminary autopsy report had concluded Payne died of 'multiple traumas' as well as 'internal and external bleeding' caused by the fall. Buenos Aires police reported finding Payne's hotel room in 'complete disarray' with several drugs scattered about. Sources told ABC News that police also found an improvised aluminum pipe to ingest drugs.

Thousands of migrants heading for southern border	(NewsNation) — A large caravan of migrants is heading from southern Mexico toward the United States' southern border. These thousands of people are part of a group called 'God Guides Us,' with members from multiple nationalities, including Venezuelan, Colombian, Haitian, Afghani and Nepalese migrants who desire to enter the United States. The hope for many is to cross the border before former President Donald Trump could be elected back to the White House, where he has promised mass deportation of those who have entered the country illegally. Trump overtakes Harris for first time in Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast Caravans such as 'God Guides Us' rarely make it to the southern border as a group. Some splinter off in and around Mexico City. In some cases, they can end up with the cartel and then come into the United States in smaller groups. GOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, provided an exclusive statement to NewsNation on this latest wave of migrants attempting to enter the U.S. 'Would-be border crossers know that their best chance to be released into American communities is under the open border policies of Joe Biden and his border czar Vice President (Kamala) Harris,' Green said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/thousands-migrants-southern-border/	2024-10-21T12:29:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/immigration-data_bernal_AssociatedPress_f9b684.jpg?w=900
Stock gains will be lower over the next decade: Goldman Sachs	(NewsNation) — The stock market has been booming over the past decade but returns could be much lower in the years ahead, according to a new forecast. The S&amp;P 500 — the broad market index — is expected to produce an annualized nominal return of just 3% over the next decade, Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team said in an analysis reviewed by CNBC. If that happens, it would be a significant decrease from the 13% annual return the last decade, which was higher than the long-term average of 11%. With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings? 'Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are toward the lower end of their typical performance distribution,' the team wrote in a note dated Oct. 18, per Bloomberg. One of the main reasons for the lower forecast? High market concentration. The so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks — companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia — have driven much of the recent returns and it's 'extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time,' the strategy paper noted. Is the stock market in an AI bubble? In other words, if a few stocks dip it could drag down the overall stock market. The Magnificent Seven generated nearly 60% of the S&amp;P 500 Index’s return year to date through June, according to a report from investment firm Boston Partners. In 2023, that figure was 62%. In fact, the recent rise in stock market concentration has been the steepest in 60 years and is now at a multi-decade high, J.P. Morgan wrote in a report earlier this year. U.S. equities have surged over the past decade and the S&amp;P 500 is on track to outperform the rest of the world in eight of the last 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&amp;P 500 has notched 47 record highs so far in 2024 and could go higher after the election as has historically been the case, Bloomberg said. JPMorgan Chase, the world's biggest bank, has also warned investors to brace for lower returns over the next decade. The analyst team there is slightly more optimistic, forecasting a 5.7% average annual return for the S&amp;P 500 over the next ten years in a report last month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/stock-lower-next-decade-goldman-sachs/	2024-10-21T10:49:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66fdb96ae67819.73820626.jpeg?w=900
Blue wall blitz: Harris courts undecided voters with Republican h...	MALVERN, Pa. (NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is barnstorming three must-win states on Monday, trying to court undecided voters, especially suburban women. And she’s bringing along what her campaign hopes is her secret weapon: former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. With the campaign heading into its final two weeks, Harris is trying to woo disaffected Republicans, specifically those who voted against former President Donald Trump and for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Harris and Cheney will blitz through suburban counties Haley won prior to dropping out of the Republican presidential primary contest: Chester County, Pennsylvania; Oakland County, Michigan; and Waukesha County, Wisconsin. You can watch the event in Oakland County, Michigan live here at 4:10p/3:10C. GOP-leaning polls trigger questions about accuracy Harris hopes to capitalize on what her team says are Trump’s 'unprecedented weakness' among women and white, college-educated voters. In Chester County, for instance, more than 9,000 people voted for Haley in the Republican primary after she had dropped out of the race. Cheney, who has been campaigning with Harris under the slogan 'country over party,' will be joined by longtime Republican strategist Sarah Longwell and conservative radio host Charlie Sykes. Despite the Harris campaign's efforts, Trump and Haley officials are discussing the two appearing together in the final stretch of the election, a source familiar with the matter confirms to NewsNation. During a 'Fox and Friends' interview Friday, Trump noted that although he soundly defeated Haley, he would still tap the former United Nations ambassador during his administration to help him win. Participate in NewsNation’s town hall with JD Vance 'I’ll do what I have to do,' Trump said. Haley offered her 'strong endorsement' of Trump in July in her Republican National Convention speech. Last month, Haley told listeners of her SiriusXM show that while she does not always agree with Trump, she still supports him because she thinks he will 'make the country better.' 'I have not forgotten what he said about me. I’ve not forgotten what he said about my husband or his, you know, deployment time or his military service,' Haley said. 'I haven’t forgotten about his or his campaign’s tactics from, you know, putting a birdcage outside our hotel room to calling me ‘bird brain.' 'But politics is not for thin-skinned people. It’s just not. And I think that if you really want to do a service for your country, you have to be able to put the personal part of it aside,' Haley added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-cheney-campaign-blue-wall-states/	2024-10-21T10:18:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179103377.jpg?w=900

Jury selection set to begin in NYC subway chokehold death trial	(NewsNation) — A former marine charged in the 2023 chokehold, subway death of a homeless man is set to stand trial with jury selection set to begin in Manhattan on Monday. Daniel Penny, now 25, is accused of 'recklessly causing the death' of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old former street performer who witnesses say was acting erratically on the train on May 1, 2023, when Penny moved to restrain him. Penny, who served four years in the Marines before being discharged in 2021, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He has been free on a $100,000 bond but faces up to 19 years in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to last between four to six weeks. Asheville woman's home burglarized after Helene Protesters took to the streets to demand that authorities arrest Penny — who is white; Neely was Black — while others rallied in support outside the courthouse once he was charged. The case also became a cause celebre among Republican presidential hopefuls. Jordan Neely's death Witnesses to the incident said Neely — who had struggled with drug addiction, mental illness and homelessness — had been shouting and demanding money when Penny approached him. Penny pinned Neely to the ground with the help of two other passengers and placed him in a chokehold for more than three minutes until Neely’s body went limp. The medical examiner’s office ruled the death a homicide caused by compression of the neck. Daniel Penny's case arguments Penny’s lawyers have argued that the Long Island native didn’t intend to kill Neely, just to hold him down long enough for police to arrive. Penny has claimed Neely shouted, 'I’m gonna’ kill you' and that he was 'ready to die' or go to jail for life. The defense said it plans to offer up other potential causes for Neely’s death, including high levels of the synthetic cannabinoid known as K2 found in his body. Oregon man guilty of kidnapping after woman escapes makeshift cell They’ll also argue that the video shared widely on social media proves Penny was not applying pressure consistently enough to render Neely unconscious, much less kill him. Prosecutors, in their court filings, have argued Penny’s actions were reckless and negligent even if he didn’t intend to kill Neely. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office declined to comment ahead of the trial. Neely’s surviving family members say they’ve been anticipating this moment and intend to attend the trial.

July Trump shooting attempt ‘should not have happened’: Task forc...	(NewsNation) — The July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump 'clearly shows a lack of planning and coordination between the United States Secret Service (USSS) and its law enforcement partners before the rally,' according to the preliminary investigation conducted by a Congressional task force. 'Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,' the report’s executive summary concludes. The strong words are contained in a 53-page document labeled 'Interim staff report: Investigating the stunning security failures on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania.' How has Donald Trump’s Secret Service security detail changed? The report immediately condemns the 'lack of planning and coordination between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners before the rally.' It cites the failure of clear guidance from the Secret Service to the state and local agencies about managing the areas outside the secure event perimeter. For example, 'there was no joint meeting on the day of the rally between USSS and all state and local law enforcement agencies assisting USSS.' It also blasts USSS for deciding to put the American Glass Research building, from which Thomas Matthew Crooks fired on Trump, outside the secure perimeter. Another major failure, according to the report, was the failure to engage Crooks at several 'pivotal moments' that day. HSI agents at Trump rally ‘ill-prepared’ for assassination attempt 'Throughout the afternoon, as Crooks’s behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement and, eventually, climb on to the roof of the AGR complex and fire eight shots at the rally stage and crowd, killing a rally attendee and injuring three others, including former President Trump,' the report states. The task force staff writes that it will continue to 'rigorously' investigate the July assassination attempt. It will also look at the September 15 incident in West Palm Beach, Florida in which an armed man was arrested near the Trump International Golf Course. The Congressional panel’s interim comes eight days after an independent review panel also detailed the failures in Butler and listed several 'remediations' for USSS. Among them: a 're-focus on the Secret Service’s protective mission.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-shooting-attempt-task-force/	2024-10-21T02:42:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24196223710960-e1727351283559.jpg?w=900
Stunning security failures' led to Trump assassination attempt, ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in July was 'preventable and should not have happened,' according to a bipartisan House panel that is investigating the shooting and what it calls the 'stunning security failures' at the event. The report from a House task force, released Monday, is just the latest look at the cascading and wide-ranging law enforcement failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally where Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire. One rallygoer was killed in the shooting and two others were wounded. Members of both the House and Senate have repeatedly questioned why the Secret Service, an agency tasked with protecting the country’s top leaders, didn’t do a better job communicating with local authorities during the campaign rally, particularly when it came to securing the building that was widely agreed to be a security threat but that ultimately was left so unprotected that gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to climb up and shoot. Lawmakers in their report focus on 'the fragmented lines of communication and unclear chains of command' between Secret Service and Pennsylvania state and local police but place the majority of the blame on the Secret Service for the security breakdown. 'Federal, state, and local law enforcement officers could have engaged Thomas Matthew Crooks at several pivotal moments,' the report stated. Lawmakers added that throughout the afternoon, 'as Crooks’s behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement' and climb onto the unsecured roof where he would eventually open fire. 'Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,' the report continued. The preliminary findings are drawn from thousands of pages of documents, nearly two dozen transcribed interviews with state and local officials as well as a series of both classified and non-classified briefings from senior officials at the Secret Service and the FBI. The report breaks little new ground, as the failed Secret Service response has been already documented by an independent commission, an interim Senate report as well as congressional testimony and news media investigations. The House report, like others before it, does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame. But The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. The director of the Secret Service at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned shortly after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse. The task force — comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats — showcased some of the report's findings during a public hearing last month. Lawmakers say they plan to issue a final report, including recommendations to avoid future assassination attempts against political candidates, by mid-December. The task force has also begun investigating the second assassination attempt on Trump last month where a man with a rifle camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-stunning-security-failures-led-to-assassination-attempt-at-trump-rally-house-report-finds/	2024-10-21T02:04:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671619b325b827.97366582.jpeg?w=900
Dodgers finish off Mets with 10-5 win in NLCS and advance to face...	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani carried the injury-riddled Los Angeles Dodgers to baseball's best record during the regular season. Tommy Edman joined the team in late July and helped them reach the World Series. It's been that kind of year for the big-spending Dodgers. When Ohtani isn't amazing with his power at the plate and prowess on the basepaths, someone else is stepping up. Edman and Will Smith homered to send Ohtani into the World Series for the first time, and the Dodgers eliminated the New York Mets with a 10-5 victory in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday night. Los Angeles opens the World Series against the New York Yankees on Friday. 'I really feel like we finally arrived, I finally arrived at this stage,' Ohtani said through a translator. 'A lot of the games we played were really tough and hard to win, and it was truly a team effort to get here.' The Dodgers clinched their record 25th NL pennant, their fourth in eight years and first won at home since beating the Mets over seven games in 1988. They moved on to their 22nd World Series — 13th in Los Angeles — and first since 2020, when they beat Tampa Bay during the pandemic-delayed season. 'Every year I get to spring training and I wonder how we’re going to make a baseball team fit because we have so many talented players,' reliever Evan Phillips said. 'I wouldn’t say we planned for injuries but we planned to have multiple guys contribute throughout the year.' Next up for Ohtani and Co. is Aaron Judge and the Yankees, back in the World Series for the 41st time and first in 15 years. The matchup, which opens at Dodger Stadium, features the top two home-run hitters in Judge (58) and Ohtani (54). 'It’s kind of what the people wanted, what we all wanted,' Dodgers star Mookie Betts said. 'It’s going to be a battle of two good teams, a lot of long flights across the country.' It’ll be the 12th time the franchises meet in the World Series and the first in 43 years. The Yankees have beaten the Dodgers eight times, while the Dodgers’ three championships against the Bronx Bombers came in 1955, 1963 and 1981. 'It’s the place that I’ve dreamt of playing all my life,' Ohtani said, 'and to be able to finally come to this stage and be able to play and hopefully win it is my next goal.' Playing his first season with the Dodgers after agreeing to a record $700 million, 10-year contract as a free agent, Ohtani had two hits and scored two runs in Game 6. He hit .364 with two homers and six RBIs in the NLCS. 'The goal was to get to this far,' Ohtani said. 'And I also pictured myself getting this far with the contract that I’ve signed.' Ohtani spent his first six MLB seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, who never had a winning record or reached the playoffs during his tenure. 'We wouldn’t be here without him,' Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy said. 'We went through a lot of injuries and there was a good stretch during the regular season where he singlehandedly carried us.' The Dodgers, who were eliminated in the Division Series the previous two years, spent a combined $1 billion last winter to sign Ohtani and pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto to lucrative long-term contracts in hopes of winning the franchise’s eighth World Series title. Rookie Ben Casparius got four outs for the win and Blake Treinen the save in his first two-inning outing since the 2021 NLCS. Los Angeles trailed after Pete Alonso's run-scoring single against starter Michael Kopech. Edman gave the Dodgers the lead for good with a two-run double in the bottom half off Sean Manaea that drove in Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, who both singled. Hernández snapped an 0-for-18 skid. Edman drove in the Dodgers' first four runs and his 11 RBIs in the NLCS tied a franchise record set by Corey Seager in 2020 against Atlanta. Edman, who won the NLCS MVP award, joined the Dodgers at the July trade deadline from St. Louis. 'I think the common theme for this season has been a lot of people, different guys have been stepping up over the course of the season,' Ohtani said. Edman sent a 406-foot shot to left-center for a two-run homer in a four-run third that included Smith’s 416-foot drive to center off Phil Maton that extended the lead to 6-1. 'I never imagined once we acquired him, he’d be hitting fourth in a postseason game,' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of Edman. 'But I trust him. The guys trust him. He’s made huge defensive plays for us and had huge hits.' Vientos hit his fifth postseason homer, a two-run drive in the fourth Ryan Brasier that cut the deficit to 6-3 in the fourth. The Dodgers, whose starting pitching has been decimated by injuries, used seven pitchers in finishing off the Mets, whose $332 million payroll was the biggest in baseball. New York twice stranded the bases loaded, when Anthony Banda struck out Jeff McNeil in the third and when Jesse Winker flied out against Phillips in the sixth. Los Angeles outscored New York 40-26 in the six games. The Mets came within two wins of reaching the World Series after overcoming a 22-33 start and earning the NL’s last wild card. 'This should be our expectations moving forward every year, we should be playing games deep into October,' first year-manager Carlos Mendoza said. Manaea lasted just two innings, giving up five runs and six hits. Alonso had two hits and drove in a run in what could have been his final game for the Mets. The first baseman is eligible for free agency after the World Series. 'I love this team. I love this organization. This fanbase has treated not just myself, but my family so, so well,' Alonso said. The sellout crowd of 52,674 included Tom Hanks, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Magic Johnson, Rob Lowe, Josh Groban, Jenny McCarthy and Vanessa Bryant.

4 dead in Houston radio tower helicopter crash: Police	HOUSTON (AP) — A helicopter reportedly crashed Sunday in Houston after hitting a radio tower, killing four people on board, including a child, fire officials said. Houston authorities said the aircraft, an R44 helicopter, went down just before 8 p.m. in Houston's Second Ward, east of the city's downtown, after apparently taking off from Ellington Field about 15 miles away. The identities of the victims and their ages have not yet been released. 'PIO is en route to a reported helicopter crash at Engelke &amp; Ennis,' the fire department said Sunday evening on X. 'The helicopter that crashed in Second Ward was not an HPD helicopter, it was a private touring helicopter,' Houston City Councilmember Mario Castillo said on X, although that could not be immediately confirmed. Local media outlets reported a large amount of emergency personnel responding to the scene. Police and fire officials have urged residents near the crash site to call 911 if they find anything on their property that could help in their investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/ap-helicopter-crashes-in-houstons-second-ward-after-hitting-radio-tower-killing-4-officials-say/	2024-10-20T21:52:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1801085827.jpg?w=724
Trump overtakes Harris for first time in Decision Desk HQ/The Hil...	Former President Trump on Sunday overtook Vice President Harris for the first time in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast this cycle. The model predicts Trump has a 52 percent chance of winning the presidency while Harris has a 42 percent chance, as of Sunday. Republicans head to court in expanding battle about overseas ballots Since late August, the election forecast put Harris’s chances of winning at approximately 54 to 56 percent, with Trump’s chances at approximately 44 to 46 percent. In early October, however, those dynamics began to shift, and the election forecast predicted both candidates’ chances to be closer to 50 percent. On Oct. 17, the model predicted the two candidates were equally likely to win next month, and Trump took the advantage on Oct. 20. The shift in election forecast coincides with the Republican candidate’s improved polling averages in Wisconsin and Michigan, two battleground states that previously leaned slightly toward Harris. Trump already had a slim advantage in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Of the seven swing states seen as decisive in determining the outcome of the 2024 election, Pennsylvania is alone in still favoring Harris in its polling average. Top 5 ways education would look different under Harris vs. Trump Nonetheless, the race remains a toss-up, according to the election forecast, since the polling in all seven states remains within the margin of error, meaning typical polling inaccuracies could shift the results in either direction. These states are expected to be decisive in determining which candidate reaches the crucial 270 electoral votes. Currently, neither Trump nor Harris has a clear lead in enough states to secure that number.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/decision-desk-hq-the-hill-election-forecast/	2024-10-20T16:39:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-campaigning-10.18.png?w=900
Raffensperger: Republican voting claims will 'really hurt' GOP tu...	Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) said Sunday that claims about vote integrity from Republicans will 'really hurt' turnout for his party. Raffensperger had already pushed back on a claim from fellow Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about a Northern Georgia 'voter’s printed ballot' being 'changed from their selections made on' a Dominion Voting Systems machine in the interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. Raffensperger denies voter fraud amid Georgia’s historic early-vote turnout Stirewalt noted that 'some people, including those in your own party, don't want … don't agree with that, and they're pushing these kinds of stories.' 'What do you say to them, who are pushing this kinda stuff out there, here in the eve of the election?' Stirewalt asked Raffensperger. 'Well, at the end of the day, if you start [spreading] … stories like that, all you’re gonna do is to … we’ll really hurt our turnout on our side,' Raffensperger said. 'And I'm a conservative Republican, so I don't know why they do that … self-defeating.' As the election has inched closer, former President Trump’s denial of the 2020 election results has made its way back into the headlines. Trump notably called Raffensperger following the election, asking him to find over 11,000 votes that would have overturned President Biden’s win in the Peach State. 'When you get high marks by the Heritage Foundation, you know, they're giving us a top ranking, that means that we're doing the right things,' Raffensperger said in the interview Sunday. Trump is currently leading Vice President Harris in the battle for the White House in Georgia, up by 1.6 percent according to an average of polls from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon urges ‘respect’ for election The Hill has reached out to Greene’s office and the Republican National Committee. 'The false claim that voting machines can switch votes has been repeatedly debunked,' a spokesperson for Dominion said in a statement emailed to The Hill Sunday, adding that 'as both state and local election authorities have confirmed' the incident Greene described 'was due to voter error.'

Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon urges 'respect' for election	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a Sunday interview urged 'respect' for 'our elections' as the 2024 election looms. 'We have to respect our elections, and I get it, candidates have the right to go to court and appeal, or to challenge versus … various processes,' Bacon told NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt in an interview on 'The Hill Sunday.' Elon Musk’s daily $1 million payouts at Trump rally draw legal scrutiny Bacon, alongside five other Republicans, signed onto a bipartisan letter released in September headed up by centrists vowing to respect the results of the November election. 'In America, we respect election results especially once the courts and appeals work through the process,' Bacon said in a statement at the time. 'We fight hard to win during campaigns and then respect the results when the votes are counted. Bacon said that there should be no 'reticence at all to say we’re gonna support the winner of the elections, period.' Former President Trump’s denial of the 2020 election results has returned to the headlines as Election Day has neared. In a debate against Vice President Harris last month, Trump expressed pushback toward the idea that he had accepted losing to President Biden four years ago. Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election 'No, I don’t acknowledge that at all,' Trump said. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also recently said that the former president didn’t face a loss against Biden in 2020 'by the words that I would use.' 'I think there were serious problems in 2020. So did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use,' Vance said at a campaign event in Pennsylvania.

Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election He said the issue was 'blown out of proportion' online. 'We’re going to respond quickly to these sorts of things in 2024 because it’s not supported by the facts,' Raffensperger said. 'The equipment’s working. We’ve done all sorts of audits since the last election and coming up to this election.' Georgia residents have cast ballots early in historic numbers — more than 1 million Georgians have already voted. 'I’m going to make sure that whoever wins this race, this is what gets certified.

Trump works the drive-thru at Pennsylvania McDonald’s	Former President Trump on Sunday stepped behind the counter at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, working the drive-thru for a short time after he spent weeks mocking Vice President Harris's past experience at the fast-food chain. Trump traded his suit jacket for an apron at a McDonald's location in Bucks County. He worked the fry cooker and handed an order to a customer at the drive-thru. Elon Musk’s daily $1 million payouts at Trump rally draw legal scrutiny The former president stopped at the fast-food chain ahead of a town hall in Lancaster, Pa., later Sunday. He is also expected to attend the Pittsburgh Steelers game against the New York Jets on Sunday night. Trump has been fixated for weeks on Harris's past experience working at McDonald's in college. The Harris campaign launched an ad in August highlighting the vice president’s upbringing in an effort to appeal to middle-class voters. The ad noted that Harris worked at McDonald’s while earning her college degree at Howard University. She had referenced the experience during past campaigns as well. Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election Trump and his allies have repeatedly suggested Harris did not actually work at McDonald's because it was not listed on her resume. 'I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala,' Trump quipped Sunday. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Trump's McDonald's visit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pennsylvania-mcdonalds/	2024-10-20T12:01:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24294650830394-e1729449052463.jpg?w=900
Driving the vote: New Jersey GOP tries to flip state to red	(NewsNation) — It's the place where the first rock and roll song was ever performed, where the dance 'The Twist' first originated, and it's where Republican former president Donald Trump held a rally in May, declaring he was going to win the state in the 2024 presidential election. The place is New Jersey, a state that hasn’t gone red since 1988, when the original 'Beetlejuice' was haunting theaters. Latest polls show Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris having a comfortable lead over Trump.

Trump to work behind McDonald's counter in Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump has a busy Sunday schedule ahead of him, 16 days until Election Day -- he's scheduled for a work shift at McDonald's. Trump will be hosting a rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, attending the Jets-Steelers NFL game in Pittsburgh, and is set to work behind the counter at a McDonald's in Lower Southampton Township, his campaign says. But for Rep. Scott Perry, R-PA, this will 'highlight he's for the working class,' he said on NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Pennsylvania is one of seven battleground states both presidential candidate needs to reach 270 Electoral College votes. The Keystone State gets 19 of those votes, making last-minute campaigning all the more urgent to get undecided voters, well, decided. 'President Trump is showing that he is very different from the party of the coastal elites and that he understands the average citizen that gets up every day, oftentimes in the dark, packs a lunch, and heads out to work just to pay their bills,' Scott said. The former president has questioned the summer job Harris said she held in college, working the cash register and making fries at McDonald’s while attending Howard University in Washington. Trump has claimed the vice president never worked there, repeating the claim Friday night at a campaign rally in Detroit, saying Harris 'lied about working at McDonald’s.' A Trump-endorsed candidate also running for reelection, Scott is not worried about Trump's rhetoric and language alienating groups of independent voters, including votes of Black males. Harris makes last-ditch appeal to disenchanted Republicans 'I think he speaks plain, you know, I think most people understand the point that he's trying to make and have probably made the same point themselves behind closed doors,' Scott said. 'He's reminding them about how bad it's been for the past essentially four years, which is also a reminder of how great it was four years prior to the Harris-Biden regime.' Though admitting he wouldn't use the language Trump uses. 'But then again, I'm not President Trump, and I don't draw tens of thousands of people to my rallies week after week, day after day, so I'm going to let President Trump be President Trump.' Election Day is Nov. 5, but early in-person voting is already underway.

Israeli strikes on northern Gaza leave at least 87 dead or missin...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on multiple homes in the northern Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday left at least 87 people dead or missing, the territory's Health Ministry said. It said another 40 people were wounded in the strikes on the town of Beit Lahiya, which was among the first targets of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago. The strikes came as the United States is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel’s plans to attack Iran, according to three U.S. officials. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents, attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and marked top secret, indicate that Israel was moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. The U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The U.S. is urging Israel to press for a cease-fire in Gaza following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week. But neither Israel nor Hamas has shown any renewed interest in such a deal, after months of negotiations sputtered to a halt in August. Iran supports Hamas and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, where a year of escalating tensions boiled over into all-out war last month. Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon at the start of October. There was no immediate comment on the strikes in Beit Lahiya from the Israeli military, which said it was 'continuing to operate across Gaza in both aerial strikes and ground operations.' Among the dead were two parents and their four children, and a woman, her son and her daughter-law and their four children, according to Raheem Kheder, a medic. He said the strike flattened a multi-story building and at least four neighboring houses. Mounir al-Bursh, director general of the Health Ministry, said the flood of wounded from the strikes compounded 'an already catastrophic situation for the health care system' in northern Gaza, in a post on X. Internet connectivity went down in northern Gaza late Saturday and had not yet been restored by midday Sunday, making it difficult to gather information about the strikes. Israel has been carrying out a major operation in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, also in northern Gaza, for the last two weeks. The military says it launched the operation against Hamas militants who had regrouped there. The north has already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year, following the deadly Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the opening weeks of the war and reiterated those instructions earlier this month. Most of the population fled last year, but around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north. Palestinians who fled the north at the start of the war have not been allowed to return. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

US investigating unauthorized release of classified documents on ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted online to Telegram and first reported by CNN and Axios. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said. The documents emerged as the U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a ceasefire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel's leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran's missile attack go unanswered. In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-us-investigating-unauthorized-release-of-classified-documents-on-israel-attack-plans/	2024-10-19T17:52:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67144be3531cd4.94854082.jpeg?w=900
Trump compares imprisoned Jan. 6 rioters to Japanese Americans du...	(The Hill) - Former President Trump on Friday alleged nobody had been treated worse than those imprisoned for storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, other than Japanese Americans who were put in internment camps during World War II. Trump appeared on 'The Dan Bongino Show,' where he questioned why those prosecuted for their actions on Jan. 6 were still being held after a Supreme Court ruling in June found an obstruction law used to charge scores of rioters was improperly applied. 'The other thing is as you know they really won in the Supreme Court. The Fischer case and the various cases,' Trump said. 'Why are they still being held? Nobody’s ever been treated like this. Maybe the Japanese during Second World War, frankly. But, you know, they were held, too.' Trump, who went on to attack the House committee that investigated the events of Jan. 6, called it 'a very sad day in the country’s life.' Democrats look to quash threat from Green Party’s Jill Stein Roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans were held in internment camps during World War II after then-President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order. The treatment of Japanese-Americans during that period has been widely condemned in the decades since, with President Biden calling it 'one of the most shameful periods in American history.' On Jan. 6, 2021, a pro-Trump mob violently clashed with law enforcement at the Capitol to try to halt the certification of President Biden’s 2020 victory. The riot followed weeks of claims from Trump that his defeat was fraudulent. The Justice Department charged roughly 1,500 defendants in connection to the attack on the Capitol that day. Roughly 550 have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees. The Justice Department said nearly 900 individuals have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges in relation to the events of Jan. 6. Trump, who himself was charged over his attempts to remain in power, has in recent days repeatedly downplayed the attack on the Capitol. At a Univision town hall event, he told one voter concerned about the events of Jan. 6 that it was a 'day of love.' The former president during a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power in 2020 because he eventually left office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/dc-riots/trump-compares-imprisoned-jan-6-rioters-to-japanese-americans-during-wwii/	2024-10-19T17:28:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Trump_economicclub_detroit_4d0ba4-e1729279526437.jpg?w=900

What's going on in Dolton? Illinois town has 'America's worst may...	(NewsNation) — Politician Tiffany Henyard, the current mayor of the village of Dolton, Ill. who just announced her reelection bid, has faced myriad controversies during her tenure in the Chicago suburb. Accusations range from opponent sabotage to misuse of taxpayer dollars, with the embattled elected official at the center of it all. Who is Tiffany Henyard? Henyard is both the supervisor of the largest township in Illinois, Thornton Township and the mayor of Dolton, Ill. Both towns are located roughly 30 miles from bustling Chicago. Henyard, who calls herself a 'supermayor' because of her dual positions, grew up in the area. According to her bio on the city's website, Henyard was elected in 2021 with 82% of the vote, making her the 'village of Dolton’s first and youngest woman mayor in the village’s 130-year history.' She's also likely the most controversial mayor ever elected in the town of 20,000, with the two governments under control racking up expenditures on fine dining, first-class travel, an armed security detail and more. Politics aside, she also runs the Tiffany Henyard Cares Foundation, a cancer charity which has garnered criticism for its inability to show how it helps cancer patients. Mayor Tiffany Henyard's controversies Henyard faces many allegations, but some of the most damning include spending tax dollars on her own lifestyle, throwing lavish parties with community resources and retaliating against those who go against her or her allies. Henyard, her political committee, her cancer charity, her boyfriend, two of her relatives, four trustees who are allies, her deputy police chief and even her defunct burger business have all been named in the FBI subpoenas regarding financial mismanagement in the town. Most recently, Henyard has come under fire for an $85,000 party backed by taxpayer funds and named after 'Friends of Tiffany A. Henyard,' her campaign fund. Trustees in both Thornton and Dolton attempted to prevent public money being used for the festivities, which included flying in R&amp;B singer Keke Wyatt and rapper J. Holiday for a mini-concert for the 'Taste of Thornton Township.' 'Let me make sure I’m crystal clear about this: I ain’t never took a goddamn thing in my life,' Henyard told Facebook viewers during a livestream from the outdoor gathering. JD Vance town hall on NewsNation: What you need to know Henyard has defended her taxpayer-funded events as important to the community, saying 'this is all for the babies' in a Facebook video taken at one of them. Residents don't believe her. 'I was flabbergasted,' said Lansing resident Jennifer Robertz. 'I was pissed off. That’s my money. That’s the people’s money.' The extravagant party and its backlash is far from the first public outcry about Henyard's spending. Lori Lightfoot investigates Henyard In August, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a lawyer, was hired to investigate Henyard after years of chaotic meetings and accusations from her constituents. Lightfoot’s findings, released in August 2024, included exorbitant spending that landed the village in a nearly $5.5 million deficit. Just two years before, Dolton had been in a surplus. Charges to the village included: Three Amazon purchases – all made in a single day – totaling $43,000 A $7,699 Wayfair purchase PayPal money transfers and gift cards NewsNation local affiliate WGN also uncovered pricey travel expenses of $67,000 over four months by Henyard and her allies. Some of the expenditures included first-class airfare and a $9,000 stay at a Four Seasons hotel. Only after our affiliate sued Henyard did her office release spending records from July to November 2023. Travel expenses from Henyard’s 'conferences' tallied up to nearly $70,000, with $20,000 spent in Texas alone. Besides the travel, other notable Dolton credit card charges include: $24,778 at retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target $14,425 at Amazon $5,009 at Uber Eats and local restaurants $3,491 for Henyard’s personal photographer Henyard’s three vehicles also cost residents more than $374,000. One of Henyard’s top aides, Keith Freeman, has been charged in federal court with bankruptcy fraud. Another aide, former acting police deputy chief Lewis Lacey, was indicted in August on bankruptcy fraud charges for collecting more than $200,000 in overtime during the previous four fiscal years. Sentencing hearing begins for former sheriff who stole millions Butting heads: Henyard vs. trustees The ongoing power struggle has stayed mostly between Henyard, the village’s trustees and other community leaders. Trustee Carmen Carlisle, who used to be Henyard's assistant, sent an email to WGN breaking her silence about the mayor’s alleged wrongdoings. 'I am standing up, not just for myself, but for others who have been affected by what I see as Henyard’s abusive leadership,' Carlisle’s statement said. 'I believe there are many more victims who have been retaliated against, fired or lied to by Henyard, but have yet to speak out.' In front of a packed audience at an August meeting, Henyard responded by saying: ''I think I’m going to get you a new nickname: ‘Lyin’ Carlisle.' 'I’m tired of everyone in here,' Henyard said. 'There always has to be a show.' Residents have also been caught in the cross-fire. What's next for Dolton? Trustees have instituted layoffs and say they’re now crafting their own budget to try to get the village’s finances in order. Henyard filed a lawsuit last week against a majority of the village's trustees, alleging that one of the meetings held at the Dolton Park District was illegal. Henyard announced on social media Tuesday that she is running for a second term. 'So again the time is now to run for office,' she wrote, also using the hashtag 'IStandWithTiff.' Meanwhile, Dolton’s mayor pro-tem Trustee Jason House plans to run for mayor, so far Henyard's only challenger in the February Democratic primary. House supported Henyard in her 2021 election. The deadline for election filings is Oct. 28. If defeated in the mayoral election, House would be off the Village Board because his position is up for reelection as well. Comments on Henyard's reelection announcement varied from support to opposition. 'Tiffany is going to win. She’s the incumbent. The opposing slate has no chance,' one Facebook user wrote. 'Only place your (sic) going is jail,' another commented. 'Y'all must have some good weed up there cuz I can't think of any reason y'all would vote for this lady after all she's done to bankrupt her town,' yet another user posted. Someone else questioned why Henyard isn't in federal prison. But the incumbent mayor also has an equal amount of support. 'You should run for Governor of Illinois. I'll vote for you,' someone said. Another: 'Praying you win reelection there's nobody else cares like you do even if I'm not from Dolton I see the good you do for those that do live there.'

3 killed and 8 injured by gunfire following a Mississippi school'...	LEXINGTON, Miss. (AP) — Three people were killed and eight others were injured in central Mississippi early Saturday when at least two people opened fire into a group of several hundred people who were celebrating a school's homecoming football win at an outdoor trail several hours after the game had ended, authorities said. The gunfire was proceeded by a fight between some of the men at the celebration, but deputies hadn't yet learned what sparked the fight, said Holmes County Sheriff Willie March. Anywhere from 200 to 300 people were on the trail celebrating, and the gunfire sent them fleeing, the sheriff said in a phone interview. 'It was chaos, to tell you the truth,' March said. 'The shooting just started and people started running.' The shootings about five miles (3 kilometers) outside of Lexington, Mississippi, followed a football game several hours earlier at the Holmes County Consolidated School’s homecoming celebration. After the victory, scores of young people headed to the trail to celebrate. Lexington is located more than 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of Jackson. Two of the victims who died were 19 and the third was 25. The injured victims were airlifted to local hospitals. Deputies were collecting ammunition at the scene in an effort to determine how many weapons were fired, March said. Shootings by young men have been an 'off and on' problem recently in the county, which has a population of almost 16,000 residents. The young men who talk to the sheriff tell him that it's often because they have a 'beef,' or disagreement with someone. 'It’s hard to see what they are fighting over. I don’t think they are fighting over turf or drugs,' March said. 'These are young men walking around with weapons. I wish I had an answer.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/ap-3-killed-and-8-injured-by-gunfire-following-a-mississippi-schools-football-game/	2024-10-19T09:21:17-07:00	
Drone strike launched toward Israeli prime minister's house. At l...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli government said a drone was launched toward the prime minister’s house Saturday, with no casualties, as Iran’s supreme leader vowed that Hamas would continue its fight against Israel following the killing of the mastermind of last year’s deadly Oct. 7 attack. Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement. In September, Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile toward Ben Gurion Airport when Netanyahu’s plane was landing. The missile was intercepted. Meanwhile, in Gaza, more than 50 people have been killed in several Israeli strikes, including children, in less than 24 hours, according to hospital officials and an Associated Press reporter. Saturday's strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. In addition to the drone launched at Netanyahu's residence, Israel's military said some 55 projectiles were fired in two separate barrages at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning. Some were intercepted, the army said, and there were no immediate reports of any casualties. Israel also said Saturday it killed Hezbollah’s deputy commander in the southern town of Bint Jbeil. The army said Nasser Rashid supervised attacks against Israel In Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a vehicle on a main highway north of Beirut, killing two people. It was unclear who was in the car when it was struck. A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. 'Hamas is alive and will stay alive,' Khamenei said. Since Israel claimed Sinwar’s death Thursday and a top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday, Hamas has reiterated its stance that the hostages they took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. The staunch position pushed back against a statement by Netanyahu that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming. Sinwar was the chief architect of the 2023 Hamas raid on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospital’s building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff. At Al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, strikes hit the building’s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where the casualties were taken. An AP reporter counted the bodies at the hospital. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where they were taken. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital. Overnight Friday, at least three houses were struck in northern Gaza killing at least 30 people, more than half of them women and children, said Fares Abu Hamza, head of the health ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. The homes were hit in Jabaliya and at least 80 people were injured. The war has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza, displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, and left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel. Sinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the war in Gaza even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. But Netanyahu said in a Thursday night speech announcing the killing that 'our war is not yet ended.' Still, the governments of Israel’s allies and exhausted residents of Gaza expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar’s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. — Associated Press reporters Jack Jeffery from Ramallah, West Bank and Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Lebanon contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-strike-launched-toward-israeli-prime-ministers-house/	2024-10-19T02:21:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67137b71afb217.38510193.jpeg?w=900
Georgia passes 1 million votes on fourth day of early voting	(NewsNation) — A million voters have turned out in Georgia as of 11:50 a.m. on Friday, the fourth day of early voting in the critical battleground state. Georgia Secretary of State Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling announced the milestone on X, celebrating record turnout in the state. He recently told NewsNation that while there are lines at polling places, they are moving fast and the secretary of state's office is committed to ensuring fair elections and being transparent with voters. Pro-Trump yard sign leads to shooting in Las Vegas neighborhood There are more than seven million registered voters in the state, where more than five million ballots were cast in the 2020 election. President Joe Biden's narrow victory in the state was critical to winning the White House. It has also been a focus for those who maintain, without evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen. In 2024, Georgia is once again expected to play a major role in deciding the next president. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have focused campaign efforts in the state and there have already been conflicts over election procedures. Republicans have challenged thousands of voters on the rolls and a judge recently blocked Republican-led efforts to require hand-counting of ballots and allow local election officials to delay certifying results. Trump is also facing racketeering charges in the state, related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-1-million-votes/	2024-10-18T11:12:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177861107.jpg?w=900
Middle East latest: Hezbollah says its war with Israel is enterin...	Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group said Friday it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckons with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Hamas acknowledged Sinwar’s death and described him as a martyr. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Many, from the governments of Israeli allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing Sinwar’s death that 'Our war is not yet ended.' On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Israel says it has killed the Hamas militant who guarded Sinwar JERUSALEM — Israel’s military says it killed the militant who guarded the late Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar was killed by Israeli troops on Wednesday in Rafah, Gaza. In a statement released Friday night, the military identified the militant as Mahmoud Hamdan. It says troops killed Hamdan on Friday, 200 meters (650 feet) away from where Sinwar was killed. The military says Hamdan acted as a guard for six hostages who were killed in August as Israeli troops drew near to where they were being held in the Gaza tunnel network. It did not provide evidence for the claim. The six hostages included an Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Biden says it may be easier to reach a cease-fire in Lebanon than Gaza BERLIN — President Joe Biden has suggested that negotiating a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could be easier than forging one between Israel and Hamas. Biden says he discussed the way ahead to end the Middle East conflict following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza when he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Friday. Biden told reporters that the leaders 'think that there is a possibility of working for a cease-fire in Lebanon and it’s going to be harder in Gaza.' He continued: 'But we agree there has to be an outcome of what happens the day after.' Sinwar was killed Wednesday by Israeli forces in Gaza, and Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone the following day. Biden declined to say whether Netanyahu gave him assurance during that conversation that the Israelis are ready to get back to negotiations toward a cease-fire and the release of hostages. 'We’re in the middle of discussions about that,' Biden said, adding: 'I’m not going to get into that.' Asked whether he had an understanding of when and how Israel may respond to Iran’s missile barrage on Israel earlier this month, Biden responded, 'Yes and yes.' He declined to offer any further details on Israel’s potential retaliation. Netanyahu plans to meet with ministers to discuss hostages JERUSALEM — Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to convene a special meeting with government ministers to discuss hostage negotiations in the light of Israel's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. It’s unclear when the meeting will be held or what exactly is on the agenda. Israelis have urged the government to use the opportunity to seal a deal for the hostages’ release since Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces Wednesday. Among hostage families, there’s hope Sinwar’s death could restart the negotiations that sputtered to a stop three weeks ago, when Hamas and Israel accused each other of negotiating in bad faith. UNICEF takes action after cholera case confirmed in northern Lebanon BEIRUT — The U.N.’s children’s agency says it has activated an emergency cholera response to help protect children and families by containing the disease. The announcement by UNICEF Friday follows the confirmation of a cholera case in the Akkar governorate in North Lebanon. The health ministry said in a statement that the cholera case was unrelated to the growing displacement crisis in Lebanon. However, the country remains vigilant in controlling the spread of communicable diseases amid the ongoing displacement. Lebanon says 6 more killed in fighting in the past 24 hours BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit says six people have been killed and 69 wounded in the past 24 hours in the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The new numbers raise the total toll over the past year of conflict to 2,418 killed and 11,336 wounded, the Lebanese Health Ministry said Friday. The crisis response unit report also records 87 airstrikes and shellings in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Some 1,098 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are sheltering 191,501 people, including 44,646 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report says. Among these shelters, 902 are full. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. The Lebanese Ministry of Education reports that 77 % of public schools are out of service, either due to their use as shelters or their location in areas directly affected by the war. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike on the road, crowds continue to flow across the border seeking safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 18, Lebanese General Security recorded 335,948 Syrian and 135,181 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report says. UK prime minister says ‘dire humanitarian situation’ in Gaza cannot go on BERLIN — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told Israel that 'the world will not tolerate any more excuses on humanitarian assistance' to people in Gaza. Speaking Friday during a visit to Berlin to meet President Joe Biden and European leaders, Starmer said 'the dire humanitarian situation cannot continue. … Civilians in northern Gaza need food now.' The Biden administration warned Israel on Sunday that it must increase the amount of humanitarian aid it allows into Gaza within the next 30 days or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. Starmer says the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar should be a precursor to a cease-fire. Starmer says 'no one should mourn' the death of Sinwar, who had 'the blood of innocent Israelis' on his hands, as well as the blood of Palestinians 'who suffered in the chaos and violence that he sought and celebrated.' He says he strongly supports Israel’s right to self-defense, 'particularly in the face of the Iranian regime’s actions' and that Sinwar’s death 'provides an opportunity for a step towards that cease-fire that we have long called for.' Italy’s prime minister says Europe wants a ‘sustainable ceasefire’ in Gaza and Lebanon BEIRUT — Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni says European countries are working for a 'sustainable cease-fire' in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Speaking in Beirut after meeting Friday with her Lebanese counterpart, Najib Mikati, Meloni said European nations also support negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since October last year. Mikati says 'a diplomatic solution should overcome' war that has intensified in recent weeks into an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, and that Israel must agree to a cease-fire. Meloni says targeting U.N. peacekeepers deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border is unacceptable and that both sides must 'ensure at all times the safety of each of these soldiers.' She says the peacekeepers will be needed in any post-conflict scenario. Over the past two weeks, U.N. posts along the border have been subjected to fire that that has wounded at least five peacekeepers. She says the peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, must be strengthened and that UNIFIL and Lebanese troops should be the only armed forces in the area south of the Litani river along the border with Israel. According to a 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006, Hezbollah should have no presence in the area along the border with Israel. Putin hopes the conflict in the Middle East won’t escalate further MOSCOW — Asked about the possibility of an all-out war between Iran and Israel, Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced hope that tension can be defused in the region. Speaking Friday during a meeting with media representatives he said 'no one is interested in the escalation of the conflict for both economic and security reasons.' He says there is a possibility 'to find a settlement, but that will depend on the parties involved in the confrontation.' He notes that Russia has maintained contacts with Iran and Israel and stands ready to play mediator if asked, describing those relationships as 'quite trusting.' He says: 'We are ready to do what depends on us, if our role is viewed positively, to also help end those horrible strikes on civilians in the Gaza Sector and help normalize the situation in southern Lebanon to end an exchange of strikes there.' Israel says aid shipment reaches northern Gaza Israel’s military says it allowed 30 trucks of humanitarian aid into northern Gaza, the latest delivery over the past week as Israel faces pressure from the U.S. to ramp up aid. The military body in charge of humanitarian aid, COGAT, said Friday that the trucks carried food, water, medical supplies and shelter equipment. There has been no confirmation from the U.N. that the aid arrived and is being distributed in the north. Aid crossings to the north of Gaza were closed for the first two weeks of October, the U.N. says, sending food and water levels plunging in an area of Gaza where some of the heaviest fighting is taking place. The closures raised fears that Israel was implementing an extreme plan proposed by Israeli generals to besiege northern Gaza and starve out Hamas militants there. Following a letter from the U.S. saying the continual closures could risk continued weapons funding for Israel, Israel says crossings have reopened and aid is continuing to flow. White House watches to see who will succeed Sinwar BERLIN — The Biden administration says it does not have any early insight on who might succeed Yahya Sinwar or whether the new Hamas leader might be more willing to revive a cease-fire and hostage deal. White House national security spokesman John Kirby has called Sinwar the main obstacle preventing the negotiations from moving forward. But he says it remains to be seen if the killing of the Hamas leader could reinvigorate negotiations. He adds it’s 'too soon' to assess who Hamas 'might anoint as Sinwar’s successor and what that individual may be willing to pursue.' Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming after a year of devastating war. Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar’s Qatar-based deputy, says Hamas will not return any of the hostages 'before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza.' Iran condemns Sinwar's killing and vows to continue resistance TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and says his death will not disturb Islamic resistance. The state-run IRNA news agency on Friday quoted Pezeshkian as saying, 'Martyrdom will not create a disturbance in the Islamic Ummah’s resistance against force and occupation.' Pezeshkian also expressed condolences to the people of Gaza and all the freedom-seekers of the world. Israel releases footage of gunfight in which Sinwar died JERUSALEM — Israel’s military has released new footage showing what it says is the killing of Yahya Sinwar, including a tank firing at a home where the Hamas leader took refuge after a firefight with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military says Sinwar was killed in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday when the tank shell hit the building where he had fled following a gunfight. Israeli soldiers killed Sinwar after encountering three militants fleeing between buildings in Rafah, Israeli military spokesperson LTC Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters Friday. Under Israeli fire, two militants whose faces were covered by cloth fled into one building while another — Sinwar — entered a second. Before night fell, soldiers killed the two militants in one building and fired a tank shell at the other. It wasn’t until the following day, that soldiers inspecting the rubble noticed the body of a man who looked like Sinwar. His identity was confirmed by forensic tests in Israel. Shoshani says the military has intelligence that troops killed Sinwar during a rare moment when the Hamas leader was outside rather than in Gaza’s extensive tunnel network. At one point, Shoshani said, Sinwar spent time in the same tunnel complex where six hostages were held. The military says they were killed by their Hamas captors as Israeli soldiers drew near. Hezbollah sends condolences to Palestinians for Sinwar's death BEIRUT — The militant group Hezbollah has expressed its condolences to the Palestinian people and Hamas for the killing of Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas’ political bureau. A statement issued by the group’s leadership Friday referred to Sinwar as a 'martyr' and praised his role in leading Hamas on 'the path of resistance.' Hezbollah describes him as the leader 'who stood in the face of the American project and the Zionist occupation, and sacrificed his blood for that.' 'We in the leadership of Hezbollah, who are facing with our resistant and steadfast Lebanese people the repercussions of the criminal Zionist aggression, confirm our standing with our Palestinian people,' Hezbollah says. — By Sally Abou AlJoud Biden urges Israel to use Sinwar's death to move toward peace BERLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden is reiterating his call for Israel to use the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as an opportunity to move toward peace. Biden said as he met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin Friday that Sinwar’s killing 'represents a moment of justice.' He says Sinwar 'had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans and so many others on his hands.' Biden says he 'told the prime minister of Israel yesterday, let’s also make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas.' Scholz, also a staunch ally of Israel, has said Sinwar’s death should open 'the concrete prospect of a cease-fire in Gaza, of an agreement to release the hostages held by Hamas.' Hamas calls Sinwar a martyr who died brandishing his weapon BEIRUT — Hamas has heralded Sinwar as a hero who 'ascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.' The Hamas statement released Friday appears to refer to a video circulating of Sinwar’s last moments, in which he sits on a chair in a badly damaged building, severely wounded and covered in dust. He then suddenly raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli miniature drone in an apparent final act of defiance. UN peacekeepers stick to their positions in southern Lebanon GENEVA — Forces in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon are maintaining their positions despite 'demands' to move from the Israeli Defense Forces. Spokesperson Andrea Tenenti of UNIFIL, the interim force in Lebanon, said Friday that a 'unanimous' decision was taken by its 50 troop-contributing countries and the U.N. Security Council to hold its positions. They will also continue to monitor the conflict and ensure aid gets to civilians. 'The IDF has repeatedly targeted our positions, endangering the safety of our troops, in addition to Hezbollah launching rockets toward Israel from near our positions, which also puts our peacekeepers in danger,' he told a U.N. news briefing in Geneva by video. Tenenti says deteriorating security in the recent fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces has forced UNIFIL — which has some 10,000 personnel — to suspend most, but not all, of its patrols near the U.N.-imposed Blue Line boundary separating Lebanon and Israel. He says UNIFIL has seen 'hundreds of trajectories, and sometimes more, crossing the Blue Line each day, forcing our peacekeepers to spend extended hours in shelters to ensure their safety, which remains our top priority.' Tenenti says UNIFIL is maintaining its positions 'despite IDF demands to move from positions close to the Blue Line.' Israeli soldiers wounded and two militants killed in exchange of fire south of the Dead Sea JERUSALEM — Israel’s military says two soldiers have been injured in a gunfight with militants who crossed from Jordan into Israel. At least two militants crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea Friday morning, before being shot dead by Israeli troops. The military says two soldiers were injured during an exchange of fire and that troops are searching the area for another militant who may have infiltrated. The identities of those who crossed the border remain unclear. Hamas praised the incursion but did not claim responsibility, calling it an 'important development' in the war in Gaza and a 'natural response' to the 'brutal crimes of the occupation against our Palestinian people.' The statement is one of the first public comments by Hamas since Israel killed its leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza. Hamas indirectly admits that its leader Sinwar was killed BEIRUT — A statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad has tacitly but not directly confirmed the death of the group’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza. Hamas said Friday that Israel is mistaken if it 'believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.' Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim says past leaders have also been killed and 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.' He says it is 'painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders' but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be 'eventually victorious.' When asked if the statement confirms Sinwar’s death, Naim said it does not. Israeli prosecutors to indict East Jerusalem man police say was planning to attack protest JERUSALEM — Israeli prosecutors are set to indict a Palestinian from East Jerusalem who police say planned to carry out an attack on a hostage protest in Tel Aviv. In a statement Friday, the police and Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said the man was a supporter of Hamas and other militant groups, and planned to carry out multiple attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers in retribution for Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Police say the man had not yet acquired a weapon or explosives to carry out any of the attacks, but that he was planning to attack a protest calling for the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Such protests occur weekly in Tel Aviv. Hezbollah says its war with Israel is entering a ‘new phase’ BEIRUT — Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group says it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, adding that it has introduced new weapons over the past days. A statement from the group’s operations room early Friday says Hezbollah’s fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. The statement appears to refer to a drone laden with explosives that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The statement also says Hezbollah’s air defense units shot down this week two Israeli Hermes 450 drones. Hezbollah says its fighters are working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. Iran commemorates Hamas leader whom Israel says it killed UNITED NATIONS — Iran’s Mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, after Israel said he had been killed in fighting. It says: 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed. However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened. He will become a model for the youth and children who will carry forth his path for the liberation of Palestine. As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.' Iran and Iraq fought a brutal war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. It killed more than 1 million people on both sides.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-middle-east-latest-hezbollah-says-its-war-with-israel-is-entering-a-new-phase/	2024-10-18T11:03:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6712a3c16deee9.26068330.jpeg?w=900
Trump calls Jack Smith ‘sick puppy’ as latest Jan. 6 evidence uns...	Former President Trump on Friday railed against special counsel Jack Smith and the judge overseeing his case on efforts to subvert the 2020 election as Smith released a slew of new documents. 'The judge is allowing him to do it. And it’s not even believable,' Trump said Friday morning on 'The Dan Bongino Show' shortly before the documents were made public. 'This guy is a sick puppy. And they’re going to release something else. And always before the election. It’s election interference. No, it’s a terrible thing what’s happening.' Trump also blasted U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who a day earlier rejected an effort from Trump's team to delay the release of additional documents from Smith. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'This judge is the most evil person,' Trump said of Chutkan. 'They all said, 'Well make sure you don’t get Chutkan.' And who did I get? I got Chutkan.' Chutkan last week agreed to a request from Smith to unseal exhibits that accompany his 180-page brief asserting that prosecutors can still bring much of their Jan. 6 case against Trump in the wake of a Supreme Court decision granting former presidents broad criminal immunity. Smith argues Trump’s efforts to thwart the transfer of power were the unlawful actions of a private citizen, not of a president.

Delphi murders: Opening statements underway in Richard Allen tria...	(NewsNation) — Opening statements are underway Friday in the long-awaited trial of the man accused of killing two teens in Delphi, Indiana, nearly eight years ago. Richard Allen, 52, is accused of killing Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, in February 2017 after allegedly luring them to their deaths while they were on a hike not far from their home. Their deaths had gone unsolved for more than five years when Allen, then a pharmacy worker, was arrested in the case that has drawn attention from true crime enthusiasts. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case After an evidence leak, several legal filings, the removal and reinstating of the original court-appointed defense team and other delays in the Delphi murder case, Allen’s trial is now in full swing. Allen had been there all along in Delphi, living and working in the community of about 3,000 people in northwest Indiana. He faces two counts of murder and two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping. If convicted, Allen could face up to 130 years in prison. State looks to nix composite sketches The initial sketch was released in 2017 (left) and the revised sketch was released in 2019 (right) After the girls were found dead, investigators released a grainy image of the suspected killer. However. it would be another five years before Allen was arrested and charged with their murders. In October 2022, Allen was taken into custody. He’s now charged with four counts of murder in connection with the girls’ deaths. As the trial begins, attorneys for Allen laid out their argument for why widely circulated composite sketches should be admitted as evidence. Earlier this week, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland filed a motion in limine asking the court to prohibit the use of composite sketches during Allen's trial. The sketches, released in 2017 and 2019, have been part of the Delphi murders investigation for years. Indiana State released them in hopes of generating leads about the deaths of Williams and German. McLeland argued the sketches were not used to identify Richard Allen and said using them during the trial could confuse or prejudice the jury. Attorneys discussed the motion during a hearing in Allen County on Thursday. Judge Fran Gull took it under advisory and has yet to rule. The state argued that the sketches were produced as part of the investigation for the purposes of recognition, not identification, of a suspect. What do we know about Delphi suspect Richard Allen? Delphi murder trial jury selection Jury selection in the trial began on Monday. Around 300 summons were sent to prospective Allen County jurors. Eventually, 12 jurors and four alternates were selected. The three-day process of culling the jury pool began in Allen County on Monday with 100 prospective jurors scheduled to appear in the courtroom. Allen was present during the proceedings, arriving in a purple shirt, khaki pants and a pair of shackles. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, Allen’s defense team asked for a change of venue. Special Judge Fran Gull, appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court to oversee the case after the original judge recused himself, determined that was logistically challenging. She decided to bring in jurors from Allen County and transport them to Carroll County for the trial. Jury selection began Monday. The jurors will be sequestered for about a month. More than 100 people were expected to testify between the defense and prosecution. Delphi murders: Prosecutors don’t want jury to visit Delphi crime scene Richard Allen's defense arguments Defense lawyers for Allen made a startling admission during Tuesday’s jury selection. Allen’s defense team revealed that hair was found in Abby Williams’ hand that didn’t match Richard Allen. That’s the first time that information has been made public. Attorney Andrew Baldwin made the comments during 'mini opening statements' preceding jury selection. While prosecutors say an unspent bullet found at the scene is linked to a gun owned by Allen and cite dozens of confessions from him, Allen’s defense argued those confessions were made under duress and weren’t trustworthy. They said Allen confessed to details from the crime that were inaccurate. He also confessed to other crimes that didn’t happen, his defense team said.

Hezbollah vows revenge for Hamas leader Sinwar's death	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden says securing a cease-fire and bringing hostages home are the main focuses after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war isn't over. Meanwhile, Hezbollah says Sinwar's death only stands to escalate its war with Israel. US responds to death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar Israeli, US response to Sinwar's death Following Thursday's announcement, Israel’s military released a drone video that shows a person they say is Sinwar just before he died by Israeli tank fire. Biden spoke with Netanyahu after Sinwar’s death and congratulated him on the news. Despite a renewed push for a cease-fire, however, Israel said the war isn’t over. Netanyahu said he wants Israel to maintain long-term control over Gaza and added that any Hamas member who helps with hostage rescue and turns their weapons in will be offered amnesty. In Iran, Sinwar’s death has strengthened the spirit of resistance, the country’s UN team said. The U.S. military has boots on the ground in Israel operating an air defense system to protect against a possible Iranian attack. Bolton calls death of Hamas leader ‘a good day for the whole world’ Hostages in Hamas detention About 101 Israeli hostages remain in Hamas custody and dozens are believed to be dead. Twenty-three-year-old Israeli American soldier Omer Neutra is one of those remaining hostages believed to be alive. Hamas took him in October 2023. His parents called for peace after the announcement of Sinwar’s death. 'We are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,' Neutera’s father, Ronen Neutra, said. Sinwar was described as a major obstacle to a deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Israel early next week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/hezbollah-revenge-hamas-leader-sinwars-death/	2024-10-18T06:08:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/655e7f0006f8d1.34963862.jpeg?w=900

Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza: Who was he?	(NewsNation) — Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds behind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has been killed, the Israeli military confirmed Thursday. 'Eliminated: Yahya Sinwar,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) wrote on X. Sinwar — who had been the de facto head of Hamas since Ismail Haniyeh was killed in July — was a U.S.-designated terrorist and had been at the top of Israel's most-wanted list since the start of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, IDF source confirms He was one of the chief architects of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw at least 250 others taken hostage. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called Sinwar’s killing a 'military and moral achievement for the Israeli army,' saying it would 'create the possibility to immediately release the hostages,' in a statement shared with The Associated Press. Hamas had not confirmed Sinwar's death as of early Thursday afternoon. Here's what we know about Sinwar. Who was Yahya Sinwar? Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. Later, he went on to form the group's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, which became known for sending suicide bombers into Israel and firing rockets from Gaza into Israeli towns. Sinwar developed a reputation for brutality and earned the nickname 'the butcher of Khan Younis' after he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators. In 1988, Sinwar was arrested by Israel for his terrorist activity. He was sentenced to four life terms for abducting and murdering two Israeli soldiers but was later released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. After his release, Sinwar returned to Gaza, where he rose to power. The U.S. State Department designated Sinwar a global terrorist in 2015. By 2017, Sinwar had been named the new leader of Hamas in Gaza, with The New York Times describing him as a 'militant hard-liner.' 'He carries a reputation as a harsh enforcer of loyalty within the group, and as an unstinting enemy of Israel,' the Times wrote. In May, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor sought an arrest warrant for Sinwar for his alleged role in the Oct. 7 attack. According to the AP, Sinwar was killed in Rafah after an Israeli tank launched a shell at a building, causing it to collapse. Photos of Sinwar published by Israeli media show a man wearing a bulletproof vest, surrounded by grenades, lying in the rubble of a building with a head wound, the AP reported. The Associated Press and NewsNation's Robert Sherman contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/who-was-yahya-sinwar/	2024-10-17T11:36:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1251837467.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Liam Payne, a former member of One Direction, fell to his death from his balcony at the CasaSur Palermo hotel in Buenos Aires Wednesday, a sad end to a recently turbulent life. Liam Payne's death at Argentina hotel First responders were called at 5:04 pm on Wednesday by the hotel — half an hour after he was carried out of the hotel’s lobby and just minutes before Payne fell from his third-floor balcony at 5:07 pm. A newly released emergency call from the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires manager to the police was chilling. Friends and musicians express heartbreak at the death of singer Liam Payne at age 31 The frantic manager 'begged for law enforcement and requested urgent’ assistance, alleging the out-of-control singer was ‘putting his life at risk’,' according to the NY Post. 'Hello, good morning. I just called and my line got disconnected. I’m calling (from) the CasaSur hotel in Palermo, Costa Rica 6032,' the manager is heard saying in Spanish in audio obtained by the Sun UK and La Nacion. The manager, 'Esteban,' claimed that Payne was destroying his hotel room and was under the influence of 'drugs and alcohol., saying: 'Well, we have a guest who is drunk on drugs and alcohol. And, well, he’s … When he’s conscious, he’s breaking up the whole room. And, well, we need you to send someone, please.' 'We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don’t know if this guest’s life is at risk. They must be in a room that has a balcony. And well, we’re a little bit worried he’ll do something, that he’ll put his life at risk.' 'How long has he been there or is it a residential hotel?' the operator asked. 'No, no, he’s been there for two or three days,' the manager said.

(Photo by Dave J Hogan/Getty Images ) Liam Payne posts about 'lovely day' before death An insider told Page Six that 'Liam had been cycling through periods of ruinous behavior for a long time,' adding that 'his demons were much worse than he let on.' Shortly before his death, Payne claimed he was having a 'lovely day in Argentina' in a since-deleted Snapchat story during his vacation with girlfriend Kate Cassidy. Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 shocks fans around the world Cassidy flew back to Miami on Monday — two days before the tragedy insinuating she’d had enough of the elongated trip (the couple were set to leave weeks before after catching former One Direction Niall Horan’s show in the city but stayed on for 14 more days). 'I was so ready to leave,' Cassidy shared in a TikTok video. 'Honestly, love South America but I hate staying in one place for too long. And we were supposed to be there for, like, five days, turned into two weeks… I was just like, ‘I need to go home.'' Liam Payne struggled with issues linked to Maya Henry Payne — who has battled drink and drugs for years — was also dealing with his ex. According to People: 'Payne was struggling with issues related to his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry'. A source with knowledge of the situation told the magazine that Payne 'was extremely overwhelmed by all of the legal issues' involving Henry. The Texan model, 23, instructed lawyers to issue a cease and desist letter to Payne a few days earlier, accusing him of 'obsessively contacting her friends and family including her mother Azteca Henry'. Henry posted a video to TikTok that said: 'Ever since we broke up he messages me, will blow up my phone, not only from his phone, it's always from different phone numbers too, so I never know where it's gonna come from.' 'He'll create new iCloud accounts to message me — it's always a new damn iCloud account. Every time I see one pop up on my phone I'm like, 'here we f---ing go again' 'Also, he will email me... not only me, but he'll blow up my mom's phone. Is this normal behavior to you?' Henry also accused Payne of 'weaponizing' fans whom he 'preys' upon against her. Liam Payne open about struggles with drugs and alcohol Since skyrocketing to fame at the age of 16 with One Direction, Payne has been open about his struggles with drugs and alcohol. Regarding alcohol, Payne told Men’s Journal: 'It's almost like putting the Disney costume on before you step up on stage and underneath the Disney costume I was (drunk) quite a lot of the time because there was no other way to get your head around what was going on.' Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast in 2021, Payne told host Stephen Bartlett that he had struggled with 'severe suicidal thoughts' and heavy drug use while he was in the band. 'I was worried how far my rock bottom was going to be,' he said in the interview. 'Where's rock bottom for me? And you would never have seen it. I'm very good at hiding it. No one would ever have seen it. 'There is some stuff that I have definitely never, never spoken about… it was really, really, really severe. And it was a problem. And it was only until I saw myself after that, I was like ‘Right, I need to fix myself.’' Liam Payne and his bandmates all sought solo success after One Direction fame Payne spent 100 days in a Louisiana rehab in 2023. Before leaving for Argentina, Payne told fans in an Instagram story that he had things 'to square up' with Horan but didn’t get into specifics about it. Liam Payne died of 'cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' Medical officials confirmed that Payne died of 'a cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' sustained in the fall. 'Our role was to head there quickly, give medical attention, and try to resuscitate him, but his injuries were incompatible with life,' said Buenos Aires emergency services chief Alberto Crescenti, according to La Nacion. The Argentine newspaper also ran pictures from Payne’s damaged hotel room showing drugs, drug paraphernalia, booze and a broken TV. 'Liam will forever live in our hearts': Liam Payne's family On Thursday, Payne’s family issued a statement to the BBC which read: 'Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.' Payne isn’t the only member of One Direction to struggle with fame and a solo career. His former bandmate Zayn Malik has been very public about his anxiety and anorexia issues since leaving the band.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/liam-payne-death-hotel-urgent-assistance/	2024-10-17T11:08:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/gettyimages-1134037682-594x594-1.jpg?w=594

The IDF said it couldn’t confirm the identities of the other alleged Hamas members who died. 'There were no signs of the presence of hostages in the area,' Israel’s military wrote on X.

The Israeli military is investigating whether top Hamas leader Si...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military says it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. The military said in a statement Thursday that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without elaborating. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of the three was Sinwar. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He was chosen as the group’s top leader following the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. An Israeli strike on a school sheltering the displaced in northern Gaza on Thursday killed at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the strike targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza where Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera's Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Israel has struck central Beirut on two occasions in its latest war against Hezbollah, and both came without warnings. In northern Gaza, Fares Abu Hamza, head of the ministry's local emergency unit, confirmed the toll from the Israeli strike and said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by both militant groups inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Panel looking into Trump assassination attempt says Secret Servic...	WASHINGTON (AP) — An independent panel investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally faulted the Secret Service for poor communications that day and failing to secure the building where the gunman took his shots. The review also found more systemic issues at the agency such as a failure to understand the unique risks facing Trump and a culture of doing 'more with less.' The 52-page report issued Thursday took the Secret Service to task for specific problems leading up to the July 13 rally in Butler as a well as deeper one within the agency's culture. It recommended bringing in new, outside leadership and refocusing on its protective mission. 'The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,' the authors wrote Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Homeland Security Department, the Secret Services' parent agency, in a letter accompanying their report. 'Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.' One rallygoer was killed and two others wounded when Thomas Michael Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and opened fire as Trump spoke. The former president was wounded in the ear before being rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents. That shooting, along with another incident in Florida when Trump was golfing — a gunman there never got a line of site on the president or fired a shot — has led to a crisis in confidence in the agency. The report by a panel of four former law enforcement officials from national and state government follows investigations by members of Congress, the agency's own investigators and by Homeland Security's oversight body. A look at the report's key findings and recommendations: Poor communications, no plan for key buildings The panel echoed previous reports that have zeroed in on the failure to secure the building near the rally that had a clear line of site to where Trump was speaking and the multiple communications problems that hindered the ability of the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement to talk to each other. 'The failure to secure a complex of buildings, portions of which were within approximately 130 yards of the protectee and containing numerous positions carrying high-angle line of sight risk, represents a critical security failure,' the report said. The panel faulted the planning between Secret Service and the local law enforcement, and said the Secret Service failed to ask about what was being done to secure the building: 'Relying on a general understanding that ‘the locals have that area covered’ is simply not good enough and, in fact, at Butler this attitude contributed to the security failure.' The panel also cited the fact that there were two separated command posts at the Butler rally: one with various local law enforcement and another with the Secret Service: 'This created, at the highest level, a structural divide in the flow of communications.' There were other communications problems. The Secret Service had to switch radio channels because radio traffic of agents protecting first lady Jill Biden at an event in Pittsburgh was popping up on the channels of agents covering the Butler rally. The panel also noted that all the law enforcement personnel on the ground were using a 'chaotic mixture' of radio, cell phone, text, and e-mail throughout the day to communicate. Also the panel said it was unclear who had ultimate command that day. Cultural issues within the agency The report delved into the agency's culture and painted a picture of an agency struggling to think critically about how it carries out its mission, especially when it comes to protecting Trump. The panel said agency personnel operated under the assumption that they effectively had to 'do more with less.' The report said the additional security measures taken to protect Trump after the Butler shooting should have been taken before. 'To be clear, the Panel did not identify any nefarious or malicious intent behind this phenomenon, but rather an overreliance on assigning personnel based on categories (former, candidate, nominee) instead of an individualized assessment of risk,' the panel wrote. The panel also noted the 'back-and-forth' between the Trump security detail and Secret Service headquarters regarding how many people were needed to protect him. The panel also faulted some of the senior-level staff who were involved in the rally for what they called a 'lack of ownership.' In one example, the panel said a senior agent on site who was tasked with coordinating communications didn't walk around the rally site ahead of timen and did not brief the state police counterpart before the rally about how communications would be managed. It cited the relative inexperience of two specific agents who played a role in security for the July 13 rally. One was the site agent from Trump's detail whose job it was to coordinate with the Pittsburgh field office on security planning for the rally. The panel said the agent graduated from the Secret Service academy in 2020, and had only been on the Trump detail since 2023. Before the Butler rally the agent had only done 'minimal previous site advance work or site security planning.' Another agent assigned to operate a drone detection system had only used the technology at two prior events. What did the panel recommend? Having a unified command post at all large events where Secret Service and other law enforcement representatives are all physically in the same place; overhead surveillance for all outdoor events; security plans must include a way to mitigate line of site concerns out to 1,000 yards and who's in charge at the event; and more training on how to get protectees out of dangerous scenarios. The panel said the agency also needs new, outside leadership and a renewed focus on its core protective mission while expressing skepticism that the agency should continue with the investigations it currently conducts. While the Secret Service is well known for what it does to protect presidents and other dignitaries, it also investigates financial crimes. 'In the Panel’s opinion, it is simply unacceptable for the Service to have anything less than a paramount focus on its protective mission, particularly while that protective mission function is presently suboptimal,' the report said. The panel members were Mark Filip, deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush; David Mitchell, who served in numerous state and local law enforcement roles in Maryland and Delaware; Janet Napolitano, homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama; and Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/ap-panel-looking-into-trump-assassination-attempt-says-secret-service-needs-fundamental-reform/	2024-10-17T05:04:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710fde506f230.58156373.jpeg?w=900
Video: Marshals raid Atlanta mansion occupied by squatters	(NewsNation) — Georgia is cracking down on squatters, fed up with people ignoring property laws. Fulton County marshals raided a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta on Wednesday after a group of squatters showed signs they possibly identified as 'sovereign citizens,' people who believe they are exempt from U.S. law. They allegedly showed up to the property, set up camp and dared anyone to remove them. Menendez family: We suspected abuse from the beginning The video of the raid was posted to social media by the marshal's office. In the video, heavily armed officers swept through the mansion during the early morning raid. At one point, officers even used a drone to ensure the area was secure. NewsNation reached out to the Fulton County Marshal’s Department for comment but has yet to hear back. In July, the Georgia Squatter Reform Act was enacted, stating that squatters caught inside a home will now be cited and given three days to present a lease. If they can't do so, or the lease is found to be a forgery, a misdemeanor charge immediately becomes a felony. The new law also states that it doesn't have to be the property owner who reports the squatters, meaning it could be a neighbor or a homeowners association member who calls the police.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/marshals-raid-atlanta-mansion-squatters/	2024-10-17T04:40:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/image-1.png?w=900
US long-range B-2 stealth bombers target underground bunkers of Y...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels early Thursday, a major escalation in the American response to the rebels' attacks on Mideast shipping lanes that appeared to be a warning to Iran as well. While it wasn't immediately clear how much damage the strikes caused, the attack appeared to be the first use of the B-2 in combat in years and the first time the flying wing targeted sites in Yemen. In announcing the strikes against the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made a point to offer a warning likely heard in Tehran as well. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened or fortified,' Austin said. Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The B-2 would be used in any American attack on hardened Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz or Fordo given it is the only aircraft in service that can drop the GBU-57, known as the 'Massive Ordnance Penetrator.' Iran offered no immediate comment on the strike Thursday. Its foreign minister has been visiting Arab nations ahead of an expected Israeli retaliatory strike over Tehran's Oct. 1 missile assault. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. Austin said the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' Both he and the U.S. military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done. However, Central Command said it believed no civilians had been killed. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion of cargo pass through it yearly. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel and have shot down U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drones. The rebels have threatened new attacks in response to Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon and its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hamas' initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israeli miltary action in the time since has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, hundreds more in the West Bank and over 2,300 people in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the combat edges ever closer to a full-on regional war. The locations named by the Houthis on Thursday correspond to known underground bases operated by the rebels, who have been locked into a stalemated war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 that’s decimated the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthis have refurbished tunnels that once held Scud missiles when Yemen was ruled by strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, according to an analysis in April by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those sites include the al-Hafa and Jebel Attan military bases, the former Presidential House and the Yemen state television compound in Sanaa, analyst Fabian Hinz wrote. The Houthis have built what appears to be their own large-scale tunnel network near Saada as well, Hinz added. 'The fact that the Houthis began constructing major new installations after the agreement of the cease-fire with the Saudi-led coalition suggests that the group is focused on entrenching themselves and bolstering their military capabilities,' he wrote. Iran similarly relies on a network of underground missile bases. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The aircraft are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there, though some B-2s were in Australia in September. The U.S. last used the B-2 in combat in 2017 against Islamic State group targets in Libya, killing more than 80 fighters in a mission defense officials at the time said disrupted possible militant attacks in Europe. The B-2's use in Yemen comes just two days after U.N. Special Envoy Hans Grundberg warned Yemen's frozen war could heat back up given the Mideast wars and the Houthis' taking captive U.N. and aid workers in an internationally criticized crackdown. 'This cycle of retaliation is pulling Yemen deeper into the regional conflict, jeopardizing its hopes for peace and stability,' Grundberg said Tuesday. 'Moreover, it distracts from the urgent need to address Yemen’s own internal crisis.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-us-long-range-b-2-stealth-bombers-target-underground-bunkers-of-yemens-houthi-rebels/	2024-10-17T03:34:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710e79a005580.23710202.jpeg?w=900
Flight attendants in crisis: Stripping, struggling, homeless	(NewsNation) — After a long day assisting travelers on a major airline, a flight attendant by the name of 'Bree' takes off her wedding ring and begins her second shift. 'I am definitely not a girl that you would normally see in a strip club, and I come from a great family. I grew up with a lot of morals, a lot of Christian morals. I have a partner, I have a job,' Bree told NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves. Bree spoke under the condition of anonymity, concerned about keeping her job. After years of flight attending and trying other avenues of earning additional income, like delivering for DoorDash, she says the decision to strip simply came down to 'the need for survival.' 'If you tell somebody that you’re a flight attendant, they normally think you make a lot of money,' said Bree. 'The public looks up to flight attendants, and it’s like you have this glamorous life.' In reality, Bree said, 'You’re dirt poor. You’re very, very poor. So poor, you become a little scrappy. You get paid under $30,000 a year.' ‘Everybody’s angry’: Thousands of autoworkers unemployed Bree said this new line of work has exposed her to a world that was wholly foreign to her before. 'I never saw a pimp before. I never looked at a drug dealer and knew what they did for work before. I never had people asking me for blow jobs, and they would pay $500. I would never get asked all the time if I could go home and have sex with somebody for money. This was not how I grew up. This was not my way of life,' said Bree. She said a constant risk and worry is exposure to fentanyl at the strip club. She said the use of the synthetic opioid was so common among the clientele that she learned to recognize its distinctive scent. 'It smells like peanut butter,' said Bree. 'I carry Narcan with me, just little nasal injections of Narcan, and I told my boss, ‘Just in case anything happens, if you find me on the floor — I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t do drugs — and there’s Narcan in my backpack. That’s what you should treat me with.’' Bree is one of many flight attendants who spoke exclusively with NewsNation for this story, saying they are in crisis, struggling to make ends meet. Kim: Living in a shed with three children Like Bree, 'Kim' also flies with a major airline. She said her passengers would have no idea she lived in a shed with her three children with no running water. One night, she said the temperature fell to minus 20 degrees. Then, the power went out. 'I had taken all my kids basically into bed with me. And I kind of, you know, used hand warmers,' said Kim. ‘'We’re just gonna have a sleepover in mommy’s bed!’ That’s what you can tell them. You can’t say anything else. That was really rough. Actually, that was probably the worst experience of my life.' Like the other flight attendants NewsNation spoke with, Kim said she only gets paid for about half of the hours she actually works. At many airlines, there is no pay for waiting at the gate, during boarding or disembarking. 'In all reality, I’m paid less than a McDonald’s worker,' said Kim. 'You do training for six weeks, and you aren’t paid for any of that. Sometimes, you work 10 1/2-hour days, and you get paid five.' Kim said she had tried to never let the struggle show on her flights. Child care costs more than rent across 100 largest US metros 'People love me. When I get on the plane, I’m super nice, and no one would know anything about me unless I told them because my hair is done, my makeup is done. I have a uniform. I’m smiling, I’m interacting.' Kim has no plans to leave the industry. She described herself as financially 'trapped' due to the fact that she pulled a loan from her 401(k): 'If I were to quit right now, I would have to pay all that back, and it’s money I don’t have.' Kim has managed to provide for her children, moving them into a better living situation as she now looks for a second job on top of flight attending. 'Sometimes, I wish I didn’t wake up in the morning,' she says, but it is her children who keep her going. Nasstasja: Eating leftover passenger meals Nasstasja Lewis told NewsNation she will never forget receiving her first paycheck as a flight attendant for a top airline. 'My paycheck that I got was 250 bucks. And that could only buy probably one trip for me and my son at the grocery store and probably pay a bill that was lingering. So it was really, really hard. Ramen noodles were a thing,' said Lewis. She recalled wondering, ''How am I going to survive for the next month until I get paid again?' It was really, really scary.' Lewis said what attracted her to the job was the appearance of traveling to glamorous destinations and the promise of financial freedom. Instead, in order to prioritize her son, she has resorted at times to eating passengers’ leftover meals. McDonald’s largest fry producer closes factory; CEO blames $5 meals 'You have to just put your pride aside and say, ‘Hey, I have to eat, or I don’t.’ It does make you feel some kind of way during those times because you’re just like, 'What am I doing here?'' said Lewis. On top of the financial hardship, Lewis recalled an incident where she was physically shoved by a passenger. She said she made the decision not to report it. 'We’re already overwhelmed, and I just wanted to go home. It was a long trip. We had delays that day, and we were supposed to be home hours before, so I just took it and swallowed it and got home,' said Lewis. Flight attendant Nasstasja Lewis tells NewsNation she has eaten passengers' leftover meals to make ends meet. (Photo courtesy of Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) Lewis said the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated challenges at the job. During the pandemic, the incidence of depression among cabin crew increased from 8% to 23%. Reports of stress similarly increased from 8% to 24%. Even before the pandemic, flight attendants faced a higher rate of suicide as well as alcoholism. According to the CDC, in 2012, flight attendants were found to have a suicide rate that is 1 1/2 times higher than the general population. Lewis said even as she posted smiling photos showing her job on social media, internally, she struggled with burnout and mental health. 'I experienced suicidal ideation during my time as a fourth, fifth-year flight attendant,' said Lewis. 'Feeling like you don't want to be here anymore. Depression, anxiety, all those things are impacted within this profession, and more needs to be done about it.' If you or someone you know needs help, resources or someone to talk to, you can find it at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website or by calling 1-800-273-8255. People are available to talk to 24/7. Liam: Living in an apartment with 20 flight attendants Liam Horgan is a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines. He has lived on food stamps and in a 'crash pad' with 20 flight attendants in the Bay Area. 'I was paying $455 a month to share a two-bedroom apartment with 20 flight attendants,' said Horgan. 'The amount of things that would pile up, the amount of trash, the amount of bodies. It drops cold at night, but for it to be that cold outside and still be 80 degrees inside the bedroom because there are so many bodies and bunk beds. It was hard.' Liam Horgan, a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines, takes a selfie in an airport. (Photo courtesy of Liam Horgan, AFA union member) Many new hires work 'on reserve,' essentially a system of being on call. They can wait for several days for an assignment. Horgan described picking up as many hours as he could to the extent that 'there were certain months that I would only be home about 3 days a month.' Horgan added he would earn about $2,300 a month before taxes were taken out. 'I don’t think a single person who applied for this job knew what it was going to be like. Because I certainly didn’t know,' said Horgan. Horgan said that when new flight attendants exit training, they are assigned to a base, typically in a city with a high cost of living like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York or Washington, D.C. Rent has risen faster than wages in most US cities Horgan said it made an impression when management at his new base explained how he could apply for food stamps. 'I just feel like it’s kind of embarrassing that corporate greed has gotten to the point that management at these corporations are telling new hires, 'Hey, we know we don’t pay you a living wage, so here’s how you can apply for welfare,'' said Horgan. 'This is a career. This is not just starting out at an entry-level job.' Horgan said he had no concept of the extent of the mental health struggle he’d witness in his colleagues. One of the flight attendants he lived with in a crash pad attempted suicide. 'There’ve been a lot of mental health issues with a lot of flight attendants, especially new hires,' said Horgan. 'I’ve felt the pressure of it myself. There have been nights that I’ve sat in bed, almost crying myself to sleep, because I’m like, ‘What am I doing with my life?’ I was working retail, and I was not struggling to make ends meet like I am right now.' Flight attendant union president: 'They can’t survive' 'A week doesn’t go by that I don’t hear another heartbreaking story from a flight attendant, and it’s from every single base,' said Ken Diaz, United AFA Union president. Diaz described hearing reports of flight attendants all over the country experiencing 'bankruptcies, going through their life savings, taking loans against their 401(k)s. Some are living in their cars, credit cards to the max, marriages breaking up over financial debt. My heart breaks for them because it shouldn’t be this way. It shouldn’t.' The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) is the country’s largest flight attendants union.Diaz said he has been unable to reach an agreement with United after three years of negotiations. 'They’re asking for concessions during a time when they’re making billions in profits, billions,' said Diaz. United CEO Scott Kirby made nearly $19 million in 2023. 'We got these airlines through some difficult times. Whether it be bankruptcies during the eighties to the pandemic. We helped them get the government loans that allowed them to survive, and then, they just forgot about us afterward,' said Diaz. The median pay for flight attendants in 2023 was roughly $68,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Diaz said that new hire pay is projected to be much lower. 'It was always tough in the past, but no one’s ever experienced the cost of living like it is today. And when you put that wage rate in today’s cost of living, it’s nothing. They can’t survive,' said Diaz. Flight attendants ‘fed up’ over stagnant wages: Union leader The AFA told NewsNation first-year flight attendants can expect to make about $23,000 at Frontier; $25,000 at Alaska Airlines; $26,000 at United Airlines; $31,000 at American Airlines; and $32,000 at Delta Air Lines. 'When people see the actual wage rate, they say, ‘Oh, those are good.’ What they don’t realize is United flight attendants do not get paid until that aircraft starts moving back from the gate. So the time they check in, the safety checks, in between flights, all of that is unpaid for. You’re only paid almost for half the time that you’re at work,' said Diaz. 'The morale is at the lowest point I have ever seen morale at United Airlines in the 28 years I’ve been here.' NewsNation reached out to United Airlines. It did not respond. Alaska Airlines provided this statement: 'Our goal is always to provide our flight attendants and employees with market-competitive wages and benefits. We appreciate how financially challenging the beginning of any career path can be and it’s one of the reasons we are so anxious to get a contract in place so our flight attendants can start benefiting from increased wages and improved benefits.' Flight attendants helping one another Thresia Raynor has been a flight attendant with Alaska Airlines for almost 17 years. She said she only realized how many of her colleagues were homeless when she’d offer to drive them home after a flight, only to find their 'home' was a car on the side of the road. 'Every day at my job, I have to drop off a girl from a trip who has no car and transportation to a place of homelessness, or take her to a car where she lives, or quite often share meals with her at work because she has no food and no money for food. That’s what I experience quite often in my job,' said Raynor. She cofounded a Facebook group called 'Alaska Airlines Flight Attendants Experiencing Hunger and Homelessness' and did not expect the response. Flight attendant Thresia Raynor was amazed by the response to the Facebook group she made to support her struggling peers.

(Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy)A message from a struggling flight attendant sent to the th|AIR|apy advocacy group. (Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) 'Overnight, it was over a thousand members,' said Raynor. 'We just had no idea that there is that many people struggling. We wanted them to have a safe place to come and talk and be heard and just to scrape away all that shame and embarrassment. To have people come forward and talk about where they park their cars at night to sleep, how they go to back alleys in the back of restaurants. People sharing how they survive homeless and hungry.' Nastassja Lewis also turned her personal experience into the nonprofit Th|AIR|apy, which focuses on flight attendant mental health. It has grown to more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. Lewis said it provides an emergency crisis line that is used every single day. 'When you’re getting messages from your peers saying, ‘Thank you for this. It’s keeping me going,’ or ‘Thank you, I really needed someone to talk to at 2:30 in the morning, and you were here for me,' said Lewis, 'it lets me know the work we’re doing is really vital.' Bree: 'I don’t have a lot to show for it' Bree said as dangerous as working at the strip club can be, there is an unfamiliar feeling — a flood of financial relief — that she hasn’t felt in her years of flight attending. She said at the strip club, she could earn roughly $300 to $1,000 a night. 'When I would take home money at the end of the night, I would sit down on the floor, and I would just count it because I need to make sure that the time I put in was worth it,' said Bree. 'It feels good to finish a job in one day and be like, ‘Okay, I made rent,’ and then the next day, ‘Okay, I paid for all of our groceries.’' Bree described herself as 'resilient' and 'optimistic.' She said this has also been a time of taking stock. Bree is now several years into embarking on the 'dream' of flight attending. 'I’m a good employee. Any job that I’ve had, I’ve gone up the ranks quickly. I’m a hard worker. And I’m creative, I’m kind. I feel like I’ve been working so hard. And I don’t know, I don’t have a lot to show for it. I don’t even have my own car. I sold my truck to help pay for flight attending,' said Bree. When asked if she would recommend being a flight attendant, she hesitated. 'I did not realize how little I’d be getting paid. I’ve been poor before; this was a new level of stress. People selling their eggs or becoming sperm donors, flight attendant groups recommending selling your plasma if you have a longer layover in a certain city. We are literally trying to find parts of our body that will produce money. I don’t think it should be like this in this country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/going-broke-flight-attendant-strips-on-the-side-to-survive/	2024-10-17T03:24:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/A234D08CA7C21AC04ACF8D5DEF51AC89.jpg?w=900
Vance says 'no' when asked whether Trump lost 2020 election	In the months since he became Donald Trump ’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance has repeatedly deflected questions about whether the Republican presidential nominee lost the 2020 election, saying he was focused on the future. During a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, where Vance was asked by a reporter about his lack of straight answers so far, he was more declarative. 'What message do you think it sends to independent voters when you do not directly answer the question ‘Did Donald Trump lose in 2020?’' the reporter asked, eliciting boos from the crowd before Vance responded, saying he has answered the question 'a million times.' 'No. I think there were serious problems in 2020,' Vance said. 'So, did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use, OK?' The answer was the most specific Vance has been on the subject, and a departure from the series of evasions he has offered about the election Trump continues to say without evidence was decided fraudulently in favor of Democrat Joe Biden. During a debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz this month, Vance was asked about the 2020 election but responded that he was 'focused on the future.' Vance’s refusal to say whether Trump lost was widely considered his weakest debate moment with Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who called the response 'a damning non-answer.' The campaign for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris quickly turned the exchange into a television ad. During an interview with The New York Times, Vance refused five times to acknowledge Biden won. Trump's continued denial that he lost the election to Biden is a widely held opinion among the Republican's base of supporters. He warned an audience in Nevada last week, 'We never want to have happen what happened in 2020.' Trump has continued to say without evidence that he expects his opponents to 'cheat' in the 2024 election and has urged his supporters to turn out in numbers to make his vote tally 'too big to rig.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-vance-says-no-when-asked-whether-trump-lost-2020-election/	2024-10-16T19:44:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67107aa1e62a12.77687679.jpeg?w=900
One Direction singer Liam Payne found dead in Buenos Aires: Repor...	(NewsNation) — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement Payne, 31, fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had thrown himself from the balcony of his room.' He said police were dispatched to the hotel in response to an emergency call about an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' Arriving police heard a thud and found Payne’s body in the hotel courtyard, Policicchio said. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, said on Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. He declined to answer further questions about the incident, including whether Payne jumped from the balcony or fell by accident. Florida continues building in high-risk areas Payne reunited with One Direction in Argentina earlier this month for a Niall Horan concert, according to Teen Vogue. He was one of five band members of One Direction, which formed in 2010 when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor.' After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful.' They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016. They had a loyal fan base, many of whom were teen girls, who became known as 'Directioners.' Once the group disbanded, Payne pursued a solo career, putting out the album 'LP1' in 2019. His last release was a single called 'Teardrops' in March. In 2021, Payne said he had problems with addiction and mental health during his One Direction fame. 'It was really, really, really severe. It was a problem,' Payne told 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast host Steven Bartlett. He said his early boy band days were filled with 'pills and booze' and 'moments of suicidal ideation.' One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the street as police stood sentinel outside. Young women at the scene expressed shock and heartbreak. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told The Associated Press. Video showed dozens gathered on the cordoned-off street outside the hotel, with many recording videos on their cellphones. A forensic investigator was seen exiting the hotel, where Payne’s body remained Wednesday evening.

One Direction singer Liam Payne found dead in Buenos Aires: Repor...	Oct 16 (Reuters) - Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local newspaper La Nacion reported on Wednesday. The 31-year-old British musician was found dead after falling from the hotel's third floor, it said, citing emergency services. Several witnesses at the hotel told TMZ Payne fell from his room at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel. It's unclear if the fall was intentional or accidental. Witnesses say Payne 'had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier,' according to TMZ. He reportedly smashed his laptop and had to be carried back to his room. Florida continues building in high-risk areas Payne reunited with One Direction in Argentina earlier this month for a Niall Horan concert, according to Teen Vogue. Payne joined One Direction when he was 16. The group became the biggest boyband in the world after its 2010 launch on 'The X Factor' before ultimately breaking up in 2015. In 2021, Payne revealed that he struggled with addiction and mental health during his One Direction fame. 'It was really, really, really severe. It was a problem,' Payne told 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast host Steven Bartlett. He said his early boy band days were filled with 'pills and booze' and 'moments of suicidal ideation.'

FEMA leader: Misinformation about hurricane operations must stop	(NewsNation) — The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) now has four disaster recovery centers in western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. FEMA says it has approved disaster assistance for more than 75,000 households, but there is a lot of confusion regarding FEMA, militia groups and hurricane recovery in the state. Over the weekend, national media outlets reported on threats from armed militias to FEMA, causing them to temporarily pause work in North Carolina. Efforts have since resumed. One North Carolina resident, William Parsons, was arrested after posting a message on Facebook calling for people to 'overtake' the FEMA site in Lake Lure, claiming that the agency was withholding supplies from hurricane survivors. Parsons said after his arrest that the law enforcement agents who arrested him were lying. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'They want to sit here and lie and say I was carrying guns around. I had one gun on me, which was legally owned and sitting on the side of my hip, and I had a rifle and another pistol that were in my vehicle that were both lawful and legal to own,' Parsons said. Last Saturday in Carter County, Tennesee, which was also hit by the hurricane, volunteers with the International Alliance of Community Chaplains witnessed a group of people confronting and threatening FEMA workers, NewsNation local affiliate WJHL reported. Tracy Elder, president and founder of the International Alliance of Community Chaplains, said the people who confronted the FEMA workers were armed but didn't have their guns drawn. 'They had surrounded them, and there was a lady there that was yelling and threatening them,' Elder said. FEMA says they made operational changes to keep personnel safe. Deanne Criswell, FEMA's administrator, had a very specific message Tuesday. Group associated with polygamous sect builds fences on US Forest Service lands 'The ongoing spread of misinformation about operations is not OK. It has got to stop,' Criswell said. 'The federal family has been here, working side by side with the state since Day 1. These are people who put their lives on hold to help those who have lost everything.' Adam Smith, who leads a volunteer organization called Savage OPs, which is made up of special operations forces, nurse practitioners and civil engineers who help with hurricane recovery efforts, says the rumors about armed militias are directed at groups like theirs. Smith, a former Green Beret, said those threats are hurting their ability to get aid into the community. 'Misinformation is not coming from the ground up. I think the misinformation is coming from the top of FEMA down,' Smith said. 'When you have contractors that are afraid to go out into the areas they are supposed to work, and they are saying you have to carry, and you have to pack, you know, watch out people are going to come after you, not true — the people in the mountains might be suspicious of the government in general, but they are the most welcoming people you could possibly imagine.' Smith says they aren’t going anywhere and just want to help and support the community. 'The conversations that we've had with county state officials as well as National Guard personnel (is like), 'Hey, there's going to be a point when the transition happens, when the National Guard has to demobilize, when the 101st has to the mobilize,'' Smith said. 'And when that transition happens, we're not going to have those forces in the area and we're going to still be here. Moreover, we've we've been told, 'Hey, keep doing what you're doing.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/fema-leader-misinformation-hurricane-operations/	2024-10-16T12:33:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175616737-1-1.jpg?w=900
Florida continues building in high-risk areas	(NewsNation) — One week since Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida cleanup efforts are underway, and so is new construction. New data shows tens of thousands of new properties have been built in high-risk flood areas despite the growing risk of destructive hurricanes. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said hurricanes will not weaken the demand for homes on Florida's Gulf Coast because there's always going to be a demand to live in beautiful places. Hurricane fallout threatens to hinder voting More than 16 million people in Florida currently live in coastal counties and that number continues to go up despite the risks of hurricanes and flooding. Climate modeling firm First Street Foundation told NewsNation that real estate developers have actually built 77,000 new properties in high-risk flood areas since 2019. That's the highest number in the nation. Nationally, close to 300,000 new properties were built in high-risk flood areas between 2019 and 2023, a number that has been concerning for disaster-risk experts who say that in many states, it would only take one good-sized hurricane to break the entire insurance system. 'We got to a situation in our country that, while we don't lose as many lives in storms, our losses are rising because we have more people coming to the coast and we have therefore grown our exposure to these storms,' said Tracy Kijewski-Correa, a disaster-risk reduction specialist. 'We have a climate that's changing, that's going to be, regrettably, the perfect storm.' Kijewski-Correa said that while Helene was an outlier in terms of lives lost, the property damage from hurricanes could lead to some major changes. to insurance. Retired therapy dog goes back to work after Hurricane Milton 'That is probably going to require us to reimagine insurance, maybe in painful ways, and to start having more candid discussions about retreat,' she said. 'Because there will be, for some families, very little possibility of ensuring or building to withstand what might be coming.' The Federal Emergency Management Agency recently looked at what are called severe, repetitive lost properties, a designation that covers homes that have severely flooded more than once. The agency found that there are 45,000 of those properties in the U.S. at the end of 2022, with about 3,100 of those in Florida alone. Ratings for Morningstar DBRS said, in a report released this week, that it expects Hurricane Milton to be among the top five costliest natural catastrophes in the U.S., with insured losses approaching $60 billion. Experts warn we are entering a difficult situation with the insurance industry across the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, saying we need to build better before storms hit to mitigate the toll of damage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-building-high-risk/	2024-10-16T11:58:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177760605.jpg?w=900
Retired therapy dog goes back to work after Hurricane Milton	(NewsNation) — Before Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida, tornadoes ripped through the state, with St. Lucie County being one of the areas hit hardest. A local therapy dog, Ben, came out of retirement and now goes door-to-door, offering a head to pet for residents who are now picking up the pieces after the storm. 'He has come a long way, but I'm very proud of him, and he's a natural at what he does,' Olivia Chasse, Ben's owner, said. Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist Ben worked at a nursing home, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, they stopped allowing visitors, so Chasse decided the time had come to let him 'just be a dog and enjoy life.' After the hurricane, though, Chasse saw people donating food, time and supplies and also wanted to help. 'I thought, 'Well, we've got something a little bit different that we can offer,'' Chasse said. '(Ben) got pretty excited about going to work. He knew he was going to get some back scratches.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/retired-therapy-dog-helps-after-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-16T07:36:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Milton.jpg?w=350
Delphi killings trial: State seeks to nix composite sketches	CARROLL COUNTY, Ind. – The state doesn’t want a pair of composite sketches that were highly publicized early in the investigation to be part of the Delphi murders trial. On Monday, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland filed a motion in limine asking the court to prohibit the admission of the sketches or any reference to them during the trial. 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German. (Credit: Family) The motion refers to a pair of widely circulated composite sketches of the Delphi suspect. Law enforcement released two sketches—one in July 2017 and another in April 2019.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } The second sketch showed a suspect who looked considerably younger than the person seen in the original one. The sketches were based on the recollections of witnesses and were released to the public to generate tips about the February 2017 murders of Abby Williams and Libby German. For several years, online sleuths attempted to match various suspects to the sketches. The initial sketch released in 2017 (left) and the revised sketch released in 2019 (right) McLeland’s motion argued that 'a composite sketch is not relevant, admission would result in undue prejudice, confuse or mislead the jury, or is impermissible hearsay, and the witnesses who participated in the preparation of composite sketch(s) will not be presented by the State for the purpose of in-court identification of the defendant.' McLeland went on to argue that the sketches were not related to the identification of Allen as a suspect and weren’t relevant to his trial, which started with jury selection this week in Allen County. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the girls’ deaths near the Monon High Bridge. McLeland argued that 'the witnesses who assisted in the preparation of composite sketches of the Bridge Guy would testify that they did not see the person depicted in their sketch for a sufficient length of time to allow them to positively identify the defendant.' Richard Allen Mugshot - Oct. 13, 2024 He added that it was the state’s belief that Allen’s defense intended to 'use composite sketches from the investigation as demonstrative evidence and for impeachment purposes.' The sketches were not 'instrumental in identifying' Allen, McLeland wrote. The motion contended that the 'prejudicial effect' of admitting the sketches would far outweigh their 'probative value' in court. Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court The motion asks the court to order the defendant, his counsel and witnesses to 'refrain from mentioning, commenting, or making any reference whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, to composite sketches without first obtaining permission of the Court outside the presence and hearing of the jury.'

Family pushes to free Menendez brothers after nearly 30 years	(NewsNation) — Nearly two dozen family members of Erik and Lyle Menendez, the two brothers convicted of killing their parents in 1996, are holding a news conference Wednesday in Los Angeles in hopes it will move the needle in the brothers' appeal of their conviction. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced earlier this month that he was reviewing new evidence in the case against the brothers. New evidence allegedly includes a letter from Erik Menendez to a cousin before the killings. In it, Erik Menendez details some of the sexual abuse he survived at the hands of his father, Jose Menendez. Plus, new allegations against Jose Menendez from a second, young boy claiming to have been raped by him at 14 have come into the spotlight. Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court Family stands by Menendez brothers Family members have said the Menendez brothers should not have been charged with murder, but manslaughter — but that wasn't an option. The brothers' extended family will advocate for the brothers’ release from prison during the news conference as prosecutors review new evidence to determine whether they should be serving life sentences for killing their parents. Erik Menendez, now 53, and his 56-year-old brother, Lyle Menendez, are currently incarcerated in state prison without the possibility of parole after being convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion more than 35 years ago. Lyle Menendez, who was then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, admitted they fatally shot their entertainment executive father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, in 1989. However, they argued self-defense, saying they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father’s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. While testimony and evidence about the sexual abuse was allowed in the brothers' first trial that ended in a hung jury, it was not allowed in the second trial that ended in guilty verdicts. 'I always believed that they were sexually molested,' Karen Vandermolen Copley told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo earlier this month. 'My sister Diane lived with them, and they have evidence that was not allowed. We have always supported the boys once we knew and understood the facts.' The extended family’s attorney Bryan Freedman previously said they strongly support the brothers’ release. Comedian Rosie O’Donnell also plans to join the family Wednesday. Texas man facing execution in shaken baby syndrome case awaits clemency ruling New evidence sparks case review Earlier this month, Gascón said there is no question the brothers committed the 1989 murders, but his office will be reviewing new evidence and will make a decision on whether a resentencing is warranted in the notorious case that captured national attention. The brothers’ attorneys said the family believed from the beginning they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder. Manslaughter was not an option for the jury during the second trial that ultimately led to the brothers’ murder conviction, attorney Mark Geragos previously said. The case has gained new traction in recent weeks after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.' The new evidence includes a letter written by Erik Menendez that his attorneys say corroborates the allegations that he was sexually abused by his father. A hearing was scheduled for Nov. 29. Prosecutors at the time contended there was no evidence of any molestation. They said the sons were after their parents’ multimillion-dollar estate. In a recorded conversation in a Netflix documentary, Erik Menendez claimed the spending was to 'cover up the horrible pain of not wanting to be alive.' Jurors in 1996 rejected a death sentence in favor of life without parole. NewsNation reached out to relatives and the brothers' attorney for comment. However, they said they would not comment on the case until after Wednesday's news conference.

Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court	(NewsNation) — The man accused of killing six women over the course of 30 years near Gilgo Beach, New York, is due in court Wednesday. Rex Heuermann will go before a Suffolk County judge at 9 a.m. EDT, marking his first court appearance since July. He pleaded not guilty in June to all charges filed against him. Texas man facing execution in shaken baby syndrome case awaits clemency ruling Heuermann is charged with murder in connection with the deaths of six women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. He was initially charged with murder in the deaths of the first four women, and prosecutors later charged him in the deaths of Taylor and Costilla. Heuermann, an architect, lived across the bay from where officials discovered the bodies. His attorney said he’ll seek to separate the cases so the charges relating to the first four women are tried independently from the two most recent charges. Police spent the past 14 years investigating the deaths of at least 10 people — most of whom were sex workers — whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway near Gilgo Beach on Long Island.

Harris peppered with questions by Charlamagne tha God’s audience	Vice President Harris was peppered with questions Tuesday about her plan for Black Americans from radio host Charlamagne tha God and his listeners in an interview that’s part of a late-campaign media blitz before Election Day. The interview began with Charlamagne asking Harris to respond to criticism about the quality of her responses to questions and the notion that she is repetitive, which she characterized as 'discipline.' She also addressed 'the weight of the moment' in her role running for president against Trump. 'I feel an extraordinary weight of responsibility right now to do everything I can,' Harris said. 'When I go to bed at night, in addition to my prayers, I will ask, ‘Have I done everything I could do today?’' 'This is a margin-of-error race. It's tight,' she added. 'But I'm going to win. I'm going to win.' Throughout the interview, Harris shared her position on topics such as reparations — which she said she supports studying — building up Black homeownership and the opportunity to grow generational wealth. The interview was an opportunity for Harris to speak directly to Black voters, a group that polls show overwhelmingly support her over Trump. But some of the interview questions also revealed some disenchantment about voting and whether the candidate could fulfill the promises she’s making on the campaign trail. At one point, Charlamagne pointed out that Harris is facing the issue of misinformation in this year’s election, particularly on her history as a prosecutor. 'One of the biggest pieces of misinformation, one of the biggest allegations against you, is that you targeted and locked up thousands of Black men in San Francisco for weed,' Charlamagne said. 'Some say you did it to boost your career. Some say you did it out of pure hate for Black men. Please tell us the facts.' Harris immediately denied the allegations and instead said she was 'the most progressive prosecutor' in California. She then pledged to work to decriminalize marijuana if elected president. 'I know exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations, and specifically Black men,' Harris said. Questions around Black men and what Harris plans to do for them popped up repeatedly during the interview — unsurprising as polls show her support among the demographic slipping while Trump’s numbers are improving. Harris released an 'Opportunity Agenda for Black Men' on Monday, but one caller asked her why she didn’t do so sooner and why support for Black men is only sought out during election cycles. 'I've been in this race about 70 days. You can look at all my work before those 70 days to know that this, what I'm talking about right now, is not new, and is not for the sake of winning this election,' Harris responded. 'This is about a long-standing commitment, including the work that I've done as vice president and before, when I was senator.' Harris’s time as a senator came up at another point in the interview when a caller from Nevada asked what she plans to do to address police brutality and its disproportionate impact on Black Americans. The vice president quickly pointed to her work on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) during her time in the upper chamber. 'We couldn't get the votes in Congress,' she admitted. 'But what we did when we came in office and during the time that I've been vice president, is we passed an executive order … that says that for federal law enforcement, the following things have to happen, which we, for the first time, put in place: no knock warrants, barring chokeholds, a national database for us to collect information and track police officers who have broken the law.' 'I'm still going to always work on getting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,' she added. 'Part of the work that I'm doing as a candidate for president of the United States includes lifting up those candidates who are running, either for reelection or for the first time to Congress, who are supportive of what we need to do on all of the issues we've been discussing.' While the interview was Harris’s chance to speak directly to Black voters, Charlamagne also pressed her on recent comments that she said she would not do anything specifically for Black people. Harris denied making the statement, reminding Charlamagne of the start of the conversation around misinformation. Later, she added that she is running 'to be a president for everybody.' 'But I am clear-eyed about the history and the disparities that exist for specific communities and I'm not going to shy away from that,' Harris said. 'It doesn't mean that my policies aren't going to benefit everybody, because they are. Everything I just talked about will benefit everybody.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-peppered-with-questions-by-charlamagne-tha-gods-audience/	2024-10-16T02:16:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24289047511075-e1729028318895.jpg?w=900
Georgia judge blocks ballot hand-count rule from taking effect be...	(NewsNation) — A new Georgia election rule that would require a hand-count of ballots on election night will not take effect before November’s contest, a state judge ruled. In a decision late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney agreed to block the rule’s application, writing that the public is 'not disserved by pressing pause.' 'This election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away, regardless of one’s view of that date’s fame or infamy,' McBurney wrote in an eight-page ruling. 'Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.' The rule, passed by the Republican-led State Election Board, was set to go into effect Oct. 22, just two weeks before the election, and after early voting in the state is underway. Under the rule, three poll workers at each facility would have been required to count the physical ballots — not votes — 'separately' and 'independently' in stacks of 50 until all three counts matched. The hand-count would be completed on election night unless a scanner had more than 750 ballots by the end of voting, at which point a poll manager could push counting to the next day. Election officials and poll workers vocally objected to the change, warning that hand-counting ballots is overly burdensome and prone to error. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has called the rule 'misguided' and suggested it would delay the reporting of election results. Additionally, the state would have little time to train poll workers under the new guidance. During a bench trial over the matter Tuesday, a lawyer for the Cobb County Board of Elections told McBurney that 444 county poll officers would have to be trained to comply with the new rule. Lawyers for the State Election Board pushed back by saying the panel was tasked by Georgia’s Legislature with defining election rules — and put under no time constraints to do so. McBurney said in his ruling that his decision was not final and would be further detailed at a later date, but not until after the election. He said that the county election board made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm, pointing to the chaos that could ensue if the '11th-and-one-half hour' rule was implemented. 'Our Boards of Election and Superintendents are statutorily obligated to ensure that elections are ’honestly, efficiently, and uniformly conducted,’' he wrote. 'Failure to comply with statutory obligations such as these can result in investigation by the SEB, suspension or even criminal prosecution.' He added, in parentheses, 'While the latter is far-fetched, it is not an impossibility in this charged political climate.' The judge did not issue a decision on five other rules, which were discussed at the hearing Tuesday, nor weigh the merits of the hand-count rule. The Cobb County election board did not seek to halt implementation of the other rules. The Democratic National Committee intervened in the case. Following McBurney's ruling, DNC acting co-Executive Director Monica Guardiola, Georgia Democratic Party Chair Rep. Nikema Williams and Harris-Walz Deputy Campaign Manager Quentin Fulks issued a statement in support of the decision. 'From the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it,' they said. 'We will continue fighting to ensure that voters can cast their ballot knowing it will count.' McBurney’s decision is the second major ruling he made Tuesday. Earlier, the judge established that county election officials may not delay or decline to certify election results, rejecting a challenge from a Fulton County election board member who refused to certify during Georgia’s spring primary. That board member is one of at least 19 Republican county officials in the state who have refused to certify election results since 2020 in a marked increase from previous years, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Georgia is one of seven critical battleground states that could shape the election's outcome. McBurney is also weighing two other new State Election Board rules, which would allow for a 'reasonable inquiry' before election certification and let election workers 'examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.' He has not issued any decision on the matter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-judge-blocks-ballot-hand-count-rule-from-taking-effect-before-election/	2024-10-15T19:39:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/c75854e51ef346528ac6c8dd13ca9ff4-e1677590583917.jpg?w=900

That board member is one of at least 19 Republican county officials in the state who have refused to certify election results since 2020 in a marked increase from previous years, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Georgia is one of seven critical battleground states that could shape the election's outcome. McBurney is also weighing two other new State Election Board rules, which would allow for a 'reasonable inquiry' before election certification and let election workers 'examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.' He has not issued any decision on the matter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elections-2022/georgia-judge-blocks-ballot-hand-count-rule-from-taking-effect-before-election/	2024-10-15T19:39:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/c75854e51ef346528ac6c8dd13ca9ff4-e1677590583917.jpg?w=900
ISIS-K orchestrated foiled Election Day terror plot: Report	(NewsNation) — The Afghan branch of the Islamic State, ISIS-K, orchestrated an Afghan man's foiled Election Day terror plot, two senior U.S. officials briefed on the matter told NBC News. Afghan native Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was arrested in early October and accused of planning to target large groups of people on Nov. 5. He told investigators he and a co-conspirator — whose identity has not been released — planned to die as martyrs. Tawhedi first arrived in the United States in September 2021. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, the Oklahoma City resident bought AK-47 rifles, liquidated his family’s assets and purchased one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan, charging documents revealed. Did migrants from Hamas cross into US after Oct. 7? Those same documents show that Tawhedi, who officials say consumed Islamic State propaganda, was in contact with an ISIS affiliate named 'Mailk.' A family member of Tawhedi was arrested and charged by French law enforcement this past weekend for allegedly planning a similar terror scheme, according to NBC News reporting. NewsNation has reached out to federal officials about these reports but has not yet heard back.

Majority find 2025 Social Security COLA bump insufficient: Survey	(NewsNation) — The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment for recipients in 2025, the smallest such increase since 2021. On average, Social Security retirement benefits will increase by about $50 per month starting in January, a minor increase for most. And recipients are feeling the pinch, with a recent survey from the Motley Fool showing a majority (54%) view this year's COLA adjustment as insufficient. A similar number, 50% — have considered going back to work to make ends meet. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits An even wider majority, 81%, agreed that the 2025 COLA will help 'very little' or not 'at all' with key expenses like food, housing and energy costs. Social Security cost-of-living adjustments have varied over the past few years. Here’s how they have changed: 2025: 2.5% 2024: 3.2% 2023: 8.7% 2022: 5.9% 2021: 1.3% The recent drop is due to a cooling pace of inflation, which is good for the overall economy but may leave retirees struggling to cover costs. Often, retirees rely heavily (32%) or exclusively (28%) on payments despite Social Security being designed to cover 40% of the average worker's salary. Medicare open enrollment begins Tuesday Most respondents, 71%, don't think the formula to determine the COLA accurately reflects how retirees experience inflation. How is Social Security COLA determined? Each year, the government determines the COLA by comparing the average inflation rate from July to September to the same period the year before. That calculation is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Some senior advocacy groups want the government to determine the COLA based on the CPI-E, a different inflation index specifically for seniors, arguing it would more accurately reflect the spending patterns of those 62 and older. The vast majority of Social Security beneficiaries, roughly 75%, are retired workers who received an average monthly check of $1,920 as of August. That’s about $80 more than the year prior. What’s the average amount of credit card debt Americans carry? Social security shortfall Thursday’s COLA announcement comes as the national social insurance plan faces a looming financial shortfall. In roughly a decade, Social Security recipients could see their benefits cut by 21% if Congress doesn’t take action. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have vowed to protect the program and promised not to slash benefits, though neither has offered many specifics. The 2025 COLA increase will be reflected in your January Social Security check.

Millennials doing better financially than baby boomers were: Stud...	(NewsNation) — Contrary to popular belief, millennials are better off financially than previous generations at the same age, according to a new study. LendingTree found that millennials ages 26 to 41 had a median net worth of $84,941 in 2022 — more than Gen Xers ($78,333) and baby boomers ($58,101) at similar ages after adjusting for inflation. The findings suggest millennials’ net worth is 8.4% higher than Gen Xers’ and 46.2% higher than baby boomers’ at the same age. Tracking debt: Which generation owes the most? 'The scars from the Great Recession and the pandemic have helped shape millennials’ views on money, forcing them to be more focused on their finances than other generations have had to be,' said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst. Millennials have more money partially because they're better educated than their predecessors, allowing for superior employment opportunities. The report found that midpoint millennials — those born in the middle of the generation — earned a median cumulative income of $446,570 between 2014 and 2023. By comparison, midpoint baby boomers earned about 20% less, $362,330, between 1980 and 1989 after adjusting for inflation. With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings? But it's not all good news for millennials. One of the reasons their finances are in better shape is because they're delaying major milestones like marriage and homeownership, the report noted. Millennials are also more likely to live at home than previous generations — a win for their wallets but potentially a negative for overall life satisfaction. As for debt, LendingTree found millennials have nearly twice as much as baby boomers did at the same age but because their assets are worth significantly more, millennials come out ahead on net worth. One important caveat: More millennials (12.7%) had a negative net worth compared to Gen Xers (11.5%) and baby boomers (11.9%) at similar ages. That finding is supported by other research pointing to a widening wealth gap within the millennial cohort. What about the cost of housing? The cost of housing is one area where millennials are worse off. That's true for both renters and home buyers. In 1990, midpoint baby boomers paid a median monthly rent of $1,174 adjusted for inflation. That's $307 less than millennials' current median rent of $1,481. Homeownership is also more expensive today. A 20% down payment on a median home purchase in 2024 is $85,960 for midpoint millennials compared to $57,107 for baby boomers in 1990. However, millennials have benefitted from lower mortgage rates, which were much higher, around 10%, in 1990. Overall, millennials ages 25 to 34 spent an average of $15,429 on shelter in 2022 — 26% more than baby boomers did at the same age. Are millennials really doing better financially? Academics and media organizations have continued to debate whether younger generations are worse off than their parents — and that discussion is likely to continue. On the whole, recent research suggests younger generations in the U.S. are doing better than many expected compared to a few years ago, and, inequality within, not between, generations is growing. In August, the Wall Street Journal highlighted 'the dramatic turnaround in millennials' finances.' The report cited research showing the median household net worth of older millennials skyrocketed from $60,000 in 2019 to $130,000 in 2022. 'The turnaround has been so dramatic that millennials — mocked at times for being perpetually behind in building wealth, buying homes, getting married and having children — now find themselves ahead,' WSJ wrote. Researchers at the University of Cambridge found that U.S. millennials were not 'universally worse off' than baby boomers in a 2023 study but noted a 'vast and increasing wealth gap.' 'The wealthiest millennials now have more than ever, while the poor are left further behind,' the study's lead author Rob Gruijters said in a statement. He added: 'Individuals with typical working-class careers, like truck drivers or hairdressers, used to be able to buy a home and build a modest level of assets, but this is more difficult for the younger generation.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/millennials-financially-baby-boomers/	2024-10-15T15:05:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/PayingBillsGettyImages-1313653794.jpg?w=900
Mystery drones flew over US base	(NewsNation) — New details are emerging about drones that flew over U.S. military bases last year, though there is still no explanation for where they came from. Air Force officials confirmed several drones flew over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December of 2023, an incident that has been brought up in a number of congressional hearings and even brought to the attention of President Joe Biden. Langley houses one of the Defense Department's largest and most important military infrastructures and is home to some of the nation's most advanced fighter jets. ‘Once in a lifetime’ comet viewing in Utah — here’s how It's still not clear exactly what the objects were, and if the Pentagon has an answer, it has not released that information publicly. A recent Wall Street Journal report says that the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which is tasked with studying reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, was involved in the investigation alongside the FBI. That means the Pentagon had at least some indication that these might be something we can't fully explain. Exclusive video given to NewsNation by someone who lives near the base shows lights in the sky with the person who took the video describing the drones being the size of cars. Some of the new reporting has corroborated that description. According to The Wall Street Journal's reporting, Pentagon officials who have seen the drones in person say they were about 20 feet long, traveling at around 100 mph or faster and at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Some speculate that the drones were not part of intelligence-gathering efforts by a foreign adversary like China or Russia, in part because they were out in the open with no apparent effort to hide them. Former Air Force pilot Ryan Graves, an advocate for pilots who have seen UAPs, told NewsNation the objects don't fit usual patterns. Maybe advanced civilizations aren’t all that advanced: Scientist 'We are seeing these objects blinking with white lights, not in the strobe pattern that one would expect due to FAA regulations, but patterns that don't seem to meet anything I'm aware of,' he told NewsNation. 'Additionally, the objects apparently have been lit up while they're operating over the base itself. So it did not appear, at least from the information I received, that these objects were trying to conceal their location or presence.' Senators who spoke to NewsNation also said they are not sure what the objects are either. NewsNation has reached out to the Pentagon for comment but has not received a response.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/mystery-drones-us-base/	2024-10-15T11:50:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/DroneLangley.jpg?w=900
What is the 'blue wall,' and what does it mean for 2024 election?	(NewsNation) — With less than a month until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is making stops this week in three states that experts say are critical to winning the White House. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is visiting Michigan on Tuesday for an event with Charlamagne tha God and another one with Black entrepreneurs in Detroit following a Monday trip to Pennsylvania. Next, she’s set to travel to Wisconsin. How to register to vote Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump also stopped in Pennsylvania this week for a rally in Pittsburgh. All three states are part of the so-called 'blue wall,' a set of states that have typically voted for Democrats in presidential elections since 1992. Which states are part of the blue wall? California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin are included as part of the 'blue wall.' Of these, California is the largest, as it has 54 electoral votes, followed by New York with 28. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, especially, are top priorities for candidates in the 2024 election. Trump, in 2016, flipped the states to Republican, but Biden was able to win them back in 2020. ‘False allegations’: Man arrested near Trump rally speaks out Could Trump break the blue wall? NewsNation partner The Hill writes that Harris and Trump are polling within close margins of each other in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Harris has a 0.7% lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, according to Decision Desk HQ/The Hill’s poll aggregate, while Trump has a 0.8% advantage in Michigan and 0.1% more than the vice president in Wisconsin. 'There’s no getting around the fact that those three states in the so-called blue wall are pivotal to both campaigns,' Al Mottur, a Democratic strategist and bundler at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, told The Hill.

McDonald's largest fry producer closes factory; CEO blames $5 mea...	(NewsNation) — 'Do you want fries with that?' America's largest fast food chain may have a fry issue as its largest supplier shuts off production and cuts costs at its Connell, Washington, plant. Lamb Weston, an Idaho-based company, announced the closure and a 4% cut in its workforce at the beginning of the month. The news comes as part of a restructuring plan expected to generate nearly $55 million of pre-tax cost savings for the company in 2025. Listeria meat recall hits Walmart, Target, more stores 'Lamb Weston is confident in the world’s ongoing love of fries — the closure of one of our older facilities accounts for less than 5% of our production capacity, so this adjustment simply helps address a current supply-and-demand imbalance,' Lamb Weston spokesperson Teresa Paulsen said in a statement to TODAY.com. Now, Tom Werner, the CEO of Lamb Weston, is blaming McDonald's $5 meal deal, which was introduced back in May. The meal deal is supposed to provide an affordable option for American families, especially during a time when inflation remains the highest in recent history. 'Restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand, relative to supply, continue to be soft, and we believe it will remain soft through the remainder of fiscal 2025,' Werner said. He said the steps to close one of its plants and cut costs is an effort to remain proactive to improve operating efficiency, profitability and cash flows.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/food/mcdonalds-french-fries-production/	2024-10-15T10:43:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-94500987-1-e1708631223656.jpg?w=800

Nevada says volleyball match will go on despite players' forfeitu...	(NewsNation) — The University of Nevada in Reno said an upcoming women's volleyball match will still be held despite the team's players saying they would forfeit the match. As Outkick.com first reported Monday, the Nevada volleyball team decided via player vote to forfeit the Oct. 23 game against the San Jose State Spartans following reports that the team has a transgender woman on its roster, redshirt junior Blaire Fleming. 'We, the University of Nevada Reno women’s volleyball team, forfeit against San Jose State University and stand united in solidarity with the volleyball teams of Southern Utah University, Boise State University, the University of Wyoming, and Utah State University,' the team said in a statement provided to Outkick. Georgia university leaders ask NCAA to ban transgender women from sports Hours later, the university acted in opposition to the 'majority' of its women's volleyball team, providing a statement to Outkick saying the game would go ahead. 'The players’ decision and statement were made independently, and without consultation with the University or the athletic department. The players’ decision also does not represent the position of the University,' the school said. 'The University and its athletic programs are governed by the Nevada Constitution and Nevada law, which strictly protect equality of rights under the law, and that equality of rights shall not be denied or abridged by this state or any of its subdivisions on account of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, ancestry or national origin. 'The University is also governed by federal law as well as the rules and regulations of the NCAA and the Mountain West Conference, which include providing competition in an inclusive and supportive environment. 'The University intends to move forward with the match as scheduled, and the players may choose not to participate in the match on the day of the contest. No players will be subject to any team disciplinary action for their decision not to participate in the match.' Jean-Pierre blocking Kirby from White House podium, report says Southern Utah was the first team to forfeit against San Jose State before its Sept. 14 match. Boise State, Wyoming and Utah State followed suit, surrendering their games on Sept. 28, Oct. 5 and 23, respectively. The teams did not cite Fleming or any other reason for their forfeiture. Fleming has played in all 12 of San Jose State's games this season and has been part of the Spartans' squad for three seasons after one season at Coastal Carolina in 2020-21. San Francisco, Saint-Mary's, Fresno State, Colorado State, San Diego State, and Nevada Las Vegas have all played against the Spartans since Southern Utah's decision. The Spartans' next game is Thursday at New Mexico. San Jose State team co-captain Brooke Slusser claimed the school tried to sweep 'under the rug' the fact that Fleming is transgender after a report in April brought it to public consciousness. Slusser transferred to San Jose State in 2023 after playing two seasons at Alabama. Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas fails in challenge to rules that bar her from elite women’s races 'When that first article came out, it was quite literally just a media meeting talking about, 'Don't make comments. If media people come up to you, it's not your story to tell,'' Slusser told Outkick on Monday. 'And that was really it. It wasn't, ‘How do we feel about this? Are we OK?’ It was how to handle the media and not make it look like there's a problem, and almost just the feeling of just sweeping it under the rug, and that was really it.' Slusser is among numerous female athletes suing the NCAA for alleged violations of Title IX by allowing transgender athletes to play on women's teams. She supports the decision of teams to forfeit. 'There's obviously a part of me that it's sad because there's only so many volleyball games you get in your career. On the other hand, I'd be doing the exact same thing,' she told Outkick the Morning on Monday. 'I fully support every school that is deciding to find the courage, take this stance and not play against us because those are the steps in the right direction of women standing up and finding that courage to say 'No, this isn't OK.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/nevada-volleyball-match-forfeit-trans-athlete/	2024-10-15T09:35:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175714174.jpg?w=900
Delphi murders trial: Defense claims hair found with victim didn'...	ALLEN COUNTY, Ind. – Defense lawyers for Richard Allen made a startling admission during Tuesday's jury selection. Allen's defense team revealed that hair was found in Abby Williams' hand that didn't match Richard Allen. That's the first time that information has been made public. Attorney Andrew Baldwin made the comments during 'mini opening statements' preceding jury selection. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the deaths of Abby and her friend Libby German in February 2017. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. 14 jurors seated so far in Delphi murders trial While prosecutors say an unspent bullet found at the scene is linked to a gun owned by Allen and cite dozens of confessions from him, Allen's defense argued those confessions were made under duress and weren't trustworthy. They said Allen confessed to details from the crime that were inaccurate. He also confessed to other crimes that didn't happen, his defense team said. During Tuesday's proceedings, three previously selected jurors were dismissed from the trial, bringing the total number of selected jurors down to 11. One was removed because of childcare issues, another over health concerns. A third was dismissed as well. By noon, four new jurors were selected, bringing the total to 15. The group now includes 12 jurors and three alternates, with one alternate still needing to be seated. The current makeup of the jury is 10 women and five men. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, Allen’s defense team asked for a change of venue. Special Judge Fran Gull, appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court to oversee the case after the original judge recused himself, determined that was logistically challenging. What to know ahead of the Delphi murders trial She decided to bring in jurors from Allen County and have them transported to Carroll County for the trial. Jury selection began Monday. The jurors will be sequestered for about a month. More than 100 people were expected to testify between the defense and prosecution. Gull is scheduled to hear some evidentiary motions in the afternoon. Wednesday will mark a break in the trial before an additional hearing on Thursday in Allen County concerning the admissibility of widely circulated composite sketches in the case. The state filed a motion asking the sketches to be excluded from the trial. Opening statements are scheduled to begin on Friday, when the proceedings shift to Carroll County.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-trial-defense-claims-hair-found-with-victim-didnt-match-richard-allen/	2024-10-15T09:07:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Allen-Co-courthouse-VO-ININDOF1ENC002_mxf_00.04.10.20.jpg?w=900
Pandas arrive in the US. Next stop is the National Zoo	WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought is coming to an end. Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears arrived in the United States on Tuesday. They will be transported from Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia to the zoo. A pair of three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan and will soon be flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 'Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine,' the statement said, adding that the partnership will 'make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries.' Once the bears arrive in Washington, there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. On Monday evening, the zoo's website posted an alert that the entire facility would be closed Tuesday, without giving a reason. The lead article on the site still said the pandas would be coming sometime before the end of the year. Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions. Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week. That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco. In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, zoo director Brandie Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year. The Chinese announcement said the National Zoo had sent 'three experienced keepers and veterinary experts' to China to assist the transport and accompany the bears. Zoo officials on Monday declined to confirm the Chinese announcement. Zoo spokesperson Jennifer Zoon said in an email, 'For the safety of animals and staff, we are not able to confirm any details at this time.' But signs at the zoo and on its social media site have heralded the planned return of the pandas and panda-themed merchandise still dominates the gift shops. 'The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,' said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. 'The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.' The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four. Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation's capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable. 'The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,' Liu said in an email. 'We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-the-pandas-are-coming-the-pandas-are-coming/	2024-10-15T08:52:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670e90c0126171.83675344.jpeg?w=900
Two giant pandas arrive in DC from China	(NewsNation) — Two giant pandas have landed in Washington, D.C., as they head toward the National Zoo less than a year after a previous pair were returned to China. The pandas are on loan from China to the U.S. and the zoo is closed to the public Tuesday to allow for the pandas' safe arrival. The male and female pair are named Bao Li and Qing Boa and are said to be lively 3-year-old pandas who enjoy climbing. Kidney recipient comes full circle with job at dialysis center Pandas first came to the National Zoo in 1972 after President Richard Nixon traveled to China to open diplomatic and trade relations between China and the U.S. It was the start of what's been called panda diplomacy, with China using the animals to achieve diplomatic goals. In 2000, China sent Mei Xiang and Tian Tian to the National Zoo and the pair had a cub, Xiao Qi Ji, in 2020, and all three were returned to China in November 2023. With the panda family's departure, Zoo Atlanta, which is set to return its pandas this year, became the only zoo in the U.S. to house giant pandas. This summer giant pandas returned to the San Diego Zoo, and now the National Zoo will once again be home to the species that is considered a national treasure in China. Hurricanes Helene, Milton devastate Florida animal rescue The black and white bears are considered vulnerable, and U.S. zoos are only allowed to import giant pandas if they can ensure China uses half the loan fee for conservation efforts. Bao Li, the male panda, has a D.C. connection, as his mother Bao Bao was born at the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in 2013. Upon arrival at the zoo, the pandas will be quarantined for at least 30 days and after that will be given a few weeks to settle into their habitat before being viewed by the public.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/giant-pandas-arrive-dc/	2024-10-15T07:55:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/20240516-817A0262-03RP.webp?w=900

Education and Rehabilitation Center about 60 miles south of Tampa. Ed Straight, who is on dialysis and was away during the storms, has worked tirelessly with volunteers to rescue and rehabilitate about 150,000 injured or orphaned animals over the years. Now, the rehab center faces a double disaster. Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the sanctuary hard. The first storm’s floodwaters surged into the Straights’ home within minutes. Although Gail Straight stayed put during Helene, she was forced to evacuate ahead of Milton. As for the animals, most were evacuated before Hurricane Helene, including multiple 100-pound tortoises. Despite the owners' efforts, they lost some animals to the storms. 'It got really scary pretty quick,' Gail Straight said. 'It's the fastest I've ever seen it. We’ve had hurricanes here before, but not like this one.' Helene’s flooding destroyed thousands of dollars worth of food and equipment. Mold took over the sanctuary, and Gail was electrocuted while trying to move appliances when the floodwaters started to recede. The couple also lost two cars. Now, they don’t know if or when they’ll be able to rebuild. After dedicating more than 30 years to rescuing animals for free, the ordeal could put Gail Straight into lifelong debt, she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/florida-hurricanes-helene-milton-animal-wildlife-inc-sanctuary/	2024-10-15T06:22:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/ECA63689D66F794B02C3DFD38B7A9D7B.jpg?w=900
Massive meat recall includes hundreds of products sold at Walmart...	(NEXSTAR) — Check your fridge and freezer: A massive meat recall linked to possible listeria contamination has impacted hundreds of ready-to-eat meals sold at major grocery store chains across the U.S., including Walmart, Trader Joe's and Target. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released an updated list of affected products, some featuring popular brand names like Dole, Taylor Farms, Great Value and Michelina's. The recall, initiated by BrucePac, involves more than 9.9 million pounds of pre-cooked meat and poultry items that were produced from June 19, 2024, to October 8, 2024. Major home improvement retailer files for bankruptcy, announces sale plans The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service discovered the issue during routine testing, when Listeria monocytogenes was found in poultry samples. Subsequent testing traced the source of the bacteria back to BrucePac’s ready-to-eat chicken. The affected products were shipped to distributors across the country and later reached restaurants and other food service providers. They appeared in a variety of items, from frozen dinners to pre-made salads. Photos provided by USDA Aside from Walmart, Trader Joe's and Target, some other retailers affected by the recall include: 7-Eleven, Albertson's, Aldi, Amazon Fresh, H-E-B, Kroger, Meijer, Publix, and Save Mart.

Man arrested outside Trump rally says it's 'all false allegations...	(NewsNation) — Vem Miller, the Las Vegas man arrested Saturday for possessing multiple guns and fake press passes outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump, tells 'Dan Abrams Live' he had no such things on him. 'I didn't have fake passports. They were valid passports. I didn't have fake IDs. That's a false accusation,' Miller said. A self-proclaimed 'kindergarten kid when it comes to guns,' Miller said he was stopped and arrested because gun laws vary from Nevada to California. 'I've never owned guns in in California. I've owned guns in Nevada. And in Nevada, you're allowed to have the mag loaded up in the gun. Apparently, in California, they have to be separated,' he said. Who is Vem Miller, man arrested outside Trump rally? While that legal difference is true, NewsNation's Jesse Weber pointed out that whether the guns were loaded or not, bringing a weapon to a former president's rally after two previous attempts on his life would be reasonable cause for law enforcement concern. Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures while walking onstage for a campaign rally on October 12, 2024 in Coachella, California.Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Calhoun Ranch in Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024. Miller, a registered Republican, pointed to police misconduct and his own past as the founder of 'The America Happens Network,' which he claims has gotten him some death threats for 'exposing corruption.' 'Are you saying that you were specifically targeted by the sheriff in law enforcement, or that you were picked up for a reason or being made a scapegoat?' Weber asked. 'I'm being made whatever you call it, a targeted scapegoat. But nothing they did is lawful. I did not do anything that they were claiming I did,' Miller responded. What we know about arrest outside Trump’s California rally He reportedly claims to be a sovereign citizen, an anti-government group that Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco associated with him during a Sunday news conference. Miller also pointed to reports of his release on a $5,000 bond Sunday as false, telling NewsNation 'there was never a bail in the situation at all, whatsoever.' Multiple outlets, including USA Today and Fox News, reported his bail release. Federal agencies said the Republican nominee 'was not in any danger' at the event, and have not released any further information about pursuing higher charges against Miller. Miller, however, has promised a lawsuit against those who arrested him. 'The sheriff is going to be investigated, is going to lose his position,' he said. 'The deputy sheriff that was part of this is going to be investigated, is going to lose his position. There's going to be a massive lawsuit.' Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco also joined 'Dan Abrams Live' on Tuesday, saying his agency did all it needed to do to prevent any violence at the former's president's rally. New suits filed Monday accuse Diddy of sexual assault On Sunday, Bianco told a room full of media: 'If you are asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that stopped the third assassination attempt.' Federal agencies haven't announced any movements to classify Miller's arrest as a third assassination attempt, as Trump wasn't even at the rally when the arrest happened. It's something Bianco told NewsNation he can 'understand ... in a factual perspective and context.' 'I believe that they are still going to be looking into Mr. Miller and why he could have been there, or making sure it was legitimate,' Bianco said. 'But we are outside of their investigation, and ours was strictly the stop with the guns, and that's what we arrested him for.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

All my deputy knows is at the inner perimeter, he has a man showing up with firearms who has multiple IDs, multiple passports with different names and a vehicle that is not registered to anyone, with fake papers,' Bianco explained.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/vem-miller-trump-rally-interview/	2024-10-14T19:48:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/C86EB0FC4CE357E13D9CEEAF4F036D88.jpg?w=900
Detroit police officer killed in shootout with other officers	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — An officer with the Detroit Police Department is dead and two others are injured after a mental health call turned into a shootout. Around 2:26 p.m. Monday, DPS got a 911 call for a 'suicide in progress' on East Davison Service Drive and Saint Aubin Street in Detroit. The caller was identified as a member of the DPS Special Response Team, who was off-duty. He was threatening suicide and 'asking for suicide by cop,' according to Police Chief James E. White. Responding officers heard shots and White said the suspect was shooting in the air. The officers retreated and took cover behind a vehicle. The suspect shot the back of the vehicle multiple times, hitting two officers, one in the leg and one in the thigh. Whitehall buys $49,000 drone as privacy questions linger One of the officers returned fire, killing the suspect. White called it a 'very tragic situation.' 'He was struggling with a mental crisis. Tragically, we are not immune to mental crisis, we’re just like everyone else. Our officers deal with this every single day,' White said at a news conference. He said the 45-year-old man who died had been suffering with a 'very serious degenerative condition' and had returned to work just over a week earlier, after working on a restricted schedule due to his illness. He had been working with the department for 13 years. The two officers who were shot were in stable condition, according to White. The mayor noted their injuries were not life-threatening. Murder trial of man in Cash App founder's death begins Detroit Mayor Mike Duggin commended the courage of the responding officers. 'It’s a reminder of the courage that the officers of this department show every day. They went to that scene knowing they were going to be confronted by a highly trained and armed officer in the department who was having a significant mental issue,' Duggin said. Grief counseling will be made available and White said the department will work with the families involved to 'make sure they get what they need.' Michigan State Police is handling the investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/detroit-police-officer-killed-in-shootout-with-other-officers/	2024-10-14T18:23:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Detroit-Police-Department-030420.jpg?w=650
With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings?	(NewsNation) — High savings rates have been a bright spot in the recent interest rate environment but with the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates further, savers are likely to see their returns dip. Last month, the Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate for the first time in over four years and additional rate cuts are expected. Further cuts could mean lower rates on mortgages, car loans and credit cards, but also lower returns for savers who have been able to get 4% to 5% on their cash in recent years. But even if yields on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) drop, they'll still be attractive saving options for many. Is now the time to lock in a good CD rate? 'It may not be as much as you were getting pre-rate cut, but it's still a lot more than you would have if you just left (your money) in something that's not going to yield as much interest,' said Elizabeth Ayoola, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the national average annual percentage yield (APY) on savings accounts was 0.46% as of 09/16/2024. By comparison, the best high-yield savings accounts have APYs that are about ten times higher. Here's what to know about falling interest rates and your savings. Are high-yield savings accounts still a good idea? High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) are like traditional savings accounts, except they pay a higher interest rate which means your money grows faster. That will still be true even if the Fed cuts rates further. 'I don't think high-yield savings accounts ever become 'unattractive,'' Ayoola said. 'They are evergreen in the sense that they usually offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts do.' As it stands now, several banks are offering HYSAs with APYs between 4% and 5%. Over a year that can mean much better returns than a traditional savings account: $10,000 in a traditional savings account at 0.46% APY Interest earned: $46 $10,000 in a HYSA at 5.0% APY Interest earned: $500 Unlike investments in stocks or bonds, HYSAs are essentially risk-free. Just make sure you're using an FDIC-insured bank, which protects your money up to $250,000. The other benefit of a HYSA is liquidity. You can pull out or transfer money without penalty, which makes it a popular place for savers to keep their emergency fund. Do I have to pay taxes on my high-yield savings account? The main caveat is that HYSA interest rates can change at any time, so your return could be lower tomorrow than it is today. Another thing to keep in mind: HYSAs typically offer better rates than brick-and-mortar bank accounts but if you want to build wealth, investing in the stock market provides higher average returns. 'It's not recommended that you put tons of money in a high-yield savings account. Usually, it's used for things like an emergency fund or a short-term goal,' Ayoola said. Don't forget, the interest you earn from your HYSA will get taxed so prepare to fork over some of those returns to Uncle Sam. Are certificates of deposit (CDs) a better option? Unlike HYSAs, which have interest rates that fluctuate, certificates of deposit (CDs) allow savers to lock in a fixed rate for a set period. The downside is that your money is tied up for the duration of the CD. With interest rates likely to fall in the coming months, CDs are one way to guarantee a return at today's rates. As of late September, the median APY on a 6-month CD was 4.55%, down from 5.00% in January, according to NerdWallet. The rate on a 1-year CD was slightly better, 4.60%. The math works out like this: A $10,000 deposit on a 6-month CD at 4.55%: You are guaranteed a return of roughly $225 after six months. A $10,000 deposit on a 1-year CD at 4.60%: You are guaranteed a return of $460 after one year. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits Whether CDs are better than a HYSA will depend on your financial goals. CDs offer less liquidity and generally have penalties for early withdrawals, meaning it's harder to access your funds in a pinch. Then again, if you know you won't need the money for several months, CDs offer a stable return while HYSA yields could drop. 'If — and when — rates do drop as fed cuts continue, you'll still have the same rate locked in,' Ayoola said. 'At the moment, short-term CDs are still relatively attractive.' What about the stock market? High-yield savings accounts and CDs are low-risk options compared to stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cryptocurrency but they potentially come with less upside. The S&amp;P 500 is up 34% over the past year and nearly 23% year to date. Historically, the average annual return on the stock market is around 10% per year, significantly higher than the typical HYSA yield. The bottom line is that HYSAs are savings accounts, not investments. They are a stable option for those hoping to earn interest on cash that might otherwise be sitting dormant in a traditional bank account but they aren't intended to hyperdrive your retirement savings.

'Consumers could put money needed for a medium-term goal in a CD and then they could put money for an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account,' she said. 'It doesn't have to be either or.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/interest-rates-falling-savings/	2024-10-14T14:41:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/6446a16b9873b3.00956252.jpeg?w=900
New suits filed Monday accuse Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual assaul...	This article mentions sexual assault. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673. (NewsNation) — Six lawsuits were filed Monday against music producer and rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs that allege he sexually assaulted two men and two women between 1995 and 2021. These suits were filed anonymously in the Southern District of New York. Among them is one by a man who says he was a minor at the time of the assault. 'Defendant Sean Combs routinely recruited individuals to parties, drugged them, and then sexually exploited them,' according to a complaint. A lawsuit filed by a man from North Carolina states Combs was talking to him about the music industry when he ordered the then 16-year-old to drop his pants. 'Don’t you want to break into the business?' the lawsuit alleges Combs asked him. Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Then, the lawsuit said, Combs grabbed and began feeling the teenager's genitals. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani tells 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that if the accusations made by a minor against Diddy were included in his federal indictment, much of his defense’s argument about consenting relations between adults would go out the window. But that's only if these civil suits influence the trial — which Rahmani said would only happen if the victims come forward and testify. Monday’s suits were filed by Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, who previously said he’s representing 120 people who’ve experienced sexual misconduct by Combs. 'There’s an overarching theme here, as you probably can see, which is basically Sean Combs feels like he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it,' Buzbee said in an interview with NBC News before filing the documents. In addition to multiple civil suits filed, the first being one by Combs’ ex-girlfriend Cassandra 'Cassie' Ventura, the producer is also criminally charged with sex trafficking and racketeering. A grand jury indicted Combs, who is now being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn despite attempts by his defense attorneys to get him freed on bail. NewsNation has reached out to a representative for Combs. Erica Wolff, Combs’ lawyer, said in a previous statement to NewsNation that the rap mogul 'cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a reckless media circus.' 'That said, Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors,' Wolff said in a statement. Another suit filed Monday alleges Combs raped a woman when she was a college freshman in a locked hotel room in 2004. Combs, the lawsuit said, invited the woman, identified as 'Jane Doe,' and a friend to a party there, where he gave them drinks and told them to snort cocaine. The woman said in the lawsuit that Combs forced her friend to perform oral sex on him and threatened to have them both killed if they didn’t do what he wanted. Diddy accuser’s lawyer: Combs used oil, knife In a different lawsuit, a separate Jane Doe says Combs attacked her in the bathroom at a 2005 party celebrating the late rapper Biggie Smalls’ music video, 'One More Chance.' Combs, according to the lawsuit, brought the woman into the bathroom and started kissing her. The woman tried to pull away, she said, but he slammed her head against the wall, and she fell to the floor. When she tried to get away, Combs hit her and raped her, the woman says. After, Combs allegedly told her not to tell anyone, 'or you will disappear.' A man identified as John Doe said that Combs gave him an alcoholic drink at his white party in 2006 that he believes included a drug that made him sick. Then, the lawsuit said, Combs pushed John Doe into a van and sexually assaulted him. Other incidents detailed in lawsuits include a man stating he was forced to give Combs oral sex in a Macy’s stockroom in Manhattan’s Herald Square, as well as one where a man says the producer gave him a drugged beverage. At one point, the man, who says multiple men assaulted him, saw Combs naked above him, according to the lawsuit.

Dad accused of fatally shooting man found with missing child	LONOKE COUNTY, Ark. (KARK) – Officials in Arkansas said a man is facing a murder charge after a confrontation turned deadly early Tuesday morning. According to authorities, deputies with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office responded to a home shortly after 1 a.m. after a juvenile was reported missing. The deputies were told on the way to the home that Aaron Spencer, the father of the juvenile, had found the juvenile in a car with Michael Fosler, according to officials. Authorities said there was an altercation between the two men which led to Fosler being shot. Officials said Fosler was pronounced dead at the scene. Man accused of threatening FEMA workers with assault rifle Deputies said they took Spencer into custody on a preliminary charge of first-degree murder, and he was taken to the Lonoke County Detention Center. As of Monday, no formal charges have been filed against Spencer, and no additional details have been released. A woman claiming to be Spencer's wife claimed they had a no-contact order for Fosler, accusing him of stalking their child. In an online fundraiser, the woman said Spencer began driving around to search for their child after discovering she was missing. She explained that her husband happened to pass a man driving with their child in his vehicle and chased him. 'The chase ended in an accident. Aaron was able to retrieve our child alive, but in the process, he was attacked and did what he had to do to protect himself and our minor child,' the woman wrote. US soldier given 14-year sentence for plotting to help ISIS She added that they are working to 'retain a legal team' to help keep her husband, a combat veteran, 'home with us where he belongs.' 'We are private people, so all of this being public has been very difficult,' she wrote on Facebook last week. Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley told USA Today that Fosler, the man who was killed, was arrested earlier this summer for internet stalking of a child and sexual assault, but was out on bond. He added that his agency was investigating what led to the Oct. 8 incident.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/arkansas-dad-accused-fatally-shooting-man/	2024-10-14T11:50:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1801085827.jpg?w=724
Who is Vem Miller, man arrested outside Trump rally?	(NewsNation) — Over the weekend, authorities in Riverside County, California, stopped an armed man outside a rally for former President Donald Trump.

6 jurors seated so far in Delphi murders trial	ALLEN COUNTY, Ind. – Six people have been chosen to sit on the jury in the Delphi murders trial after jury selection began Monday in Allen County. What to know ahead of the Delphi murders trial Richard Allen faces four counts of murder in connection with the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German. (Credit: Family) Around 300 summons were sent to prospective Allen County jurors. Eventually, 12 jurors and four alternates will be selected. The three-day process of culling the jury pool began in Allen County on Monday. During the proceedings, six jurors were seated. Six additional potential jurors were excluded, including one individual who claimed to have psychic abilities. Six jury seats remain open, as do positions for four alternates. The jury will be sequestered for up to a month as it decides Allen’s fate. During Monday's proceedings, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland told prospective jurors that Allen is the 'Bridge Guy' who killed the girls and whose image was widely seen in a grainy still taken from Libby German's phone. Richard Allen Mugshot - Oct. 13, 2024 The prosecution said an unspent round found next to the bodies matches a gun owned by Allen. The state also said Allen has confessed dozens of times. Defense attorney Bradley Rozzi said Allen made those confessions under duress. He also suggested infighting between federal and local law enforcement left some evidence unanalyzed. The prosecution seemed to indicate it may not have conclusive DNA or phone data or weapon evidence. The defense appeared to lay the groundwork to keep Allen off the witness stand.

Georgia sheriff calls deputies after Burger King got order wrong	(NewsNation) — A Georgia sheriff up for reelection in his county was seen on body camera videos asking his deputies for help after Burger King got his order wrong. The footage from March 4, 2023, was obtained by WSB-TV last week and was also posted on Facebook by the sheriff's opponent in the upcoming election, David Cavender. It shows deputies responding to a Burger King in Mableton and approaching Cobb County Sheriff Craig Owens Sr., who is in his truck. 'Hey, do me a favor,' Owens told one deputy in the video. 'I need to get, all I need is the owner name of whoever owns this damn facility or the manager.' Referring to a passenger in the vehicle, Owens says, 'I wanted her a Whopper, no mayo, cut in half, right?' He then says he doesn't need his money back, but to 'find out who owns this place so I can do an official complaint.' Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Employees locked themselves inside the restaurant but opened the doors for the three deputies. A deputy told the assistant manager that 'nobody is in trouble. We just want to get some names' and that there wouldn't be a report written. After getting the name of the manager and the company that owns that Burger King location, the deputy brought this information to Owens. Mike Dondelinger, who is running for chief deputy with Cavender, called Owens' actions an 'abuse of power' as well as a waste of resources. 'I’m shocked the sheriff feels so flippant about this issue that he would have deputies run lights and sirens, placing citizens at risk and his deputies at risk, just so he could get information from a business owner that clearly could have been followed up on another day,' Dondelinger said. Medicare open enrollment begins Tuesday However, Owens characterized what happened in the video as a 'business dispute call.' 'The type of call referenced in the video is a business dispute call. This is a call that ANY citizen can make, and law enforcement will respond,' Owens said Friday in a statement posted to Facebook. Owens said he was not in uniform during the incident and went through the drive-thru as a regular patron. 'At no point did I indicate my position, nor did I ask the responders to do anything that they would not, had not, or have not done for anyone else who makes a business dispute call,' Owens said. While Owens said the call is 'being politicized' by Cavender to win votes, he apologized. 'Whether as a Command Sergeant Major, or a major in the Cobb Police Department, or as sheriff, I have always worked to build confidence and trust in leadership,' Owens said in the statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/georgia-sheriff-deputies-wrong-order-burger-king/	2024-10-14T07:56:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/police-lights-e1707156650724.jpg?w=800

Florida aims to fix hurricane-caused power outages by Tuesday	(NewsNation) — Nearly a week after Hurricane Milton left a trail of destruction in Florida, power should be restored to all residents by Tuesday night, according to state and utility company officials. President Joe Biden visited the hard-hit areas of Saint Petersburg and Saint Pete Beach on Sunday, where he announced $600 million of aid after Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Residents face an uphill battle as they rebuild from the back-to-back storms that devastated Florida communities. Aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Biden is on the way as many locals struggle with debris, power outages and fuel shortages. What $35 trillion in US national debt means for Americans Restoring electricty after Helene, Milton Power restoration efforts are progressing, but more than 400,000 Floridians remained in the dark as of 9 a.m. ET Monday, according to poweroutage.us. Electricity has been restored to 3.25 million customers by crews working around the clock with help from out-of-state teams, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Duke Energy and Florida Power &amp; Light both said they expect to have power restored to nearly all customers in all impacted areas by Tuesday night, except for those in areas heavily damaged by flooding, tornadoes or storm surge. Biden also announced $612 million in funding to strengthen the power grid, with $94 million earmarked for Florida. Both state and federal leaders are pushing to restore full power as quickly as possible. Fetterman unworried by tight Pennsylvania race Gasoline shortages Fuel shortages remain a critical challenge as long lines persist at the few operating gas stations in the hardest-hit areas. About a quarter of all of the nearly 7,900 gas stations in the state of Florida didn't have gas or power Thursday. Damage to a pair of major fuel ports in the area created the largest barriers to fuel. Port Tampa Bay's fuel terminals lost power after Hurricane Milton, which prevented fuel distribution to the community. Power had been restored to all seven private fuel terminals as of Friday. The state has also set up free fuel distribution sites in Bradenton, St. Petersburg and Plant City, offering up to 10 gallons per vehicle. For many, those free fuel stations have been a lifeline, helping families stay connected and mobile during the crisis. DeSantis said more sites will open soon and additional fuel is on the way via the Tampa shipping port. Debris cleanup Debris removal could take up to a year, despite the nearly 3,000 workers assisting with cleanup, DeSantis said. Biden has approved 100% federal reimbursement for those efforts for 90 days. 'The (removal of) debris has to be 24/7 over this 90-day period,' DeSantis said while speaking next to a pile of furniture, lumber and other debris in Treasure Island, an island city near St. Petersburg that has been battered by both recent hurricanes. 'That’s the way you get the job done.'

Hurricane Helene victims vow to rebuild and return	(NewsNation) — One couple lost the Asheville, N.C. business they spent ten years building. Another became instantly homeless when part of their apartment complex along the Swannanoa River was swept away. All four are alive and thinking about rebuilding their lives – and processing what happened. 'It was terrifying,' Jacqueline Twohig told 'NewsNation Prime' about the flooding river that destroyed two buildings of the riverfront apartment complex in which they lived. 'At first we thought it was going to be just a little flooding in the apartment,' she said. That notion quickly changed when she and her husband, Doug Frieders, saw the water covering the 20-foot stilts on which the complex’s buildings sit. New tropical disturbance pops up in the Atlantic, NHC monitoring 'We got out as fast as we could,' which means scaling a cement barrier on the complex and then walking through ankle-deep water to their car. Todd and Megan Walsh didn’t have to run for their lives, but they quickly realized how different their lives would be when they returned to Asheville to find their business, Atomic Furnishing and Design, destroyed. 'This is our dream business,' said Todd Walsh. 'We started from nothing, and we built it to this point, and it's kind of unreal that it's gone. It's hard to look at the pictures of what it was like before, and now seeing what it's like.' 'The day we saw the river over top of our store, we knew immediately it was gone,' said Megan Walsh. 'We immediately started thinking, okay, we need to secure a new space,' for not just their business but the dozens of vendors who occupied the space, she said. Still recovering from Helene, SC county rattled by cluster of 8 earthquakes 'Most of our vendors are week-to-week, month-to-month. We care about them greatly. Their kids come into our stores. They play with our children. And so our main priority and focus right now is to find a new, secure, new place and get back to business as soon as possible,' she added. Meanwhile, Twohig and Frieders are not only dealing with the loss of their home but the fact that two of their neighbors were killed when two of the apartment complex’s six buildings were washed away. 'The survival guilt is immense,' she said. 'It just feels awful. We knew them. We saw them every single day. Had we known that this was going to be the case, that the apartment was going to fully collapse, we would have gone banging on doors.' FEMA makes ‘operational adjustments’ following safety concerns in North Carolina Jacqueline Twohig and Doug Frieders have set up a GoFundMe page and so have the Walshs to help their neighbors, vendors and friends to rebuild and return. 'We are, 100%, going back to Asheville,' said Twohig. 'We want to help rebuild. Asheville is a wonderful city. We love it. We love the mountains. We love the art. We love everything there,' she added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/hurricane-helene-victims-vow-rebuild-return/	2024-10-13T19:46:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/83220109_1728399582493092_r.jpeg?w=900
What we know about arrest outside Trump’s California rally	(NewsNation) — The Las Vegas man arrested Saturday for possessing multiple guns and fake press passes outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump never made it inside while Trump was there, an official said Sunday. The man was released on a $5,000 bail on Sunday, less than a day after his arrest. Federal agencies said the Republican nominee 'was not in any danger' at the event and the incident is under investigation. In a Sunday press conference, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a noted supporter of Trump, addressed the media and discussed safety measures taken at the event in Coachella, California. Man arrested outside of Trump's SoCal rally on gun charges Man arrested outside Trump rally Authorities stopped 49-year Vem Miller at a checkpoint outside the Coachella, California, rally just one minute before it was scheduled to start on Saturday. Trump was not yet at the venue. Bianco said Miller presented fake VIP and press presses at the sheriff's office's inner checkpoint, leading to a further search of his vehicle. That vehicle was unregistered and had a homemade license plate that Bianco said could connect him to the anti-government 'Sovereign Citizen' extremist movement. Inside Miller's black SUV was a shotgun, a loaded handgun and a high-capacity magazine along with his fake entry passes. Miller had already successfully passed through an outer checkpoint and gave officials 'all indications that he belonged there,' Bianco clarified. The outer perimeter was not manned by Riverside deputies. Trump says national abortion ban is ‘off the table,’ but ‘we’ll see what happens’ Riverside County Sheriff’s Office personnel took Miller into custody and transferred him to the John J. Benoit Detention Center, where he was released on Sunday on $5,000 bail. Miller is a registered Republican in Nevada, a fact which Bianco said he 'couldn't care less' about. 'It’s fringe one way or the other, I couldn’t care less,' Bianco said. 'It's people trying to do harm, and thank God we prevented it.' Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Calhoun Ranch in Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024.Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures while walking onstage for a campaign rally on October 12, 2024 in Coachella, California. Sheriff: Deputies 'probably' prevented assassination attempt Previous reporting cited Bianco as saying the incident was 'probably' a third assassination attempt on the former president, a statement he echoed after some back-and-forth during Sunday's press conference. 'I will be honest with you, I don’t remember saying that, but it certainly would be something that I did say,' he told a reporter, instead focusing on the prevention of any potential bloodshed. 'I certainly wouldn’t want to be saying, after the fact, that I wish we would have done something to prevent that shooting. And there is absolutely no way that any of us are going to truly know what was in [Miller's] head,' Bianco said, adding that 'it’s all going to be speculation.' Few Americans believe Donald Trump will concede election: Poll Minutes later, Bianco changed his tune again, saying: 'If you are asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that stopped the third assassination attempt.' He clarified that the FBI and United States Secret Service would have to lead the investigation classifying Saturday's arrest as an assassination attempt. Neither organization has done so. 'From my perspective … the firearms charges is what we arrested him for and booked him on. Anything further will come from the federal government and, quite frankly, I don’t know if we will be a part of that,' Bianco said. 'Trump was not in any danger': Federal officials The U.S. Attorney's Office released the following statement just minutes after the press conference concluded: 'The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI are aware of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office’s arrest on Saturday. The U.S. Secret Service assesses that the incident did not impact protective operations and former President Trump was not in any danger. While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI extend their gratitude to the deputies and local partners who helped ensure the safety of last night’s events.' Attempts on Trump's life The arrest comes as multiple high-profile attempts of violence against the former president have taken place during the heated election cycle. On July 13, Trump was grazed in the ear by a bullet coming from the gun of 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. Crooks was shot and killed by a member of the Secret Service. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, is currently being prosecuted on gun charges after he hid out near a Florida golf course in an alleged attempt to have a clean shot at the former president and current Republican presidential nominee on Sept. 15.
