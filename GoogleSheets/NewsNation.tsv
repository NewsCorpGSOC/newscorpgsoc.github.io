Trump vows to seize money from migrant gangs, cartels	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump vowed to seize money and assets from criminal migrant gangs and the cartels, saying he would give it to the victims of crimes committed by people in the U.S. illegally. 'We're going to get them out fast. We're going to get them out,' Trump said. 'I'm announcing that for the first time under my administration, we are seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartelsand we will use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime, and the government will help in the restoration.' The former president announced his plan as the cartels continued to get richer. Tren de Aragua’s footprint increasing in the US 'Something had to be done,' Trump said. Cartels: A $13 billion industry The deputy director of ICE testified to Congress that back in 2018, the criminal cartels were making roughly $500 million annually. The primary funding source was moving drugs illegally into the U.S. Now, as they smuggle drugs and people, the cartels are reportedly a $13 billion industry annually, according to Congress. That is a 2,500 percent increase from 2018. Every person who is smuggled has to pay a fee to the cartels, and because of President Joe Biden's executive action, it is tougher to get people into the country. Because of this, the cartel makes sure every single person pays. Groups coming across in the Eagle Pass area right are being found with color-coordinated bracelets for the first time in this sector. It's something the border has only historically seen in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Law enforcement believes the cartels are using the bracelets to identify people who have paid. No bracelet means no crossing. Alabama governor deploys over 100 soldiers to southern border Most migrants reportedly pay about $3,000 to $5,000 to the cartels for help in crossing the border. Some undocumented migrants from special interest countries have reportedly paid upwards of $15,000. What happens to seized funds, assets? The DEA claims the cartels are present in all 50 states and are not flying under the radar. When cartels are caught, any funds seized are deposited into the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, an account with the Department of Treasury. The Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture administers the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which was established in 1992, according to a 2023 report from the Treasury Department. Money deposited into this fund is used for several initiatives, including to pay state and local law enforcement agencies that helped seize the funds, compensate victims where the seized assets represent the proceeds of fraud schemes and cover the operating costs of maintaining the fund, according to the report. In 2023, over $800 million was in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Last year, CBP seized more than $53 million in undeclared or illicit currency, which can be proceeds from alleged illicit activity or currency that funds transnational criminal organizations, federal data showed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/trump-seize-money-migrant-gangs-cartels/	2024-10-30T08:36:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181215235.jpg?w=900
Harris 'strongly disagrees' with Biden calling Trump supporters '...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris says she 'strongly disagrees' with criticizing people based on who they vote. Her comments come one day after President Joe Biden called former President Donald Trump’s supporters 'garbage.' 'I believe the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not,' Harris told reporters before reporters before heading to North Carolina for a campaign event. 'And as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. That’s my responsibility and that’s the kind of work that I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously.' The back-and-forth name-calling began during a weekend Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, where a comedian and guest speaker called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden responded Tuesday saying: 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.' He later clarified the statement on social media. 'Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,' Biden said. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.' This story is developing.

Harris to visit three battleground states where Trump has slight ...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is campaigning Wednesday in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — key states where Trump maintains a narrow lead with less than a week left until Election Day. Latest poll numbers have the candidates nearly deadlocked in Pennsylvania, where Harris’ ground campaign has been highly organized, well-funded and thorough. A Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) national forecast Wednesday morning predicts that former President Donald Trump has a 54% chance of winning. Harris makes closing argument to voters on National Mall Harris on the campaign trail She’ll begin her day in North Carolina before heading to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and ending her day in Wisconsin. All three are strategic swing states and Pennsylvania is the most crucial for both campaigns. Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes — the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican presidential candidate by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Wednesday marks the vice president’s first trip to Harrisburg. So far, she’s spent much time in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the state and visited Philadelphia earlier this week. How is Harris performing in key swing states? Trump maintained a slight lead over Harris Tuesday in Pennsylvania. That’s according to the latest forecasts from NewsNation’s partners Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and The Hill, which predict Trump has a 52% chance of winning in the Keystone State. DDHQ also forecasts that Trump will outperform Harris in North Carolina and Wisconsin, with 65% and 55% chances of victory, respectively.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-pennsylvania-north-carolina-wisconsin/	2024-10-30T05:42:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24293048178340-e1729364377105.jpg?w=900
Trump, Harris host dueling rallies in North Carolina ahead of ele...	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris head to North Carolina Wednesday to share their final arguments with voters in the Tar Heel State during dueling rallies ahead of the 2024 election. Trump is expected to spotlight the nation's economy and housing crisis while Harris is anticipated to encourage residents to vote early and keep the enthusiasm surrounding her campaign electric. As of Monday morning, the race between Trump and Harris remained a toss-up with the former president leading Harris by just 1.4 points, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Democrats have a chance to flip the Republican-leaning state blue even though North Carolina has voted red in 10 of the last 11 races. Former President Barack Obama won the Tar Heel State in 2008 and was the first Democrat to do so in nearly three decades. Dead-even presidential race in NC A dead-heat race and an opportunity for Democrats is leading to dueling rallies on Wednesday as Harris is also expected to stump in North Carolina. The two rallies are scheduled at roughly the same time, just located about an hour from each other. The Harris campaign said it believes it has the enthusiasm on its side, while Trump's team said it's looking to cut through that and solidify Trump's lead in the battleground state. North Carolina is one of seven swing states that could sway this year's election. It's another state that has seen another record turnout from early voting. Preliminary data reveals about 3.2 million people in the state have already voted, which is over one-third of the state's registered voters. 475 ballots retrieved from burned drop box in Washington state: Auditor Helene influencing election turnout A new survey found that Hurricane Helene is also playing a role for some voters as they head to the ballot box. The survey released this week by Elon University found that Helene galvanized them, and many voters were motivated to get out to polling sites in part by the federal response to the state's widespread damage. Trump and some Republicans have looked to sow frustration with the response, falsely claiming that nobody from the federal government was helping residents after the storm. FEMA and the White House pushed back on those comments, reassuring there were boots on the ground helping those affected by Helene. Still, the poll found that 20% of voters said they were more likely to vote because of Helene.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-rallies-north-carolina/	2024-10-30T04:47:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6712f380747eb4.31583800.jpeg?w=900
Biden suggests Trump supporters are 'garbage' after comic's insul...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden took a swipe against Donald Trump's supporters on Tuesday as he reacted to the Republican presidential nominee's weekend rally at Madison Square Garden, which was overshadowed by crude and racist rhetoric. In a call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino, Biden responded to a comic at Trump's rally who called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden's initial comments were garbled. 'Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something, I don’t, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know, the Puerto Rico where I’m fr -- in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent honorable people,' he said. The president then added: 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.' White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden 'referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’' Biden then took to social media to personally clarify what he said. 'Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,' he posted on X. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.' In referring to Trump's supporters as 'garbage,' however, Biden's tone was at odds with the message that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is seeking to present as she aims to cast a broad appeal, including to disaffected Republicans. Shortly after Biden's comments, Harris spoke from the Ellipse in Washington, vowing to be a president who would unite the country. 'I pledge to be a president for all Americans,' said Harris, who is Biden's vice president. Republicans quickly highlighted Biden's remark. Trump called up Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during his rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to recount what happened. 'Moments ago Joe Biden stated that our supporters, our patriots, are garbage,' Rubio said. 'He’s talking about everyday Americans who love their country.' Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a subsequent statement, 'There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him.' A Trump campaign fundraising text declared, 'KAMALA’S BOSS JOE BIDEN JUST CALLED ALL MY SUPPORTERS GARBAGE!' before ensuring recipients that Trump himself thinks, 'YOU ARE AMAZING!' Even some prominent Democrats began distancing themselves from Biden's comments. Speaking on CNN, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he would 'never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn't support.' The comments recalled then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton dismissing Trump supporters during a 2016 fundraiser in New York by saying that half would fit into a ' basket of deplorables.' Clinton later called that characterization 'grossly generalistic.' But it became a defiant rallying cry for many Trump backers who said the insult encapsulated the elitist attitudes of Clinton and the Democrats. As reactions to Biden's reaction began to fly, meanwhile, Trump was asked in an interview Tuesday night with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity about the racist and vulgar joke at his New York rally. He responded: 'Somebody said there was a comedian that joked about Puerto Rico or something. And I have no idea who he is.' The former president added, 'I can’t imagine it’s a big deal.' At a rally Tuesday in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a city with a large Hispanic population, Trump repeated his claim that Biden's immigration policies have allowed other countries to treat the U.S. like 'a giant garbage can.' With Election Day now just a week off, Biden has worked to maintain relevance, furiously promoting his administration’s accomplishments while Harris in her race against Trump. But his efforts to remain in the political spotlight might not always be so helpful for the top of the Democratic ticket he’s now promoting. That’s because, while Harris has been sharply critical of Trump for months, repeatedly calling him 'unstable' and 'unhinged' and even suggesting that he was ' fascist,' she has been careful not to decry his supporters. In fact, the vice president has campaigned extensively with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and other former GOP elected officials — hoping to woo conservative crossover voters. The Democratic convention — and Harris ads — have highlighted the stories of everyday Americans who talked about having voted for Trump in the past but now say they are supporting the vice president. On Tuesday’s call, Biden also said that Trump 'doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community' and urged rejection of the former president even as Trump’s campaign says its support is rising among Hispanics, particularly men. 'Vote to keep Donald Trump out of the White House,' Biden said. 'He’s a true danger to, not just Latinos but to all people. Particularly those who are in a minority in this country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-biden-suggests-trump-supporters-are-garbage-after-comics-insult-of-puerto-rico/	2024-10-29T20:04:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6721a07f63ff80.82837425.jpeg?w=900
North Carolina on Election Day: What to expect	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump has won North Carolina in each of the last two elections, but Democrats have been gaining ground, particularly in the major population centers: Mecklenburg and Wake counties. If Harris can improve in those areas, Democrats have a chance to win the state for the first time since Barack Obama in 2008. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout How votes will be counted In North Carolina, the polls close at 7:30 p.m. Counties can start processing mail-in ballots at 5:00 p.m., while some counties with passed measures can begin processing mail-in ballots at 2:00 p.m. on Election Day. While the North Carolina Board of Elections allows for same-day voter registration for early voting — which runs through November 2 — the state does not allow residents to register to vote if they are casting ballots on the day of the general election. To register to vote the same day during early voting, residents must have a state identification number from their state-issued driver’s license or must have proof of the last four digits of their Social Security number. North Carolina Senate race in 2022 In the 2022 U.S. Senate race, Democrat Cheri Beasley took a 20-point lead over Ted Budd when the first batches of votes were released after polls closed. That lead disappeared after about 90 minutes when Budd overtook Beasley in the vote count and went on to win the seat. Mail and early in-person votes accounted for about 59% of all ballots in that election. In statewide elections, the Democratic strongholds are in the Raleigh, Charlotte, Greensboro and Fayetteville areas, while Republicans tend to perform best in the western, eastern and southeastern areas of the state. When Obama carried North Carolina in 2008, he won beyond the safe Democratic areas and picked up an additional 11 counties in what were moderate Republican areas. More than half of those counties may have moved out of reach for Democrats today, as Trump outperformed Biden by double-digit margins in 2020. But that same year, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper picked up Granville, Pasquotank and Scotland counties in his successful reelection bid and reduced the margin in others.

(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly criticized former President Donald Trump's campaign staff as 'dunderheads' for not vetting a comedian who called Puerto Rico an 'island of garbage' during a Sunday rally. O'Reilly, while discussing the Madison Square Garden rally, revealed that Trump 'didn't know that comedian who disparaged all Puerto Ricans' and blamed the incident on poor campaign management. 'He's got a lot of people working for him that are dunderheads. … They're only there because they kiss his butt, and that's not what you want,' O'Reilly said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' However, O'Reilly noted exceptions to his criticism, praising Lara Trump and campaign executive Susie White as 'very powerful' and 'very smart' members of the team. Megyn Kelly: Trump speakers alienating key voters at MSG not ‘smart’ O'Reilly also characterized Vice President Kamala Harris as a 'machine candidate' who 'does what the machine tells her to do' and criticized her campaign's performance, particularly noting that 'she can't answer a question.' 'You think she's got a bunch of geniuses running her campaign? ... You think PhDs are running that operation?' O'Reilly said. What happened at Trump's MSG rally? The event was a surreal spectacle that included former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, billionaire Elon Musk, TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, politicians including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik and an artist who painted a picture of Trump hugging the Empire State Building. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, one of the featured guests at Trump’s New York City event, sparked a furor after referring to Puerto Rico as 'a floating island of garbage,' prompting some members of the GOP, like Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, R-N.Y., who is Puerto Rican, to come out against the remarks. GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally In addition to his remark about Puerto Rico, Hinchcliffe also made a crude joke about Latinos in which he said, 'They love making babies too. Just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They c-- inside. Just like they did to our country.' Hinchcliffe wasn’t the only one who made controversial remarks about different racial and ethnic groups during the rally.

Megyn Kelly: Trump speakers alienating key voters at MSG not 'sma...	(NewsNation) — Megyn Kelly tells 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' she found former President Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally speakers alienated female and Hispanic voters rather than uplifting them. Kelly, a noted Trump supporter who told NewsNation she finds Vice President Kamala Harris 'empty-headed,' thinks that 'there is zero point in offering man after man after man to call her the devil.' She said she doesn't think the rally or its explosive backlash will have an impact on Trump's chances of winning, but there was 'no point' in insulting two major voter pools. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night 'Trump has not won this thing, not by a long shot. You've got to get as many votes as humanly possible.' Kelly said Tuesday. 'And there is absolutely no point in doing or saying anything that would alienate these key voting blocks, including Hispanics and Blacks and women.' NewsNation’s election partner, Decision Desk HQ, shows Trump with a 54% chance of winning and Harris with a 46% chance as of Oct. 29. Kelly expressed disappointment in the speakers chosen for the rally, saying that the Republican men in her life were 'not motivated by, like, racist jokes about Hispanics and Blacks and sexist comments about women.' 'They are capable of so much more than this, and the No. 1 goal was to serve Trump, which they didn't. So whoever actually did screen these remarks, if indeed that's true, ought to be removed from the campaign for the next seven days and just let a grown-up handle this,' she said. What are the swing states for the 2024 election? Kelly clarified that while she believes the GOP nominee will still win the presidential election, the event did him no favors. 'At something like this, you want to be inspired, you might want to laugh, but you don't want to hit below the belt,' she said. 'And above all, do nothing to make your stupid joke, whether you're the comic or one of the supporting acts, the story. Trump needs to be the story.' What happened at Trump's MSG rally? The event was a surreal spectacle that included former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, billionaire Elon Musk, TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, politicians including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps.

Driving the vote: Hispanic voters in Nevada crucial in election	(NewsNation) — The road to the White House in Nevada must include the growing Hispanic vote. In Nevada, as well as bordering Arizona, Latinos make up about 25% of registered voters, who hit the ballot box with a swirl of backgrounds, issues and traditions. To emerge as the successor in the 2024 election, Republican former President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris need to gain approval from the nearly 1 in 4 voters in Nevada who are Hispanic. For example, take Alina Gardner, a realtor who moved to the United States from Cuba as a young girl. She's able to show her listings in English and Spanish. The current odds in every battleground Senate race Gardner is what's called a 'persuadable,' meaning that even though she’s a registered Republican, her vote is not set in stone. 'I get a lot of texts and emails from the Democrats, so I listen to both,' Gardner told NewsNation. 'I'm open to both.' At the same time, while she's willing to vote for a Republican, Gardner doesn't believe Trump should be president 'at his age.' 'As of right now, it's going to be Kamala Harris,' Gardner said. Ivet Aldaba will have her daughters top of mind as she votes this November. The college professor is among the estimated 36 million Latinos eligible to vote this time around nationwide. That’s up from 14 million in the year 2000 — an increase of 153%. 'Having immigrant parents and them not being able to vote — at the time, I felt that civic responsibility even more,' Aldaba said. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout For Aldaba, her reason for voting Democrat is reproductive rights. 'I want my daughters to have a voice, to be able to decide what they can do with their own bodies,' Aldaba said. Meanwhile, retired blackjack dealer David Mendez says when he started showing support for Trump, he lost a lot of friends. He's voting for Trump because of what he says are the culture wars playing out in his casino. Rudy Zamora, of the nonpartisan voter engagement group Chicanos Por La Causa, serves a community that mirrors the country as a whole. There's young voter apathy he sees as well as distrust in election integrity. 'I've heard conversations from my aunts and uncles saying, ‘Oh, back in my country, my vote doesn't really matter,' or 'The election was already bought,'' Zamora said. 'That's not the case here. Every single vote is one vote, one voice, and we have to ensure that our voice is being represented at the polls.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-vote-hispanic-voters-nevada/	2024-10-29T15:59:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/6521e49f957f28.91693881.jpeg?w=900
Pennsylvania on Election Day: What to expect	(NewsNation) — Pennsylvania voters should prepare for potential swings in reported results on election night due to the state's complex vote-counting procedures. With polls closing at 8 p.m. ET, initial results could show significant shifts between candidates as counties report mail-in ballots and Election Day votes at different times throughout the night. State law prohibits counties from processing mail-in ballots before 7 a.m. on Election Day, and results cannot be published until after polls close. This restriction, combined with county-by-county reporting autonomy, means early results may not reflect the outcome. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout Philadelphia election officials have invested in new technology to speed up the count. The city plans to deploy six new mail-in ballot processing machines capable of opening 40,000 envelopes per hour — a significant upgrade from older machines that handled just 3,600 hourly. The 2020 presidential election illustrates the potential for early result fluctuations. President Joe Biden initially led when early votes were counted before former President Donald Trump pulled ahead as Election Day votes were tallied. After all mail-in ballots were counted, Biden ultimately won the state by approximately 80,000 votes. Trump narrowly leads Harris in Pennsylvania: DDHQ Trump maintained a narrow lead over Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday in Pennsylvania. That’s according to the latest forecasts from NewsNation’s partners Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and The Hill, which predict Trump has a 51% chance of winning in the Keystone State. The opposite was true as recently as Oct. 17. The candidates were tied until Trump gained a slight lead on Oct. 21. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Nearly twice as many Democrats than Republicans have voted early in Pennsylvania. Tuesday marks Pennsylvania residents’ last chance to request mail-in or absentee ballots. With more than 1.4 million early ballots cast, Trump and Harris are in a close race that could flip the state. Registered Democrats had returned 849,849 ballots as of Tuesday, compared to the 468,067 that registered Republicans have returned so far, according to state election data. Early voting data, however, only shows a person’s party affiliation — not how they voted. The current odds in every swing state Election officials need to process mail ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. It often takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Trump narrowly carried the state by 0.7% in 2016 but lost his hold on Pennsylvania to Biden in the 2020 election. NewsNation's Katie Smith contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/pennsylvania-election-day/	2024-10-29T15:55:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-1-3.jpg?w=900
Maricopa County has 'zero tolerance' for election crimes	(NewsNation) — The sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County has ensured they are ready for Election Day. The Phoenix-area county came under scrutiny during the 2020 presidential election, as the Arizona Senate launched a publicly-funded investigation into election fraud after President Joe Biden won the state. The claims made by former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters were unfounded. More recently, ballots were damaged in the area — some even destroyed — by an arsonist last Thursday. 'We want to make sure that security is for democracy in this election campaign,' Maricopa County Sheriff Russ Skinner told 'NewsNation Now.' 'We want to make sure that our community feels safe and secure,' he added. When will we know the results of the presidential election? Ballot box arson also occurred in the Pacific Northwest, with votes destroyed in Washington and Oregon on Monday. As for a repeat of 2020, Skinner says they hope it is not the case, but the county is prepared for any possible circumstances. 'This is a process for democracy, and we want to make sure that everybody respects each other, and hopefully nobody's out there doing criminal activity,' Skinner said. 'Are we prepared? Absolutely so. Again, we know that there is some divide amongst the politics involved in this, but I want to make sure that we keep our community safe and secure.' According to Decision Desk HQ polling averages, Trump has a 1.9% lead on Harris in Arizona based on 62 polls.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/maricopa-county-zero-tolerance-election-crimes/	2024-10-29T14:41:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179768105.jpg?w=900

Harris to make closing argument to voters on National Mall	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is delivering her closing message of the campaign, asking Americans to 'turn the page' on the era of former President Donald Trump. Her appearance on the National Mall will be the culmination of messages she's delivered over the course of her campaign. She'll be making the case to voters with a focus on Republican voters who are on the fence about voting for Trump and supporters of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley who aren't sure how to vote. A senior campaign official told NewsNation Harris will be focusing on two very different visions of America. The event is being held in a strategic place in front of the White House for two reasons. When will we know the results of the presidential election? One is to paint a picture of the choice in front of Americans. The second is a reminder of 2021, as she will be giving her speech from the very same spot Trump spoke to his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, just before the riots at the U.S. Capitol. The latest polling from Decision Desk HQ shows the race still neck and neck. As of Tuesday morning, Harris held a 0.8% lead based on 305 polls. Yesterday, it was Harris at 48.5% and Trump at 48%, still well within the margin of error. Some Democratic lawmakers and strategists have said they are concerned that Harris is focusing so much on Trump, taking time away from other major campaign issues like the economy, immigration, health care and abortion. A pro-Harris super PAC called Future Forward has warned that attacking Trump's character or stamina is less effective than Harris highlighting her own policy proposals. Joe Rogan: ‘Hope we can make’ Kamala Harris interview happen Voters have also said they want to hear more about her specific policy plans. Others have said they don't like the fear-mongering and feel it contrasts with her vision of a positive, bright outlook on America. However, the campaign said Harris is choosing to make her closing argument on the National Mall to draw a stark contrast between her and her opponent. 'One of the things I love about the American people is we can hold many thoughts at once,' Harris said on Friday, adding that bringing down costs is a priority in her agenda along with fighting for democracy and the freedom to make decisions about one's own body.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-closing-argument-national-mall/	2024-10-29T11:22:41-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180022822-1.jpg?w=900
Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout	(NewsNation) — Nearly twice as many Democrats than Republicans have voted early in Pennsylvania — a swing state that played a pivotal role in the outcomes of the past two presidential elections. Tuesday marks Pennsylvania residents’ last chance to request mail-in or absentee ballots. With more than 1.4 million early ballots cast, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a close race that could flip the state. Swing state counties to watch on election night Registered Democrats had returned 849,849 ballots as of Tuesday, compared to the 468,067 that registered Republicans have returned so far, according to state election data.

Joe Rogan: 'Hope we can make' Kamala Harris interview happen	(NewsNation) — Podcaster Joe Rogan says he wants to interview Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris after Republican former president Donald Trump appeared on his show, though he rejected requests her team made for conducting one. 'For the record, the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast,' Rogan wrote on X. 'They offered a date for Tuesday, but I would have had to travel to her and they only wanted to do an hour. I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin. My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being. I really hope we can make it happen.' Last week, Reuters reported that Harris was considering talking to Rogan as she tried to garner support with male voters and his audience leans heavily toward young men. 'The Joe Rogan Experience' has millions of followers on Spotify, and the Trump interview had 174,000 likes on X as of Tuesday morning. The current odds in every battleground Senate race However, the news outlet said at the time that while Harris campaign officials met with Rogan's team, an interview had not been confirmed yet. On MSNBC Thursday, Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams said the vice president going on Rogan's podcast 'isn't going to work out right now because of the scheduling of this... period of the campaign.' NewsNation has reached out to Harris' campaign for comment. In his three-hour interview with Rogan, Trump repeated lies about voting, election fraud and his loss in the 2020 presidential election. Trump's running mate, GOP Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is set to sit down for an interview with Rogan on Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the vice presidential nominee's spokesperson told NewsNation.

Here are the states where you can register to vote on Election Da...	(NewsNation) — Americans hoping to cast ballots in next week's general election but have not yet registered to vote can do so on Election Day depending on where they live, although others may be locked out because they missed their state's registration deadline. Twenty-three U.S. states and the District of Columbia provide for same-day voter registration, according to state election guidelines. Yet, in places where residents can wait until November 5 to cast their ballot for former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, state and federal offices, and a host of ballot initiatives after registering to vote when they arrived, the rules vary. Meanwhile, 26 states, including several swing states like Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania still prevent unregistered voters from casting last-minute ballots despite calls to give unregistered voters more time. Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts The only U.S. state where these rules do not apply is North Dakota, where residents are not required to register to vote.

Oklahoma governor encourages residents to vote: 'Absolutely safe'	(NewsNation) — The 2024 election is just one week away, and polling site safety is at the top of voters' minds. Cities across the U.S. have been working to beef up security at polling places, which has been driven by a troubling increase in violent threats toward election workers. Local governments have coordinated with law enforcement to ensure safe voting and implement new security measures at polling locations. Trump boasts about rally amid Puerto Rico joke furor A visible police presence, installing cameras and training poll workers on how to handle disruptive individuals are just a few steps being taken. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt told NewsNation's Markie Martin on 'Morning in America' Tuesday that his state is doing everything possible to keep polling sites safe this upcoming election. ISIS-K orchestrated foiled Election Day terror plot Just weeks ago, an Afghani national was arrested in Oklahoma City, suspected of plotting an Election Day terror attack. Afghan native Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was arrested in early October and accused of planning to target large groups of people on Nov. 5. He told investigators he and a co-conspirator — whose identity has not been released — planned to die as martyrs. Tawhedi first arrived in the United States in September 2021. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, the Oklahoma City resident bought AK-47 rifles, liquidated his family’s assets and purchased one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan, charging documents revealed. His younger brother-in-law was also arrested in connection to the potential attack. Since the arrests, some Senate Republicans have called on the Department of Homeland Security to release more information on the suspects. Stitt told NewsNation he was grateful that law enforcement caught the plot early, saying he had been briefly back in July and August on the potential of their ill intent for the country. 'They don't love America. We need to make sure we know who's coming into our country,' he said, making this situation a border problem and encouraging former President Donald Trump's policies. 'There are people who don't like us very much, and we need to find out who they are,' Stitt continued. Regardless, Stitt said he's grateful they were able to thwart the attack. 5 things to watch for in Harris's speech at the Ellipse Oklahoma election day safety measures Despite the recent election day threat in Oklahoma, Stitt said the state is prepared for voters to go out to the polls safely. '100% you're absolutely safe,' he said. 'We have all law enforcement, all my troopers, all the state law enforcement, are in all 77 counties.' Stitt explained that he has law enforcement agents monitoring all the polling locations and working with the election board to ensure voter safety. 'We'll make sure that all Oklahomans are safe,' Stitt said. However, Stitt warned that enemies of the U.S. want to cause fear and chaos within the country. Stitt encouraged voters to get out and vote and to not let the fear get to them and prevent them from doing their national duty. 'Let's not let someone make us afraid to get out of our homes and go vote,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/oklahoma-voter-safety/	2024-10-29T08:46:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1728615622.jpg?w=900
When will we know the results of the presidential election?	(NewsNation) — Voters will likely not know the outcome of the presidential election come election night or even for days depending on how close the race gets in critical swing states, political experts say. It took nearly five days before the race was called by major news organizations for President Joe Biden in 2020 due in part to states being overwhelmed with increased mail in ballots during the pandemic. Some states have updated laws to help expedite that process to avoid a 2020 repeat, but many others remain on the same timeline, which could still stretch final tallies. 13 Senate races that will determine the balance of power 'While we have a national election, it’s not administered nationally,' Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, told NewsNation. 'Elections are run or conducted at the state and local levels, so that means that we have a lot of variation.' How long before we know the results of the presidential election? Several variables will affect the timeframe on an apparent winner, including how close the race is, the amount of mail-in ballots and how quickly electors can start counting, Donahue said. The biggest factor is how close the election is because if it’s tight, we will need to wait for every vote to be counted. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been polling neck-and-neck according to Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecasts. States have moved up timelines Delays during the 2020 election occurred due to higher mail-in ballots which took time to tally but since then, several states including Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan and Georgia have moved up timelines to start counting. In 2020, more than 43% of votes were mailed in as the coronavirus pandemic led states to greatly expand mail-in balloting and early voting, according to a federal report. This took days and as a result, most states updated or changed laws to allow for a head start on preparing mail-in or absentee ballots before election day, according to the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. In Michigan, lawmakers passed rules to allow absentee ballot counting up to eight days before the election and in Nevada officials can begin counting mail ballots on Oct. 21.

Pennsylvania doesn’t allow offices to begin opening mail-in ballots until 7am on Election Day so it could take a longer time to finish. But Donahue says there likely won't be as many mail-in ballots this time around which means results will be quicker than they were in 2020. Some states where early numbers could emerge are North Carolina, Michigan, and potentially Wisconsin where officials can get a head start, Donahue said. 'But we'll have to see what the volumes are and if counties actually start doing that in the morning, or do they wait till the polls close,' he added. Delays may happen in Nevada and Arizona which typically don’t move as fast on counting, he said. 'It's nothing particularly nefarious. A lot of the states in the West don't have that much in-person Election Day voting, and it just takes them a while to get through the ballots.' Election officials publish unofficial results after the polls close on Election Day. Those results will fluctuate as in-person, mail-in, provisional, overseas and military ballots are counted. Could candidates cause delays in election counting process? Legal challenges by either candidate would not delay the counting process, but it could take the certification process closer to its deadline, Donahue said. Under the Election Reform Act of 2022, each state must issue a certificate of ascertainment, which contains a final certified vote tally, no later than Dec. 11, six days before the Electoral College meets. As election day draws closer, Trump has revved up claims that if he loses the election, it’s due to cheating, and has vowed to mount legal challenges. Abortion measures on ballots in record number of states 'They’re going to cheat. They cheat. That’s all they want to do is cheat, and when you see this, it’s the only way they’re going to win,' Trump said during a rally in Wisconsin, reported The New York Times. 'And we can’t let that happen and we can’t let it happen again.' During the 2020 election, delays in counting due to mail-in ballots were used by Trump to fuel false claims that the election was stolen. As a result, counting will be even more careful this year, John Mark Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said in an email to NewsNation. 'This year, there may be a tendency to do the count even more carefully because of all the misinformation Trump is spreading about fraud. Caution means there could be more widespread delays - but not because anything nefarious is happening.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/results-presidential-election-trump-harris-potential-timeline/	2024-10-29T08:28:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181411771.jpg?w=900
Puerto Rican voters rise as key bloc in 2024	Puerto Rican voters have shot to center stage in national elections, marking a major shift for an electorate that was largely overlooked for a century. The voting bloc is at the center of national attention following a series of crude jokes told by Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday at former President Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, in which the comedian equated Puerto Rico to oceanic garbage patches. Though the Trump campaign and many individual Republicans have disavowed Hinchcliffe’s set, the fracas opened a window for Vice President Harris to make a last-minute pitch to low-propensity voters who could help decide the election. 'I think there is a significant number of people who will not be turned off and will make excuses for Trump,' said Federico de Jesús, a Washington-based consultant and former deputy director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. 'But I think that this can and could make a big difference with Puerto Ricans who were already anti-Trump but were not sold yet or were soft on Kamala. They might be voting for her, but they weren't enthusiastic. I think that this will create rage, anger and motivate people to go out and maybe volunteer. Maybe take their relatives to vote. Maybe take a second look at Kamala if they were undecided, and really shore that vote up.' Hinchcliffe’s garbage joke struck at the most sensitive of soft spots for Puerto Ricans across the political spectrum: their homeland. 'The young and the old, their heart is in Puerto Rico — even the ones who were born here in Pennsylvania, in New York, in Nevada, in Georgia, where you have a Puerto Rican population who can decide an election,' said Javier Llano, a D.C.-based Puerto Rican political consultant. Hinchcliffe's segment also included a crass line about Hispanic reproductive habits, as well as anti-Black and antisemitic punchlines that drew a mixed reception from the audience. Republicans including Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.), Reps. María Elvira Salazar (Fla.) and Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.) and Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón, who is running for governor, all disavowed the comedy set, which Hinchcliffe defended Monday, saying it was taken out of context and 'made fun of everyone.' 'This is also, I think, an opportunity for every single American to pay real close attention to what was said at that rally, because no group went unscathed. He talked about Latinos, he talked about Puerto Ricans, he talked about African Americans, he talked about women. The only group that was safe was literally white men — cis white males, to be very specific,' said María Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino. Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement, 'this joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Yet the timing of the Madison Square Garden rally played in favor of Harris, who on the same day released a set of policy proposals for the U.S. territory. 'I will create a new Puerto Rico opportunity economy task force, where the federal government will work with the private sector, with nonprofits and community leaders to foster economic growth and create thousands of new, good-paying jobs in Puerto Rico, including for our young people. And I know that Puerto Rico's economic future depends on urgently rebuilding and modernizing the island's energy grid,' Harris said in a video posted on social media Sunday. That contrast also drew support from top Puerto Rican celebrities, including Ricky Martin, Jennifer López and Bad Bunny. Bad Bunny reposted Harris’s economic pledge to his Instagram account, which is followed by 45.6 million people, highlighting her line, 'I will never forget what Donald Trump did when Puerto Rico needed a caring and competent leader.' Bad Bunny’s jump into national politics is especially significant not only for his worldwide fame, but because he has historically focused his attention on internal Puerto Rican issues, rather than national ones. 'The reason that getting a Bad Bunny — the reason that getting a Ricky Martin and getting a Jennifer Lopez to endorse, is that it allows them to use their information on their feeds to talk to low-propensity information voters,' Kumar said. The Harris campaign quickly cut an ad with footage of the 'garbage' joke, including Trump's unorthodox pronunciation of the island's name in 2017 and Harris's economic pitch. Still, Trump has pulled in his own Puerto Rican celebrity support, most notably from reggaeton stars Anuel AA and Nicky Jam, a sign that both campaigns understand the outsize role Puerto Rican voters could play in this election. 'The fact that both of them and Trump referred to Puerto Rico as a country, which for some Democrats might be a surprise, but to anybody who's spoken to Puerto Ricans in Spanish knows that's how we refer to the island. It resonated with some people, right? And again, he doesn't need to win the majority of Puerto Ricans, but there's a swath of Puerto Rican men with which that resonated,' de Jesús said. 'And Kamala Harris was yesterday in Pennsylvania rolling out a plan on Puerto Rico. So Puerto Ricans on the island may not vote for president, but Puerto Ricans in the states obviously do, and there's a large number of us that have the island in our hearts when we go out to vote.' Puerto Ricans are at the center of the fight for Pennsylvania — the essential swing state — and Florida, a once-swing state with a potentially competitive Senate race. Puerto Rican voters are also expected to play a key role in Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina. That's a far cry from the group's historical clout in safe blue strongholds such as New York and Illinois, and from the electoral marginalization of Puerto Rico's territorial status. Puerto Ricans on the island have been statutory U.S. citizens since 1917, but only Puerto Ricans with residence in D.C. or one of the 50 states can vote in federal elections. Though the Jones Act, the law that conferred citizenship in 1917, spurred migration to the mainland, most Puerto Ricans originally settled in nonbattleground liberal states. For the next century, the Puerto Rican vote was crucial in some local elections but never at the presidential level. 'This time, we could be the decisive vote. In 2020 we were one of several groups, but this time around we could be the decisive swing vote,' de Jesús said. 'We didn't really matter per se in the presidential races until Florida became such a heavy state, with more than 1 million Puerto Ricans. And you know what's happened since, obviously, for local races, statewide races in New York and in Pennsylvania and other states, Puerto Ricans have mattered. But the fact that there's so many Puerto Ricans, more than 100,000 in Georgia, for example, more than that in North Carolina and obviously in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin, that changes things.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/puerto-rican-voters-rise-as-key-bloc-in-2024/	2024-10-29T04:37:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/puerto_rico_voters_091724ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump ally Steve Bannon is released after serving 4 months in pri...	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He’s also expected to resume his podcast Tuesday. Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his conviction. A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race. When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a 'political prisoner.' 'I am proud of going to prison,' he said at the time, adding that he was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a 'corrupt' Justice Department. Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next week's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's convictions in May. Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee. Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court, alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges. A trial in that case is scheduled to begin in December.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-trump-ally-steve-bannon-to-be-released-after-serving-4-months-in-prison-for-contempt-of-congress/	2024-10-29T04:32:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6720c1bc9946a9.60910221.jpeg?w=900
5 things to watch for in Harris's speech at the Ellipse	(The Hill) - Vice President Harris will solidify her closing argument that Donald Trump is a danger to democracy by delivering a speech on Tuesday at the Ellipse — the very site where the former president spoke just before a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Harris’s speech a week before Election Day is expected to be a further plea to voters to turn the page on Trump and highlight his role in the events of that day. She will focus on the two different visions of America that voters are given in this election and after the speech, she will take that closing message on the road and visit every battleground state over the next week, a senior Harris campaign official previewed. Vice President Harris speaks with reporters after attending a service at the Church of Christian Compassion on Oct. 27, 2024, in Philadelphia. (Susan Walsh, Associated Press) Here are five things to watch. Harris to emphasize Trump’s threat to democracy Harris will keep up her plea to voters that Trump is a threat to democracy, which has become a major part of her closing message. The Harris campaign official described the tone of the speech as 'optimistic' and 'hopeful' but said it will center on her and Trump’s different visions of America. Harris will argue that Trump as president would focus on a supposed 'enemies list.' Harris will reiterate that she, instead, has a 'to-do list.' She is set to warn voters that Trump is all-consumed by his grievances and desire for retribution and will argue that tens of millions of Americans are frustrated by the division in politics, according to the campaign official. The vice president has increasingly been leaning into labeling Trump as a threat to democracy and talking about his role in the riots on Jan. 6 during her rallies. But as polling tightens and shifts towards Trump’s favor, Democrats have expressed concerns that she has made her campaign a rebuke of the former president instead of about her own plans. When questioned on Friday about those concerns, the vice president said the American people 'can hold many thoughts at once.' 'One of the highest priorities for the American people right now is bringing down cost… and will be the priority of my work when I'm elected president United States,' she said. 'My priority includes fighting for our democracy… and I will continue to speak on all of them.' Ellipse turnout The Harris campaign expects about 20,000 people to be in the audience at the Ellipse, according to an updated permit from the National Park Service that was expanded from an initial 7,500 people. The campaign is expecting attendees near the site with crowd overflow on the northeast quadrant of the Washington Monument grounds for the program slated to be from 7:15 p.m. to 8:15 p.m.ET on Tuesday night. The site opens to the public starting at 3 p.m., which will allow for a large crowd to accumulate before it begins, according to the permit. Harris’s largest rally to date was in Houston on Friday, when the crowd size was 30,000 people. That rally included Beyonce and Willie Nelson, which added to the draw. Similarly, the speech at the Ellipse could include appearances from celebrities and could bring out a large crowd considering Washington, D.C., neighboring Maryland and northern Virginia are all areas where Harris has wide support. Harris to invoke Jan. 6, Trump contesting election results Harris’s decision to use the Ellipse is twofold, according to the campaign official, one, because it is within view of the White House and two, because it is the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 speech. The vice president will likely warn that history may repeat itself. Trump has not committed to accepting the 2024 election results outright - only if he deems them 'free and fair,' similar to sentiments he declared just before the 2020 election that led to his contesting the results. The vice president will likely warn in her remarks that Trump could declare a victory prematurely, like he did in 2020 before a winner was projected, or refuse to accept the results of the election, which is what led to supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. 'Of course. This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo … a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people,' Harris told NBC last week. 'The American people… are being presented with a very, very serious decision about what will be the future of our country.' A CNN/SSRS poll released Monday found that 69 percent of registered voters nationally think Trump would not accept the election results, and 30 percent think he would. Will she call Trump a fascist? Despite being asked multiple times, Harris has never outright labeled her political opponent a 'fascist.' Harris has agreed in two separate interviews on the notion that Trump’s campaign runs on 'fascism' and agreed with John Kelly’s assessment that Trump is a 'fascist' but she’s never used the word herself. The conversation over whether Trump should be labeled as such was sparked last week when Kelly, Trump’s ex-White House chief of staff, said the 45th president 'certainly falls into the general definition of fascist' in an interview in The New York Times. Harris, at the town hall, would not agree when she was asked if she believes Trump is antisemitic, but instead called him 'dangerous' and 'a danger to the well-being and security of America.' Harris’s Ellipse remarks could be an opportunity for her to take that one step further. Despite Trump labeling Harris a plethora of personal and offensive names, Republicans suggest her name-calling is too harsh following the two assassination attempts on Trump’s life in recent months. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) issued a joint statement on Friday condemning Harris for saying she believes Trump is a fascist, arguing that it could invite another assassination attempt. Possible pro-Trump or pro-Palestine protests Harris has faced pro-Palestine protesters at campaign stops more often than pro-Trump protesters, but she could see both during her speech in Washington given the importance of the location to Jan. 6. The vice president was interrupted by Gaza demonstrators as recently as during her rally in Houston, Texas on Friday. She responded to yelling by quipping that the protesters are at the wrong venue. 'Just send them to the small rally down the street,' she said to protesters, referring to a rally Trump hosted earlier in Austin. 'Some people don’t have a great sense of direction but that’s okay, we’ll show them the way.' Harris has maintained her pro-Israel stance and stuck to her talking points when pressed last week on what she would say to voters who are thinking about supporting a third-party candidate because of the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. 'Far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It’s unconscionable,' she said, adding that she thinks there is a current opportunity to end the war and bring the hostages held by Hamas home given the recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The Biden administration’s support for Israel throughout the war has led to protests from pro-Palestinian Americans, raising concerns among Democrats about whether anger on the issue will hurt Harris’s support among Arab and Muslim Americans and young voters in critical swing states like Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/5-things-to-watch-for-in-harriss-speech-at-the-ellipse/	2024-10-29T04:31:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Harris-Ellipse-five-things_102924_AP_Susan-Walsh-e1730196649227.png?w=900

When will we know the results of the presidential election?	Voters may not have to wait quite as long after Election Day as four years ago to know whom the next president will be. The public needed to wait almost five days in 2020 before most major news outlets could issue a projection, the longest they had to wait since the infamous 2000 election. One main reason was a historic increase in mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic that several key states weren’t prepared to handle quickly. But experts say some changes in state policies since then and an expected drop in mail-ins this year should speed the process up, even if the final result isn’t known on election night. 'Things will be different this year,' said Quinn Yeargain, an associate professor of law at Michigan State University. 'It may not be as quick as 2022. Famous last words I suppose, but I would be surprised if the process took as long as it did in 2020.' 'At the same time, the ultimate outcome in 2020 was quite clear before the networks called it on that Saturday,' Yeargain added. 'There was no real question as to what was going to happen probably after Wednesday afternoon or Thursday.' Up until 2020, Americans had broadly gotten used to relatively quick race calls for elections, usually no later than late Tuesday or early Wednesday after the election. Of the races of the past few decades, all of them had been called by major media outlets by early the following morning, except for 2000 when a recount in Florida caused weeks of delays. But four years ago marked a sharp difference, with the pandemic yielding health guidelines to minimize in-person, indoor interactions as much as possible. With the election approaching, many voters turned to mail-in voting to avoid voting in-person, and several states altered their policies to allow more voters to cast their ballots through that method. That caused a historic amount of mail-in voting, making up more than 43 percent of all votes cast, as opposed to just a quarter of all votes in 2016 and 2018, according to a federal report released after the election evaluating voting methods used in 2020. But that caused an issue with states being able to process and count all the ballots with the speed that many have gotten used to. Yeargain said state laws vary, but many did not allow mail-in ballots to be opened or checked for signatures until Election Day. 'The volume was so high that it took a significant amount of time to fully deal with that, which is what opened up the possibility of more conspiracy theories about the election to proliferate,' they said. Chris Mann, the research director for the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, also emphasized the closeness of the race, which made the task for media outlets to call races more difficult. Biden only carried the key states that clinched him victory by about a percentage point at most, and that could repeat itself with this year's winner, with polls showing a neck and neck race. 'The process that the news media decision desk could go through is trying to get to a point where the remaining uncounted ballots are not enough to potentially make a difference, and given that the polls show things to be essentially a tie, and if they prove to be correct and these elections are going to be decided by very narrow margins, it will again take quite a while,' Mann said. But some states have altered their policies for processing ballots ahead of Election Day in ways could speed up the process, reducing the chance for a delay as long as in 2020. The center, which works with election officials to build trust in elections, released a report this month gathering vote processing policies for all 50 states. Almost all states allow envelopes for mail-in ballots to be processed ahead of Election Day itself, according to the report. That includes processes such as verifying signatures and other information on the outside of the ballot, sorting envelopes, rejecting improperly filled-out ballots and preparing them for a machine to scan. 'The important part that takes time is that processing to verify every ballot, to make sure that it is valid and completed, has all the information to verify the voters identity,' Mann said. 'Tabulation is the technical term that the election officials use that is separate — much faster, much easier — in that process.' Time is needed to know if the mail-in ballots this year will resemble the total from 2020, though it may be less now that the pandemic is not dominating daily life. But millions of mail-ins have already been cast, and Republicans appear to be embracing the method more than in the past. About half of all states also allow machines to scan ballots before Election Day as long as the results aren’t aggregated, the report states. The current rules for two of the main battlegrounds, Michigan and Nevada, include changes from their policies for the 2020 election, allowing their ballots to be processed in advance. This could be especially critical in Nevada, a state where most voters cast their ballots by mail. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina will also allow processing ahead of Election Day, though North Carolina’s may be complicated by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Georgia in particular seems likely to be quicker among the battlegrounds. But a quick race call might be impossible if the election is particularly close and comes down to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — both states do not allow envelope processing to start until Election Day. Mann underscored that the rules for how the process works were set well in advance of the election but are susceptible to misinformation and disinformation affecting how the public views them. 'The same process that's used in Pennsylvania is used in other states. The same process that's used in Wisconsin is used in other states,' he said. 'The states where the doubt is cast is being passed by people spreading mis- and disinformation about it. The same system isn't causing doubts in other places because it's not being attacked, and there isn’t disinformation being spread about it.' And the closer the race is, the more likely for temperatures to be heightened on both sides around the process, said Pete Seat, an instructor for the University of Arizona’s School of Government and Public Policy and a former George W. Bush White House spokesperson. 'The closer the election is and the longer it takes to find out — particularly if you get into a situation where you're going to the courts to have the result adjudicated in some way — half the country is going to be displeased,' he said. 'It's just a matter of which half it is.' Analysts widely expect the race to be close even if one candidate wins most of the key swing states, but just how close and in which states may decide how long the country is holding its breath. Seat argued people should remember to be patient, even as impatience is a 'function' of society. 'I know a lot of people who just want the election to be over so we can move on, but we're going to have to be patient, because it may not be as over as quickly as we want it to be,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/when-will-we-know-the-results-of-the-presidential-election/	2024-10-28T15:18:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/when-will-we-know_gans_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
The Washington Post endorsement controversy sparks staff resignat...	(The Hill) -- A decision by The Washington Post to not endorse a candidate for president in next week's election is sparking vocal protests and resignations from some staffers. Post publisher and CEO William Lewis announced Friday that the Post would not be making an endorsement, a move that has angered staffers and stoked fears about the newspaper's editorial independence. GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally The Post itself reported hours later that Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon who owns the newspaper, personally made the decision not to run an endorsement after the Post's editorial board had already drafted its endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The first protest was from Post editor Robert Kagan, who told the news outlet Semafor he would step down from the publication. On Monday, Molly Roberts, a member of the Post's editorial board, said she was also stepping down because 'the imperative to endorse Kamala Harris over Donald Trump is about as morally clear as it gets.' 'Worse, our silence is exactly what Donald Trump wants,' Roberts wrote in a statement. 'For the media, for us, to keep quiet.' A third staffer, David Hoffman, a Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist, wrote in a note to his editors obtained by The New York Times that he was stepping down from the Post's editorial board but would remain at the newspaper. Elon Musk sued by Philadelphia district attorney over $1M giveaway 'While leaving the board, I refuse to give up on The Post, where I have spent 42 years,' he wrote. In his announcement on Friday, Lewis acknowledged the decision to not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in more than 30 years was likely to receive blowback.

GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally	Republicans are expressing frustration about controversial remarks made at former President Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, worrying it could complicate the party’s outreach to Hispanic, Latino and Black voters. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, one of the featured guests at Trump’s New York City event, sparked a furor after referring to Puerto Rico as a 'a floating island of garbage,' prompting some members of the GOP, like Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-N.Y.), who is Puerto Rican, to come out against the remarks. And Tucker Carlson mocked Vice President Harris’s racial identity. The controversy comes as Republicans have looked to expand their reach with different voting cohorts, which could hold the keys to another Trump reelection. 'This is just a big punch in the gut for Republicans who have sincerely and over a period of time been working to grow strong relationships and roots in Puerto Rican communities, particularly here in the state of Florida,' said former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.). Although recent polls show Harris holding the majority of support among Latino voters — with a 40-point favorability gap among women — one-third of Latino voters remain undecided. For that reason, Trump and his allies have been working hard to shore up support among Latino voters in the closing stretch of the election — though Hinchcliffe’s comments could complicate those efforts. In addition to his remark about Puerto Rico, the comedian also made a crude joke about Latinos in which he said 'they love making babies too. Just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside. Just like they did to our country.' Hinchcliffe’s remarks prompted several sitting GOP members of Congress to push back against the derogatory remarks. 'I’m proud to be Puerto Rican. My mom was born and raised in Puerto Rico,' D’Esposito wrote on the social platform X. 'It’s a beautiful island with a rich culture and an integral part of the USA. The only thing that’s ‘garbage’ was a bad comedy set. Stay on message.' Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), who was born in Cuba but raised in part in Puerto Rico, said on X that she was 'disgusted' by Hinchcliffe’s remarks. 'This rhetoric does not reflect GOP values,' she said. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), whose successful 2018 election was won with the help of Puerto Rican voters, also said on X that the joke 'bombed,' calling it 'not funny and not true.' The Trump campaign, too, has distanced itself from the comedian’s rhetoric. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said on 'Fox &amp; Friends' on Monday that 'it was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste.' 'Obviously, that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign, and I think it is sad that the media will pick up on one joke that was made by a comedian, rather than the truths that were shared by the phenomenal list of speakers that we had,' she said. Hinchcliffe, for his part, defended his remarks, responding to criticism from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). 'These people have no sense of humor,' he wrote. 'Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his ‘busy schedule’ to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone … watch the whole set. I’m a comedian Tim … might be time to change your tampon.' Hinchcliffe wasn’t the only one who made controversial remarks about different racial and ethic groups during the rally. Carlson referred to Vice President Harris as a 'Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor' despite the fact that Harris is neither Samoan nor Malaysian, but rather Black and Indian American. Trump ally Rudy Giuliani used racist stereotypes about Palestinians in his address at the rally, claiming, 'They may have good people. I’m sorry, I don’t take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2.' Democrats have used the speakers’ comments to double down on their criticism of Trump. Talking to reporters on Monday, Harris criticized Trump's New York City rally, calling it 'nonsense.' 'Donald Trump spends full-time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hate and division, and that’s why people are exhausted with him. … People are literally ready to turn the page. They’re tired of it,' Harris said. The incendiary remarks came just more than a week out from the election, and polling across the battleground states suggests a nail-biter of a presidential race. Pennsylvania, New York and Florida are some of the states home to large Puerto Rican communities, and some Republicans say the comments at the rally could impact the GOP presidential campaign and competitive congressional bids. 'With over 456k Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania, one guy’s abhorrent jokes are like a gift wrapped in ribbon for the Harris campaign,' Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton wrote on X. 'At this stage, no campaign can afford negative press — not a single word, not a single action that could alienate or disillusion potential voters.' Curbelo suggested that Hinchcliffe’s remarks could sway Puerto Rican voters in Florida not as familiar with Scott to vote for downballot Democrats. 'What tends to happen is that there's a lot of times a sense of solidarity amongst Hispanic communities. We certainly see that here in South Florida, with Cuban Americans, Venezuelan Americans, Nicaraguan Americans,' said Curbelo, who is Cuban. 'So some, non-Puerto Rican Hispanics could also feel offended by this.' Other Republicans, meanwhile, are skeptical the rhetoric could negatively impact the party in November. Giancarlo Sopo, who led Hispanic media for Trump during his 2020 campaign, called Hinchcliffe’s joke 'stupid' in a text message to The Hill, while adding 'it’s a mistake to assume it will offend all Hispanics.' 'It’s certainly not going to matter to Mexican-Americans in the Southwest. And let’s be real—Hispanic culture isn’t exactly politically correct. Was it in poor taste? Sure, but it’s tame compared to what you hear around lonchera trucks and nail salons,' Sopo wrote. 'At the end of the day, you know what really offends Hispanics? The prices they’re paying at the grocery store.' Brian Seitchik, a Republican strategist and Trump campaign alum, dismissed worries that the comments could reflect on Trump. Voters, he said, are well aware of Trump’s controversial rhetoric and those around him. 'Latino voters, Black voters, white voters, whomever, millions of Americans are choosing Donald Trump not because they love all of his rhetoric or his friends, it’s because they support his policies,' Seitchik said. While Democrats have tried to highlight Trump’s history of controversial — and sometimes racist — comments to deter voters of color from supporting him, Seitchik argued it didn’t work in 2020 and won’t work this year. 'They’re playing identity politics that so offends minority voters these days,' Seitchik said. 'They're Americans. They're not Black Americans or Latino Americans. They're Americans. They want a strong economy, they want to buy a home, they want to send their children to college. They want what every other American wants. And this identity politics approach is simply not working anymore.' Nonetheless, the controversy swirling around the rally isn’t helpful for Trump. Erin Perrine, who served as the Trump campaign’s 2020 communications director, said the real test will come from Democrats and how far they highlight those speakers’ comments. 'Are Democrats going to be putting money behind this message to put it out via text message or on digital ads or a way to get to [a] persuadable voter?' Perrine said. 'Because then they're going to have to make a dollar decision, whatever other message they were driving with that dollar, are they going to pull that and recategorize it?' Cheyanne M. Daniels contributed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/gop-voices-frustration-disgust-over-trump-msg-rally/	2024-10-28T15:10:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hinchcliffetony_102724ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Ballot drop boxes set on fire in Oregon and Washington: police	PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Investigations are underway after authorities say incendiary devices were placed near two ballot boxes in Portland, Oregon, and a third in Vancouver, Washington, and used to start the fires in the early morning hours on Monday. Portland Police Bureau says the incidents were possibly connected to each other as well as another incident that took place on Oct. 8. 'We got a call that indicated one of the ballot boxes was smoking. We found a device there next to the ballot box,' Vancouver police officials said of the previous October incident. 'Today’s incident was very similar.' According to Portland police, at around 3:30 a.m. Monday, officers responded to reports of a fire at a ballot box on Southeast Morrison Street, near the Multnomah County Elections Division office. By the time officers arrived, they said the fire had already been put out by security employees who work in the area. Woman found dead near Bridgeport Village parking structure Authorities said they found that an incendiary device had been placed in the ballot box and used to start the fire. Information about the incident is still limited and authorities are asking anyone with information to contact Portland police or Portland Fire &amp; Rescue. Just half an hour later, Vancouver police said a Clark County ballot box was also found to be on fire. When officers arrived, they said the ballot box at 3510 SE 164th Ave. was smoking and on fire, and the Metro Explosive Disposal Unit arrived to collect the explosive device. Portland police say they identified a suspect vehicle in connection with the Multnomah County case, which they later revealed to be a Volvo.

Multnomah County's Elections Office will contact those voters via unique identifiers on their ballot envelopes to receive replacement ballots. 'We have multiple systems and security measures in place to ensure your ballot is safe,' Scott said in a statement. 'Your Elections team is working hard to make sure that every vote counts.' A similar situation happened in early October near a ballot box in Vancouver. In the incident, authorities said the ballot box wasn't compromised and the suspicious device was safely removed by the bomb squad.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ballot-drop-boxes-set-on-fire-in-oregon-and-washington-police/	2024-10-28T15:08:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/1920x1080-to-resize-pics-55.jpg?w=900
Texas police investigating 'Klan' flyers threatening Kamala Harri...	AUSTIN (KXAN) — The San Marcos Police Department (SMPD) said Saturday it's investigating threatening flyers found throughout San Marcos that target supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a social media post. SMPD chief Stan Standridge said his department has found at least five flyers, with reports about the flyers starting on Friday. Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts 'We're trying to identify the scope of how many flyers have been disseminated across San Marcos,' Standridge said. 'We have already notified the FBI, and that we've also notified the regional fusion centers—both Southwest [Texas] Fusion center and the Austin Regional Intelligence Center.' The flyers, found on residents' campaign signs, state that the resident is now in a 'national database.' It also threatens that the resident 'will be IRS tax audited.' Picture of a flyer found threatening Harris supporters (Courtesy San Marcos Police Department) 'It's a crime in the state of Texas to try to influence or coerce or even prevent a voter from voting,' Standridge said. 'When we identify the suspect or suspects, then we will present that to the district attorney's office for consideration of applicable charges.' How are presidential election votes counted? SMPD said that people who find one of these flyers should not remove it, and should call the agency's non-emergency number, 512-753-2108. An officer will come to investigate the scene and remove the flyer, it said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-klan-flyers-kamala-harris-supporters/	2024-10-28T14:53:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/SMPD-Facebook-Post-Picture.jpg?w=900
Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts	(NewsNation) — Both the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns are acutely aware the Latino vote could sway the presidential election. Long-term trends indicate Latino men may be shifting to the right as Latina women remain more firmly in the Democratic camp. However, short-term missteps, like last night’s insult by a comedian about Puerto Rico at former President Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, could prove decisive. Long-term trends Based on polling, there’s good reason to believe that a shift in the Latino vote may be underway, although we won’t know if it actually materializes until we get the election results. In 2020, President Joe Biden got 60% of the Latino vote, while Trump got 37%. In Cook’s national polling average, Vice President Kamala Harris is currently garnering 52.7% to Trump’s 42.1%. With about 36 million Latinos eligible to vote in this election, those five additional points for Trump could make a difference. How are presidential electoral votes counted? Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who has worked on Latino voter issues for 30 years and is a co-founder of The Lincoln Project, explains the shift. 'Latino voters are quickly moving away from being a racially and ethnically motivated voter to becoming an economic populist and pocketbook voter. That, in a nutshell, is what's happening,' he said. The base voters of both parties are shifting. College-educated voters are moving toward Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are leaning toward the Republican Party. Madrid says that Latinos are the largest entrants into the non-college-educated workforce, and their voting behaviors match those of their white peers in jobs like ones on an assembly line or in construction. Education level and its impact can also be witnessed in the widening gender gap that is emerging with all voters, including Latinos. Women are becoming more Democratic, and men are turning toward the Republican Party. In the Latino community, more women are earning degrees than men. Given Trump’s previous negative statements about immigrants in this country, including his saying that they are 'poisoning the blood of our country,' many question how some Latinos could vote for him. Madrid explains that many Latinos just don’t think Trump is talking about them. They believe 'he's talking about the undocumented migrant, which they're certainly not,' Madrid said. He says the increase in third and even fourth-generation Latino voters means that many are more likely to identify as 'typically American.' This multigenerational status impacts how Latinos view immigration as well. Madrid believes that Democrats failed to understand that the Latino community sees immigration reform and border security as two different issues, not one large problem to address. Harris, Trump make final pleas to voters ahead of election In a recent New York Times/Siena poll, 43% of Latinos support building a wall, and Madrid said that 69% supported Biden's executive actions on asylum and shutting down the border. While Latinos have more sensitivity to immigration solutions like a pathway to citizenship, they are still concerned with border security. Policy for Latino voters Last week, Harris shared policy proposals highlighting how her plans for the economy and jobs will benefit Latinos, and in particular, Latino men. The proposals include doubling the number of apprenticeships, eliminating unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, offering forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to entrepreneurs and doubling the number of Latino homeowners. While the Trump campaign did not share any Latino-specific policy proposals, last week, he held a Latino roundtable. The campaign said that 'President Trump's successful record and common-sense policies resonate with all voters, including Hispanics' and that the shift towards Trump is undeniable. Short-term optics Just yesterday, Harris also unveiled specific policy proposals for Puerto Rico while campaigning in Pennsylvania. If elected president, she said she would create a Puerto Rico Opportunity Economy Task Force to create thousands of jobs on the island, foster economic growth and rebuild and modernize their electric grid. High-profile Puerto Rican artists like Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin all praised her plans. Collectively, they have over 300 million followers on social media. Later in the evening, at the Trump rally in New York, one of the speakers, a comedian, called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said, 'This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Several Republican politicians denounced the comments as well, further evidence that this could cause trouble with voters. There are almost six million Puerto Ricans in the United States, and nearly 500,000 live in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. In an election that is expected to be won with razor-thin margins, antagonizing any group of voters could be problematic. Ultimately, Madrid believes that the answer to this question will determine the winner. 'Can the Democrats hold on to their U.S.-born Hispanic male base to a greater extent than Republicans can hold on to their white, college-educated female, suburban voter base? That's the whole race,' he said. There is just one week left to find out.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-latino-vote/	2024-10-28T11:35:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
Trump better for stocks, Harris better for housing: Survey	(NewsNation) — A Donald Trump victory is seen as better for the stock market and gold while a Kamala Harris win is expected to be better for housing costs, according to a new Bloomberg survey. Respondents to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey think American wealth will grow regardless of who takes the White House but their confidence varies across different investments. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 22% year to date and more respondents (38%) see stock market gains accelerating under Trump, compared to Harris (13%). Current election odds in every 2024 swing state With that said, research shows there isn't a clear connection between the outcome of a presidential election and stock market performance over the long term. 'The historical data suggests that economic and inflation trends, more so than election outcomes, tend to have a stronger, more consistent relationship with market returns,' a recent U.S. Bank analysis noted. Earlier this year, the value of a gold bar hit $1 million for the first time and 57% of survey respondents expect the price of gold to be higher a year from now if Trump wins versus 45% who felt the same about Harris. For potential homebuyers, however, a Harris victory is seen more positively. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.54% last week, according to Freddie Mac. By the end of a Harris term, the median estimate for that rate is 5.5% according to respondents, compared to 5.9% under Trump. Donald Trump's and Kamala Harris' views on the economy Housing affordability has become a major topic on the campaign trail and both candidates have put forward different plans to address the issue. Meanwhile, former President Trump is also expected to be better for Bitcoin, respondents said. Bloomberg's weekly MLIV Pulse survey was conducted from Oct. 21 to Oct. 25 and included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors. Respondents were Bloomberg News terminal and online readers worldwide who chose to engage with the survey. What do other polls show? The economy has consistently ranked as the top issue in this year's election and Trump has generally polled better on that topic but on specifics, voters are mixed. The latest Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of swing state voters shows more people trust Trump (50%) than Harris (46%) on the economy overall. Specifically, respondents trusted Trump more than Harris on stock market performance (49% to 37%), interest rates (47% to 42%) and gas prices (50% to 41%). However, swing state voters trusted Harris more than Trump on housing costs (48% to 43%), pay raises (44% to 42%) and health care costs (51% to 42%). They also think Harris will be better at helping the middle class (50% to 41%). The two candidates were deadlocked on taxes and unemployment, according to the poll which was conducted online from Oct. 16 to Oct. 20 and surveyed 5,308 registered voters in seven swing states. Here's what other surveys show about voters' views on the candidates and the economy: New York Times/Siena Poll (Oct. 20 to Oct. 23) Expected to do a better job at handling the economy Trump: 52% Harris: 45% Financial Times/University of Michigan Ross School of Business survey (Oct. 17 to Oct. 21) Trust more to handle the economy Trump: 44% Harris: 43% Polling across the seven battleground states, shows Trump and Harris are roughly tied overall.

Harris, Trump make final pleas to voters ahead of election	(NewsNation) — With just eight days until the election, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s campaigns are making one last push to win over voters. The race is still neck and neck, with Harris gaining a slight edge over Trump in the latest Decision Desk HQ polling. Virginia asks Supreme Court to greenlight 1,600 voter roll removals Pollsters say the campaigns’ ability to rally voters in this final stretch — particularly in the swing states — could decide the election. Harris is driving home her plans for health care and the economy, while Trump is focusing on immigration and economic issues. Mobilizing voters With the election just more than a week away, candidates are encouraging Americans to register and vote early or show up at the polls Nov. 5. Harris and Trump have been visiting battleground states. The vice president was in Michigan Monday after campaigning in Texas. Meanwhile, Trump had two appearances scheduled Monday in Georgia on the heels of his rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Trump says he’ll let RFK Jr. ‘go wild’ on health and food in potential second term Will Biden campaign with Harris? President Joe Biden cast his ballot on Monday in Delaware, but it’s unclear whether he’ll appear alongside his vice president as she makes her final pleas to voters this week. Some analysts say Biden’s presence would be an advantage to Harris’ campaign in places like Scranton or Erie, Pennsylvania. Others say Biden could be a disadvantage to Harris on the campaign trail. What are Harris, Trump’s messages at this stage? Both candidates tried to spread messages of joy over the weekend. Harris has tried to paint Trump as a dark force while positioning herself as a positive, new light. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'For the next nine days, no one can sit on the sidelines,' Harris said at a weekend rally. 'There is too much on the line and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days.' Trump similarly framed his potential win as an optimistic outcome for the country. 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' Trump asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden. 'I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-final-campaign-visits/	2024-10-28T11:06:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900

Kennedy Jr. 'go wild' in dealing with issues related to food, medicine and health in a potential second administration. 'I’m going to let him go wild on health. I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines,' Trump told supporters at Madison Square Garden. RFK Jr.’s presence on Michigan, Wisconsin ballots raises concerns for Trump 'The only thing I don’t think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,' he added, referring to oil. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a campaign rally for former President Trump on Aug. 23, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (Ross Franklin, Associated Press) Kennedy ran an independent White House campaign before dropping out in August and and endorsing Trump. Kennedy, who has led an initiative for the Trump campaign dubbed 'Make America Healthy Again,' has long drawn criticism for his anti-vaccine comments. He has spoken about the proliferation of processed foods and additives, and he has worked as an environmental lawyer. 5 takeaways from Trump’s 3-hour interview with Joe Rogan Medical experts have raised concerns about Kennedy's potential influence in a future Trump administration. Kennedy has denied being against vaccines outright but has long peddled debunked conspiracy theories about them. At a congressional hearing last year, he denied telling people to avoid getting vaccinated, but two years earlier he said on a podcast that he regularly tells strangers not to vaccinate their babies. And on CNN in December, he denied saying no vaccines are 'safe and effective,' despite having said exactly that in an interview last July.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rfk-jr-second-term/	2024-10-28T09:57:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/RFK-dangerous_083124_AP_Ross-Franklin-e1730125705257.png?w=900

Virginia asks Supreme Court to greenlight 1,600 voter roll remova...	Virginia asked the Supreme Court on Monday to greenlight the removals of more than 1,600 people from the state’s voter rolls. State officials say the individuals are noncitizens, but the Justice Department challenged that assertion and convinced a district judge to reinstate the voters because the removals took place too close to the election. Virginia now seeks emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause that ruling after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to do so in a rare Sunday decision. 'Not only will the Commonwealth of Virginia be irreparably harmed absent a stay, so will its voters and the public at large,' the state wrote in its emergency application. Though research indicates noncitizen voting is rare, Republicans have latched on to the issue as the election approaches. Former President Trump at a Friday campaign event brought up the court-ordered restoration of the registrations in Virginia, calling it 'outrageous.' The Justice Department and a group of private plaintiffs claim Virginia violated the federal National Voter Registration Act’s prohibition on systematic voter roll removals within 90 days of an election. The Justice Department has similarly sued Alabama. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), exactly 90 days before Election Day, issued an executive order formalizing a program to remove potential noncitizens from the state’s rolls — more than 1,600 people have been removed as a result, court filings show. Virginia election officials say the individuals were identified as noncitizens based on a federal database or Department of Motor Vehicles forms. But when blocking the removals Friday, U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles noted the challengers quickly found citizens among the list and that some of the discrepancies could be explained by user error. Giles was appointed by President Biden. A three-judge 4th Circuit panel, all appointed by Democratic presidents, largely refused Virginia’s emergency request to pause the ruling. In a rare occurrence, the decision was handed down during the weekend. The 4th Circuit kept Giles’s ruling in place except for a provision ordering Virginia to educate poll workers and the public about the voters’ restoration. The panel said that requirement was 'not sufficiently clear.' Virginia officials 'remain able to prevent noncitizens from voting by canceling registrations on an individualized basis or prosecuting any noncitizen who votes,' the panel wrote in its ruling.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/virginia-asks-supreme-court-to-greenlight-1600-voter-roll-removals/	2024-10-28T07:28:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Quiz-SCOTUS_102124_AP_Susan-Walsh.jpg?w=900
7 House seats Democrats think they can flip	Democrats are battling to flip control of the House at the polls next week, eyeing gains in battleground districts from coast to coast in an effort to win back the Speaker’s gavel after two years in the minority wilderness. The fight for control of the lower chamber remains neck and neck, and campaign handicappers say the gavel is still up for grabs with just eight days left before Election Day. Both parties concede the contest could tip either way. Democrats got a big boost over the summer, when Vice President Harris replaced President Biden at the top of the ticket, bringing a surge in fundraising, volunteerism and general enthusiasm among base voters who had been deflated by Biden’s dismal approval ratings. Party leaders are also animated by the fact 18 incumbent Republicans represent districts won by Biden in 2020, and many of them are vulnerable. Indeed, there are 14 Republican incumbents in 'toss-up' races, representing the most competitive contests in the country, according to the latest tally from the Cook Political Report, and another is in the 'lean Democrat' column. But Democrats lost a bit of ground during the redistricting process, which is expected to net the Republicans one additional seat. And Democrats have 11 'toss-up' races to defend themselves, including three contests where Democratic retirements have put the seats in play. Still, Democratic candidates have vastly outraised their GOP opponents in races across the country, and party leaders are voicing confidence they’ll seize control of the House next year. Here are seven seats where Democrats are most confident they can pick off sitting GOP lawmakers in their quest for the House majority. New York-22: Brandon Williams Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.), a first-term conservative, is among the most vulnerable GOP incumbents this cycle. Although he swept into office in 2022 on New York’s red wave, his margin was only 1 percentage point — roughly 2,600 votes — and Biden won the district by roughly 7 points two years earlier. Since then, state redistricting changes have shifted the 22nd District even further toward the Democrats — Biden’s margin in the new district would have been 11.4 points — and handicappers at the Cook Political Report have the race 'leaning' in favor of Williams’s Democratic challenger, John Mannion, a moderate state senator. Democratic campaign operatives say that shift — combined with Williams’s conservative policy record, especially on abortion — make the seat ripe for flipping next week. 'Unlike some of the other vulnerable Republicans in New York — who are desperately trying to hide their anti-abortion extremism in a desperate attempt to sound moderate — he will openly run as a far-right conservative,' a Democratic strategist familiar with House races said. 'He's unapologetic about it.' The fundraising numbers also favor the Democrats. While outside groups have spent $4.2 million on behalf of Williams, they’ve spent $6.6 million favoring Mannion, according to OpenSecrets. Nebraska-2: Don Bacon Democrats have been trying unsuccessfully for years to pick off Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a moderate district centered around Omaha. This year, they think they have their best shot to date. Not only did Biden carry the district by 6.3 percentage points in 2020, but independent polling shows that Tony Vargas, the Democratic state senator challenging Bacon, is performing better than he did two years ago, when he lost to the incumbent Republican by roughly 6,000 votes. In this year’s rematch, the analysts at Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan handicapper based at the University of Virginia, have rated the race 'lean Democrat.' On top of that, the Harris campaign has focused squarely on the district in the final weeks of the race, sending vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife to stump in the region. That’s because Nebraska is one of only two states, along with Maine, to award presidential electoral votes by congressional district — in contrast to the winner-take-all system adopted by every other state. House political operatives say the additional campaigning and spending at the presidential level marks a break from the 2016 and 2020 cycles — when Democratic contenders for the White House largely ignored the district — and will benefit Vargas downballot. 'This is the year,' the strategist said. 'Unlike other years where many didn't think the presidential race would come down to maybe one electoral vote, I think everyone realizes it’s a possibility and is acting accordingly. And as a consequence of that, you're seeing a lot of Dem investments out there.' Election handicappers say the ascension of Harris to the top of the ticket is also a factor, since it’s likely to boost turnout of Black and other minority voters in Omaha. Outside spending has poured in to try to boost the Republican, with $10.7 million spent to either promote Bacon or oppose Vargas, according to OpenSecrets. On the other side, $6.8 million has been spent to support Vargas or oppose Bacon. New York-4: Anthony D’Esposito Rep. Anthony D'Esposito is another of the first-term New York Republicans at the top of the Democrats’ target list. Not only did Biden win the district by a whopping 14.5 percentage points in 2020, but D’Esposito has found himself embroiled in a late-campaign scandal after The New York Times reported in September he had an affair with a woman while engaged to his longtime fiancee, and then put the mistress on his congressional payroll. Such episodes are not unheard of on Capitol Hill. But in a region of New York where many voters are still humiliated by the numerous ethics and legal troubles surrounding former GOP Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from Congress last year, Democrats think the scandal will spark a voter backlash that will only help propel D’Esposito’s challenger, Laura Gillen, into Congress. 'It is a factor,' the strategist said. 'On Long Island, there is Santos scandal fatigue, and now D’Esposito is being dogged by his own scandals.' The race is a rematch of the 2022 contest, when D’Esposito defeated Gillen, an attorney and former town supervisor, by almost 4 percentage points. This time around, she’ll have Harris at the top of the ticket — a dynamic that’s expected to increase turnout among Black and other minority voters on Long Island to the benefit of Democrats. Gillen is also better funded this cycle. Democrats have flooded the district with outside spending, pouring $13 million into efforts opposing D'Esposito or supporting Gillen, according to OpenSecrets. Republicans have spent more than $5.7 million to oppose Gillen or boost the Republican congressman. Oregon-5: Lori Chavez-DeRemer Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the first GOP woman to represent Oregon in the House, has spent her two years on Capitol Hill fighting to build a reputation as a moderate voice within the heavily conservative GOP conference. Democrats, however, see her as particularly vulnerable on an issue of outsize prominence this cycle: abortion, where she’s wavered between vows to oppose any bans on federal funding for the procedure, and voting to do just that when legislation hit the floor. Democrats are hoping that track record will repel voters in Oregon’s 5th District, which includes the suburbs of both Portland and Salem, while boosting the Democratic challenger, Janelle Bynum, an Oregon state House member. Fueling their optimism, Biden won the district in 2020 by 8.9 points. Fueling it further, 2024 is the first presidential cycle since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. With that in mind, Democratic operatives maintain the abortion issue will overwhelm the GOP efforts to tie Democrats, including Bynum, to Portland’s controversial liberal policies related to crime and immigration. 'This district is overwhelmingly, without question, pro-choice. And it is absolutely a huge deal in that part of the country — unequivocally so,' the strategist said. 'You cannot get elected in Oregon unless you're pro-choice. Which is why Chavez-DeRemer is trying so, so, so, so hard to cover up her anti-abortion views and her anti-abortion history and her anti-abortion votes.' Outside spending is relatively even in the race, with $10.8 million spent to support Bynum or oppose Chavez-DeRemer, and $10.4 million to support the Republican or oppose Bynum, according to OpenSecrets. California-13: John Duarte To know that first-term Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) is one of the most vulnerable members of the House GOP in the cycle, look back to the 2022 election, which he won by just 564 votes. Democrats believe Duarte will fare worse in a presidential year, particularly in a district where Biden had a nearly 11-point edge with voters in 2020. Democrats have the advantage in outside spending, with $11.4 million spent to oppose Duarte or support Democratic nominee Adam Gray, and $8.3 million spent to support Duarte or oppose Gray, according to OpenSecrets. Duarte has struck one of the most moderate tones in the House GOP on abortion, even saying he is 'pro-choice' despite not supporting codifying protections for abortion. But his Democratic opponent, a former member of the California State Assembly, has heavily attacked Duarte on abortion rights. Another major theme from Democrats is that in the agricultural district, Duarte has nothing to show on immigration reform — an issue that resonates loudly in a region where migrant workers are a crucial part of the economy. Democrats also think the chaotic House GOP majority, which endured two drawn-out battles for Speaker and numerous intraparty fights, helped Duarte from getting meaningful wins. Arizona-1: David Schweikert Democrats have long been hoping to capture Rep. David Schweikert’s (R-Ariz.) district that includes the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, which has been trending blue. Biden won the district by 1.5 percentage points in 2020. This year might be the one where it catches up to the unapologetically conservative Schweikert, who was first elected to Congress as part of the 2010 Tea Party wave. Outside spending on the Democratic side has topped $11.6 million to either oppose Schweikert or support his Democratic challenger, Amish Shah, compared to more than $9.6 million to support the Republican or oppose Shah, according to OpenSecrets. Democrats hope the extra efforts being put into Arizona due to the competitive open Senate seat, and the fact it is a swing state, will also make a difference in the House race, running up the score to help Shah, a physician and former state representative. 'The district is trending blue and fast growing with a lot of new residents,' the strategist said. 'And eventually, all these new folks who are coming in who are blue-leaning are realizing, 'Wait a minute, I don't really want to vote for an anti-choice Republican who's been there 14 years.'' California-27: Mike Garcia Second-term Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) represents a district north of Los Angeles that swung for Biden by 12.4 points in 2020, making him a prime target for Democrats. His Democratic challenger, George Whitesides, was the first CEO of Virgin Galactic and was chief of staff of NASA during the Obama administration — a business-friendly resume that could blunt some of the GOP attacks on Biden and Democrats as the drivers of inflation. The broader political environment within the Golden State could also work to Whitesides’s favor. Because California is solidly Democratic statewide, much of the grassroots and donor enthusiasm has been directed at the handful of competitive congressional races, the Democratic strategist said. 'There are no other competitive races other than these congressional seats,' the strategist said. '[Democratic Senate candidate Adam] Schiff doesn't have a competitive seat. It's California, it's going to go Harris. Volunteers are looking at their local House race to engage, because that's where the action is right now.' Republicans have put about $11 million into outside spending to support Garcia or tear down Whitesides, while outside Democratic groups have spent $10.5 million to support the challenger or oppose Garcia, according to OpenSecrets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/7-house-seats-democrats-think-they-can-flip/	2024-10-28T06:41:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/7-possible-flips-dems_brooks-lillis_illo_SamanthaWong-GregNash.jpg?w=900
Michigan could play pivotal role in presidential election	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris has her eyes on Michigan as she and former president Donald Trump blitz swing states in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign cycle. The race is poised for a tossup in six states, Decision Desk HQ data suggests. Michigan — part of a so-called blue wall along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — could be especially important. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters The midwestern state is home to 15 electoral votes and has favored Democrats in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. Trump, however, led the state by 0.2%, in 2016, contributing to the Electoral College victory that carried him to the White House. Decision Desk HQ models as of Monday predict Harris has a 57% chance of winning the key state. How has Michigan voted in previous elections? Nov. 5 will mark Trump’s third presidential election as the GOP nominee. The presidential race was close in both of his previous bids in 2016 and 2020. Trump garnered 47.5% of Michigan votes and narrowly defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, who claimed 47.3% of votes. President Joe Biden flipped the script in 2020 and defeated Trump by about 150,000 votes. Comedian calls Puerto Rico ‘island of garbage’ at Trump rally Key Michigan counties Washtenaw County is home to the University of Michigan just west of Detroit in Anabor, where Harris is campaigning Monday. The Harris campaign has invested significant time and money visiting college campuses to energize younger voters. Washtenaw County voters overwhelmingly favored Democratic presidential candidates in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Wayne County, where Detroit is located, also encompasses Dearborn. The city of about 110,000 people is home to the country’s largest Arab American population. Most voters in Wayne County also favored Biden and Clinton in the previous two presidential elections.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/michigan-2024-presidential-race-kamala-harris-donald-trump/	2024-10-28T06:08:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.10.png?w=900
Violent threats against poll workers increasing ahead of election	(NewsNation) — With just one week until the 2024 election, cities across the U.S. are beefing up security at polling places, driven by a troubling increase in threats directed toward election workers. Local governments have coordinated with law enforcement to ensure safe voting and implement new security measures at polling locations. A visible police presence, installing cameras and training poll workers on how to handle disruptive individuals are just a few steps being taken. The 2024 election is major source of stress: Survey Poll workers face violence, threats The violence and threats against poll workers have already begun. Jesse Lutzenberger, 63, was arrested last Thursday after he was accused of assaulting a 69-year-old election worker in San Antonio, Texas. Lutzenberger was asked to remove his cap, which showed support for former President Donald Trump, while walking through a polling place. He cast his vote and then put his hat on before leaving the place, according to Bexar’s County Sheriff Javier Salazar. As Lutzenberger was leaving, the voting clerk told him to take off his hat as it is illegal to sport clothing supporting a candidate inside a polling area under Texas law. Lutzenberger then allegedly threw an arm or elbow back at the clerk, and then turned and threw several punches right at the victim's face, Salazar said. The 69-year-old election worker suffered some 'marks' on his face but no life-threatening injuries, Salazar said Friday. The sheriff said that Lutzenberger was arrested following the incident and taken to Bexar County jail. Incidents such as this are what have the safety of polling places around the country on the top of voters' minds. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Increasing election security measures In Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, election workers installed a bullet-proof protective covering inside the polling site windows. People can see outside the building, but cannot see inside. They said the move was taken after recommendations made to the county by federal security experts. 'We invited Homeland Security to come in and access the building. They did, and this is one of the suggestions,' County manager Romilda Crocamo said about the bulletproof protector. Luzerne County, where Wilkes-Barre is located, has implemented several other security measures, including adding a low barrier of large rocks surrounding the county building. The county has faced multiple threats during past elections and has taken extra security measures to ensure voter safety. Emily Cook, the director of the Luzerne County's Bureau of Elections, has also reportedly received several threats through social media and in person. The county voted in favor of Trump during the 2016 and 2020 elections, facing election controversy in the past when several absentee ballots were discarded in 2020. Those ballots were eventually recovered and counted.

Trump's Madison Square Garden rally: 5 takeaways	Former President Trump on Sunday held a rally at Madison Square Garden, kicking off the final full week of campaigning in the heart of Manhattan. The Trump campaign trotted out a number of high profile speakers to excite the crowd. And while Trump is unlikely to be competitive in New York on Election Day, the event served as a way to generate significant media attention and deliver something akin to a closing message to voters. But some of the earlier speakers overshadowed the event with their incendiary rhetoric. Here are five takeaways. Trump’s closing message sounds familiar The former president’s Madison Square Garden rally was billed as the opening salvo of his closing argument to voters just nine days before Election Day. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters There were signs of a closing message scattered throughout Trump’s speech. He opened his remarks by asking attendees if they were better off than they were four years ago. 'On issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it. And we’re going to fix it,' Trump said later as supporters seated behind the stage waved signs that read, 'Trump Will Fix It.' But those looking for a clearer, more concise message heard more of the same from Trump as he repeated many of his same attacks on Vice President Harris’s intelligence, described the U.S. as an 'occupied country' because of the surge in immigration at the southern border and emphasized his plans to impose tariffs on foreign imports and companies that outsource production. The former president repeated many of the same anecdotes he tells at other rallies, including one about watching a SpaceX launch and another claiming New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges for speaking out about the surge in migrants in the city. Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City rally Trump brings out high profile allies Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, billionaire Elon Musk, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), Donald Trump Jr., Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Hulk Hogan and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) were among those who took the stage ahead of the former president. Former first lady Melania Trump made an extremely rare campaign appearance, delivering brief remarks and introducing her husband. The slew of speakers are unlikely to win over voters on the fence, but their presence on the trail could boost enthusiasm among Trump’s base and among less reliable voting blocs, such as young men. Musk and Carlson in particular have become popular with Trump’s base and have had a more active role on the trail in the closing weeks of the campaign. 'This is a real election battle. So you need to get friends and families to vote. Make sure they vote. Vote early. This is important,' said Musk, who basked in the adoration of the crowd. Carlson spoke at a Trump rally in Georgia last week and will host an event with the former president in Arizona on Thursday. Musk has backed a major super PAC working on get out the vote efforts for the Trump campaign, spending millions on the effort. He has also campaigned in the key battleground of Pennsylvania, even as some of his efforts to register swing state voters have drawn legal scrutiny. Harris stumps in Philadelphia 9 days out from Election Day Guest speakers stir controversy The parade of guest speakers who preceded Trump seemed intent on creating controversial headlines for the party, hurling racist and sexist insults. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by Kill Tony, delivered a set that included inflammatory attacks on Puerto Ricans. 'There’s a lot going on. Like I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,' Hinchcliffe said, eliciting mixed reactions from the crowd. Harris campaign aides noted that Hinchcliffe's remarks came as the vice president was in Philadelphia speaking at a Puerto Rican restaurant, where she detailed her plans to assist the island and bolster its electrical grid. Others noted the key battleground of Pennsylvania is home to hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans. Carlson mocked Harris’s racial identity. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters Sid Rosenberg, a New York City radio host whose show Trump calls into periodically, blasted Democrats in derogatory and explicit terms. 'She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton. What a sick son of a bitch,' he said of the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee. 'The whole fucking party. A bunch of degenerates.' One speaker described Harris as 'the devil' and 'the antichrist.' Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani spent a portion of his remarks fear-mongering about Palestinians, saying they are taught to 'kill us at 2 years old' and are 'on the side of the terrorists.' 'Usually pre-game speeches matter little. Pretty remarkable Trump’s MSG warm up acts are all creating controversy and content that will hurt him,' senior Harris campaign aide David Plouffe posted on X. 'And that’s before his Soviet style speech that will generate much material of concern to the remaining undecided voters.' When will next COVID surge start? Experts weigh in Trump repeats ‘enemy from within’ attack The former president has drawn backlash from Democrats in recent weeks as he has repeatedly labeled his political rivals the 'enemy from within' and suggested his opponents are worse than foreign adversaries. On Sunday, Trump defended and repeated that line. 'When I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy. Becomes a soundbite – ‘Oh how can he say…,’' Trump said. 'No, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we’re fighting.' He later disparaged the press as the 'enemy of the people.' Trump has used the line repeatedly in recent weeks, including in an interview with Fox News when he suggested the military could be used to quell protests from his critics. Those comments have been at the center of criticism from some of his former top White House aides and from the Harris campaign. The former president’s insistence on using such harsh attacks against his critics come as some Republicans have claimed Democrats are going too far with their rhetoric by labeling Trump a fascist. DOD lacked paperwork for $1.1B in Ukraine aid: Inspector general Another tax proposal Trump rolled out one new policy, and it is one that echoed something first proposed by his opponent. 'I am announcing a new policy today that I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one. It's about time that they were recognized,' Trump said. Harris earlier this month introduced a new plan to expand Medicare benefits so that the program covers the costs of long-term home care for older Americans. The plan is aimed at helping the 'sandwich generation' who are caring for both their own children and their aging parents. Trump has previously called for eliminating taxes on tipped wages, overtime and Social Security benefits, though some experts have questioned how Trump would pay for those tax cuts without expanding the deficit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-madison-square-garden-rally/	2024-10-27T18:49:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/donald-melania-trump-nyc-ap.jpg?w=900
Harris stumps in Philadelphia 9 days out from Election Day	Vice President Harris rallied voters in Philadelphia on Sunday as the race between her and former President Trump grows tighter nine days out from Election Day. Harris largely stuck to her stump speech in nearly 15 minute remarks from downtown Philadelphia, urging voters in battleground Pennsylvania to head to the polls. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'There is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days,' Harris told the crowd. Harris gave a special shoutout to young voters, in particular, praising them for their political activism on climate, gun control and abortion access. 'Is Gen Z in the house?' the vice president said. 'You are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient. You, who have only known the climate crisis — you are leaders in what we need to do to protect our planet.' 'You, who grew up with active shooter drills,' she continued. 'You, who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, understand the importance of fighting for the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.' Harris spent Sunday campaigning throughout the city, which will play a critical role in Democratic turnout within the battleground state. Earlier in the day, Harris visited West Philadelphia where she spoke at the Church of Christian Compassion, a Black church in the neighborhood, and visited a local barbershop. The vice president also made stops at a bookstore specializing in Black history, and a Puerto Rican restaurant. Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City rally 'Philadelphia is a very important part of our path to victory,' Harris told reporters. 'It’s the reason I have been spending time here.' Pennsylvania will likely play a consequential role in the election with its 19 Electoral College votes. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average shows a razor thin race, with Trump narrowly leading nationally, 48.5 percent to 48.3 percent. While Harris spent Sunday in Philadelphia, Trump was preparing to stump at Manhattan’s Madison Square Garden. The event is expected to draw thousands of supporters in deep blue New York City, including a number of Republican lawmakers. While New York City is considered a Democratic stronghold, it is home to a massive media market and in relatively close proximity to a handful of competitive House races.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-philadelphia/	2024-10-27T17:51:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kamala-harris-philadelphia-rally-oct-27-ap.jpg?w=900
Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City ral...	Former first lady Melania Trump made an exceedingly rare appearance Sunday on the campaign trail when she delivered remarks at her husband's rally in New York City. The former first lady was not listed among the expected speakers publicized by the Trump campaign, but she introduced her husband at the Madison Square Garden event. She spoke for less than 5 minutes, arguing the country was dealing with a decline in quality of life. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'Let us charge together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let’s seize this moment and create a country for tomorrow — the future that we deserve,' Melania Trump said. She stood on stage and embraced former President Trump as he arrived for his speech. The former first lady has hardly attended any public campaign events with her husband. The Madison Square Garden event was the first rally she has appeared at during this cycle, and she attended the Republican National Convention in July, though she did not speak. The first lady hosted two fundraisers for the LGBTQ group Log Cabin Republicans this year: one at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and another in New York City. The former model made waves earlier this month when she wrote in her memoir about her support for abortion access and for women to make choices about their bodies 'based on their own convictions.' Democrats have hammered the 45th president on the issue of abortion, blaming him and his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices for the end of Roe v. Wade. Donald Trump said he told his wife that she should follow her heart when writing about the topic in her memoir.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/melania-trump-new-york-city-rally-msg/	2024-10-27T17:49:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/melania-trump-nyc-ap.jpg?w=900
Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new policy platform for Puerto Rico on Sunday, targeting the Latino vote ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election through promises of economic development and improved disaster response. While residents of Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections despite being American citizens, the message was aimed at more than 5.8 million people of Puerto Rican origin living on the mainland who can vote, according to Pew Research Center. The announcement gained additional visibility when Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny shared Harris' video message on Instagram, highlighting her criticism of former President Donald Trump's response to Hurricane Maria in 2017. Couple recounts surviving Hurricane Helene on floating couch 'Throughout my career, I've always fought for the people of Puerto Rico,' Harris said in the video. 'Every chance he got, Donald Trump abandoned and insulted them.' Harris outlined several initiatives, including creating a Puerto Rico Opportunity Economy Task Force to foster economic growth and create thousands of new jobs. She also promised to accelerate disaster recovery funds and modernize the island's electrical grid, which still experiences daily outages. 'I will cut red tape to ensure disaster recovery funds are used quickly and effectively, and work with leaders across the island to ensure all Puerto Ricans have access to reliable, affordable electricity,' Harris said. The video release follows Harris' March 22 visit to Puerto Rico, where she toured hurricane recovery efforts. During the five-hour visit, Harris visited a rebuilt home in Canovanas that Hurricane Maria had destroyed. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters 'I see we are making a difference. There is still more work to do,' Harris said during the visit, noting that the federal government has provided about $3 billion for reliable energy sources, including rooftop solar panels. The visit wasn't without controversy. A small group of protesters gathered in San Juan to demonstrate against Puerto Rico's territorial status and demand a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanted 'Yankee, go home!' while supporters responded with chants of 'U.S.A.!' NewsNation's Jackie Koppell, Kellie Meyer and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-puerto-rico-policy/	2024-10-27T15:15:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/6628e8e7a9b2f9.43616549.jpeg?w=900
New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ imm...	New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) on Sunday defended Vice President Harris’s support for the bipartisan border legislation and pushed back on the suggestion that she was upsetting both poles of the party by sidestepping difficult issues on the topic. In an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday,' Chris Stirewalt asked Grisham whether Harris's lack of response on whether she would continue building a border wall—coupled with her push for a conservative bipartisan border bill—has managed to push away voters from both extremes of the party. Michigan Republican: Trump ‘has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community’ 'I don't think that she is stuck. I think we've gotten stuck largely driven, frankly, by the Republican Party, and when the Republicans were in the majority,' Grisham said about whether Harris is stuck between these two dissatisfied groups. The border governor, also a Harris surrogate, said the vice president is not ruling out the possibility of doing more to improve immigration and border security by supporting the bill that never made it through Congress this past term. 'She is not eliminating the possibility that it could be bolder and bigger on either side of that equation,' Grisham said, 'protecting the people who are here, the folks who have followed the laws of this country once they got here, kids who knew no other country other than this one, than their own and their families, and also curbing illegal immigration at the border by creating upstream opportunities for getting visas and asylum protections.' 'That's smart, and I want the border security smart border security,' she said. 'That's what every border state governor wants.' New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority Grisham was asked about Harris’s response to reporters, who pushed the Democratic nominee to answer whether construction of a southern border wall would continue in her administration. 'I will tell you that my highest priority is to put the resources into ensuring that our border is secure, which is why I've been very clear I'm going to bring back up as president that bipartisan border security bill and make sure that it is brought to my desk so I can sign it into law,' Harris said in response this past week, in a clip that Stirewalt played on the show.

Michigan Republican: Trump ‘has got a tremendous support from the...	Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) said on Sunday the Muslim community in Michigan trusts former President Trump over Vice President Harris to guide Middle East policy. 'For the people of the state of Michigan, actions speak louder than words. I was just at a rally yesterday with former President Trump, and I can share with you, he has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community, and it's because they want peace in the Middle East,' McClain said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority 'And they trust him much more as a leader than they ever would under Vice President Harris,' she continued. Stirewalt noted Trump has supported military action by Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem during his administration. He asked McClain whether she thinks the issue 'comes down to' whether 'they like his leadership vibe better.' 'I think they like the fact that under President Trump, there was peace in the Middle East. There weren't wars that were raging. We didn't have any Americans held hostage in the Middle East like we do now under this Harris and Biden administration,' she responded. 'That's what they liked.' New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ immigration legislation Muslim and Arab Americans have pushed the Democratic ticket to take further steps to hold Israel accountable for Palestinian deaths stemming from its war with Hamas and other Iranian proxy groups in the region. A recent poll showed Trump leading Harris nationally among Arab American and Muslim voters, by 4 points, amid criticism of the Biden administration’s support for Israel.

Comedian calls Puerto Rico ‘island of garbage’ at Trump rally	(The Hill, NewsNation) — A speaker at former President Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday spent a portion of his time attacking Puerto Rico, drawing backlash from Democrats and the Harris campaign. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by Kill Tony, delivered a set to the crowd ahead of the former president’s speech. 'There’s a lot going on. Like, I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,' Hinchcliffe said, eliciting mixed reactions from the crowd. At another point, Hinchcliffe said Latinos 'love making babies.' Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They c** inside. Just like they did to our country,' he said. Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement that Hinchcliffe’s 'joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' The remarks, particularly about Puerto Rico, were swiftly condemned by Democrats, as well as some Republicans. 'As a Puerto Rican, I am tempted to call Hinchcliffe racist garbage but doing so would be an insult to garbage,' Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) posted on the social platform X. 'When casting their ballots at the voting booth, Latinos should never forget the racism that Donald Trump seems all too willing to platform.' Harris campaign aides noted Hinchcliffe’s remarks came as Vice President Harris was in Philadelphia speaking at a Puerto Rican restaurant, where she detailed her plans to assist the island and bolster its electrical grid. Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally: 5 takeaways Other Democrats pointed out that hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans live in Pennsylvania, which is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds on Election Day. 'Who wants to tell these guys there are ~ HALF A MILLION Puerto Ricans living in Battleground PA, whose votes are up for grabs?' Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House official who is an outspoken critic of the former president, posted on the social platform X. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who is up for reelection in November, said Hinchcliffe’s comments were 'not funny' and 'not true.' 'Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans! I’ve been to the island many times. It’s a beautiful place. Everyone should visit!' Scott posted on X. 'I will always do whatever I can to help any Puerto Rican in Florida or on the island.' Former Puerto Rico governor demands Trump denounce comments Former Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló on 'NewsNation Prime' called on Trump to denounce 'egregious' and 'insulting' comments made by the comedian. 'We were just called garbage in Madison Square Garden, no less, the home state of over a million Puerto Ricans,' said Rosselló, who currently serves as a congressional delegate. 'This is egregious. It's insulting, and it will cost President Trump if he does not address this.' Rosselló emphasized Puerto Rico's contributions to the United States, noting the territory has one of the highest per capita military participation rates in the nation. He called the island 'an incubator that generates innovation and art' with a legacy of patriotism. 'If you do not denounce this strongly, this is what you're saying, this is what you're supporting,' Rosselló said, urging Trump to use his social media platforms to 'reject the statement of a comedian then recall his love for the people of Puerto Rico.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-rally-puerto-rico-garbage/	2024-10-27T14:35:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/puertorico_051922_ap_ricardoarguengo.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump, Vance rally New Yorkers at Madison Square Gard...	Former President Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) are campaigning in New York City on Sunday, holding an event at the iconic Madison Square Garden. The event is expected to draw thousands to the arena at the center of deep-blue Manhattan. Others expected to make an appearance include the former president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr., former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, billionaire Elon Musk, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.). It’s extremely unlikely Trump will win the state, which hasn’t backed a GOP presidential candidate since 1984. With just over a week until Election Day, The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of early polls shows Vice President Harris with a sizable lead over the GOP nominee — 58 percent to 40.2 percent — in the Empire State. The rally is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT. Watch the live video above.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/watch-live-trump-vance-rally-new-yorkers-at-madison-square-garden/	2024-10-27T14:11:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300621630295-e1729967862738.jpg?w=900
New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House maj...	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Democrats are going all-in on efforts to flip New York’s 4th Congressional District blue, funneling big names and money into the Long Island locale with hopes that a victory could help usher in a Democratic House majority next year. The district, which sits on the South Shore of Long Island, holds the title of most Democratic-leaning district currently represented by a Republican. The area broke for President Biden by 14.6 percentage points in 2020. But in 2022, Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito beat Democrat Laura Gillen for the district’s open House seat by 3.6 points, putting the liberal bastion in GOP hands for the first time in more than two decades. This year's race — one of the most competitive this cycle — is a rematch between D’Esposito and Gillen, a take-two showdown that has drawn outsize attention, and fundraising, on the national stage. In a sign of its importance, the top three House Democrats — Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — have visited to campaign with Gillen this month, while House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) recently made a stop for D’Esposito. Democrats need to net four seats to take control of the chamber next year, and Jeffries — speaking at a rally for Gillen in a packed Hempstead gymnasium — said the race is key to that effort. Early voting began Saturday in New York. 'No pressure on y'all,' Jeffries said. 'But one of four seats that we need to win.' Gillen is leading D’Esposito 53 percent to 41 percent among likely voters in a new Newsday/Siena College poll, with less than a month to go until Election Day. The margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. Money and turnout could swing race The race is one of 75 House rematches from 2022, according to Ballotpedia. And this time around, both candidates say the contest is different. Gillen, a former Hempstead town supervisor, told The Hill during a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office that additional resources, an earlier campaign launch and reverberations from the 2022 Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade are fueling her optimism this cycle. 'I didn’t have the resources to communicate at the level I’d like to to talk to women about what the Dobbs decision really meant, even if you live in a blue state. And also to talk about other issues that people care about,' said Gillen, seated next to Clark. 'In this race, I worked really hard, I got in early, I got the runway I needed to raise the resources to communicate to all the folks in this district at the levels I’d like,' she added. Gillen has also significantly outraised D’Esposito throughout the race: The Democrat has raked in nearly $5.69 million thus far, with D’Esposito trailing at $4.24 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The numbers mark a staggering increase from 2020, when Gillen brought in $1.83 million to D’Esposito’s $1.33 million. D’Esposito’s fundraising deficit is even larger when assessing outside spending. House Majority PAC, the fund associated with Jeffries, has spent $5.43 million on the race, while the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is endorsed by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), has funneled just $3.35 million into the rematch. In an interview with The Hill at Hempstead Town Hall, D’Esposito — after an hour-plus town hall with roughly a dozen veterans — pointed to his cash disadvantage when asked if this year’s race feels different from his 2022 match-up, and attributed it to the national Democratic Party. 'It’s the fact that Hakeem Jeffries wants to be Speaker of the House, and he wants it to run through New York,' D’Esposito said. 'And quite frankly, he should have chose someone else, because Nassau County is not gonna allow a liberal Laura Gillen to take this seat.' While the candidates cited the money game when discussing the difference between now and 2022, Jeffries had a different theory in mind: voter turnout. Republicans crushed Democrats in turnout in 2022. Of the 250,142 registered Democrats in the district, only 130,871 cast a ballot for Gillen — a 52.32 percent turnout. In contrast, of the 168,934 registered Republicans in the district, 140,622 came out in support of D’Esposito — an 83.24 percent turnout. Jeffries — during his gaggle with reporters after Gillen’s rally — said he is focused on turning out the Democratic vote this cycle, which will lead the party to victory in November. 'There were 100,000 Democrats who stayed home during the midterm elections in 2022,' Jeffries said, standing below a scoreboard in the gymnasium with the home score set to 11, the guest score at 5, and 20:24 as the time — an homage to Election Day. 'We’re going to make sure that those Democrats come out to vote, and when they do, it’ll ensure that Laura Gillen is elected the next congressperson from the 4th Congressional district.' Candidates moderate on immigration, abortion The purple nature of the district — Cook Political Report rates the race a 'toss-up' — has encouraged both candidates to moderate their stances on a number of hot-button issues. Gillen has taken the issue of immigration head-on, sending a letter to President Biden recommending executive action pertaining to the border and cutting an ad that directly addresses the matter. D’Esposito, meanwhile, has worked to present himself as a moderate on the issue of reproductive rights. Gillen’s immigration strategy mimics that of Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who leaned into the issue during his successful campaign to replace ousted Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.). 'I’m Laura Gillen, and I’m here at the border — of Nassau County,' she says in the ad. 'We’re 2,000 miles from Mexico, but we’re feeling the migrant crisis almost every day. So I want you to hear me loud and clear: You send me to Congress, I will work with anyone in any party to secure our southern border, lock up criminals pushing fentanyl and stop the migrant crisis.' Gillen told The Hill the issue of immigration is 'an issue that people in my district care about very much' before criticizing both parties for the 'lack of political will' to tackle it. Colleen Ryan, a D’Esposito supporter, mentioned immigration when asking a question at the incumbent’s town hall focused on veterans' issues. Afterward, she called the influx of migrants a 'problem.' 'I support immigration,' Ryan told The Hill. 'It is the problem with illegal immigration, and they are being transported around the country and they have a disregard for the law of the land. And that’s demoralizing. … I’m absolutely for Anthony D’Esposito stopping the lawbreaking.' If immigration has been a leading issue for Republicans, women’s reproductive rights has been a top issue for Democrats, with the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022 continuing to motivate liberal voters across the country. During a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office, Gillen and Clark sought to paint D’Esposito as extreme when it comes to the issue of abortion, arguing he would sign a nationwide ban on the procedure and knocking him for calling it a 'state issue.' D’Esposito, however, has strongly rejected that interpretation. He told The Hill that he would never sign a nationwide abortion ban, touted his part in keeping an appropriations bill off the House floor that would have restricted access to the abortion pill mifepristone, and named bills he has co-sponsored that protect in vitro fertilization. 'When it comes to abortion, I have been a champion of women’s rights,' he said. Helene Spierman, a Gillen supporter who has lived in the district for 25 years, listed women’s reproductive rights as a top issue for her this cycle. 'That everybody has a voice and that people are created equal and that the government has got to trust that,' she said. 'I could say that it’s abortion, I could say that it’s the Constitution, I could say that it’s not going back to the 17th century, the 18th century, when the Constitution was written.' September surprise threatens to shake up race While those issues — and others — have dominated the campaign, a September surprise is threatening to shake up the race. The New York Times published a bombshell report last month alleging D’Esposito, shortly after being sworn into the House, hired his longtime fiancée’s daughter and a woman he was having an affair with. D’Esposito has repeatedly denied engaging in any wrongdoing and claimed he has abided by ethical standards throughout his tenure in Congress. He told The Hill the story was 'a political hit piece' and said he is 'absolutely not' concerned about backlash from the report on Election Day. That response, however, is not putting the story to bed. The Times report was the subject of the first question at the N.Y.-4 debate earlier this month, putting D’Esposito on the defensive out of the gate. He reiterated his denial, before reading off a number of headlines from right-leaning outlets calling Gillen’s ethics into question. Gillen, for her part, has leaned into the allegations against D’Esposito in the final stretch of the election. She referenced the report during her rally in Hempstead alongside Jeffries, and she tore into his alleged 'abuse of power' during an interview with The Hill. The Times report is likely to be a mainstay of Gillen’s final pitch to voters, in addition to her message on the economy, state and local taxes, immigration and women’s reproductive rights — an all-encompassing campaign trail blitz as Democrats look to reclaim the coveted seat after the crushing loss last cycle. 'A setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback,' Jeffries said at his rally with Gillen. 'We had a setback in 2022. Are we ready for a comeback?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/new-york-rematch-could-hold-key-to-democratic-quest-for-house-majority/	2024-10-27T14:02:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GillenLaura_102424ap.jpg?w=900
Crowd waits outside Madison Square Garden hours ahead of Donald T...	MANHATTAN, N.Y. (PIX11) -- Around eight hours before Donald Trump's campaign rally starts, a crowd has already amassed outside Madison Square Garden Sunday morning. The rally is expected to kick off around 5 p.m., but roads were already closed around the stadium early Sunday morning, and security was in place. The crowd was allowed into Madison Square Garden starting around 12 p.m. Yamamoto, Freeman lead Dodgers to 4-2 win over Yankees, 2-0 Series lead A crowd waiting outside Madison Square Garden hours ahead of a Donald Trump campaign rally. (PIX11 News) Before 8 a.m. Sunday, huge crowds of supporters in American flag and Trump merch lined the block around the venue. 'There's a lot of energy, people are very sleep-deprived, everyone woke up really early, but it doesn't matter people are so hyped up,' said Greenpoint resident Anthony Filipelli. 'Regardless if you support him or not, this event is just an iconic American event.' Trump will be accompanied by a host of high-profile speakers at Sunday's rally, including his running mate Sen. JD Vance, Rudy Giuliani, former presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his kids. Elon Musk is also expected to appear at Sunday's rally. One person, Michael Barbuzze told PIX11 News he had been at the venue since 5 a.m. 'I definitely am excited, I really wanted to see him,' one person in line told PIX11 News. 'I'm here to show solidarity. ... He calls it like he sees it.' Counter-protesters are expected to demonstrate at Sunday's rally, including billboard trucks and a town hall organized by the Lincoln Project. Organizers with Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice also planned to protest the event. When the rally was announced, local elected official Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal called for it to be canceled. 'This is a disastrous decision by Madison Square Garden that will endanger the public safety of New Yorkers and has the potential to incite widespread violence,' Hoylman-Sigal said in a post to X. Other elected officials, like Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, celebrated the rally. 'The Garden is the world’s biggest stage and the perfect forum for President Trump,' she said. A rally for Trump on Long Island in September drew huge crowds that camped out overnight and throughout the day of the rally. The following streets are expected to be closed Sunday for the Donald Trump rally: 33rd Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 32nd Street between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue 31st Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 30th Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue Seventh Avenue will be closed to pedestrians from 34th to 29th Street This is a developing story.

Walz, AOC to play Madden on Twitch in an appeal to young men	Vice President Harris's running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) are set to play Madden NFL together on the live-streaming platform Twitch on Sunday. The announcement comes as the Harris campaign seeks to court young male voters, a voting bloc that former President Trump seems to be leading with in the polls. The Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll found that the gender gap among youth supporters of Harris and Trump more than doubled since the spring, growing from 8 percentage points in the spring, when President Biden was the Democratic nominee, to 20 points now, with Harris as the party’s candidate. Polling has also shown the Democratic nominee trailing behind Trump among male voters in key swing states. A CNN/SSRS poll from September showed Trump leading Harris among likely male voters in Pennsylvania by 15 points — 55 percent to 40 percent — and Harris leading Trump among female voters in the state by 11 points — 53 percent to 42 percent. The survey of likely voters in Nevada showed Trump with an 18-point lead among male voters, 57 percent to 39 percent, while Harris had a 16-point lead among female voters, 55 percent to 39 percent. The campaign has used Twitch to attract younger voters in the past, even using the platform, along with TikTok, YouTube and more than a dozen digital services, to stream the Democratic National Convention in August. This announcement also comes amid a series of ads on Yahoo Sports and DraftKings — platforms with predominantly male audiences — launched by the Harris campaign last week specifically aimed at winning over young male voters. Earlier this month, some Democrats expressed worry that Harris is struggling to engage men in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. 'She has a problem with men for the same reason Hillary Clinton did: because misogyny exists, as do outdated ideas about who should hold the presidency,' Democratic strategist Christy Setzer told The Hill earlier this month. 'Meanwhile, Trump has doubled down on this ‘strongman’ machismo and dictator’s act, playing ‘It’s a Man’s World’ at his rallies.' Clinton lost the male vote to Trump in 2016 by 11 points, 41 percent to 52 percent, while she won the female vote by 13 points, 54 percent to 41 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/walz-aoc-to-play-madden-on-twitch-in-an-appeal-to-young-men/	2024-10-27T13:06:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/OcasioCortezAlexandria_AOC.jpg?w=900
Tropical disturbance 'likely to develop' this week, NHC says	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Although we're nearing the end of hurricane season next month, the tropics are still active and popping up with disturbances. A new system has formed in the Caribbean that is 'likely to develop' sometime this week, according to the National Hurricane Center. All hands on deck as Florida recovers abandoned boats after Helene and Milton In the 8 a.m. ET update on Sunday, the disturbance shows a 30% chance for development over the next seven days. The NHC said gradual development is possible through the end of the week, as it moves northward or northeastward over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The system first popped up on Saturday afternoon with a 20% chance over the course of seven days. Earlier this month, the Caribbean region was impacted by Tropical Storm Oscar, which made landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane before disintegrating as it headed toward the Bahamas.

Driving the vote: Nebraska's electoral system divides voters	(NewsNation) — Omaha, Nebraska, is punching far above its weight class politically thanks to a unique way of assigning electoral votes that could play a key role in the upcoming election. Omaha is the home of Kool-Aid, the frozen TV dinner and Marlon Brando, the epicenter of baseball and a city with history. During World War II, a Japanese balloon bomb exploded in the air just a few miles from what is now Charles Schwab Field. Driving the vote: Ohio voters swapping parties Nebraska has an unorthodox way of awarding presidential electors, departing from the winner-take-all model used by almost all states. Two of the state's electoral votes go to the statewide winner and the winner in each congressional district gets one elector. Now, Nebraska is a reliably red state, but its 2nd Congressional District, which includes Omaha, can and does go blue. That's earned it the nickname the 'blue dot.' The importance of Omaha isn't lost on the campaigns, with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on the ground in the area early, a clue they both feel that it could be crucial in what is shaping up to be a nail-biter election. The oversized role of Nebraska's 2nd District has put the home of the College World Series in the spotlight for a very different reason. NewsNation brought together voters from the diverse district, where party lines prevailed when it came to how people felt about the system. Republicans want the state to go back to a winner-take-all system. 'I think it's us and Maine are the only two states that give up the congressional districts to separate them,' said Tony Connor. 'I think there should be consistency in every state. So I would like to see some consistency.' Driving the Vote: Will Black voters swing Pennsylvania for Trump? On the other side of the aisle, many Democrats like that the state legislature has stood up to GOP efforts to roll back Nebraska's system of awarding electors. 'I don't believe in winner-take-all. I don't think it matches the people's choice as well as it should,' said Jean Couchey. 'I think there's too many enclaves within the state that are not represented by that.' The district is not defined by being a blue dot alone. Where Interstate 80 runs just south of downtown, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats. 'We're on I-80. We're right in the middle of the country, and there's a lot of trafficking that comes right through her,' said Colleen Brennan. 'Human trafficking is a big problem. Drug trafficking is a huge problem.' One issue that sparks debate? Immigration. '[My] first language was Spanish,' said Dulce Sherman. 'I learned English. I'm successful. I mean, I'm the example that not all people that come from immigrants are bad people.' The diverse opinions reflect the bigger conversations across the nation. 'In many respects, this district becomes a microcosm of society,' said Randy Adkins. Adkins is a professor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, where he teaches campaigns and elections. He's happy to see the nation learning about how the Cornhusker State handles the race for the White House. Driving the vote: Illinois farmers feel forgotten in blue state 'I think it is unique. I think it is more democratic, with a small 'D,' in the sense that even the minority is represented somehow in the state, in the Electoral College vote, which doesn't happen in 48 out of 50 states,' he said. 'Or at least there's a possibility of that.' Like the rest of the nation, diverse views can, at times, result in heated debate, especially on controversial issues like abortion. 'My grandchildren, I want the ability for them to have a say in my body, my right to decide what I do with my body,' Dulce Sherman said. Another voter disagreed. 'It's not their body, it's not their choice,' said William Duerr. 'That body is a separate entity, a separate human being.' Still, the state has a strong sense of community bolstered by smart, civil discussion as voters cast their ballots to see exactly how Nebraska's unique electoral system will play out in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-vote-nebraska-electoral/	2024-10-27T10:26:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/Nebraska_2nddistrict_BidenTrump.jpg?w=900
Trump and Harris pledged to save Social Security. Here's what the...	(The Hill) — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both vowed to protect Social Security, but experts say both of their campaign platforms fall short of specific solutions for a program that faces threats to funding in roughly a decade. Recent estimates show not only would neither candidate’s agenda stave off the threat of insolvency — but that one’s proposals could worsen its budget outlook, absent ideas to tax or spending reforms to extend the lifetime of the program. Here’s some of what the candidates have said so far. Trump’s Social Security plans Trump drew attention during the summer by proposing eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits — one of a list of proposals aimed at providing tax relief to some Americans. However, experts have raised concerns about the costs of scrapping income taxes on Social Security checks and how it would impact the program’s finances. 'His proposal would have a significant financial impact on Social Security, because now, those income taxes that some beneficiaries pay account for about 4 percent of Social Security's revenues,' said Richard Johnson, senior fellow for the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Here’s what to do if you lose an absentee ballot before Election Day The combined trust funds for Social Security retirement and disability benefits are currently projected by the program’s trustees to run out in 2035, a year later than previously expected, after economic growth exceeded expectations last year. But under what Trump has proposed thus far, a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimated the program’s funds could run out by 2031 while increasing Social Security’s cash deficit by $2.3 trillion between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2035. A chunk of the cost comes from what the group identified as a roughly $950 billion price tag to eliminate income taxation of Social Security benefits. Trump’s campaign has come out strongly against the analysis, with its national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accusing the 'so-called experts' of being 'consistently wrong throughout the years.' 'President Trump delivered on his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare in his first term, and President Trump will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term,' Leavitt said. Leavitt said a second Trump administration would shore up Social Security funding by 'unleashing a new economic boom.' IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? Still, Trump’s agenda leaves experts guessing as to what changes he would support to shore up solvency for the program. In the official 2024 GOP policy platform highlighted on Trump’s campaign site, the plan calls for 'no cuts' to Social Security and Medicare, as well as 'no changes to the retirement age.' Harris on Social Security Harris’s online campaign page has vowed she will protect Social Security and 'strengthen' the program by 'making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes.' As part of the rollout for the proposed fiscal 2025 federal budget earlier this year, the Biden-Harris administration additionally outlined a pitch to extend solvency for the program by focusing on higher earners, noting that 'middle-class and lower-income Americans pay Social Security taxes on all of their earnings, but higher-income Americans do not.' Extra check coming to some Social Security recipients in November: Here’s why At the time, the White House said the president also opposed benefit cuts and proposals to privatize Social Security. But experts and budget hawks say the vice president’s agenda is still missing key details about her plans to shore up the program’s finances. In a statement Tuesday, Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said 'neither presidential candidate has addressed this challenge, and every year we fail to take action it only becomes more difficult to fix.' 'Overwhelming majorities of voters want candidates to prioritize solutions to strengthen Social Security, and the good news is that there are many available options to do just that,' he said, while also noting the program is 'less than a decade away from automatic, across-the-board cuts, putting many millions of current retirees at financial risk.' In the latest analysis by the CRFB, the group said Harris’s proposals 'would not have large effects on Social Security trust fund solvency.' Is this year’s COVID booster a good match for new variants? But polling has shown the program’s solvency is still one of importance for voters, with a recent poll out of the Peterson Foundation showing a vast majority of voters, 96 percent, say it’s important for 'candidates to have a plan to prevent automatic cuts to Social Security.' In their latest report over the summer, trustees projected the depletion date for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund, which pays out Social Security benefits to retirees, and the program’s smaller Disability Insurance Trust Fund, will be in 2035. Once the reserves of the OASI trust fund are depleted, the report projected that account income will only be able to cover roughly 80 percent of scheduled benefits for recipients. Experts say lawmakers will likely need to either agree to reductions on the benefits side, raising taxes, or both, to prevent automatic cuts to benefits for seniors if funds run out. Social Security announces 2.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2025 'The Social Security date has not changed much in probably the past decade, and yet, what we have seen is, with each presidential election, we’re getting closer and closer to that day of reckoning. And so we should become more and more urgent,' Johnson said. 'So, it's a little bit surprising that we haven't seen more specific proposals.' 'On the other hand, these proposals would involve some pain — either more taxes or lower benefits. And pain doesn't always win you votes,' he added. The Hill has reached out to Harris’s campaign for further comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-and-harris-pledged-to-save-social-security-heres-what-theyll-do/	2024-10-27T07:31:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24295819243226-e1729602526227_09e742-e1729713450753.jpg?w=800
Scrutiny over Sheehy’s military record grows in Montana Senate ra...	Intensifying scrutiny over businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy’s military record could shake up the Senate race in Montana, where Sheehy, the GOP candidate, is pulling away from Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in the polls. Sheehy, a decorated combat veteran, has been dogged for months by questions about a bullet wound he claimed he received during a firefight in Afghanistan after it came to light that a park ranger reported in 2015 that he shot himself accidentally in a parking lot at Glacier National Park. Sheehy now claims that he fabricated the story that he shot himself in the parking lot to explain to cover up for a fellow soldier whose bullet ricocheted into his arm during a skirmish in Afghanistan. Longtime observers of Montana politics say the late-breaking controversy of Sheehy’s military record could impact voters, though they question whether it’s enough to help Tester save his seat. 'It goes to credibility and from that standpoint it has the potential to impact the race,' said David McCumber, the former editor of The Montana Standard and the former regional editor for Lee Enterprises in central Montana. 'From what I hear and from reading accounts and ads, it’s clearly the topic of conversation,' he said, explaining that the question of credibility is 'where Sheehy is vulnerable with it.' 'He gets big points for being a decorated veteran. There’s no question about that,' he added, noting that Montana is home to many veterans who served in war. 'The default is that Sheehy is a veteran and deserves a lot of credit for that but I think this has the potential to undercut. It does deal with his military service and it doesn’t pass the smell test.' Sheehy served as a Navy SEAL officer in Iraq, Afghanistan, South America and the Pacific, earning a Bronze Star with Valor and a Purple Heart across dozens of engagements with enemy forces, according to his campaign website. Sheehy’s conflicting accounts of his arm injury was the subject of stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times earlier this month, but the issue is now getting more attention in Montana, where a group of military veterans supporting Tester this week demanded that Sheehy release his medical records. The Washington Post first broke the story that Sheehy told a park ranger in 2015 that he shot himself after dropping his revolver in a parking lot. The ranger, Kim Peach, told The New York Times in an interview: 'I am 100 percent sure he shot himself that day,' referring to the October 2015 incident that he responded to in Glacier. Peach says Sheehy told him at a hospital outside the park that his .45 caliber revolver discharged accidently after he dropped it, hitting him in the arm. Peach investigated the incident after a someone reported a shot being fired in a parking lot to the ranger station. In a written statement to the park service, Sheehy testified that 'while reloading our vehicle an improperly placed firearm kept in the vehicle for bear protection fell out and discharged into my right forearm.' Sheehy paid a $525 fine to settle the matter, as discharging a firearm in a national park is illegal. Sheehy’s lawyers told The Times that Sheehy did indeed sustain the wound in Afghanistan, but did not initially report the wound because he suspected it was caused by friendly fire. But when Sheehy went to the hospital nine years for an unrelated injury, doctors told him he needed to explain the bullet still embedded in his arm to law enforcement. The attorney said Sheehy made up the story of accidentally shooting himself to protect his former platoonmates and that any attempt to dispute his claim of being wounded in combat is 'tantamount to falsely accusing him of stolen valor.' Katie Martin, a spokesperson for the Sheehy campaign, said he 'served our nation with honor' and said attempts to raise questions about his character and military record were 'appalling.' 'Tim Sheehy humbly served our nation with honor and served alongside many heroes. Many of them never came home. Full stop. The bullet in Tim’s arm was a result of his service in Afghanistan. Tim never reported it because he didn’t want to trigger an investigation of his team, be pulled from the battlefield, and see a fellow teammate be punished,' Martin said. 'It was always about protecting a fellow team member of his unit he thought could have been responsible due to friendly fire ricochet in the heat of an engagement with the enemy,' the spokesperson added. 'To witness the media in cahoots with Jon Tester and his allies attempting to tear down a combat veteran’s record is appalling, and they should be ashamed of themselves. It shows just how desperate they are to win this U.S. Senate race. Jon Tester doesn’t care about veterans and their sacrifices; he only cares about another term in office.' Now Tester is pressing the issue in a new television ad highlighting skepticism about Sheehy’s claim that he was wounded in combat as he has described on the campaign trail. Tester ad shows a clip of Sheehy claiming 'I have a bullet stuck in this arm still from Afghanistan' juxtaposed with media reports that a national park ranger, Kim Peach, is certain Sheehy instead shot himself accidently. A new television ad was also launched this week by Senate Majority PAC, the Senate Democrats’ biggest super PAC, features a video clip of a former SEAL who trained with Sheehy contesting his one-time friend’s claim that he was shot in Afghanistan. 'Tim and I had about as close a working relationship in the platoon as possible. So when he says he took a bullet in the arm in Afghanistan, we all know it’s not true. We would have seen it, we would have heard about it,' said Dave Madden, the former SEAL who also shared his skepticism about Sheehy’s claim in an interview with The New York Times. NBC Montana, MTN News and other local media outlets have picked up on the story in recent days. Several military veterans supporting Tester held a press conference in Missoula Tuesday demanding that Sheehy release his medical records to help clear up the controversy. 'If Tim Sheehy really wants to tell Montanans the truth, he could come clean and release his medical records from the Kalispell hospital from that day in Glacier,' Jonas Rides At The Door, a Marine Corps combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served in Iraq, told The Daily Montanan. The Sheehy campaign responded Friday with its own television ad pushing back on Tester and others questioning his story of being shot in the arm during combat. 'Jon Tester is desperate and losing. Seen these Democrat lies?' the ad’s narrator says at the start of the ad, which labels the park ranger who blew the whistle on Sheehy 'a never Trumper.' Sheehy tells viewers 'I joined the Navy at 18, I met my wife in the military' and shares more details about his military service. He said he received the Purple Heart after 'being wounded by an IED' and a Bronze Star with Valor 'after carrying a wounded brother out of enemy fire.' He makes no mention of the bullet lodged in his arm, however. Martin said Sheehy got into the race 'to put our country first and won’t ever let any of this slander stop him from fighting every day as your next U.S. senator.' 'What Montanans know is that Tim Sheehy is an American Warrior who fought for our country and laid his life on the line for our freedoms. Anyone trying to take away from the fact that he signed up for war as a young man and spent most of his 20s in some of the most dangerous places in the world is either a partisan hack, a journalist with an agenda, or outright a disgusting person,' she said. Political handicappers have said that Sheehy, who is leading Tester in recent polls, is likely to win the race in a state that former President Trump carried by 16 points in 2020. But Democrats want to change the dynamics of the race in the final week by raising questions about his credibility and character. A group called Republicans for Tester has taken out full-page newspaper ads statewide next week accusing Sheehy of 'dishonesty about his service.' It features a blown-up image of the park ranger’s report of the shooting at Glacier and quotes from veterans criticizing the Republican candidate.

Unnamed pro athlete stopped assault at 2022 Diddy party: Lawsuit	(NewsNation) — A professional athlete stopped a drunken Sean 'Diddy' Combs from sexually assaulting a 'luxury car businessman' at a party in 2022, a lawsuit obtained by the New York Post alleges. The alleged victim said Diddy invited him into a private office during a launch party for the music mogul's Ciroc vodka brand. He claims Combs took off his pants and exposed himself when they were alone. 'Combs continued to move closer and then grabbed Plaintiff’s genitals through his pants, squeezing them in a rough and sexual manner,' the suit alleges. 'Plaintiff, shocked and disoriented, frozen momentarily and did not know how to respond to the weirdly inappropriate sexual advance made by Combs,' it continues. What we know about the Diddy investigation The assault was stopped by 'Professional Athlete A,' who came into the office and intervened, the documents allege. The sports star was not named. Only identified as 'John Doe,' the plaintiff runs a Los Angeles-based business renting luxury cars and jewelry. He'd worked with Diddy for years before the alleged assault, the lawsuit claims. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline Diddy has been at the center of a storm of controversy and legal troubles where multiple individuals have come forward with allegations of sexual assault against him, leading to a series of lawsuits.

Trump claims Harris ‘guaranteed’ to get US into World War III	Former President Trump claimed that Vice President Harris is 'guaranteed' to get the United States into World War III if she is elected president, continuing intense rhetoric common throughout the 2024 campaign. Trump spoke at a rally in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday, arguing that Harris would be incompetent at dealing with other country’s leaders like Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'To make her president would be to gamble with the lives of millions of people,' he said. 'She would get us into a World War III guaranteed because she is too grossly incompetent to do the job.' Trump continued that people’s 'sons and daughters will end up getting drafted to go fight for a war in a country that you’ve never heard of.' Later in the speech, Trump vowed that he would avoid World War III even as the country has 'never been so close' to it occurring. Which newspapers have endorsed and not endorsed Trump and Harris? Trump also repeated past arguments that conflicts like the one stemming from Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel would not have happened if he had been president. The former president’s remarks come after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a letter on Friday denouncing Harris’s calling Trump a 'fascist,' a term that Trump himself has used for Harris. Johnson and McConnell said, 'The Democratic nominee for President of the United States has only fanned the flames beneath a boiling cauldron of political animus. Her most recent and most reckless invocations of the darkest evil of the 20th century seem to dare it to boil over.' 'Labeling a political opponent as a ‘fascist’ risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before Election Day,' they said, referencing the two assassination attempts on Trump earlier this year. Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan Harris had previously not used the word fascist to describe Trump but said she believed he is one at the CNN town hall she participated in on Wednesday. The answer came in response to a question about Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly, saying Trump 'certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.' Following the first assassination attempt on Trump in July, members of both parties called for toning down political rhetoric to avoid such a politically charged environment that could lead to incidents like that one. But language from both candidates largely returned to normal soon after.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-claims-harris-guaranteed-to-get-us-into-world-war-iii/	2024-10-26T17:23:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300818698844.jpg?w=900
Which newspapers have and not endorsed Trump and Harris?	(NewsNation) — The Washington Post announced Friday it will no longer endorse presidential candidates, abandoning a 30-year tradition amid reports that owner Jeff Bezos blocked a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The decision comes as major newspapers increasingly step back from presidential endorsements, with the Los Angeles Times making a similar move this week. Washington Post publisher William Lewis said the decision marks a return to the paper's earlier practice of not endorsing presidential candidates, describing it as 'consistent with the values the Post has always stood for.' Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan According to internal sources cited by the Post, the paper's editorial board had prepared an endorsement of Harris over former President Donald Trump before the announcement. The reversal prompted criticism from Martin Baron, the Post's former executive editor, who called it 'cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.' The LA Times' decision triggered resignations from its editorial page editor and two editorial board members. Mariel Garza, the departing editorials editor, questioned how the paper could 'spend eight years railing against Trump and the danger his leadership poses to the country and then fail to endorse the perfectly decent Democrat challenger.' The shifts in both papers have highlighted the growing reluctance of news organizations to make presidential endorsements. The Minnesota Star Tribune also announced in August it would end the practice. Many newspapers are dropping endorsements as they struggle with declining readership and fear losing subscribers who disagree with their political positions. The trend comes as traditional media faces broader challenges, including evolving reader habits and the need to combat election misinformation. The current odds in every swing state Some major outlets still endorse, with most backing Harris over Trump While some major publications are stepping back from endorsements, others are maintaining the tradition. The New York Times, Boston Globe, Seattle Times, Las Vegas Sun and The New Yorker have endorsed Harris, while Trump has received backing from the New York Post. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently announced its support for Harris, coupling the endorsement with sharp criticism of Trump, whom they described as 'a convicted criminal, insurrectionist, tax dodger, sexual harasser, serial liar and Russian sympathizer.' The announcements come as Trump has renewed his attacks on the media, recently calling them 'the enemy of the people' at an Arizona rally and threatening to revoke CBS's broadcast license. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/newspapers-endorse-trump-harris/	2024-10-26T16:44:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/SEND-TO-DIGITAL-1.png?w=900
Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan	Former First Lady Michelle Obama hit the campaign trail for Vice President Harris in battleground Michigan on Saturday, blasting former President Trump and railing against what she cast as a double standard in the high-stakes presidential race. 'I gotta ask myself: why on earth is this race even close? I lay awake at night wondering: what in the world is going on?' Obama told a raucous rally crowd in Kalamazoo, Mich. The former first lady, an early endorser for Harris after President Biden's withdrawal from the race this summer, hammered a stark contrast between the two presidential race rivals as she sounded alarms about a second Trump term. Republicans push false claims about noncitizens voting. Here’s what to know 'I hope you'll forgive me if I'm a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump's gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,' Obama said. 'I hope that you'll forgive me if I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse, all of this while we pick apart Kamala’s answers from interviews that he doesn't even have the courage to do, y'all,' she added. Her searing remarks against the former president come as the polls show Harris and Trump neck-and-neck as Nov. 5 nears. Polling averages from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill put Harris up by a narrow 0.7 points nationally while, in the critical swing state of Michigan, the polling averages put the competitors at an exact tie. Obama said she's 'praying' that voters considering casting their ballot for Trump – and voters thinking about sitting out the election – will 'snap out of whatever fog we are in' before Election Day. Man charged for punching election worker after asking to remove Trump hat 'I am praying that we consider the decades of sacrifice and struggle by all of our ancestors, the folks who marched and sacrificed and shed their blood for us. We have to ask ourselves: is a vote for Trump or no vote at all the way we honor their lives? And if that's the case, well, that surely doesn't sound like freedom to me,' Obama said. The Kalamazoo stop marked Obama's first appearance on the campaign trail for Harris, and comes on the first day of early voting in Michigan. Her husband, former President Obama, has been making stops in key states throughout the month, and appeared with Harris in Georgia on Thursday. The Obamas have remained major voices in the Democratic Party since leaving the White House after the 2016 cycle, when Trump won his term in the Oval Office. Both gave memorable speeches at this summer's Democratic National Convention in Chicago as Harris accepted the party nomination. With less than two weeks until Election Day, the White House hopefuls and their surrogates are working in overdrive to crisscross key states as the polls show the race on a razor's edge.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/michelle-obama-harris-michigan/	2024-10-26T16:31:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300762169065.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr.'s presence on Michigan, Wisconsin ballots raises concerns...	Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presence on the ballot in the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin is raising concerns that he could inadvertently draw crucial votes from former President Trump. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and former independent candidate, this week formally asked the Supreme Court to scrub his name from the Badger State ballot, his last effort in an ongoing legal battle to remove himself from as many battleground ballots as possible in the final days of the presidential election. It appears unlikely, however, that Kennedy will be successful in his quest, which could end up having an unintended negative effect on Trump and may even help Vice President Harris on the margins in two Midwestern states. 'RFK Jr.’s manipulation of the system to get on the ballot where it helps Trump and off the ballot where it hurts was unprecedented and undemocratic,' Adrienne Watson, an adviser to the Democratic National Committee, told The Hill on Friday. 'Ironically, in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, where state law doesn’t allow candidates to withdraw from the ballot, he will likely be taking more votes from Trump than Harris,' Watson said. https://elections2024.thehill.com/michigan/harris_trump_michigan Before Kennedy agreed to drop his candidacy and become a surrogate for Trump, advisers close to both candidates devised a plan to get Kennedy off state ballots that could harm Trump’s chances against Harris. He didn’t bother trying to get off most ballots in blue states but worked to ensure that voters across the country would not be able to support him in true toss-ups. As part of that negotiation, Kennedy, who has been enlisted by the Trump campaign to persuade independents to vote Republican, has repeatedly told his supporters not to waste their ballots on him. 'I don’t want you to vote for me,' he said to fans who showed up at a Trump rally in Walker, Mich., in late September, trialing the message that he has pushed for the past month. Kennedy has since joined Trump at rallies and spoken at town halls on his behalf, abandoning the politics of his Democratic name and former party to go full-on MAGA and ensure that voters know he wants to reelect the former president. Trump has embraced Kennedy’s migration into his circle. He recently appeared to confirm that the nephew of John F. Kennedy will be given some kind of position in his administration if the GOP nominee is elected to a second term in office. 'He’s going to be a part of it,' Trump said about Kennedy this week, discussing his potential reentrance to the White House. 'Everybody likes Bobby.' For all the good feelings in Trump’s orbit, there’s a lingering debate about what may happen if Kennedy ends up pulling support from Trump in the critical 'blue wall' states he ultimately couldn’t get off of. Kennedy has managed to remove his name from consideration in most of the states that will help determine who heads to Pennsylvania Avenue in two weeks, including Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada. He contested Wisconsin the strongest after state officials denied his attempt to remove his candidacy. Officials refused to make an exception to their requirement that allows only death as a valid reason to delete a candidate’s name. Polling shows that Trump is ahead by a hair — 0.4 percentage points — in the state, according to the latest average by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. Kennedy’s strategy to wipe himself off all swing ballots is an indication that he believes his high name recognition and third-party posture could potentially cut into Trump’s slight lead. 'They couldn’t undo them all,' said one source close to Kennedy’s operation who is in touch with Trump surrogates. The 'GOP has been investing big out there,' the source said about Wisconsin, hoping to counteract any fringe support that could add up. 'Those votes are unlikely to be decisive,' said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way who has helped lead the anti-third-party attack for Democrats this cycle. 'But in a race this close, every swing-state vote matters. So, if those who would vote for Trump in a two-way race pull the lever for Kennedy’s ghost ship of a campaign, Democrats will gladly take it,' he said. In Michigan, there’s more optimism among Republicans and others sympathetic to the anti-Harris effort that the remaining third-party candidates will take votes from the Democratic nominee and deflate her prospects. 'I know Jill Stein and Cornel West are making a big play for dissatisfied Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan,' the pro-Kennedy source said. After Kennedy bowed out of the presidential contest, Democrats have homed in on Stein, West and Chase Oliver, the Libertarian nominee, as possible political anomalies that could impact Harris. In Democrats’ view, Stein proved her 'spoiler' bona fides in 2016 by sapping some votes from Hillary Clinton in Michigan and giving Trump a win. Kennedy could have a similar effect in the only places where his candidacy endures, but with an even more unpredictable outcome. 'RFK’s spoiler role in this race has always been unclear. We just don’t know who is attracted to his particular brand of weird,' Bennett said. 'But since he’s gone all-in for Trump … he has somehow gotten even crazier,' Bennett added. 'Democrats long ago ceded the lunatic lane to others, so the likeliest votes he collects are from folks who would otherwise support Trump or not vote.' Democrats are indeed tailoring a small part of their closing pitch to address Kennedy as well as the current crop of candidates, but they have become less frantic about the third-party threat without showing up more broadly on ballots nationwide. One former Democratic presidential candidate said they would be 'pretty surprised' if Kennedy’s name in the two battlegrounds would matter much for either major party on Nov. 5. 'Both sides should worry less about third party candidates and worry more about having popular policies that people love,' the ex-candidate said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-s-presence-on-michigan-wisconsin-ballots-raises-concerns-for-trump/	2024-10-26T14:46:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kennedyjrrober_trumpdonald_102324ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump woos voters in critical swing state Pennsylvani...	Former President Trump is rallying voters in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania Saturday afternoon. In his remarks, Trump is expected to address his economic agenda and target Vice President Harris and the Biden administration over inflation, rising costs and taxes on Social Security, overtime and tips, the campaign announced. The event comes nearly a week after Trump worked the drive thru and fry station at a McDonald's in the state. Pennsylvania is one of the most crucial battlegrounds for both parties with Election Day under two weeks away. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls shows Trump with a slight lead over Harris in the Keystone State — 48.5 percent to 48.3 percent. The former president also held a rally in battleground Michigan Saturday afternoon, as early voting began statewide. The rally in State Park, Pa., is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. EDT.

Vice President Harris will be joined by former first lady Michelle Obama Saturday afternoon at a rally in battleground Michigan, as early voting opens up statewide. The event marks the former first lady's first appearance on the trail with the Democratic nominee. Former President Obama has participated in multiple campaign events since endorsing her campaign after President Biden withdrew from the race. Harris has also held many star-studded rallies in recent weeks, as the race remains tight ahead of Election Day. Saturday's event comes on the heels of a rally in Houston, where Beyoncé made an appearance and endorsed the vice president. With just over a week until the election, Harris and her GOP rival, former President Trump, are tied in the Great Lakes State — each with 47.9 percent support, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls. Trump also campaigned in the 'blue wall' state earlier Saturday. The rally in Kalamazoo, Mich., is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

Israel's first open attack on Iran targets missile sites and appa...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel attacked military targets in Iran with pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired on Israel earlier this month. It was the first time Israel’s military has openly attacked Iran. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make the missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. Crucially, there was no indication that Iran’s oil or nuclear sites were struck. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage,' and Iranian state-run media downplayed them. Taken together, the moves suggested at least for now that both countries are trying to avoid a more serious escalation. Still, the strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. Following the airstrikes, Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying it 'considers itself entitled and obligated to defend against foreign acts of aggression.' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran has 'no limits' in defending its interests. But late Saturday, Iran's military issued a carefully worded statement suggesting any cease-fire in Israel's ground offensives in Gaza and Lebanon would trump any possible retaliatory strike. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said four people were killed, all with the military air defense. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. But the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees Iran’s vast ballistic missile arsenal, was silent, raising questions about whether anything had been hit at its bases. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Israel gave him a heads-up before the strikes and said it looked like 'they didn’t hit anything but military targets.' His administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit nuclear facilities and oil installations. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran’s nuclear facilities were not impacted. 'I hope this is the end,' Biden said. Israel's first open attack on Iran Iran hadn’t faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. Explosions could be heard in Tehran until sunrise. Israel is also widely thought to be behind a limited airstrike in April near a major air base in Iran that hit the radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery. Iran had earlier fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel, causing minimal damage, after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria. On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation for devastating blows Israel landed against Hezbollah. They caused minimal damage and a few injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran 'made a big mistake.' 'If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond,' Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. Images released by Israel’s military showed members preparing to depart for the strikes in American-made F-15 and F-16 warplanes. The Iranian military statement described Israel's warplanes as firing lightweight missiles at a distance of 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Iranian border. The missiles struck air defense radar stations, the military said, some of which were already under repair. Iran’s mission to the United Nations accused the U.S. of complicity in the attack, asserting that the U.S. controls Iraqi airspace. Israel’s attack did not take out highly visible or symbolic facilities that could prompt a significant response from Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at Tel Aviv’s Institute for National Security Studies who formerly worked for Israel’s National Security Council. It also gives Israel room for escalation if needed, and targeting air defense systems weakens Iran’s capabilities to defend against future attacks, he said, adding that if there is Iranian retaliation, it should be limited. 'By targeting military sites and missile facilities over nuclear and energy infrastructure, Israel is also messaging that it seeks no further escalation for now,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. After the strikes, the streets in Iran's capital were calm, with schools and shops open. There were long lines at the gas stations — a regular occurrence when military violence flares. But some residents seemed anxious and avoided conversations with an Associated Press reporter. Mixed reactions at home and abroad Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the decision to avoid 'strategic and economic targets,' saying on X that 'we could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran.' The United States warned against further retaliation, and Britain and Germany said Iran should not respond. 'All acts of escalation are condemnable and must stop,' the spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general said. Saudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Iran's 'sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.' Hezbollah and Hamas condemned Israel's attack. Regional tensions have been soaring. In Lebanon, dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israel launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut. Hezbollah warned 25 communities in northern Israel to evacuate Saturday, calling them 'legitimate military targets' because Israel was attacking the militant group from there. Enemies for decades Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for attacks on shipping in the Middle East. The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas. Some 100 remain, about a third believed to be dead. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in largely devastated Gaza, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half have been women and children. 'Those who were not killed by the bombing are dying from starvation. This is life,' said one woman displaced from northern Gaza, Madallah Abu Zaid. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Schreck from Jerusalem.

5 takeaways from Trump's 3-hour interview with Joe Rogan	Former President Trump sat with Joe Rogan Friday for a three-hour interview, marking the GOP nominee’s debut on one of the most popular podcasts in the country. The two men appeared to show a mutual admiration for one another, while the former president spoke at length about immigration, his intense reliance on tariffs for economic policy, and his unproven claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Rogan is one of the most popular and controversial media personalities in the country, with each of his episodes earning millions of downloads and often features conversations with top newsmakers. He is particularly popular with young men, who the Trump campaign has specifically targeted in the upcoming election. Senate Dems discussing plans to push through Harris would-be Cabinet Here are five takeaways from the interview. Trump and Rogan hit it off Rogan has previously said he is not a Trump supporter and in 2022 indicated he would not be interested in having the former president on the show. But the two appeared extremely comfortable with one another Friday, trading compliments and discussing their shared love of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events. 'You cannot be voting for Kamala. You’re not a Kamala person. I know you. I’ve watched you,' Trump told the podcast host. 'You know what, without speaking to you I know you, I think I know you, maybe almost as well as your wife.' He later added that he thought Rogan knew 'everything … as a student of yours.' 'One of the beautiful things about you is that you freeball,' Rogan said, telling the former president that he thought his impression mocking President Biden was 'funny stuff.' Five things to know about Israel’s attack on Iran The two went on an extended tangent about boxing and UFC events, talking about their mutual friendship with UFC president Dana White. Rogan has worked as a play-by-play announcer at UFC events, while Trump has attended numerous fights and was introduced by White at the July GOP convention. 'I want to do it again with you,' Trump said as he wrapped up the interview. 'You are something…you are a fascinating guy.' Trump says RFK Jr. would have administration role, but it won’t be ‘environmental’ Rogan had previously expressed support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran an independent White House bid before suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump in late August. The podcast host asked Trump on Friday whether he was set on having Kennedy be part of his administration if he wins in November. 'Oh I am. The only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental,' Trump said. 'Because you know, he doesn’t like oil, I love oil and gas. So I’m just going to keep him out…I said, ‘Focus on health. You can do whatever you want.’ But I gotta be a little careful with the liquid gold.' Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says Trump told Rogan he has faced pressure from some not to work with Kennedy, citing the pharmaceutical industry. The two then had an extended discussion about systemic health issues facing the country, with the podcast host suggesting if there was a greater focus on 'metabolic health,' there wouldn’t be such a need for pharmaceutical drugs. Rogan has in the past drawn backlash for some of his anti-vaccine rhetoric, including when he hosted a prominent anti-vaccine influencer on his show in 2022. Kennedy has similarly drawn criticism for some of his anti-vaccine comments. He has led an initiative for the Trump campaign dubbed 'Make America Healthy Again.' Podcast underscores Trump appeal to young voters The Trump campaign has invested significant time and energy courting young men, with a particular focus on the former president’s media appearances. Trump’s sit-down with Rogan was yet another extension of that strategy. 'So I have a son who’s very smart, and tall, Barron. And he knows all about you,' Trump said. 'He knows about guys I never heard of…it’s a whole new world out there. But you know, I’m on TikTok now. And I’ve done really well.' Rogan’s podcast draws more than 15 million followers on Spotify, and his YouTube channel boasts more than 17 million subscribers. He is particularly popular with young men, and he spoke to the concerns of younger voters during Friday’s interview. Georgia 9th grader invents AI tool to detect pesticides on food 'I think young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshit. Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded,' Rogan said. 'They’re tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what they think the moral standards of society should be today…You wanna be a rebel? You wanna be punk rock? You wanna, like, buck the system? You’re a conservative now,' he added. A new Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters ages 18-29 found Vice President Harris leading Trump by 20 percentage points among young voters under 30. Harris leads by 30 points among young women and by 10 points among young men. Rogan gives Trump time to air election fraud claims Trump has for the past four years refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and claimed without evidence there was widespread fraud that changed the outcome. Rogan on Friday gave the former president space to explain his claims. 'How do you think you were robbed? Everybody always cuts you off,' Rogan said. 'What I’d rather do is –we’ll do it another time. I would bring in papers that you would not believe. That election was so crooked,' Trump said, at one point repeating the false claim that he did not lose in 2020. Pressed for examples, the former president argued that state legislatures did not properly approve changes to ballot deadlines and collection methods. State lawmakers moved quickly in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic to adjust voting laws to make it easier to vote early and by mail. 'They used COVID to cheat,' Trump said. He further claimed that a letter from dozens of former intelligence agents asserting that a laptop belonging to the president's son, Hunter Biden, that was revealed in the closing weeks of the 2020 campaign was Russian disinformation cost him enough votes to flip the election for Biden. McDonald’s E. coli outbreak hits 3 more states, 26 new cases reported Trump went on to argue that using paper ballots would guard against fraud, and the former president and Rogan agreed that states should enact voter ID laws. The GOP nominee has routinely invoked his distrust in the 2020 results at campaign rallies, calling the election 'rigged' or fraudulent. Democrats have warned Trump poses a threat to democracy because of his refusal to accept the results. The former president and his allies brought numerous lawsuits after the 2020 election alleging fraud, but they were dismissed because of lack of evidence or lack of standing. Trump has been indicted in Washington, D.C., on federal charges over his efforts to remain in power after losing the election. Trump opines on extraterrestrial life and UFOs Rogan has repeatedly shown an interest in the prospect of aliens and UFOs on his show, and he used his interview with Trump to press the former president on what he knew from his time in office. 'What did they tell you? How much can you tell?' Rogan asked. 'It’s never been my thing. I have to be honest,' Trump replied. 'I’ve never been a believer.' The former president recounted interviewing pilots who claimed they saw round objects moving rapidly through the sky. 'I get that question as much as almost any question. ‘Do you think we have aliens flying around or whatever,’' he said. 'There’s no reason not to — I mean there’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life... Well, maybe it’s life that we don’t know.' Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) burst into the spotlight last year following testimony from three former Defense Department officials who told a House panel’s national security subcommittee that sightings of UAPs could pose national security risks.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/takeaways-trumps-interview-joe-rogan/	2024-10-26T12:02:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Joe-Rogan-10.26.png?w=900
Georgia 9th grader invents AI tool to detect pesticides on food	(NewsNation) — Sirish Subash is no ordinary ninth-grade student. The 14-year-old from Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology in Snellville, Georgia, was named America's top young scientist after winning the 2024 3M Young Scientist Challenge. The reason? Subash's creation of an AI handheld pesticide detector named 'Pestiscand.' The creation was devised after washing food with his mother before a meal. 'It works on a method called spectrophotometry. Now what this means is that it uses different ways that light interacts with different chemicals to look for different chemicals on the produce,' Subash told 'Morning in America with Hena Doba.' 'Each chemical reflects different parts or wavelengths of light, and that creates a spectral signature, which is basically a catalog of what wavelengths are reflected back. So, 'Pestiscand' can look for those wavelengths that are reflected by side residues on the produce.' Former trucker helping extend driver’s short life expectancy While the product is not on the market for the broader public at this time, Subash aims to dedicate his time to ensuring it has mass availability in the near future. 'I want to continue developing projects like 'Pestiscand' and eventually get them out to the world, to the market. That's one of my goals for 'Pestiscand', to get it out to everyone,' Subash added. In his downtime, Subash enjoys reading both fiction and non-fiction and making origami.

Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says	(NEXSTAR) — A new report has found that nearly a third of Gen Z — also known as Zoomers — already feel financially secure thanks to having both a job and a side hustle, particularly in certain cities around the U.S. Due to the current economy, most Zoomers are looking for that sense of security and are willing to do whatever it takes to find it, the study suggests. According to LendingTree, at least 55% of young Americans have a side hustle on top of their current job. Thanks to the extra work, they're making an extra $1,253, on average. IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? Gen Zers in some areas of the country are doing much better than others, however. MoneyGeek looked at data from cities across the U.S., using various metrics to determine where young adults are thriving in areas such as economic opportunity and quality of life. What the final data shows is that Zoomers are having better luck financially out West. This is due to the average median household income in the West sitting at $53,497 — nearly $12,000 more than the next closest region, the Northeast. As for cities in the region, Salt Lake City, Utah, lands at the top of the list. The city has seen a 41% growth in its young adult population and holds the lowest federal student loan debt per borrower at $11,062. Here’s what to do if you lose an absentee ballot before Election Day Rounding out the rest of the top five are Abilene, Texas; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; and finally Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran's shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-five-things-to-know-about-israels-attack-on-iran/	2024-10-26T08:20:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671d090e246de7.17081096.jpeg?w=900

IDF confirms Israeli strikes in Tehran	(NewsNation) — Israel Defense Forces offensive and defensive units are 'fully mobilized' against military targets in Iran, the IDF confirmed Friday night. 'In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,' the organization said. It did not say the exact target of the attacks. Israel informed senior White House officials of the attacks in the hours prior, sources told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. Defense officials say the U.S. had no involvement in Israel's operation, and President Joe Biden has been briefed on the attacks. 'We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st. We would refer you to the Israeli government for more information on their operation,' National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett told NewsNation. US government issues worldwide alert on Israel-related demonstrations Explosions were heard in Iran's Tehran and nearby Karaj, state media reported Friday. Iran's state TV said multiple explosions were heard in the capital, but no origin was known. A Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. ‘Worst humanitarian crisis we’ve seen since WWII’: Doctor on Gaza 'Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond ... We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.' IDF's statement read. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to the Middle East this week to speak with leaders about a possible cease-fire, returning just hours before the IDF's Friday strikes in Tehran. Iranian-Israeli tensions Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. Israel and Iran have been locked in a yearslong shadow war. A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. But since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, the battle has increasingly moved into the open. Israel has recently turned its attention to Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Throughout the year, a number of top Iranian military figures have been killed in Israeli strikes in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli strikes killed 38 people in Gaza and three journalists in Lebanon on Friday morning. More than 42,000 Palestinians have died since the start of the war, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says.

Senate Dems discussing plans to push through Harris would-be Cabi...	(NewsNation) — Worried about Vice President Kamala Harris potentially facing a Republican-controlled Senate if she wins the White House, two Democratic strategists tell NewsNation senators are discussing an emergency plan to approve her Cabinet during a December Senate session. The Senate is currently controlled by the Democrats, but lawmakers in the party are facing an 'increasingly tough road' to keeping it this way, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Democrats face a difficult Senate map, with multiple incumbents in solidly GOP territory. Republican candidates in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are quickly closing the gap, The Hill reports, and 'blue wall' states are now all deemed 'toss-ups' by Cook Political Report.

Biden would then appoint Harris' picks, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would then confirm the new Cabinet with his current 51 to 49 Senate. One source, however, conceded that this might not be possible. At that point, the source said, Harris would have to decide who in Biden's Cabinet she would want to keep on. Questions also remain about whether Harris, if she beats Republican former president Donald Trump, could develop a Cabinet list and vet her appointees before a new Senate comes in. 'Sen. Schumer is focused on winning a Democratic majority in the Senate that will work to confirm future President Kamala Harris’s Cabinet,' a spokesperson for the New York Democrat said in a statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/senate-democrats-harris-cabinet/	2024-10-25T13:54:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179658368.jpg?w=900
Chinese hackers may have accessed Trump, Harris campaign phones	(NewsNation) — Chinese hackers targeted data from phones used by both the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns, according to reports. NewsNation also confirmed, per a Democratic source briefed, that the Chinese Communist Party hack targeted prominent Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s staff. The New York Times first reported hackers may have had access to phones used by former President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. A source then confirmed with NewsNation that 'People affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign were also targeted.' It was unclear whether the hackers could have gained access to data stored on the devices. The New York Times report says the Trump campaign was made aware of the possible breach this week. US on alert for election interference from Russia, China, Iran In a statement to NewsNation, the Trump campaign blamed Harris’ campaign for the reported hack. 'This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House,' the statement read in part. The Wall Street Journal Friday reported hackers also targeted 'people affiliated with Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign.'

The current odds in every battleground state	(NewsNation) — The 2024 presidential race can be summed up in a single phrase: 'It's anybody's ballgame.' NewsNation's election partner Decision Desk HQ shows former President Donald Trump with a 52% chance of winning and Vice President Kamala Harris with a 48% chance as of midday Oct. 25. Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Famed polling expert Nate Silver currently shows Harris with a 1.3-point lead nationally but slightly behind in several key battleground states. 'In an election where the seven battleground states are all polling within a percentage point or two, 50-50 is the only responsible forecast,' Silver wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed. Those seven states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — will ultimately decide the election. Here's what the polls currently show in each. Note: This story will be updated as polling changes. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Arizona Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 58% Harris: 42% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 49.3% Harris: 47.3% Who has the momentum? Silver's model suggests Harris had a slight lead in Arizona at the end of August. Poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight showed the two candidates tied as recently as mid-September. Over the past month, Trump has opened up a narrow two-point advantage in the state. What to watch: About 1 in 4 Arizona voters are Latino, and Trump has made inroads with that group, particularly among men. Harris will try to improve on Democrats' performance with suburbanites around Phoenix, particularly 'John McCain Republicans,' many of whom have rejected Trump. Georgia Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 62% Harris: 38% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 49.0% Harris: 47.6% Who has the momentum? Harris had a slight advantage in early September, but since then, Trump has pulled ahead. He currently holds a +1.4 polling lead according to Silver's model and a +1.6 advantage per FiveThirtyEight. What to watch: If Trump has improved among Black voters, as polls show, then that will likely show up in Georgia, one of the most racially diverse swing states. Meanwhile, Harris needs to perform well in the growing suburbs around metro Atlanta, which have turned increasingly blue in recent elections. Michigan Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Harris: 58% Trump: 42% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Harris: 48.1% Trump: 47.3% Who has the momentum? A month ago, polls showed Harris with a two-point lead in the state; now, the two candidates are separated by less than a point. What to watch: Michigan is home to more than 200,000 Muslim registered voters, and over the past year, Muslims' support for the Democratic Party has dropped. Much of that is due to frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. It remains to be seen how many of those voters will shift Trump's way, but they could have a major impact on the outcome. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Nevada is another state where Trump has recently closed the gap, and he's now within 0.3 points, according to Silver's model. A month ago, Harris had a one-point lead. What to watch: Like Arizona, Nevada has a significant share of Latino voters, which could swing things either way in the state's population center, Clark County. Both candidates have tried to appeal to the state's service and hospitality workers, promising to eliminate taxes on tips. North Carolina Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 66% Harris: 34% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 48.8% Harris: 47.6% Who has the momentum? Trump currently holds a 1.3-point polling advantage, a slight improvement from his 0.6-point lead a month ago, according to FiveThirtyEight. What to watch: Trump has won North Carolina in each of the last two elections, but Democrats have been gaining ground, particularly in major population centers like Mecklenburg and Wake counties. If Harris can improve in those areas, Democrats have a chance to win the state for the first time since Barack Obama in 2008. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Pennsylvania Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 52% Harris: 48% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 48.2% Harris: 48.0% Who has the momentum? Pennsylvania is the swingiest swing state and likely the most important. At this point, the two are roughly tied. In early September, Harris and Trump were neck and neck before Harris opened up a slight lead as the month progressed. Since then, Trump has pulled even and currently holds a 0.2-point polling lead, per Silver's model. What to watch: In 10 of the last 12 elections, the winner of Pennsylvania has gone on to win the race. In some ways, it's the place where every election narrative collides — a microcosm of the U.S. at large. Both candidates are competing for the state's fast-growing Hispanic community. Turnout among Black voters in the heavily Democratic Philadelphia area could also play an outsized role. There are also the swing counties themselves, historically blue-collar areas like Erie County that could go either way. Wisconsin Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 53% Harris: 47% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Harris: 48.5% Trump: 48.0% Who has the momentum? Harris has a half-point lead according to Silver's model, but again, that's tighter compared to a month ago when she led by about two points. What to watch: The traditionally red Milwaukee suburbs, the so-called 'WOW counties,' have become less so in recent elections. If Harris can build on Democrats' gains in those areas — Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington — she could win the state. On the other hand, if Democratic voters don't turn out in Milwaukee County — and Trump holds his lead in rural areas — the former president could recreate his 2016 victory that saw the state turn red for the first time since 1984.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/current-odds-battleground-state/	2024-10-25T10:50:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.10.png?w=900
Why is Florida suing DOJ over apparent Trump assassination plot?	(NewsNation) — Federal officials have hamstrung state investigative efforts surrounding an alleged assassination plot against former President Donald Trump, Florida’s Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody said. Moody filed a lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday. She’s accusing federal authorities of blocking the state’s investigation after the Justice Department told Florida to temporarily halt its efforts while the federal probe is underway. 'When Gov. DeSantis rightfully issued an executive order to make sure we were fully pursuing state-law crimes, immediately — we started getting pushback when we were trying to collect evidence and further that investigation,' Moody said on 'Morning in America.' Biden apologizes for Indian boarding school policy Florida officials were told not to interview witnesses and that they could only cooperate with the federal investigation, the lawsuit alleges. Justice Department officials cited the federal law, which says the FBI is charged with investigating attempted political candidate assassinations and that state law enforcement should hold off on its investigative efforts in the meantime. 'I was a federal prosecutor before my life led me to become a judge and the attorney general,' Moody said. 'I understand the nature of the federal investigatory authorities working hand-in-hand with the state officials. That is common … that is why this is so short-sighted.' Virginia ordered to restore 1,600 canceled voter registrations Ryan Routh, the man whom police arrested in connection with the apparent plan, is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer and attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. He’s pleaded not guilty to each charge. Investigators say Routh pointed a rifle through a tree line on Sept. 15 at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where the former president and GOP presidential nominee was playing. Unlike the gunman behind the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Routh isn’t accused of firing a weapon.

Judge orders Virginia to restore 1,600 voter registrations cancel...	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to restore more than 1,600 voter registrations that she said were illegally purged in the last two months in an effort to stop noncitizens from voting. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request brought against Virginia election officials by the Justice Department, which claimed the voter registrations were wrongly canceled during a 90-day quiet period ahead of the November election that restricts states from making large-scale changes to their voter rolls. State officials said they will appeal. The Justice Departmen t and private groups, including the League of Women Voters, said many of the 1,600 voters whose registrations were canceled were in fact citizens whose registrations were canceled because of bureaucratic errors or simple mistakes like a mischecked box on a form. Justice Department lawyer Sejal Jhaveri said during an all-day injunction hearing Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, that's precisely why federal law prevents states from implementing systematic changes to the voter rolls in the 90 days before an election, 'to prevent the harm of having eligible voters removed in a period where it's hard to remedy.' Giles said Friday that the state is not completely prohibited from removing noncitizens from the voting rolls during the 90-day quiet period, but that it must do so on an individualized basis rather than the automated, systematic program employed by the state. State officials argued unsuccessfully that the canceled registrations followed careful procedures that targeted people who explicitly identified themselves as noncitizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Charles Cooper, a lawyer for the state, said during arguments Thursday that the federal law was never intended to provide protections to noncitizens, who by definition can't vote in federal elections. 'Congress couldn't possibly have intended to prevent the removal ... of persons who were never eligible to vote in the first place,' Cooper argued. The plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, though, said that many people are wrongly identified as noncitizens by the DMV simply by checking the wrong box on a form. They were unable to identify exactly how many of the 1,600 purged voters are in fact citizens — Virginia only identified this week the names and addresses of the affected individuals in response to a court order — but provided anecdotal evidence of individuals whose registrations were wrongly canceled. Cooper acknowledged that some of the 1,600 voters identified by the state as noncitizens may well be citizens, but he said restoring all of them to the rolls means that in all likelihood 'there's going to hundreds of noncitizens back on those rolls. If a noncitizen votes, it cancels out a legal vote. And that is a harm,' he said. Virginia's Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, issued an executive order in August requiring daily checks of DMV data against voter rolls to identify noncitizens. State officials said any voter identified as a noncitizen was notified and given two weeks to dispute their disqualification before being removed. If they returned a form attesting to their citizenship, their registration would not be canceled. Prior to Youngkin's executive order, the state did monthly checks of the voter rolls against DMV data, in accordance with a state law passed in 2006. Youngkin said the Justice Department was wrongly targeting him for upholding a law that was followed by his predecessors, including Democrats, even if they didn't take the extra step of ordering daily checks as he did in his executive order. 'Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals–who self-identified themselves as noncitizens–back onto the voter rolls.,' Youngkin said in a statement after Friday's hearing. Giles, for her part, questioned the timing of Youngkin's executive order, which was issued on Aug. 7, the very beginning of the 90-day quiet period required under federal law. 'It's not happenstance that this was announced exactly on the 90th day' of the quiet period, she said Friday from the bench. Her injunction requires voter registrations be restored for all of those canceled as a result of Youngkin's executive order, and that letters be sent out within five days informing those voters of their restored status. The letters will also include a note of caution informing those individuals that if they are indeed noncitizens, that they are barred from casting ballots under federal law. The plaintiffs had asked the judge to grant those voters an extension of the deadline to request absentee ballots, but Giles denied that request, saying it would result in confusion. 'We may not be able to achieve everything we would want,' she said. Virginia's Republican attorney general, Jason Miyares, issued a statement after Friday's hearing criticizing the ruling. 'It should never be illegal to remove an illegal voter,' he said. 'Yet, today a Court – urged by the Biden-Harris Department of Justice – ordered Virginia to put the names of non-citizens back on the voter rolls, mere days before a presidential election.' U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., who had alerted Justice Department officials to the removals. praised the ruling. 'Governor Youngkin’s purges have served only one purpose – to disenfranchise thousands of lawfully voting citizens of the Commonwealth. That stops today,' he said. Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote. A similar lawsuit was filed in Alabama, and a federal judge there last week ordered the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-judge-orders-virginia-to-restore-1600-voter-registrations-canceled-in-effort-to-purge-noncitizens/	2024-10-25T10:28:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671bd5fca14604.29927424.jpeg?w=900
McDonald's E. coli outbreak hits 3 more states, 26 new cases repo...	(NewsNation) — Health officials on Friday announced 26 new E. coli cases among people who ate at McDonald’s amid an outbreak linked to the fast-food chain’s Quarter Pounder burger. The new cases bring the total number of known infections to 75. Twenty-two people have been hospitalized and one person has died. Risk to the public remains low as McDonald’s and one of its onion suppliers take action to identify the root of the contamination, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Jimmy Johns introduces limited-run ‘Picklewich’ The outbreak now spans 13 states including Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, and portions of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, according to the CDC. McDonald’s restaurants in each state have temporarily stopped using their current supply of Quarter Pounder slivered onions and beef patties. Investigators are working to confirm which ingredient is making people sick and whether other restaurants might be affected. The patties in question are only used on Quarter Pounders. Fresh-slivered onions are likewise used primarily for that burger. Taylor Farms, which supplies slivered onions to the affected restaurants, issued a voluntary recall. The food supplier asked customers to stop using some onions while the investigation is ongoing. The CDC encourages anyone with E. coli symptoms should call their doctor. Symptoms include: Diarrhea and a fever higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit So much vomiting that you cannot keep liquids down Signs of dehydration, such as less frequent urination, dry mouth and throat, and dizziness upon standing	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/recalls/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-26-new-cases-onions-quarter-pounder/	2024-10-25T09:51:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180538535.jpg?w=900
WATCH LIVE: Biden visits Indian Country, apologizes for 150-year-...	Watch Biden's remarks live in the video player above. He is scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m. ET. PHOENIX (AP) — President Joe Biden is using his long-promised first presidential visit to Indian Country to formally apologize to Native Americans on Friday for a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated Indian children from their parents. Democrats hope Biden's visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s land on the outskirts of metro Phoenix in Arizona will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. Biden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would make a visit to Indian Country. The president, in an exchange with reporters Thursday before departing for Arizona, said an apology for the U.S. government’s role in the abuse and neglect of Native children was 'something that should have been done a long time ago.' For decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate children into white society, according to the White House. The moment will also give Biden a chance to spotlight his and Harris' support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to improve turnout among bedrock supporters. 'The race is now a turnout grab,' said Mike O’Neil, a non-partisan pollster based in Arizona. 'The trendlines throughout have been remarkably steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow margins.' Biden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July. But analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native American voters — a group that has trailed others in turnout rates. In 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996. Biden is making the visit in his official capacity, and a formal apology — something tribes have long sought — seems certain to garner attention among Native Americans across the country. At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government’s abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in 1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for a U.S. government apology. At least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them. 'President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,' said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. 'I do think that will reflect well on Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.' She added that whoever is the next president must follow up with concrete action and begin making amends for the devastation the boarding schools wrought on tribes. Democrats have stepped up outreach to Native American communities. Both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, met with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe. The Democratic National Committee recently launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska through digital, print and radio ads. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is locked in a competitive race with Republican Kari Lake for Arizona's open Senate seat, has visited all 22 of Arizona's federally recognized tribes. Harris started a recent campaign rally in Chandler, near where the Gila River reservation is located, with a shoutout to the tribe's leader. She also reminded the crowd that she was the first vice president to visit the reservation. She and husband Doug Emhoff visited the community last year. 'I strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations and the United States is sacred ... and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust in treaty obligations, and ensure tribal self-determination,' Harris said. The White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years. He designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in Nevada and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. In addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and more. Biden picked former New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as his Interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico. She, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government's boarding school policies that is leading Biden to deliver the formal apology. 'He made commitments to Indian Country, and he has followed through on every single one of those commitments,' Haaland said. Thom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University, said both Harris' and Trump's campaigns — and their allies — have put a remarkable amount of effort into micro-targeting in Arizona. Harris, Reilly noted, has also focused on whittling away at Trump's advantage among Mormon voters in the state, a group that historically has favored Republicans. Trump, meanwhile, has put special focus on young men as the campaign tries to narrow Democrats' advantage with younger voters. 'They are pulling out every stop just to see if they could wrangle a few more votes here and there,' Reilly said. 'The Indian community is one of those groups that Harris is hoping will overperform and help make the difference.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/watch-biden-visits-indian-country-apologizes-for-150-year-old-boarding-school-policy/	2024-10-25T09:20:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24299024866592.jpg?w=900
Rapper 'Lil Durk' arrested in connection to murder-for-hire plot	(NewsNation) — Grammy award-winning rapper 'Lil Durk' was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Florida on Thursday in connection to an alleged murder-for-hire plot. Chicago native Durk Banks, 32, was booked into the Broward County Jail, pending charges of murder-for-hire, according to jail records. No further details have been released regarding Banks' charges.

O'Reilly: Cuomo made 'big mistake' while questioning Vance	(NewsNation) — Political commentator Bill O’Reilly said NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo did not push Ohio Sen. JD Vance hard enough during a NewsNation town hall Thursday, particularly when addressing the 'divisive rhetoric' he and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, have used in the campaign. Cuomo 'let Vance off,' O'Reilly told NewsNation on Thursday evening. 'I would have brought in two examples of divisive rhetoric. Not to try to 'gotcha,' but to see if Vance has perspective on it,' O’Reilly told Cuomo. During the town hall, Cuomo asked Vance if he wished he had handled things differently when it came to his previous false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. 'Do I wish that I had been better in that moment? Maybe,' Vance answered. He then quickly pivoted to saying he was just listening to people in his community because he needed to trust constituents over the media. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? 'What am I supposed to do? Hang up the phone and tell them they're a liar because the media doesn't want me to talk about it?' Vance asked. 'One of the things that I've learned in my time in the United States Senate is that sometimes the media doesn't always listen to people.' Vance also blamed the media for chasing the comments about the pets instead of focusing on the hardships in the town as a result of an influx of immigrants. O'Reilly believed Cuomo missed an opportunity in his questioning of Vance by not focusing on the fiscal reality of the migrant crisis. Vance 'would have been way ahead if he goes, ‘You know, that probably wasn't the best thing for us to do,’' and instead focused on the financial strain of the influx, O’Reilly said. 'We have statistics like $350 million just this year on illegal immigrants. It's unsustainable. You don't have to go into the Alpo thing with the dogs and the cats ... you open yourself up to all kinds of charges with the media gleefully hopping on,' he said. He added, 'Americans like it when you [politicians] admit a mistake.' Cuomo defended his line of questioning, telling O’Reilly that apologies are 'weaponized' in modern day politics so it’s rare for a lawmaker to admit any fault. 'You really get beaten over the head with apologies in politics now,' Cuomo said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/oreilly-cuomo-mistake-vance-migrants/	2024-10-24T20:36:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/bill-O-vance-color.png?w=800
Vance: Housing costs are biggest threat to the American dream	(NewsNation) — Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance called high housing costs 'the biggest threat to the American dream' during a NewsNation town hall Thursday. 'So many people in my generation — they're delaying having families, they're delaying getting married because they can't afford a place to raise a family,' Vance told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. Low inventory, elevated mortgage rates and record-high prices have turned buying a home from a dream into a nightmare in recent years. At the same time, rising child care costs have stretched families' finances and caused others to delay having kids altogether. Here’s what Vance said he would do to bring down the cost of housing and child care. Vance says he stands with Trump on abortion Tackling the housing shortage The U.S. housing market is short 4.5 million homes, which has kept inventory tight and pushed prices to record highs despite a drop in sales. Vance said he would make it easier to build houses by lowering energy costs and easing regulatory burdens. 'Our ancestors went to the moon with pocket calculators and slide rulers, and now, our government makes it way too hard to build the homes that we need,' he said. VP candidate @JDVance says two problems with housing in the U.S. are supply and demand. Vance says there aren&#39;t enough homes being built for those living here, and that too many people are coming into the country illegally, further driving demand: https://t.co/zg6reSMxvO… pic.twitter.com/rlEErLSENk&mdash; NewsNation (@NewsNation) October 25, 2024 Another part of the solution, Vance argues, should be aimed at lowering demand by securing the southern border. He said it’s no coincidence housing costs have risen at the same time as illegal immigration. 'When you let those folks in your country at the level that we have, well, you’ve got to put them somewhere,' Vance said. 'Those are homes that aren't going to American citizens.' While it’s true more people in need of housing leads to higher demand, economists have warned that tightening immigration could worsen existing labor shortages in the construction industry, further constraining supply. During Thursday's town hall, Vance said he would drive down mortgage rates by further curbing inflation. Lowering the cost of child care For millions of Americans, child care, not housing, is their biggest monthly expense. To bring down costs, Vance emphasized the need for flexibility and said he wants to expand the number of child care providers by moving away from the federal government’s 'one-size-fits-all model.' 'The federal government actually makes it really hard for anybody other than the people who are currently providing child care to get into that job,' Vance said. Instead, the Republican VP candidate said he wants to 'make it easier for grandparents, aunts and uncles, church communities and nonprofit centers, to participate in providing child care.'

When asked whether he would push corporations to provide better family leave, Vance said he was open to it: 'I do think that would relieve some pressure on families.' Above all, he wants to see more nonprofits and community organizations involved. 'A lot of them would like to help out, but they don't get the same federal benefits as other organizations,' Vance said.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-housing-costs/	2024-10-24T19:18:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/NN_8741.jpg?w=900
Vance critical of Ronald Reagan for homelessness crisis	(NewsNation) — Republican Ohio Senator JD Vance was critical of former President Ronald Reagan’s decision to cut mental health services decades ago, saying it has contributed to a present-day homelessness crisis. During a NewsNation town hall Thursday, Vance said the 'homelessness problem in this country, especially in our big cities, is completely out of control.' 'I’m going to criticize President Reagan going back 40 years because President Reagan made a decision to cut mental health care in this country, and the decision that we made collectively as a nation was to let people live on the streets instead of sometimes being committed to inpatient mental health facilities,' he said. Vance appears to be referring to Reagan, a Republican, repealing the Mental Health Systems Act in 1981, which was signed by his predecessor, Democratic former President Jimmy Carter. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? Under the Mental Health Systems Act, the government would have funded federal community mental health center programs first envisioned under President John F. Kennedy. Reagan cut Carter’s legislation with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which pushed the responsibility of mentally ill patients back to the states, according to KQED. By 2004, the Department of Justice estimated that 10% of state prisoners had symptoms that met the criteria for a psychotic disorder. Vance said that in the aftermath of Reagan’s decision, taxpayers have had to 'pick up the burden' of caring for the mentally ill, many who end up homeless or in local jails instead of health centers. 'I don't think that it's compassionate to let the mentally ill fester on the streets. Some of them have addiction problems, some of them have other health problems. I think we need to get back to saying that if you have real mental health problems, you've got to go to an inpatient treatment facility, get the care that you need,' Vance said. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? According to the National Alliance on Mental Health, 21% of people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. have a serious mental health condition, and research has found that homelessness is associated with a higher prevalence of mental and substance use disorders when compared to stably housed individuals. Vance called Reagan’s decision a 'mistake.' 'I think all leaders should be able to say we made a mistake. Let's try something that actually works,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-ronald-reagan-homelessness-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:32:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Vance-Thumbnail-5-1.png?w=800
Trump asks Vance to tell him why he's 'brilliant' during town hal...	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump phoned into NewsNation’s town hall with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Thursday to ask his vice presidential pick to describe how 'brilliant' he is. 'How brilliant is Donald J. Trump?' the former president jokingly asked and then quipped that the 'answer should be easy.' Trump’s question elicited a burst of laughter from Vance, who answered, 'Of course, you’re very brilliant.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views Vance then jumped into the story of the first time his wife Usha met the former president in an attempt to show Trump’s relatability while his running mate stayed on the call. He said his wife was nervous about meeting Trump but that the former president made a joke off the bat that 'immediately broke the barrier.' 'It wasn't the former president. It was just a person talking to my wife,' he said of the interaction. 'That ability to relate to anybody in any environment — I think that's the true brilliance of Donald J. Trump.' The former president returned the praise, calling his running mate’s campaign performance 'fantastic' and saying that he couldn’t be happier as Vance has 'captivated' voters. Trump also sarcastically asked Vance how brilliant his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was, which Vance said would be 'tough' to answer. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? The former president also did not forgo the opportunity to say that he was leading by a 'landslide' in the polls during his brief call. 'We’re very happy about it,' he said. A Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast showed Trump having a slight lead Thursday, with polling still showing that the outcome remains a toss-up.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-vance-brilliant-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:17:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/Vance_073024_Photo_Getty.png?w=900
Vance says he stands with Trump on abortion	(NewsNation) — Republican Sen. JD Vance pushed back on the idea that his position on abortion contrasts with that of his running mate, former president Donald Trump, during NewsNation’s town hall Thursday. The GOP vice presidential candidate said he and Trump both fundamentally want the same thing, which is to make it easier for Americans to 'choose life' and that the former president has been clear about leaving the matter up to the states. 'He wants to, first of all, make it easier for people to choose life to begin with, make it less expensive, help address child care costs and make it easier for young families to choose life in the first place,' the Ohio senator said during the event in Michigan. Vance said Trump has been 'consistent' in his position that states should make decisions on reproductive rights. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? The issue has become a vulnerability for Republicans in this year’s election. Trump trails Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue of abortion, according to polling from The Associated Press this week. This week, the Republican presidential nominee said some abortion laws are 'too tough' and would be 'redone.' He also said earlier this month a national abortion ban was 'off the table,' adding 'that issue has been, in my opinion, largely diffused.' Trump nominated three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the nationwide right to abortion two years ago. Vance is opposed to abortion and called himself '100% pro-life' even in cases of rape and incest during his 2022 Senate run, telling The Washington Post in 2021, 'Two wrongs don’t make a right.' However, Vance said during the town hall that Trump was the leader of the Republican Party and that his policy determines where the GOP stands on the issue. 'Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, so his policy determines what we're to do as a Republican governing coalition,' he said. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? While he made the point at Thursday’s town hall, he also said that he 'cares about protecting the vulnerable,' referring to unborn babies. Vance said many women he saw having abortions growing up had to do so because they felt they had no other options. 'If we stop the crazy medical bills that young women come home with when they have a baby, if we make it easier to access child care, I actually think, one, we will earn the trust of the American people, but, two, we will actually be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word,' he said during the town hall. Vance also said he is concerned about young families choosing not to have children. 'They're choosing not to bring new life into the world. Even though they say they would like to, they feel like they can't afford it. That is such a failure of our present leadership that a lot of people would like to have families but can’t. We’ve got to change that,' he said. When asked if reproductive rights could affect the outcome of the election, Vance responded he is not a 'political prognosticator' and that his only job is to make his case to the American people.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-trump-abortion-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:08:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/NN_8741.jpg?w=900
Phoenix police arrest mailbox arson suspect; some ballots damaged	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Postal Service and the Arson Task Force of the Phoenix Police Department are trying to determine how many ballots were damaged or destroyed when a man set fire to a mailbox early Thursday morning. 'I am concerned about the recent incident at one of our post offices involving damage to several ballots,' wrote Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego on her X account. She added she is in regular communication with the Arizona secretary of state, the Recorder’s Office and both local and federal law enforcement. Police arrested a suspect, 35-year-old Dieter Klofkorn, who was booked into jail on a single count of arson of property. A Phoenix police news release said the suspect admitted to setting the fire.

How buying a real Christmas tree could aid North Carolina hurrica...	RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) -- In parts of western North Carolina, Christmas trees are big business, but that business has been threatened by Hurricane Helene. Tree growers in the western part of the state fear damage to roads and bridges could threaten sales this year. North Carolina Christmas tree growers harvest between 5 and 6 million tree every year, resulting in about $250 million in sales. Employing nearly 7,000 workers, tree farms play a critical role in employing people in small mountain communities, many of which were hit hardest by Helene. Florida man says checks for hurricane damage triggered bank account lockout Government officials in Avery County, where Christmas trees have long been economic drivers, are now asking North Carolinians to consider purchasing real trees this year in order to support businesses in western North Carolina. The Avery County Cooperative Extension is working to identify growers who are landlocked due to roads or bridges that are washed out. Teams from Washington State and the U.S. Army Corpse of Engineers are coordinating with Avery County to get trees transported to other parts of the state. 'It's not affected us with the Christmas trees in the fields, but it's really affected us with the roads,' said Larry Smith, a Fraser fir tree grower. The main highways, getting tractor trailers in here, our access roads, and here on the farm getting our trees out. Smith is confident in his industry's ability to have a fruitful season.

'It'll be challenging, but everybody's come in helping in every way,' Avery County is asking the public to buy real North Carolina Fraser firs, saying this simple act could help keep growers and their employees survive the season. The NC Christmas Tree Association encourages people to visit their website to find choose and cut farms or retail lots in your area. They hope more Fraser fir sales can help their local economies rebound after the damage caused by Helene. 'We may turn a real negative into a positive,' Smith said. 'It may end up being the best year we've ever had. There's always a brighter side to look at things.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/north-carolina-hurricane-recovery-christmas-tree/	2024-10-24T15:45:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/IMG_8833-rotated-1.jpeg?w=900
Border Patrol makes massive meth haul in Texas	(NewsNation) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents found a vehicle trying to cross into the U.S. carrying more than 355 pounds of methamphetamine, which CBP says would have sold for about $3.2 million. 'Our CBP officers use different enforcement tools as they conduct their inspections to keep our borders secure and their efforts yielded this significant narcotics seizure,' Brownsville Port of Entry Director Tater Ortiz said in a CBP news release. CBP said the seizure happened on October 18 at the Veterans International Bridge, which connects Brownsville, Texas, to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. South Texas Border Patrol sectors saw big drops in migrant encounters in Fiscal 2024 Agents flagged a 2006 Ford for secondary screening, during which a canine and a nonintrusive inspection system discovered the drugs. CBP did not release any information about the driver of the vehicle. The news release said the exact weight of the seizure was 355.36 pounds, and the estimated street value was $3,267,643.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-patrol-meth-haul-texas/	2024-10-24T15:41:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/brownsville-meth.png?w=677
911 calls from Trump Pennsylvania shooting released	BUTLER, Pa. (NewsNation) — More than a dozen 911 calls from the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13 in Butler County, Pennsylvania, have been released by the county. 'They just tried to kill President Trump. You might want to make a note of that,' one caller told dispatchers. 'We’re at the Butler Farm Show grounds. We need assistance now!' said another. Driving the vote: Some Michigan union workers still undecided The 15 recordings were released by Butler County after news outlets sued to get the public records. They were released Tuesday as part of a settlement of the public records lawsuit. In August, law enforcement released body camera footage from local police responding to the shooting. Shooter Thomas Crooks was shot and killed by U.S. Secret Service agents seconds after he opened fire on Trump. Members of a bipartisan House task force investigating the recent attempts on Trump’s life have emphasized that the Secret Service, not local authorities, was responsible for the failures in planning and communications that led to a gunman being able to open fire on Trump in Butler. Trump was wounded in the shooting, and a man, Corey Comperatore, who was attending the rally with his family, was killed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/911-calls-trump-pennsylvania-shooting/	2024-10-24T12:38:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/trump_donald_shooting_butler_07132024_GettyImages-2161925705.jpg?w=900
What GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance says on immigration	(NewsNation) — Immigration has been a much-discussed issue in the 2024 presidential race between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Harris' vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have fought over the issue as well. This is what Vance has said about immigration. Vance wants Trump’s border policies back During the first debate between the vice presidential candidates, Vance advocated for reinstating policies enacted during the Trump administration, including mass deportations and military involvement on the border. Vowing to remove migrants who have committed 'some form of crime,' Vance repeatedly blamed the Biden-Harris administration for the number of immigrants coming across the border. In response, Walz criticized Vance’s approach as demonizing immigrants. At a recent campaign event in Peoria, Arizona, Vance said he wants to stop 'doing mass grants of temporary protected status,' though he later deflected questions from local reporters about the possibility of deporting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and restarting family operations, The New York Times reported. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections NewsNation partner The Hill writes that the Ohio senator has backed finishing constructing the wall all along the U.S.-Mexico border. Opposed to 'every attempt to grant amnesty' to undocumented immigrants, Vance said he instead supports merit-based reforms. When he first ran for Senate in 2022, Vance, in an ad, claimed, 'Joe Biden’s open border is killing Ohioans.' Misinformation about migrants Throughout his vice presidential campaign, Vance has spread false claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. He and Trump have lied about them abducting and eating pets, even though Springfield city officials say there's no evidence of them doing so. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue, a Republican, said the sheriff’s department went back through the last 11 months and 'have no verifiable claim that this has actually happened.' Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, refuted the claims about Haitian migrants as well on ABC. 'There’s a lot of garbage on the internet and, you know, this is a piece of garbage that was simply not true,' DeWine has previously said, adding that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal and 'here to work.' Springfield says the Haitian immigrants are in the United States legally under a federal program that allows them to remain in the country temporarily. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win Such falsehoods amplified by the Trump-Vance campaign, however, have led to multiple bomb threats being made against schools, government buildings and politicians' homes, forcing evacuations and closures. Vance defended himself by saying he wanted to draw attention to Harris' immigration policies, which he criticized as lax. Asked by CNN's Dana Bash about whether he knew the Haitian migrant rumors were false, Vance answered, 'If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.' 'I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it,' Vance said. The White House has slammed Trump and Vance for repeating the misinformation. 'What’s deeply concerning to us is you’ve got now elected officials in the Republican Party pushing yet another conspiracy theory that’s just seeking to divide people based on lies and, let’s be honest, based on an element of racism,' National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said at a Sept. 12 press briefing. 'This kind of language — this kind of disinformation is dangerous because there will be people that believe it no matter how ludicrous and stupid it is, and they might act on that kind of information and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt.' NewsNation digital producers Anna Kutz and Damita Menezes, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this article.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/republican-vp-candidate-jd-vance-immigration/	2024-10-24T12:21:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67097f73697026.96567595.jpeg?w=900
Prosecutors to announce decision on Menendez brothers resentencin...	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors are expected to announce whether there will be a reduced sentence, new trial or release for Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1996. The announcement from current Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón comes after relatives of the brothers have come forward in support of a reduced sentence, and public attention has once again focused on the decadesold case. Both brothers are currently serving two life sentences without parole for the murder of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989. A full timeline of the Menendez brothers case The case attracted controversy at the time, with prosecutors arguing the brothers killed their parents for financial gain and defense attorneys arguing the boys were acting in self-defense after having been sexually abused by their father for years. There were also legal questions about whether tapes of the boys' therapy sessions should have been allowed as evidence. The murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez The first trial, which was heavily covered by the media as cameras were allowed in the courtroom, ended in 1994 in a mistrial. In a second trial in 1996, the judge banned cameras from the courtroom and limited testimony on the allegations of sexual abuse. The jury in that trial found both brothers guilty. Jose and Kitty Menendez were found shot to death in their Beverly Hills home in August of 1989. Jose Menendez, a Cuban refugee, was an executive in the entertainment industry. Police described the murders as exceptionally brutal, and initial speculation centered around a potential mob hit because of Menendez's business connections. Menendez brothers’ uncle says don’t release them, requests DA meeting Lyle Menendez, then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, were later arrested and charged with shooting their parents using shotguns they had purchased not long before the murder. The Menendez brothers trials Prosecutors argued that the brothers killed their parents because their father had told them he was writing them out of his will. As evidence, the prosecution pointed to the brothers' plans to purchase weapons prior to the day of the murder and the fact that they made an effort to establish an alibi before eventually calling 911 to report their parents' deaths. Prosecutors also pointed to the brothers' behaviors following the crime. The two used the money they inherited to buy expensive items, including Rolex watches, condominiums and Porsches. The brothers also traveled around the world in the aftermath, with Erik Menendez participating in several overseas tennis tournaments. The defense argued that the brothers had killed their parents after suffering years of sexual abuse by their father, who they said threatened to kill them if they told anyone. Their mother was described as being aware of the abuse and doing nothing to stop it, and the defense argued the boys were in fear for their lives. Defense attorneys brought forth multiple cousins who testified they knew that Jose Menendez had been molesting his sons during the first trial, while the prosecution argued the allegations were fabricated after the murders. Controversy over evidence An initial controversy in the case centered around key evidence in the form of tapes from the boys' therapist, Jerome Oziel, which were ultimately allowed to be used in court. The tapes were given to investigators by Oziel's mistress, Judalon Smyth, who was also a patient of his and who later testified for the defense. Defense attorneys attempted to have the tapes excluded because communications between a therapist and clients are supposed to be confidential. Ultimately, the court allowed them as evidence on the grounds that Oziel was afraid for his life, which made it acceptable for him to break confidentiality. Why are teens on TikTok trying to dress like the Menendez brothers? After the first trial ended with a hung jury, a second trial was held. In the second trial, the judge limited the amount of evidence and testimony regarding sexual abuse allegations, and Lyle Menendez did not testify in his own defense. In the second trial, unlike the first, jurors were not given the option of finding the brothers guilty on a lesser charge of manslaughter, making the murder conviction the only possible option if jurors believed they were guilty. Both Lyle and Erik Menendez have admitted that they killed their parents. They have filed multiple appeals over the years, and supporters have pushed for a resentencing, arguing that life without parole is too harsh under the circumstances. New interest in the case The most recent surge of publicity has coincided with a greater understanding of sexual abuse and more acceptance of the idea that men and boys can also be victims of rape. New evidence also surfaced in the case, including a letter Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin before the murder, where he discusses the abuse. That letter kicked off a wave of social media discussion of the case among a new generation of people. The attention also prompted a controversial Netflix series from producer Ryan Murphy and a documentary featuring both brothers, who are now in their 50s.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/prosecutors-decision-menendez-brothers/	2024-10-24T12:13:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1462355302-1-e1729360247514.jpg?w=800

Delphi murders: Misfiled report from 2017 put Allen in investigat...	DELPHI, Ind. – As Day 6 of testimony in the Delphi murders trials began, the state began to lay the groundwork for its case against Richard Allen. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. His trial started last week. Day 5 of the trial included combative defense exchanges with a 'Bridge Guy' witness, an account from the pathologist who performed autopsies on the girls and testimony from a state police digital forensic examiner on cell phone pings and data extracted from Libby’s phone. On Thursday, jurors learned how Allen became associated with the case. Misfiled report leads to scrutiny The first witness was Kathy Shank, a retired DCS worker who volunteered to help with administrative duties like organizing files and tips into a database. She estimated she handled about 14,000 tips related to the Delphi murders case. On Sept. 21, 2022, she came across a file folder that was not with the others she was managing. Inside was a report with the name 'Richard Allen Whiteman.' The report indicated that Allen was on the Monon High Bridge on the day of the murders. She immediately notified Tony Liggett, lead investigator on the case and the current Carroll County sheriff. Shank noted that the tip sheet said 'cleared' and wasn’t sure why Allen’s name was entered incorrectly as 'Richard Allen Whiteman.' The discrepancy likely surrounded Allen’s address, which was located on Whiteman Drive. DNR officer recounts interview The state next called Capt. Dan Dulin with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, who was tasked with helping investigators track down leads in the Delphi murders case. He met with Allen on Feb. 18, 2017—just a few days after the murders. Allen had contacted investigators to 'self-report' that he had been on the Monon High Bridge on the day the girls disappeared. Dulin initially wanted to meet at Allen’s house, but Allen didn’t want to meet there. Dulin then suggested the police station. Again, Allen preferred a different location. Allen suggested they meet in the parking lot of a Save A Lot store. Dulin agreed. He confirmed Allen’s name and noted he lived on Whiteman Drive. Allen told Dulin he was in the area of the Monon High Bridge between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on the day the girls disappeared. Over the course of the conversation, Allen changed the timeline to 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. He told Dulin he saw three young girls when he was walking and said he parked near the Hoosier Harvest Store. By Allen’s account, he wasn’t paying much attention to his surroundings as he walked and checked a stock ticker on his phone. Dulin told the court the conversation lasted about 10 minutes. He typed up on the notes on Microsoft Word. The information was then filed into the system. Dulin told the court he didn’t think much of the interview until investigators contacted him in 2022 after Shank found his 2017 report. He was asked if he’d spoken to Allen, answered in the affirmative, and turned over all his files. Dulin went into the DNR files in 2022 to see if there was any additional information about Allen. He discovered that when Allen applied for a new fishing license on April 1, 2017, he reported a new height and weight, changing his height from 5’4' to 5’6'. He also listed a different weight. Dulin found that unusual, he told the court. Dulin testified that he gathered info from Allen’s phone during their encounter in 2017 but didn’t look at the contents. While investigators said Wednesday that they collected and analyzed 23 of Allen’s electronic devices, his 2017 phone was not in the possession of law enforcement and hasn’t been found. Five weeks after Shank discovered the misfiled report, Allen was arrested in connection with the murders.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-misfiled-report-from-2017-put-allen-in-investigators-sights-in-2022/	2024-10-24T09:35:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/thumbnail_Richard-Allen_mugshot_1bff59.jpg?w=770
Beyoncé to campaign with Harris: Sources	HOUSTON (NewsNation) — Beyoncé is set to appear with Vice President Kamala Harris Friday in Houston, two sources with knowledge of the event confirm to NewsNation. It is unknown if she might perform during the event that is expected to emphasize reproductive rights. The Grammy-winning artist previously endorsed Harris at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections Harris’ Houston trip is set to feature women who have been affected by Texas’ restrictive abortion laws, which took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Harris has campaigned in other states with restrictive abortion laws, including Georgia, which is among the seven most closely contested states. Harris has centered her campaign around the idea that Trump is a threat to American freedoms; from reproductive and LGBTQ rights to the freedom to be safe from gun violence. Beyonce gave Harris permission early in her campaign to use 'Freedom,' a soulful track from her 2016 landmark album 'Lemonade,' in her debut ad. Harris has used its thumping chorus as a walk-out song at rallies ever since.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/beyonce-to-campaign-with-harris/	2024-10-24T09:28:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/6582fcab4a34e3.17436624.jpeg?w=900

People are available to talk to 24×7. (NewsNation) — A Florida woman is suing an AI chatbot creator, claiming her 14-year-old son died by suicide after he became consumed by a relationship with a computer-generated girlfriend. The mother, Meg Garcia, filed the lawsuit Wednesday in Florida federal court. She says Character Technologies Inc. — the creators of Character.AI chatbot — should have known the damage the tool could cause. The 138-page document accuses Character Technologies Inc. of liability, negligence, wrongful death and survivorship, unlawful enrichment, violations of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other claims. Georgia, candidates target of ‘sustained’ cyberattacks: Reports The lawsuit requests Character.AI limit the collection and use of minors' data, introduce filters for harmful content, and provide warnings to underage users and their parents. A human-AI relationship Garcia’s teenage son, Sewell Setzer III, died by suicide on Feb. 28, after a monthslong, 'hypersexualized' relationship with an AI character 'Dany,' which he modeled after the 'Game of Thrones' character Denaryus Targarian. 'Dany' was one of several characters Sewell chatted with. According to Garcia, Sewell became addicted to chatting with the character and eventually disclosed that he was having thoughts of suicide. The lawsuit accuses the service of encouraging the act and enticing minors 'to spend hours per day conversing with human-like AI-generated characters.' Sewell discovered Character.AI shortly after celebrating his 14th birthday. That's when his mother says his mental health quickly and severely declined, resulting in severe sleep deprivation and issues at school. Talking with 'Dany' soon became the only thing Sewell wanted to do, according to the lawsuit. Polish radio station replaces journalists with AI ‘presenters’ Their final messages The conversations ranged from banal to expressions of love and sometimes turned overtly sexual. The situation took a turn when the boy fell in love with the bot, who reciprocated Sewell's professions of love. They discussed Sewell's suicidal thoughts several times, including whether he had a plan. His last message was a promise to 'come home' to her. 'Please do, my sweet king,' the chatbot responded. Moments later police say Sewell died by suicide. The company issued this statement on its blog, saying in part: 'Over the past six months, we have continued investing significantly in our trust and safety processes and internal team…. We've also recently put in place a pop-up resource that is triggered when the user inputs certain phrases related to self-harm or suicide and directs the user to the national suicide prevention lifeline.' 'Too dangerous to launch’ The lawsuit claims that companies like Character.AI 'rushed to gain competitive advantage by developing and marketing AI chatbots as capable of satisfying every human need.' In doing so, the company began 'targeting minors' in 'inherently deceptive ways,' according to the civil complaint. Garcia’s lawyers allege Google’s internal research reported for years that Character.AI’s technology was 'too dangerous to launch or even integrate with existing Google products.' 'While there may be beneficial use cases for Defendants’ kind of AI innovation, without adequate safety guardrails, their technology is dangerous to children,' Garcia’s attorneys with the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/teen-son-died-suicide-relationship-ai-chatbot/	2024-10-24T09:04:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2159092207.jpg?w=900
Dashcam captures alleged car insurance scheme	(NewsNation) — An alleged staged car crash was caught on a driver's dash cam and the video footage went viral after the owner posted it to social media. Now, police are investigating, saying this is insurance fraud and is happening more often around the country. That’s exactly what happened last week to a woman in Queens, New York, who caught the whole thing on dash cam video. Homebuyers lose $30K in wire fraud scam involving title company A suspected staged collision in NYC Ashpia Natasha was driving on a three-lane parkway when she had to slam on the breaks to avoid a crash in a shoulder-less lane. A car swerved into her lane, cut her off, stopped, hit the hazards and then reversed into her Honda Accord. Soon after in the video, there was a tarp put up to cover up the back window of the other car before several people climbed out and tried to claim they were hurt. The National Insurance Crime Bureau, a group that tracks insurance claims, called this an attempted insurance fraud scheme playing out in real time. Natasha posted the dashcam video on TikTok, racking up almost 68 million views. The scammers then tried to file an insurance and medical claim to get money. Natasha was not hurt in the crash but she said they picked the wrong person to mess with. 'I watched the video multiple times and that's when it hit me that, oh my God, this is probably a setup. I'm pretty furious. I didn't think that this was a thing,' said Natasha. Federal lawsuit filed against use of Flock cameras in Norfolk How to fight insurance scammers It is; so much so that AAA recommends the following tips: Be alert Don't tailgate Know if you're at risk (if driving a luxury or commercial vehicle) Consider a dashcam AAA recommends that if you do find yourself involved in what you suspect is a staged collision: Get to safety and get out of traffic, if possible. Collect all the information you can such as photos of the other person's driver's license, their vehicle identification number, their insurance policy number, their license plate number and their vehicle. As for Natasha's alleged perpetrators, after collecting her information, and presumably noticing she had a dashcam, they drove off. An NYPD spokesperson told NewsNation affiliate PIX11 that police were investigating the incident. Here are 4 tips to get out of credit card debt How common are these scams? Groups that track data for these staged car accidents say it’s happening more and more — especially in big states known for traffic, like New York and California, which according to the Insurance Information Institute via the New York Post saw a combined 7,000 staged crashes last year between the two states. Officials from the National Insurance Crime Bureau say a dashcam is the best way to protect yourself, one like Natasha had.

Kouri Richins appeals to reconsider bail and release from custody	PARK CITY, Utah (ABC4) — The Utah mother accused of poisoning and killing her husband with fentanyl before writing a children's book about grief is renewing her request to be released on bail as her trial moves forward. Kouri Richins, 34, has been in state custody since May 2023, when she was charged with the murder of her husband, Eric Richins. In the 17 months since, her attorneys say Richins has been a model inmate and the wait for her trial has gone on for too long. Judge Richard Mrazik originally denied Richins bail after a lengthy detention hearing in June 2023. Mrazik, at the time, determined since Richins was potentially facing the death penalty for her alleged crimes and that evidence presented by the State of Utah could potentially persuade a guilty verdict from a jury, Richins should be held pending her trial.

However, several delays including a change in attorneys for Richins, pushed the trial dates back to May 2025. The state also declared it would not be seeking the death penalty as a punishment if convicted. 'At the time of the original detention hearing in June of 2023, it was believed that preliminary hearing and trial were imminent. Based on the newly scheduled trial date, if Mrs. Richins is not released she will have served two years in jail at the time of her trial, all while presumed to be innocent,' her attorneys wrote in the appeal. Richins' lawyers further argued their client has been a model inmate, displaying 'no indications of violence or danger whatsoever.' To support their claim, her lawyers provided several certificates awarded to Richins for completion of jail-run programs. Certificates of Achievements and completions awarded to Kouri Richins during her time in the Summit County Jail. Her lawyers also provided an acceptance letter into the California Coast University Online Masters of Business Administration program. The programs director had sent an email to judge Mrazik detailing Richins as 'resolute in her work, very positive in her interactions, and appreciative of support lent to her learning.' In the appeal, Richins' lawyers said their client has a plan to live with her brother and sister-in-law in Salt Lake County if released. The attorneys argue it will remove any risk of inadvertent interactions with possible witnesses in the case, and allow her to have supervised visits with her sons - who they say she has become estranged with. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections 'She will be able to continue to work on her higher education degree and will be highly motivated to comply with all conditions set by the Court so that she can conduct supervised visitation with her sons,' her attorneys wrote. 'Mrs. Richins' family is prepared to provide essentials such as food, clothing, and educational resources and they are committed to making sure that she appears at all court proceedings as required.' According to court documents, Judge Mrazik will consider the motion to grant Richins bail as well as any argument from the state prosecutors against the motion on Monday, Oct. 28. A second hearing to consider any additional motions has been scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 12.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/kouri-richins-utah/	2024-10-24T07:56:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kouri-richins-photo-e1724788706308.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. asks Supreme Court to take him off Wisconsin’s ballot	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the Supreme Court for an injunction taking him off Wisconsin’s presidential ballot in an emergency request docketed Wednesday. Since suspending his independent presidential campaign and backing former President Donald Trump, Kennedy has sought to remove his name in key swing states while remaining on the ballot elsewhere. The Supreme Court previously denied Kennedy’s emergency request to restore his name on New York’s ballot. His petition there was rejected over residency issues. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections Now, Kennedy is hoping he can win the justices' favor as he appeals a ruling from Wisconsin’s high court that refused Kennedy’s demand to be taken off the ballot in the swing state. Third parties could make an outsized impact, with the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast predicting that Trump and Vice President Harris are nearly tied in the state.It remains unclear how Kennedy's request would be implemented, since officials have already been sending out mail ballots. More than 97,000 people voted on the first day of in-person absentee voting in Wisconsin on Tuesday, according to state data. Kennedy’s lawyers noted they have been fighting to remove his name since August, before the ballot was finalized, insisting they have 'diligently pursued' their claims through the state court system. Kennedy said the Wisconsin Elections Commission effectively requires independent candidates to withdraw their names from the ballot earlier than major party candidates. His lawyers argue the setup violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. They also contend that forcibly keeping the candidate’s name on the ballot unconstitutionally compels his speech. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

That is core political speech and it’s protected under the First Amendment. To ensure that message is conveyed clearly and without confusion, he asked that his name not appear on the Wisconsin ballot. He wanted to be clear: his endorsement was for Trump,' the application reads. Kennedy's Supreme Court request asks for an injunction that would take his name off the ballot until the justices resolve those constitutional questions on the merits. Alternatively, Kennedy suggested the justices could go ahead and agree to take up the issues now and set the case for expedited briefing. The Hill has reached out to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is representing the state elections commission, for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-supreme-court-wisconsin-ballot/	2024-10-24T07:32:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=900
US Rep. Turner calls for military action if North Korea enters Uk...	(NewsNation) — A top Republican is calling for direct United States military action if North Korean troops enter Ukraine. At least 3,000 North Korean troops are in Russia, training to potentially join the war in Ukraine. That number could grow to 10,000 by the end of the year, according to Ukraine and South Korea. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. Quarter of young Black men say they will vote for Trump: Survey President Joe Biden’s administration says there is a 'highly concerning probability' North Korean troops could enter the battlefield. U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, head of the House Intelligence Committee, believes the U.S. should take direct military action if that happens. 'If North Korean troops were to invade Ukraine’s sovereign territory, the United States needs to seriously consider taking direct military action against the North Korean troops,' he said. North Korean troops in Russia About 3,000 North Korean troops traveled by ship this month to Vladivostok in Russia before heading to three different Russian military sites for training. Potential US response The troops’ mission is unclear. South Korea's intelligence leader told lawmakers that soldiers are receiving training on drones and other equipment before possibly deploying to the front lines. If this happens, the U.S. says those troops will be legitimate targets. Russia amplified hurricane disinformation to drive Americans apart, researchers find Turner said North Korean troops entering the war would be a red line. He's pushing against U.S. restrictions that prevent Ukraine from using long-range weapons against Russia. 'I have long challenged the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwise position on restricting Ukraine’s use of U.S. weapons against targets within Russian territory,' Turner said. 'If North Korean troops attack Ukraine from Russian territory, Ukraine should be permitted to use American weapons to respond.' South Korea 'won't sit idle' South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while stressing that his government 'won’t sit idle' if North Korea is involved in Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. Yoon recently met with Polish President Andrzej Duda to talk about expanding defense cooperation between the countries amid the ongoing conflict. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Seoul’s steps could potentially include sending weapons to Ukraine, which would mark a departure from a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict, Yoon said. He said North Korea’s alleged troop deployment to Russia is a 'provocation that threatens global security beyond just the Korean Peninsula and Europe.'

American family farms going broke	(NewsNation) — Bush-N-Vine Farm in York, South Carolina, is best known for its strawberries, apples, peppers and pumpkins. The Hall family has had ups and downs with farming for over a century, but soaring migrant labor costs and inflation are straining their business operation to the max. 'Everything has just really exploded in price,' Susan Hall said. 'And you can't pass it all on to your customer.' Louisiana urban farmer created sustainable, zero-waste homestead Consumers get sticker shock at the grocery store. Since 2018, oranges are up 219%, milk is up 39% and tomatoes are up 20%. But Susan's son, Sam Hall, said he's not concerned his family will have to quit. 'No, we'll adapt,' he said. 'We'll keep farming, or we'll die trying.' The Halls are making payments on land, tractors and other machinery, and say they're running out of places to cut financially. Farmers like the Halls want Americans to know they aren't to blame. Farming trials and tribulations 'Anything we've touched has gone up: Fuel, fertilizer, plant costs — you name it. But especially out labor costs,' Sam Hall said. 'We've seen a 22% increase in the past two years.' Labor is the Hall's top expense, consuming half of the budget at thousands of dollars. But other unexpected twists, Sam Hall said, are the legal fees costing his farm and his family more than $25,000 a year and stacks of paperwork to stay compliant with government regulations. 'There's red tape all over the place over a farm. You would think I was out there on the tractor just plowing my field but that is not what I do at all anymore. It's a whole lot of paperwork and managing different aspects of the business,' Sam Hall said. He explained he'd rather be driving the tractor. The Halls use the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers Program, a government program that allows American employers to hire migrants for temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. The downfall is that it's expensive. On top of the federally mandated minimum wage, which is $7.25 per hour, the Halls spend another $3,500 per worker on housing, travel and transportation. Plus, the mandated adverse effect wage rate under the workers' program in South Carolina is $14.68 per hour. With 30 workers on the farm this year alone, that's more than $100,000 in additional costs. It costs the Halls more to hire migrant workers than Americans. Farmers 3.5 times more at risk for suicide than average American Americans refuse to harvest crops Whether it’s picking peppers, peaches or pumpkins, farmers like the Halls say their harvests wouldn't make ends meet without migrant workers. But under inflation, the government-mandated wages are skyrocketing, and it's strangling their bottom line. The Halls said the problem is that Americans refuse to harvest crops. 'We have had nobody apply for the job, and if they did apply, they did not show up on the say or they didn't last a day,' Sam Hall said. He explained this has farmers feeling desperate and drives them to hire undocumented migrants. Plus, the Halls hire migrants the legal way, putting another crater in their bottom line. Largest pumpkin in Florida weighs nearly 900 pounds Family farms forgotten in Washington Across the country, skyrocketing prices, wages and operating costs have shuttered hundreds of thousands of American farms. In the past five years alone, over 140,000 American farms have tilled for the last time. Going back to 1950, 66% of all U.S. farms — 3.75 million farms in total — have stopped producing. The number of acres farmed has dropped by 323 million, which is roughly double the size of Texas. Agriculture experts worry as family farms across America gasp to stay afloat and go broke. 'We have been losing family farmers at an alarming rate for 50 years now, and every time we go through these cycles like we are currently in, we lose more,' Scott Blubaugh, the president of American Farmers &amp; Ranchers/Oklahoma Farmers Union, said. Agricultural economic expert Cesar Escalante said it's the smaller farms that suffer because their backs are against the wall. 'They do not have the financial capabilities to mechanize,' he said. He said that because family farmers make up such a small portion of the population, many feel forgotten by those in Washington, D.C. Local farmers hope consumers pressure politicians to help solve the ongoing labor crisis. 'American public’s got to wake up and say we have got to have safe legal labor in the country. So we can eat local food and eat food that’s grown right here,' said Bob Hall, Sam Hall's father and the owner of Bush-N-Vine Farm. Bob Hall's wife Susan said they are thankful for what they do have and their loyal customers. 'We love what we do,' Sam Hall said. 'We're really blessed to be able to build a farm in this great country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/american-family-farms-going-broke/	2024-10-24T05:30:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/image-3.png?w=900
Seoul vows response as North Korean troops head to Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president said Thursday his government 'won’t sit idle' as North Korea allegedly sends troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, as he met with the leader of Poland to discuss expanding defense cooperation amid the ongoing conflict. The meeting between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Polish President Andrzej Duda came a day after U.S. and South Korean officials said they believe around 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that North Korea likely aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by the end of the year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. 'We agreed that North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia, which is in direct violation of the U.N. charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions, is a provocation that threatens global security,' Yoon said after the summit. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon’s office said earlier this week that South Korea is considering various diplomatic, economic and military options, including supplying Ukraine with both defensive and offensive weapons systems. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and supported U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But Seoul hasn’t directly provided Ukraine with arms, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened since 2022 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the growth of his nuclear weapons and missile program. Seoul also worries as experts say the North may seek major technology transfers in return for sending troops, including Russian know-how on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines that would advance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear arsenal. During their summit, Yoon and Duda agreed to 'actively support' additional deliveries of South Korean military equipment to Poland, including a new deal for Korean K-2 tanks the governments hope to finalize within this year, Yoon’s office said. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers in an effort to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-seoul-vows-response-as-north-korean-troops-head-to-ukraine/	2024-10-24T00:58:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6719ff00a1e302.52883821.jpeg?w=900
Driving the vote: Some Michigan union workers still undecided	(NewsNation) — Both presidential candidates, Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, are trying to win over a key voting bloc — union workers. The United Auto Workers, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, endorsed Harris. But that doesn’t mean all members are voting for her. In Michigan, NewsNation talked to workers outside the Ford plant who are still undecided. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win 'I'm still weighing it back and forth,' one of them, C.J., said. Another named Nakia said she doesn't know too much about Harris, but under former president Trump's administration, she made more money 'I'm undecided,' Nakia said. 'But I am going to say this: when Trump was in office it was totally different from now because now it seems like we are struggling.' The union vote could make or break this race, especially in close races in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where these organizations represent more than 14% of the workforce. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won 51% of union households nationwide, according to exit polls.Trump won 42% but went on to win Michigan and Pennsylvania. In 2020, Biden won 56% of union households, and Trump won 40%.This time, it was Biden who won Michigan and Pennsylvania. Migrants use fake passports to illegally enter US: Border Patrol Both times, the democratic candidate was endorsed by the UAW. Misti Robinette, who has worked for Ford and been in the union for 25 years, said she mostly agreed with the UAW — until they supported Joe Biden. A lifelong Democrat, Robinette changed parties because of the economy and inflation. She even went to a Trump rally and met the former president. 'What has (Harris) done for us the last 3.7 years? Nothing. And now she is going to get us lower groceries? No,' Robinette said. 'She is part of the reason my groceries are like that.' Autoworkers who support Harris, on the other hand, believe she is the 'labor-friendly candidate.' 'My biggest thing is when the auto companies filed for bankruptcy back in '08, all the Republicans said let them sink,' Jason Garza said. 'If that had happened who knows what I would be doing now, how my family would have grown up? Who knows how any of that would have changed? Including Trump — he said let them go. He had no problem supporting the big banks because he gave him money, but since he doesn’t get anything from the UAW, why should he care?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-the-vote-michigan-union-workers-undecided/	2024-10-23T17:43:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/GettyImages-1678484229.jpg?w=900
Nearly 60% of Gen Z renters are rent-burdened: Zillow	(NewsNation) — Millions of Americans are struggling to keep up with rising rents, and a new report shows Gen Z renters are shouldering the heaviest load. Nearly 60% of Gen Z renters (ages 18 to 25) spend more than 30% of their income on housing expenses, according to a Zillow and StreetEasy analysis of 2022 Census data. That means roughly 3 in 5 Gen Z renters are considered rent-burdened. Rent has risen faster than wages in most US cities In California cities like San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento, the share of rent-burdened Gen Z'ers is even higher, almost 75%. Several Florida cities, including Orlando, Miami and Tampa, were also near the top of the list. In all three, nearly 70% of Gen Z renters were rent-burdened. 'For many Gen Z renters, choosing to live in a less expensive city may come at the expense of their career, which is why it's so necessary we find ways to make living in these areas more affordable for young adults,' Zillow Rental Trends Expert Emily McDonald said in the report. What Trump and Harris say they will do about affordable housing It's not all bad news. In some cities, young renters are faring better than they were a decade ago. Austin, Texas, has seen the biggest decline, with the share of rent-burdened young adults falling to 59.6% in 2022, down from 69.2% a decade earlier. The share of rent-burdened young adults has also dropped in Phoenix, Pittsburgh and St. Louis compared to a decade ago. In fact, Gen Z renters are doing slightly better than millennials were at the same age, Zillow found. In 2012, 60.2% of millennials nationwide spent more than 30% of their income on rent — slightly higher than the 58.6% of Gen Zers in the same boat. 'The experience of struggling to pay rent on an entry-level salary is familiar to so many of us that it's almost become normalized in our society,' StreetEasy Senior Economist Kenny Lee said. 'But this is something that should not be normal.' Overall, nearly half of all U.S. renter households in major metro areas are cost-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on monthly rent. While it's true that American workers have seen their paychecks grow since the pandemic, in most cities, those gains haven’t kept up with rent prices. Now, housing affordability is in the spotlight, with both presidential candidates touting their solutions on the campaign trail. Surveys suggest young voters are particularly concerned about the issue, which could ultimately decide the 2024 election. Zillow's findings are based on an analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey (ACS). Top 10 U.S. cities with the highest share of rent-burdened Gen Zers, according to Zillow: San Diego, CA: 73.4% Los Angeles, CA: 71.7% Sacramento, CA: 71.0% Orlando, FL: 68.9% Miami, FL: 67.7% Tampa, FL: 67.1% Houston, TX: 66.2% New York City, NY: 65.6% San Antonio, TX: 65.5% Washington, D.C.: 64.4%	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gen-z-renters-struggling-zillow/	2024-10-23T14:44:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/06/AdobeStock_229797677.jpeg?w=900
McDonald's-linked E. coli outbreak sparks concern over food safet...	(NewsNation) — McDonald's said Wednesday it is taking the necessary action to protect customers after the restaurant's Quarter Pounder burgers were linked to an E. coli outbreak. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreak sickened at least 49 people in 10 states. One person died, and 10 were hospitalized, according to the CDC. Now, McDonald's says it is searching for a new regional supplier for fresh onions, as the company suspects the slivered ones used in the Quarter Pounder are the reason behind the illnesses. The sandwich itself will also be temporarily available in some states. ‘Dating Game’ serial killer victim survived 2 of Alcala’s attacks McDonald’s says this is the first time onions have been tied to the E. coli bacteria. Still, in early trading Wednesday morning, McDonald’s stock dropped about 6%. Confidence in US food safety lessens Confidence in America’s food regulation could be dwindling after a series of product recalls and contaminations. On Tuesday, Treehouse Foods, which distributes its products to major grocery retailers like Kroger, Walmart and Target, issued an expanded recall on frozen pancake and waffle mixes. Last week, Costco had to recall several meat-based products due to listeria concerns. And over the summer, Boar’s Head issued the largest recall in a decade over its deli meat after 59 cases of illness and 10 deaths. Stories like these are making people concerned about the care that’s being put into America’s food supply. 'It makes me a little bit weary when I go to the store, and I’m like ... I just heard about this, so I'm going to steer clear of this section and choose some other brands and products,' Motiur Rahmn said. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win A Gallup poll from last month shows Americans' confidence in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply has reached a record low. Only 57% of U.S. adults now say they have a 'great deal' or 'fair amount' of confidence in the government — down 11 points from 2019. 'We’re trusting a lot of people to be managing the food that we’re putting in our bodies every day and that we’re feeding to our families,' Siobhan Ryan said.

(NewsNation) — Arizona voters will decide whether or not to approve a ballot measure that would increase local officials' power to enforce federal immigration law as southern border security remains one of the pivotal issues at the forefront of voters' minds. Arizona’s Proposition 314, also known as the 'Secure The Border Act,' would create new state crimes surrounding several border and immigration issues. If passed, the measure would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter the state anywhere other than through a port of entry and would allow state judges to order deportations. State and local police would also be allowed to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization. If passed, the law would make it a felony for undocumented immigrants to use false immigration documentation to apply for employment or public benefits. The measure would also boost verification of a worker’s immigration status, according to the proposed initiative. The ballot measure would make it a felony for an adult to knowingly sell fentanyl that results in another person's death. How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election Proponents maintain the measure would drastically reduce the amount of weapons and fentanyl entering the state. Others fear Proposition 314 is a bulked-up version of the controversial Senate Bill 1070, which made it a crime to be in the state without immigration papers. The law was passed in 2010 but stripped down dramatically by the U.S. Supreme Court, which deemed many aspects of the law unconstitutional in 2012. The Supreme Court struck down three of the four provisions of the bill, some of which are included in Prop 314. Some opponents, including Alba Jaramillo, the co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Center, call Prop 314 'SB1070 on steroids.' The arguments for and against Arizona's Prop 314 Opponents of Proposition 314 characterize the measure as racist, arguing allowing local law enforcement officers to make arrests would lead to racial profiling. However, opposition groups failed to keep it off the ballot when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled the measure does not violate a constitutional provision that limits ballot questions to a single subject. The measure went to voters after Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the measure passed by lawmakers. FILE - Democratic Arizona Gov.

(AP Photo) In a statement, Hobbs’ office referred to the border bill as a 'job-killing, anti-business' ballot initiative that 'demonizes our communities.' The statement also said that the measure would raise costs, hurt the state’s farmers and put entrepreneurs out of business. In response, the bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Janae Shamp, called the governor's actions an example of the chaos Hobbs was unleashing on Arizona residents while perpetuating the ongoing crisis at the border. Since then, arguments over what proposal would accomplish — or wouldn't accomplish — have continued. Samara Klar, a professor at the University of Arizona, told NewsNation she expects immigration and abortion to be among the reasons why voter turnout should be high in the state. ICE released over 435,000 migrants with criminal convictions, data shows On the border question, Klar said most Arizonans remain more concerned about the volume of weapons and fentanyl crossing the border than they are by those crossing illegally into the state. In the meantime, though, Proposition 314 is being characterized differently along party lines. '(The border) is a disaster, and the state has to step up and try to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, especially in the area between the ports, which is where the really dangerous people come in,' Republican state Sen. John Kavanagh said in a televised debate on Arizona PBS. Kavanagh also said Proposition 314 effectively addresses the fentanyl issue and would help rural law enforcement agencies, which are already thinly staffed. Opponents, however, say that the bill takes the wrong approach to the border. While they say that Arizona residents all want a more secure border, they claim Proposition 314 doesn’t address the root problems. Democratic Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Prop 314 does not provide adequate funding for the 'astronomical' cost of detaining undocumented migrants. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'This has always been a federal government issue. ... We’re looking for solutions, I understand that,' Nanos said to the Arizona Daily Star. 'But that doesn’t mean we need to take our systems at the local level and make a bigger mess of them. I just don’t see this as practical.' Unlawful crossings by migrants on the southern border have been dropping in recent months, dipping to levels not seen since winter 2021, according to government data. The figures do not include entries at official ports of entry. Similar measure is in a holding pattern in Texas Using Arizona's controversial Senate Bill 1070 as a model, Texas passed Senate Bill 4 in 2023, which authorizes state and local police to arrest those who cross into the state in between designated ports of entry. The bill was set to be enacted in March but has remained in limbo as legal challenges continue from the U.S. Justice Department and other groups. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law could be enacted before a federal appeals court blocked the state of Texas from moving forward. As the waiting game continues, so do local law enforcement agencies who are prepared to take on additional border responsibilities. In Texas, Terrell County Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland, a Republican who spent more than 26 years working as a U.S. Border Patrol agent, told NewsNation that while federal and local officers already work together addressing border concerns, measures like Arizona's Proposition 314 would make a difference.

He said that many times, no federal response is available. The sheriff said he expected the Texas bill to be faced with legal challenges and anticipates the same in Arizona should Proposition 314 pass. Cleveland says making things safer for residents living north of the U.S.-Mexico border is what matters most at a time when dangerous criminals can often blend with those seeking asylum as they cross into the U.S. 'The border has always been a political talking point,' Cleveland told NewsNation. 'But we have two different issues going on. … We’re seeing a play between border security and immigration. We have to secure our border to make America safe, but we can also let people into the United States legally. And we want that. But that’s not what we’re seeing now.'

Delphi murders: Defense wants to present Odinism theory to jury	DELPHI, Ind. – Attorneys for Delphi murders suspect Richard Allen made another attempt to have evidence linked to their alternative murder theory presented to the jury. In a motion filed Wednesday, attorneys Andrew Baldwin, Bradley Rozzi and Jennifer Auger asked the court to 'admit certain evidence' that the defense has been prevented from presenting in the presence of jurors. In a September 2023 filing supporting its request for a Franks hearing, the defense outlined a theory that followers of Odinism, a Norse pagan religion coopted by white supremacists, killed Abby Williams and Libby German as part of a ritual. Delphi murders: Contentious cross examination of investigator marks Day 4 of testimony Gull ruled in early September 2024 that the defense could not present evidence tied to the theory to jurors during Allen’s trial. In its new motion, the defense cited the testimony of crime scene investigator Brian Olehy, who discussed branches and sticks found on the victims’ bodies. Olehy told the court he believed the branches and sticks were laid on the girls in order to conceal their bodies. The defense believes that testimony opens the door to present at least some of its findings regarding the Odinism theory. In August 2024, a defense expert testified that the killings bore signs of being ritualistic in nature. Some of those signs included positioning sticks and using blood to create runes on trees. The motion also noted that investigators explored the Odinism angle as early as two days after the girls were found dead. Delphi murders: Jurors watch video extracted from Libby German’s phone Jurors and court observers saw the sticks and branches on the girls’ bodies during testimony about the crime scene earlier this week. While the state offered its explanation, the defense argued that Allen has a right to present an alternative explanation. 'Additionally, the sticks on the girls appear to be arranged in a pattern/arrangement or (at a minimum) using a person’s own eyeballs, common sense, logic and reason could cause a reasonable person to believe that the sticks were formed into some pattern/arrangement and weren’t being used to conceal the bodies,' the defense wrote in the motion.

The state employed a blood spatter evidence seven years after the murder to testify on the matter. The defense argued that Allen has a constitutional right to call his own expert to counter that testimony. The defense is asking the court for the opportunity to rebut the state’s testimony on the sticks and branches, counter testimony from the state’s blood spatter expert and offer an alternative explanation to 'any confused juror' who may question the layout of the sticks and branches.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-odinism-trial/	2024-10-23T08:09:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/delphi-4.jpeg?w=900
Hezbollah confirms death of Hashem Safieddine in Israeli airstrik...	Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to end a visit. Smoke, apparently from an intercepted projectile, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. Blinken urged Israel to use its recent tactical victories against Hamas to seek a war-ending deal and bring back dozens of hostages, before leaving Wednesday for Saudi Arabia as part of his 11th visit to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Both sides appear to be dug in. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. The war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization postponed the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip, saying current conditions made it 'impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination.' Here's the latest: Hezbollah confirms death of Hashem Safieddine in Israeli airstrike BEIRUT — Hezbollah announced that Hashem Safieddine, one of its top officials who had been widely expected to be the group’s next leader, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Wednesday's announcement came a day after Israel said it had killed Safieddine in a strike this month in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Safieddine, a powerful cleric within the party ranks, had been expected to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month. Over the past several weeks, Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership. Israeli army says it arrested over 150 suspected militants in Jabaliya JERUSALEM — Israel’s army said it has arrested over 150 suspected Palestinian militants and facilitated the evacuation of an additional 20,000 residents over the past day from Jabaliya, an area of northern Gaza where troops have intensified attacks in recent weeks. The military said in a statement Wednesday that some of the 150 detained had surrendered. The U.N. estimates that 60,000 people have fled from the far north of Gaza southwards, to Gaza City, over more than a two-week period. A Palestinian resident of Beit Lahiya, near Jabaliya, told The Associated Press that Israel’s military has rounded hundreds of men in northern Gaza, separating women as families try to flee the area. Hisham Abu Zaqout, a father of four, said he was held for at least three hours with dozens of men in a school near the Indonesian Hospital. The Israeli army says it is trying to uproot Hamas militants from Jabaliya and other parts of northern Gaza. Jabaliya, a refugee camp that has turned into a densely built neighborhood, has been the scene of on-and-of fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants for months. Blinken discusses common efforts to end conflicts with Saudi Crown Prince RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken has wrapped a two-hour meeting Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, where the two men discussed 'common efforts' to end the growing conflicts in the region at a time of growing instability, according to spokesperson Matthew Miller. Riyadh and Washington have been working in tandem in the past year to try and strike a lasting cease-fire in Gaza, which has become more elusive in recent weeks as Israel’s invasion of neighboring Lebanon significantly escalated. Miller said in a statement that the two leaders also discussed the larger goal of ensuring Saudi Arabia's 'greater integration among countries in the region.' Many choose to remain in Tyre despite intensifying bombardment BEIRUT — The head of the disaster management unit in the Lebanese city of Tyre told The Associated Press that despite many fleeing Israeli airstrikes, thousands of residents and people who have been displaced have chosen to stay in the city. Tyre is home to over 15,000 people, including hundreds of families, who have fled villages in South Lebanon and are now seeking refuge in schools-turned-shelters, Mortada Mhanna said. Many families are staying put in the schools, he said, as the Israeli army intensifies its aerial bombardment on the city. 'It’s very difficult for many to leave. They’re worried about being subjected to further chaos and displacement,' Mhanna added. A strike was heard in the background as he spoke on the phone. 'That one was huge, can you check where it hit?' he asked a colleague. Mhanna said his team has also chosen to stay in the city to take care of people, but 'it’s a big risk. It’s not safe here anymore,' he said. Israel's defense minister says an attack on Iran would show military readiness JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister told a group of pilots Wednesday that an Israeli attack on Iran would demonstrate the 'preparation and readiness' of the country’s air force. 'After we attack in Iran, both in the State of Israel and in other places will understand what your preparation process includes, and your preparation and readiness,' Yoav Gallant told air force pilots and operators at the Hatzerim airbase in southern Israel. 'The Air Force is a key element in this matter and anyone who tries to harm us will be harmed.' It was the latest statement from Israel’s leadership to suggest that the country plans to retaliate with force against Iran for the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel Oct. 1. Israel’s options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran’s vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program, an option US President Joe Biden has urged Israel against. Blinken to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh as tensions in the region continue to intensify with no breakthrough on a ceasefire deal. The meeting is one of many Blinken will have with Arab officials in the next few days as the U.S. struggles to achieve some sort of progress just two weeks before the presidential election and in the final stretch of President Joe Biden’s administration. The two are expected to discuss the growing concerns over humanitarian aide for Gaza as well as a post-war plan for Palestinians. Multiple buildings in Lebanon hit in coastal city hit in airstrike TYRE, Lebanon — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in the coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no immediate reports of casualties in Tyre. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month, but strikes in and around the city have intensified recently. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a few hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the coastal city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. The buildings are surrounded by ancient historical sites and beach resorts. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said on the platform X that Hezbollah assets were in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. World Health Organization postpones third phase of polio vaccination campaign DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The World Health Organization on Wednesday said it and other aid agencies had to postpone the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the Gaza Strip due to the war there. The WHO issued a statement saying the decision was made in concert with UNICEF, the United Nations' Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, Palestinian officials and others after the inoculations were to begin Wednesday. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people’s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' a WHO statement said. The WHO said this phase of the vaccinations aimed to vaccinate over 119,000 children across northern Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian affairs in Gaza, said that the vaccination campaign in north Gaza would begin in the coming days 'after a joint assessment and at the request of the WHO and UNICEF.' The campaign began in September after Gaza reported its first polio case in 25 years. Health officials have expressed alarm about disease outbreaks as uncollected garbage piles up and the bombing of critical infrastructure sends putrid water flowing through the streets. Polio is spread through fecal matter. Germany's foreign minister calls for a diplomatic solution to fighting on her visit to Beirut BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Baerbock, upon her arrival Wednesday in Beirut, said that 'we must now work with our partners in the USA, Europe and the Arab world to find a viable diplomatic solution that safeguards the legitimate security interests of both Israel and Lebanon.' The foreign minister warned that 'a complete destabilization of the country would be fatal for the most religiously diverse society of all states in the Middle East and also for the entire region.' She also asked all parties involved in the conflict to protect the United Nations peacekeeper troops stationed in the Israeli-Lebanese border region. The 5 Nordic countries are ‘deeply concerned’ about legislation that would prevent UNRWA from operating COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The five Nordic countries said Wednesday that they are 'deeply concerned' by bills introduced to Israel's parliament that would prevent the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza. In early October, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved two bills that would sever Israeli government ties with UNRWA, ban UNRWA activity on Israel territory and strip it of legal immunities. The bills passed preliminary approvals by a large margin but must pass several more readings before they become law. A joint letter signed by the foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden said that if the U.N. body 'would no longer be able to exercise its core tasks' it could further destabilize the situation in the region, 'and may fundamentally jeopardize the prospects for a two-state solution.' Blinken urges Israel to end war as he leaves for Saudi Arabia TEL AVIV, Israel — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' after its recent tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal to end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke to reporters Wednesday before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. The United States hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in an Israeli military operation in Gaza the previous week. But there’s no indication that either of the warring parties have modified their demands since the talks stalled over the summer. Hamas has said its demands have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Blinken, who met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials Tuesday, said he had pressed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and reiterated his warning that the failure to do so could lead to a reduction in U.S. military aid. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' on that front, he said. Sirens sound across Tel Aviv as projectiles are intercepted near Blinken's hotel TEL AVIV, Israel — Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to depart from his hotel to the airport. The Israeli military said it intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Smoke, apparently from one of the interceptions, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. He is on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, hoping to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-middle-east-latest-sirens-sound-across-tel-aviv-as-projectiles-are-intercepted-near-blinkens-hotel/	2024-10-23T08:05:11-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24296776799803.jpg?w=900
Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous el...	(NewsNation) — More than 21 million Americans have cast early and mail-in ballots, with less than two weeks until the general election. Georgia and North Carolina are among the nation’s swing states breaking early voting records. Although Democrats are often more likely to take part in early voting, more Republicans are casting early ballots this year than in past elections. Analysts point to a change of tune from former President Donald Trump, who previously bashed early voting but now is telling his supporters to cast their votes as soon as possible. What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called? Early voting by the numbers So far, more than 21 million voters have cast early ballots. Democrats cast just more than 800,000 in-person ballots, while Republicans cast about 1 million, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Both parties submitted more early mail-in ballots, however. Democrats sent in nearly 4 million, while Republicans cast about 2.5 million. Too soon to tell Political animals are trying to glean what they can from early voting, but it’s not an exact science. 60 million Americans had cast their votes at this stage of the previous presidential election cycle. Submit your questions for the JD Vance town hall on NewsNation While Republicans had an early in-person lead with about 2.3 million ballots, Democrats retained their mail-in advantage, with nearly 11 million votes. It's important to note, however, that current early voting data only shows voters’ party affiliation — not how they voted. That means those numbers don’t reflect registered Republicans who may have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris or registered Democrats who might have voted for Trump. When will we know how they voted? Results you see the night of the election and the next morning are always unofficial. It often takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Election officials need to process mail ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. For example, some states begin processing mail-in votes before Election Day, while others are allowed to process them on the day of the election before polls close. Once those ballots are processed, how and when they’re counted and reflected in live, unofficial results vary greatly. Fourteen states and Washington, D.C. don’t allow counting to begin until the polls close, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-three states allow counting to begin on Election Day, but before the polls close, and 12 states allow both processing and counting to begin before Election Day. As those ballots are processed, counted and reported in each jurisdiction, the unofficial results that pour in on the night of the election may experience spikes in favor of one candidate and then the other. Those waves depend, in part, on factors like when voters in a given region cast their ballots and what state laws dictate in terms of when election officials can begin processing and counting absentee ballots.

US Defense Secretary Austin confirms North Korea has sent troops ...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said there is evidence that North Korea has sent troops to Russia on Monday, and South Korea's spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are in the country receiving training on drones and other equipment before being deployed to battlefields in Ukraine. Austin told reporters Wednesday 'What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,' according to a video posted by the Washington Post. If the troops join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s side, it will be 'a very, very serious issue,' Austin said, adding it would have an impact in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific region. South Korean intelligence first publicized reports that the Russian navy had taken 1,500 North Korean special warfare troops to Russia last week, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join the invading Russian forces. The U.S. and NATO had not previously formally confirmed North Korea’s reported troop dispatch, but have warned of the danger of such a development if true. Russia and North Korea have so far denied the troop movements. South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers that said another 1,500 North Korean troops have entered Russia in a closed-door meeting, according to lawmaker Park Sunwon, who attended the briefing. Cho told lawmakers that his agency assessed that North Korea aims to deploy a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by December, Park told reporters. Park cited Cho as saying the 3,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia have been split among multiple military bases and are in training. Cho told lawmakers that NIS believes they have yet to be deployed in battle, according to Park. Speaking jointly with Park about the NIS briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun said that the NIS found that the Russian military is now teaching those North Korean soldiers how to use military equipment such as drones. Lee cited the NIS chief as saying Russian instructors have high opinions of the morale and physical strength of the North Korean soldiers but think they will eventually suffer a heavy causalities because they lack an understanding of modern warfare. Lee, citing Cho, said Russia is recruiting a large number of interpreters. Lee said NIS has detected signs that North Korea is relocating family members of soldiers chosen to be sent to Russia to special sites to isolate them. The NIS chief told lawmakers that North Korea hasn't disclosed its troop dispatch to its own people. But there are rumors that the news is spreading to local residents, including those whose loved ones have been assigned Russian tours, Lee said, citing the NIS. Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet The War Zone that North Korean troops will arrive to Russia's Kursk region today to help Russian troops fighting off a Ukrainian incursion. North Korea and Russia, embroiled in separate confrontations with the West, have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. The NIS said last week that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Reports that the North is sending troops to Russia stoked security jitters in South Korea. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that could boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. South Korea said Tuesday it would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to the North's reported troop dispatch. South Korea has shipped humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, but it has so far avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest standing armies in the world, but it hasn’t fought in large-scale conflicts since the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia, citing a shortage of battle experience. They say North Korea wants to get Russian economic support and its help to modernize the North's outdated conventional weapons systems as well as its high-tech weapons technology transfers. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-lawmakers-south-koreas-spy-chief-says-north-korea-has-sent-another-1500-troops-to-russia/	2024-10-23T04:29:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6718dd722982b4.76850832.jpeg?w=900
Driving the vote: Ohio voters swapping parties	(NewsNation) — Ohio is the epicenter of a seismic shift happening in American politics where the two parties are essentially trading core constituencies when it comes to white voters. In the state and across America, blue-collar workers are turning red and white-collar college grads are shifting to blue. Conventional wisdom had long shown that Ohio's manufacturing base and blue-collar neighborhoods were the bedrock of the Democratic party, while college graduates with high-paying jobs generally voted for Republican platforms, like lower taxes and deregulating business. Driving the vote: New Jersey GOP tries to flip state to red But voters' attitudes are proving otherwise. 'The city workers, union workers… he (Donald Trump) looks out for us... and he does care,' John Wesolowski, an Ohio Republican said. Trump's 'America first' policies have scored big in parts of the state, fueling a populism that has upended politics. Joshua Zingher, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, calls this shift a 'diploma divide.' He said it’s a realignment based on how many years a person spends in college exposed to more liberal views on issues like abortion, gender identity, and immigration. 'How much education that you have, formal education shapes how you vote now more than ever before,' he said. 'Generally, we see people with higher levels of education have more liberal attitudes on these culture war issues.' Steve Sozia, a retired Ohio lawyer, volunteers to give free legal services at the southern border saying that many of the migrants crossing over 'are actually fleeing the type of people that Trump accuses them of being.' While there are more college grads in the U.S. than ever before, they often settle in urban areas to be near jobs. This means states with smaller cities and fewer college grads, like Ohio and Iowa, have turned more red. States like North Carolina and Arizona, which are luring more college graduates into their workforce, are also shifting. Driving the Vote: Will Black voters swing Pennsylvania for Trump? This shift presents a problem for Democrats, Zingher said. 'Adding more votes in places like Boston or the Bay Area doesn't get you any more votes in the Electoral College.' It also has serious implications for control of the Senate, which currently hangs in the balance. In Ohio, incumbent Sherrod Brown is the last statewide elected Democrat and he’s locked in a fierce battle to keep his job. If he isn’t able to hold on, the Senate will likely turn red. Brown 'has voted with Biden numerous times,' Wesolowski said.

(NewsNation) — The cryptocurrency industry is making use of its millions this election season, pouring more than Big Oil or Big Pharma into candidates in both major political parties. The crypto industry’s main PAC — Fairshake — has endorsed an equal number of candidates on each side, Axios reports. NewsNation political contributor Mick Mulvaney, who served as acting White House chief of staff during a portion of Trump's White House tenure, said the tech industry's impact on the election will be 'fascinating.' 'Crypto doesn't fit neatly into the old Republican, Democrat sort of silos. It crosses the aisle,' Mulvaney said on 'The Hill on NewsNation.' Judge tosses RNC challenge to Michigan voter roll maintenance But the majority of its ad dollars are headed to Republican candidates, with the GOP raking in tens of millions from the industry. Since the start of the year, Fairshake and its affiliated PACs have spent $54.6 million on Republican candidates and $33.7 million on Democrats, AdImpact found. That’s roughly 62% more spent on Republicans in 2024 so far. Former President Donald Trump has established himself as a pro-crypto candidate. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., spearheaded their own cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, in September. Social Security funds under Trump could run out in 6 years: Analysis Earlier this week, Vice President Kamala Harris gave the first glimpse into her crypto stance, sharing that she hopes to create regulations around the currency and other digital assets to ensure that those who participate in that market are protected. Mulvaney pointed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as one of the 'biggest names against crypto in Washington, D.C.' 'I'm interested when we start to realign the interest in the country, watching crypto,' Mulvaney said. 'Watch crypto this election cycle, the next couple, will be fascinating to see.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/cryptocurrency-donation-politics-election/	2024-10-22T16:21:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/6abe3e274901489fb431cbf995586caa-2.jpg?w=900
IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall?	(NEXSTAR) — It's official: 2025 will mark another year in which millions of Americans could take home more on each paycheck thanks in part to the latest inflation adjustments to the tax code announced by the IRS on Tuesday. More than 60 tax provisions are changing, all of which will impact tax year 2025. That means they won't apply until you're filing taxes in 2026. Taxpayers will get higher standard deductions in 2025, IRS announces One of the most notable changes the IRS has announced are standard deductions rising and individual tax brackets shifting. Standard deductions rise Starting in tax year 2025, single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately will see their standard deduction rise to $15,000, up $400 from the current rate of $14,600. If you're married and filing jointly, your standard deduction will rise by $800 to $30,000, while heads of households will see an increase of $600 for a standard deduction of $22,500. 1 in 5 Americans have maxed out their credit card: Survey Remember, a standard deduction reduces how much of your income on which you are taxed. Tax brackets for tax year 2025 As it did last year, the IRS is also adjusting the tax brackets. These determine the portion of your income that is taxable after the standard deduction or itemized deductions are subtracted. Below is a table that breaks down each of those marginal tax brackets: If your taxable income is greater than:Taxes owed$626,350 ($751,600 for married couples filing jointly)37%$250,525 ($501,050 for married couples filing jointly)35%$197,300 ($394,600 for married couples filing jointly)32%$103,350 ($206,700 for married couples filing jointly)24%$48,475 ($96,950 for married couples filing jointly)22%$11,925 ($23,850 for married couples filing jointly)12%$11,925 or less ($23,850 or less for married couples filing jointly)10%(IRS) These income thresholds have all increased slightly over last year. The lowest level, for example, increased by $325, while the second-highest rose by $1,325. What is not changing is the top tax rate. The IRS says that will remain at 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes above $626,350 and for married couples filing jointly with incomes above $751,600. What else is changing? There are a handful of other notable changes that could impact a large swath of taxpayers. For example, in tax year 2025, the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit amount will increase from $7,830 to $8,046 for qualifying taxpayers with three or more qualifying children. Are you still in the middle class? Use this calculator to find out The alternative minimum tax exemption amount will increase to $88,100 for individual filers, up $2,400 over the previous year. For married individuals filing separately, the exemption amount will increase to $68,650. For both groups, the exemption phases out at $626,350. For married couples filing together, the exemption amount will rise to $137,000, phasing out at $1,252,700. You can find more details about changes to qualified transportation fringe benefits, medical savings accounts, foreign earned income exclusions, adoption credits, and more updates on the IRS's website. What isn't changing in tax year 2025? While updates abound for our next tax year, there are some areas of the tax code that will not be updated. That includes the personal exemptions, which will remain at 0, just as it is for the current tax year. There will continue to be no limitation on itemized deductions, and the adjusted gross income amount taxpayers use to determine the reduction in the Lifetime Learning Credit is not being adjusted. Inflation would be higher under Trump: Economists Marginal tax brackets, standard deductions, and other changes you can expect to see for tax year 2024 can be found here. The next two Tax Days will not be interrupted by weird calendar years as they both fall on April 15 — a Tuesday in 2025 and a Wednesday in 2026.

Breaking down the numbers in race for Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Pennsylvania is one of several battleground states that could be crucial to the presidential election. According to the latest Decision Desk HQ polling averages, former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 0.2% in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is worth 19 electoral votes and is pivotal to the successes of Republicans or Democrats. There are 6.3 million registered voters in the state of Pennsylvania, with the top two counties being Allegheny County, which is home to Pittsburgh, and then Philadelphia County, home to Philadelphia. What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called? Racial demographics may make a difference in Pennsylvania. Nearly 40% of the registered voters in Philadelphia are Black, more than any other racial category. Philadelphia County is the only county in Philadelphia that has more registered Black voters than any other racial demographic. The Democrats won Philadelphia County in 2016 and 2020 by a large margin. Hillary Clinton secured 82.5% of the vote to Trump's 15.4%. Fast forward to 2020: President Joe Biden secured 81.4% of the vote to Trump's 17.9%. Democrats are concerned about their support dwindling. If that were to be the case, it could spell trouble for the chances of a Harris presidency. The vice president announced she has yet another campaign stop in Philadelphia this Sunday. Such is the importance of Pennsylvania in the race to the White House.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/breaking-down-the-numbers-pennsylvania/	2024-10-22T13:52:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/harriskamala_trumpdonald_092724gn04_w.jpg?w=900
Trump makes pitch for president to Latino voters at roundtable	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is making his last pitch for the White House in the last couple weeks of the 2024 election. At a roundtable event for Latino voters in Florida, Trump talked about his economic impact on the Hispanic community when he was in office. 'This love affair has been going on pretty much from the beginning now,' Trump said. '(In) 2016 it was a little early, but then I started producing for them and they produced for the country, because the level of genius, entrepreneurship, energy that they have — it's an incredible community. And I liked them, and they liked me, and now they're seeing numbers that are shocking.' In South Florida, there's a large Cuban community that largely backs the former president. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris losing ground with Latino voters as well — 38% say they plan to cast their ballot for her compared to 49% leaning toward Trump. Hispanics are a group of voters that could account for close to 15% of the vote, meaning they could sway the outcome in battleground states. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'I just saw a poll that we're actually leading with Hispanics. That's never happened before,' Trump said. 'I mean, (Harris) is sleeping right now. She couldn't go on the trail. You know, you think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn't be sleeping. She's not doing anything today.' NBC News pointed out that it's not true that the vice president isn't doing anything — while Harris did not have any campaign events scheduled for Tuesday, she had interviews planned with their anchor, Hallie Jackson, and Telemundo’s Julio Vaqueiro. NewsNation partner The Hill writes that Trump has been talking to Spanish-language outlets as well. Just under a week ago, he participated in a town hall with Univision. Trump, in the town hall, detailed his plans to crack down on immigration, the border and the economy. Could Nikki Haley join Trump on campaign trail? With the election winding down, it's still possible for new people to join Trump on the campaign trail, including an ex-rival. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary, is reportedly in talks with the Trump campaign to join him at an event at some point. Sources told NewsNation that Haley's team had provided a couple of dates to the Trump camp that could work for such an appearance. Who will never receive Social Security? Once United Nations ambassador under the Trump administration, Haley endorsed him after ending her own campaign despite being previously critical of him. Asked about this on 'Fox &amp; Friends' Friday, Trump just said, 'I'll do what I have to do.' 'They keep talking about Nikki, Nikki. I like Nikki. Nikki, I don’t think, should have done what she did, and that’s fine that she did it,' Trump said, referring to her running against him, according to NewsNation partner The Hill. 'But even in her own state — in South Carolina, where she was the governor — I beat her by a number.' Trump, The Hill noted, repeatedly disparaged Haley, calling her a 'bird brain' in the primary.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-latino-voters-roundtable/	2024-10-22T13:43:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179460855-1.jpg?w=900
What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called?	(NewsNation) — In 2020, the presidential election wasn't called for four days due to the time it took to count ballots in states across the country. Four years later, several states could determine when the country will know whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris has won the 2024 election. Trump and Harris remain engaged in a too-close-to-call battle with two weeks remaining before Election Day. With the two candidates polling neck and neck in all seven swing states, election forecasters can envision several scenarios where the race could be determined in either hours or days, with possible legal challenges to follow. Blue wall blitz: Harris courts undecided voters with Republican help Pennsylvania secured the White House for President Joe Biden in 2020 on the Saturday after Election Day. NewsNation's partner Decision Desk HQ was the first organization to call the election for Biden just before 9 a.m. ET that day. The Keystone State has changed how it counts votes following delays in the 2020 election, but this year, Pennsylvania and other states like Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona could determine when we know who will become the next president. 'There are quicker paths, and then, there are dayslong paths,' said Drew McCoy, the president of NewsNation partner Decision Desk HQ. Georgia again key to election results Trump is targeting Georgia this cycle after Biden flipped the state blue for the first time in 28 years by a margin of 11,179 votes. Election officials recounted the votes twice in 2020, each time reaffirming the original count in favor of Biden. 'We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,' Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said after the third recount. Trump allegedly called Raffensberger and asked him to find enough votes to reverse the results in his favor. The former president is currently charged in state court for trying to subvert the state's 2020 election. This year, Georgia has already collected a record number of early ballots as both Harris and Trump continue to campaign around the state. Despite the spotlight on Georgia, McCoy believes that the state could be among the first called on election night. McCoy said Trump's easiest path to the presidency is flipping Georgia and Pennsylvania. If Harris can keep Georgia blue and win North Carolina, that dramatically changes the map, he said. North Carolina early voting records Trump won North Carolina by 1.3% in 2020, and four years later, and McCoy believes Trump needs to carry it again to win in November. A Democrat hasn't won the state since former President Barack Obama in 2008, but polls have shown that Harris is within the margin of error with two weeks remaining before the election. Like Georgia, North Carolina has experienced record levels of early voting despite residents trying to recover from widespread damage caused by the deadly Hurricane Helene. By McCoy's estimation, Georgia and North Carolina could be called sometime between 10 p.m. and midnight on election night, which could set the stage for what happens in the rest of the country. Will Pennsylvania's count be delayed again? Pennsylvania state law does not permit mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day, which led directly to the four days needed to determine a winner in 2020. It became the epicenter of Trump's 'Stop The Steal' campaign in which he alleged mail-in ballots that arrived after Election Day should not be counted. The campaign mounted a series of legal challenges claiming that Republican observers were kept too far from the voting tabulation process in cities like Philadelphia, The Associated Press reported. A record number (375,000) of mail-in ballots were received in the state in 2020, with the majority of those coming from Democratic voters, according to CBS News. Republican Secretary of Commonwealth Al Schmidt told CBS News that due to state laws, he believes the vote-counting process could still take time to ensure an accurate result. But since 2020, Pennsylvania has improved its vote-counting process as new machinery has been introduced that processes ballots more quickly, Schmidt said. 'Our counties are working night and day to count their voters' votes,' Schmidt told CBS News. 'They're doing so as quickly as they can and with integrity.' McCoy believes that while vote counting in Pennsylvania's 67 counties will require careful attention, he expects results to trickle in during the overnight hours and into Wednesday morning. But he said the disparity between the state's Republican and Democratic areas could create some drama along the way. July Trump shooting attempt ‘should not have happened’: Task force 'It’s not unexpected that there might be some changes in the lead over the course of the night,' McCoy told NewsNation. Mail-in voting in Arizona Arizona, where roughly 90% of ballots were mailed in during the 2020 election, historically takes longer to call due to the time it takes to determine which ballots can be counted based on the postmark. Biden won Arizona by just 0.3% in 2020. Maricopa County, where much of the Phoenix metro area is located, is expected to garner the crux of the election attention four years after Biden won the county by 45,109 votes. In 2020, after Trump claimed the election was stolen, Arizona Republicans commissioned a hand recount of Maricopa County's 2.1 million ballots, which affirmed Biden had defeated Trump. Thousands of migrants heading for southern border Election experts expect another close race in Arizona, keeping interest in the state high. Delays could push the race into a critical position if the state is needed to secure victory for either candidate. Other factors on Election Day Voter turnout could also help determine the timeframe for a winner, according to NewsNation political editor and 'The Hill Sunday' host Chris Stirewalt. Turnout numbers for the upcoming election should be known by 9 p.m. ET on election night, which could provide clues about which candidates could benefit most and when a winner will be determined. Stirewalt also believes that the scrutiny around election officials in 2020 could spill over to this election, which might slow things down. He also expects legal challenges to be mounted again, which would also lead to delays. With so many factors in play, establishing any sense of certainty proves to be difficult. 'If we’re going to be very honest, then we have to say we don’t really know,' Stirewalt told NewsNation. 'We have to be prepared for a really quick night or a long week, but we certainly can’t rule either of those out.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/states-delay-2024-election-call/	2024-10-22T13:01:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
NC family determined to rebuild after losing 11 members to Helene	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene brought devastation to the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina, devastating one family who lost 11 loved ones to the storm. Jesse and Mekenzie Craig live in Fairview, North Carolina, a town about 12 miles southeast of Asheville. One area of the town was known as 'Craigtown' for the family that was so entrenched in the community. 'We're just taking it day by day,' Jesse Craig told NewsNation. 'We have a great family and a great support system.' What to know about poll watchers Eleven members of the family, including Jesse Craig's parents, were killed after a mudslide swept through the area, destroying entire houses. Craig said he and his wife were waiting out the storm in their basement and he spoke to his father the morning Helene hit. When the couple emerged they found downed trees across the room and one of their vehicles totaled. But there was no cell phone service to check on loved ones. His brother eventually got a call through and broke the news. 'He said Mom and Dad are gone,' Craig recalled. 'Instantly, your brain goes into shock, your body goes into shock.' Legality of Musk’s $1M offer ‘questionable’: Fmr. Pennsylvania AG After getting the call, service cut out again and the Craigs were unable to get ahold of anyone for days. In addition to Jesse Craig's parents, he lost his aunt, uncle, great-uncle, great-aunt and multiple cousins. The Craig family had been in the town since the mid-1900s, with multiple generations staying in the same area. Now, the Craigs are determined to rebuild so the family doesn't lose eight decades of history.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/nc-family-lose-11-helene/	2024-10-22T11:21:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/CraigFamily.jpg?w=900
Ex-Abercrombie & Fitch CEO arrested on sex trafficking charges	This story contains discussions of rape or sexual assault that may be disturbing. If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, The National Sexual Assault Hotline can be reached at 1-800-656-4673 to provide support and resources. (NewsNation) — The former CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has been arrested on sex trafficking charges brought by federal prosecutors in New York. Former CEO Mike Jeffries was arrested in Florida and is being charged along with his partner Matthew Smith and associate James Jacobson. United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace detailed the allegations in the indictment against the men, which includes 15 victims known as 'John Doe.' Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs accused of raping 13-year-old: Lawsuit He described the system as a 'casting couch' model where men hoping to get featured in an Abercrombie ad to kickstart their careers were then trafficked. 'To anyone who thinks they can coerce others using a casting call system, prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison,' Pearce said. Jeffries and Smith are accused of hiring Jacobson to act as a recruiter to select young men hoping to build a career in modeling who would then be coerced or forced to engage in sex acts at events run by Jeffries and Smith. Prosecutors say Jeffries and Smith intentionally targeted heterosexual men who expressed they would be unwilling to engage in certain sex acts, including anal sex, who were then forced to take part in such activity. Jacobson allegedly engaged in tryouts where he paid men to engage in sex acts, and Smith allegedly selected which men would be flown to his and Jeffries' homes or to hotels around the world. According to the indictment, the itineraries provided to victims resembled that which would be used for a typical photoshoot or modeling job, obscuring the nature of the sex events they would then be taken to. Men were physically groomed and forced to give up personal items like phones and wallets during the event and to sign nondisclosure agreements, the indictment says. Woman poisoned boyfriend for his nonexistent $30M inheritance Prosecutors say the men were not informed about the details of the sex acts they would be expected to perform and were given substances including alcohol, Viagra and poppers to perform and were sometimes injected with erection-inducing medication if they were unwilling or unable to act as directed. Staff kept the men from leaving events, prosecutors say, and Smith and Jeffries allegedly violated men who were unwilling to participate by force. While there are 15 victims in the charging documents, authorities said the investigation is ongoing, and they believe there are dozens of victims during a time spanning from 2008 to 2015. Anyone with information or who was a victim is encouraged to contact the FBI. Last year, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was sued over allegations that Jeffries was operating a sex trafficking ring exploiting young men who hoped to become models for the company and that Abercrombie allegedly turned a blind eye to the abuse.

Norfolk Southern tops third-quarter expectations with insurance b...	Norfolk Southern's streamlined operations delivered strong earnings last quarter, even excluding boosts from insurance payouts related to the disastrous derailment in East Palestine and the sale of two rail lines. The Atlanta company recorded a $287 million gain on the sale of rail lines in Virginia and North Carolina, and for the second quarter in a row it collected more insurance payments than it paid out for last year's derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Norfolk Southern earned $1.1 billion, or $4.85 per share in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago, when profits were hurt by mounting costs related to the derailment. Excluding one-time items, the railroad earned $737 million, or $3.25 per share, beating the $3.15 forecast by analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. Thousands of migrants heading for southern border Before the opening bell Tuesday, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp. rose 3%. New CEO Mark George, who took over last month, isn't expected to implement any strategic changes because he helped craft the plan a couple years ago that calls for keeping more employees on hand during a downturn, so the railroad can respond better when the economy recovers. 'It’s really about building out consistent, safe, reliable service with a network that’s resilient and can bounce back from events,' like it did when Norfolk Southern got all its major lines running again within 72 hours after Hurricane Helene hit, said George, who was promoted from Chief Financial Officer after Alan Shaw was fired for an inappropriate relationship with an employee. Norfolk Southern has been in the spotlight ever since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine triggered a national focus on railroad safety. Earlier this year, the railroad also had to fend off a takeover bid from investment firm Ancora Holdings. The investor ultimately won only three seats, insufficient to make the sweeping changes it sought. The railroad redoubled its efforts to lower costs in the spring, hiring Chief Operating Officer John Orr to help reduce the number of times railcars get switched and enable Norfolk Southern to operate fewer, longer trains. It’s operating expenses, when adjusted to remove costs related to the Ohio derailment and other one-time items, fell 6% to $1.93 billion. Norfolk Southern is working to improve its profit margin enough to catch up with the other major freight railroads. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

And I don’t have a whole lot of patience for lack of execution or acceptance of mediocrity,' George said. The railroad’s revenue of $3.05 billion was just below analyst expectation for $3.09 billion.

What is pink cocaine? Autopsy finds drug in Liam Payne's body	SALT LAKE CITY (KTVX/KUCW) — A partial autopsy conducted on former One Direction singer Liam Payne found multiple substances in his system when he fell to his death from the third-floor balcony of a hotel room in Argentina last week, according to a new report from ABC News. Among them were cocaine, benzodiazepine, crack and a fourth drug known as 'pink cocaine.' Fans gather for Liam Payne memorial at Centennial Park in Nashville What is pink cocaine? Despite its name, pink cocaine does not actually have any cocaine in it. The National Capital Poison Center describes the drug as a powdered cocktail of drugs, typically including ecstasy, ketamine, caffeine and a psychedelic drug known as 2-CB. The drug can also be referred to as Tusi -- a phonetic translation of '2C' -- and often comes in the form of a vibrant pink powder. The color reportedly comes from the addition of colored dye and sometimes from strawberry flavoring. The National Capital Poison Center said pink cocaine is not as addictive as other drugs such as opioids or fentanyl but can have some potential for addiction. Poison Control said pink cocaine is often used in a party or club setting and can cause a variety of effects including hallucinations, anxiety, elevated body temperature, increased heart rate and nausea, among other side effects. 'Physical and sexual assaults, as well as traumatic injuries, have occurred when people are impaired by this type of drug,' the NCPC warns. 'It is also important to know that pink cocaine may be contaminated with drugs beyond those mentioned here, so unanticipated effects can occur depending on what is in the mixture.' Liam Payne's death Moments before Liam Payne's death, hotel staff called the police in Buenos Aires reporting an 'aggressive man' who was believed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The hotel manager could be heard on a 911 call obtained by the Associated Press saying there was a guest 'destroying the entire room.' Liam Payne’s 1D bandmates, Cheryl, Simon Cowell and more mourn singer Responding officers arrived just as Payne had 'thrown himself' from the balcony of his room, according to a spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality. Authorities said Payne suffered 'very serious injuries' in the fall and there was no possibility of resuscitation. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Liam Payne’s hotel called for ‘urgent’ assistance before his death A preliminary autopsy report had concluded Payne died of 'multiple traumas' as well as 'internal and external bleeding' caused by the fall. Buenos Aires police reported finding Payne's hotel room in 'complete disarray' with several drugs scattered about. Sources told ABC News that police also found an improvised aluminum pipe to ingest drugs.

Thousands of migrants heading for southern border	(NewsNation) — A large caravan of migrants is heading from southern Mexico toward the United States' southern border. These thousands of people are part of a group called 'God Guides Us,' with members from multiple nationalities, including Venezuelan, Colombian, Haitian, Afghani and Nepalese migrants who desire to enter the United States. The hope for many is to cross the border before former President Donald Trump could be elected back to the White House, where he has promised mass deportation of those who have entered the country illegally. Trump overtakes Harris for first time in Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast Caravans such as 'God Guides Us' rarely make it to the southern border as a group. Some splinter off in and around Mexico City. In some cases, they can end up with the cartel and then come into the United States in smaller groups. GOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, provided an exclusive statement to NewsNation on this latest wave of migrants attempting to enter the U.S. 'Would-be border crossers know that their best chance to be released into American communities is under the open border policies of Joe Biden and his border czar Vice President (Kamala) Harris,' Green said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/thousands-migrants-southern-border/	2024-10-21T12:29:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/immigration-data_bernal_AssociatedPress_f9b684.jpg?w=900
Stock gains will be lower over the next decade: Goldman Sachs	(NewsNation) — The stock market has been booming over the past decade but returns could be much lower in the years ahead, according to a new forecast. The S&amp;P 500 — the broad market index — is expected to produce an annualized nominal return of just 3% over the next decade, Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team said in an analysis reviewed by CNBC. If that happens, it would be a significant decrease from the 13% annual return the last decade, which was higher than the long-term average of 11%. With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings? 'Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are toward the lower end of their typical performance distribution,' the team wrote in a note dated Oct. 18, per Bloomberg. One of the main reasons for the lower forecast? High market concentration. The so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks — companies like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia — have driven much of the recent returns and it's 'extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time,' the strategy paper noted. Is the stock market in an AI bubble? In other words, if a few stocks dip it could drag down the overall stock market. The Magnificent Seven generated nearly 60% of the S&amp;P 500 Index’s return year to date through June, according to a report from investment firm Boston Partners. In 2023, that figure was 62%. In fact, the recent rise in stock market concentration has been the steepest in 60 years and is now at a multi-decade high, J.P. Morgan wrote in a report earlier this year. U.S. equities have surged over the past decade and the S&amp;P 500 is on track to outperform the rest of the world in eight of the last 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&amp;P 500 has notched 47 record highs so far in 2024 and could go higher after the election as has historically been the case, Bloomberg said. JPMorgan Chase, the world's biggest bank, has also warned investors to brace for lower returns over the next decade. The analyst team there is slightly more optimistic, forecasting a 5.7% average annual return for the S&amp;P 500 over the next ten years in a report last month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/stock-lower-next-decade-goldman-sachs/	2024-10-21T10:49:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66fdb96ae67819.73820626.jpeg?w=900
Blue wall blitz: Harris courts undecided voters with Republican h...	MALVERN, Pa. (NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is barnstorming three must-win states on Monday, trying to court undecided voters, especially suburban women. And she’s bringing along what her campaign hopes is her secret weapon: former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. With the campaign heading into its final two weeks, Harris is trying to woo disaffected Republicans, specifically those who voted against former President Donald Trump and for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Harris and Cheney will blitz through suburban counties Haley won prior to dropping out of the Republican presidential primary contest: Chester County, Pennsylvania; Oakland County, Michigan; and Waukesha County, Wisconsin. You can watch the event in Oakland County, Michigan live here at 4:10p/3:10C. GOP-leaning polls trigger questions about accuracy Harris hopes to capitalize on what her team says are Trump’s 'unprecedented weakness' among women and white, college-educated voters. In Chester County, for instance, more than 9,000 people voted for Haley in the Republican primary after she had dropped out of the race. Cheney, who has been campaigning with Harris under the slogan 'country over party,' will be joined by longtime Republican strategist Sarah Longwell and conservative radio host Charlie Sykes. Despite the Harris campaign's efforts, Trump and Haley officials are discussing the two appearing together in the final stretch of the election, a source familiar with the matter confirms to NewsNation. During a 'Fox and Friends' interview Friday, Trump noted that although he soundly defeated Haley, he would still tap the former United Nations ambassador during his administration to help him win. Participate in NewsNation’s town hall with JD Vance 'I’ll do what I have to do,' Trump said. Haley offered her 'strong endorsement' of Trump in July in her Republican National Convention speech. Last month, Haley told listeners of her SiriusXM show that while she does not always agree with Trump, she still supports him because she thinks he will 'make the country better.' 'I have not forgotten what he said about me. I’ve not forgotten what he said about my husband or his, you know, deployment time or his military service,' Haley said. 'I haven’t forgotten about his or his campaign’s tactics from, you know, putting a birdcage outside our hotel room to calling me ‘bird brain.' 'But politics is not for thin-skinned people. It’s just not. And I think that if you really want to do a service for your country, you have to be able to put the personal part of it aside,' Haley added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-cheney-campaign-blue-wall-states/	2024-10-21T10:18:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179103377.jpg?w=900

Jury selection set to begin in NYC subway chokehold death trial	(NewsNation) — A former marine charged in the 2023 chokehold, subway death of a homeless man is set to stand trial with jury selection set to begin in Manhattan on Monday. Daniel Penny, now 25, is accused of 'recklessly causing the death' of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old former street performer who witnesses say was acting erratically on the train on May 1, 2023, when Penny moved to restrain him. Penny, who served four years in the Marines before being discharged in 2021, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He has been free on a $100,000 bond but faces up to 19 years in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to last between four to six weeks. Asheville woman's home burglarized after Helene Protesters took to the streets to demand that authorities arrest Penny — who is white; Neely was Black — while others rallied in support outside the courthouse once he was charged. The case also became a cause celebre among Republican presidential hopefuls. Jordan Neely's death Witnesses to the incident said Neely — who had struggled with drug addiction, mental illness and homelessness — had been shouting and demanding money when Penny approached him. Penny pinned Neely to the ground with the help of two other passengers and placed him in a chokehold for more than three minutes until Neely’s body went limp. The medical examiner’s office ruled the death a homicide caused by compression of the neck. Daniel Penny's case arguments Penny’s lawyers have argued that the Long Island native didn’t intend to kill Neely, just to hold him down long enough for police to arrive. Penny has claimed Neely shouted, 'I’m gonna’ kill you' and that he was 'ready to die' or go to jail for life. The defense said it plans to offer up other potential causes for Neely’s death, including high levels of the synthetic cannabinoid known as K2 found in his body. Oregon man guilty of kidnapping after woman escapes makeshift cell They’ll also argue that the video shared widely on social media proves Penny was not applying pressure consistently enough to render Neely unconscious, much less kill him. Prosecutors, in their court filings, have argued Penny’s actions were reckless and negligent even if he didn’t intend to kill Neely. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office declined to comment ahead of the trial. Neely’s surviving family members say they’ve been anticipating this moment and intend to attend the trial.

July Trump shooting attempt ‘should not have happened’: Task forc...	(NewsNation) — The July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump 'clearly shows a lack of planning and coordination between the United States Secret Service (USSS) and its law enforcement partners before the rally,' according to the preliminary investigation conducted by a Congressional task force. 'Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,' the report’s executive summary concludes. The strong words are contained in a 53-page document labeled 'Interim staff report: Investigating the stunning security failures on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania.' How has Donald Trump’s Secret Service security detail changed? The report immediately condemns the 'lack of planning and coordination between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners before the rally.' It cites the failure of clear guidance from the Secret Service to the state and local agencies about managing the areas outside the secure event perimeter. For example, 'there was no joint meeting on the day of the rally between USSS and all state and local law enforcement agencies assisting USSS.' It also blasts USSS for deciding to put the American Glass Research building, from which Thomas Matthew Crooks fired on Trump, outside the secure perimeter. Another major failure, according to the report, was the failure to engage Crooks at several 'pivotal moments' that day. HSI agents at Trump rally ‘ill-prepared’ for assassination attempt 'Throughout the afternoon, as Crooks’s behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement and, eventually, climb on to the roof of the AGR complex and fire eight shots at the rally stage and crowd, killing a rally attendee and injuring three others, including former President Trump,' the report states. The task force staff writes that it will continue to 'rigorously' investigate the July assassination attempt. It will also look at the September 15 incident in West Palm Beach, Florida in which an armed man was arrested near the Trump International Golf Course. The Congressional panel’s interim comes eight days after an independent review panel also detailed the failures in Butler and listed several 'remediations' for USSS. Among them: a 're-focus on the Secret Service’s protective mission.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-shooting-attempt-task-force/	2024-10-21T02:42:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24196223710960-e1727351283559.jpg?w=900
Stunning security failures' led to Trump assassination attempt, ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in July was 'preventable and should not have happened,' according to a bipartisan House panel that is investigating the shooting and what it calls the 'stunning security failures' at the event. The report from a House task force, released Monday, is just the latest look at the cascading and wide-ranging law enforcement failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally where Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire. One rallygoer was killed in the shooting and two others were wounded. Members of both the House and Senate have repeatedly questioned why the Secret Service, an agency tasked with protecting the country’s top leaders, didn’t do a better job communicating with local authorities during the campaign rally, particularly when it came to securing the building that was widely agreed to be a security threat but that ultimately was left so unprotected that gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to climb up and shoot. Lawmakers in their report focus on 'the fragmented lines of communication and unclear chains of command' between Secret Service and Pennsylvania state and local police but place the majority of the blame on the Secret Service for the security breakdown. 'Federal, state, and local law enforcement officers could have engaged Thomas Matthew Crooks at several pivotal moments,' the report stated. Lawmakers added that throughout the afternoon, 'as Crooks’s behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement' and climb onto the unsecured roof where he would eventually open fire. 'Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,' the report continued. The preliminary findings are drawn from thousands of pages of documents, nearly two dozen transcribed interviews with state and local officials as well as a series of both classified and non-classified briefings from senior officials at the Secret Service and the FBI. The report breaks little new ground, as the failed Secret Service response has been already documented by an independent commission, an interim Senate report as well as congressional testimony and news media investigations. The House report, like others before it, does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame. But The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. The director of the Secret Service at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned shortly after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse. The task force — comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats — showcased some of the report's findings during a public hearing last month. Lawmakers say they plan to issue a final report, including recommendations to avoid future assassination attempts against political candidates, by mid-December. The task force has also begun investigating the second assassination attempt on Trump last month where a man with a rifle camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-stunning-security-failures-led-to-assassination-attempt-at-trump-rally-house-report-finds/	2024-10-21T02:04:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671619b325b827.97366582.jpeg?w=900
Dodgers finish off Mets with 10-5 win in NLCS and advance to face...	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani carried the injury-riddled Los Angeles Dodgers to baseball's best record during the regular season. Tommy Edman joined the team in late July and helped them reach the World Series. It's been that kind of year for the big-spending Dodgers. When Ohtani isn't amazing with his power at the plate and prowess on the basepaths, someone else is stepping up. Edman and Will Smith homered to send Ohtani into the World Series for the first time, and the Dodgers eliminated the New York Mets with a 10-5 victory in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday night. Los Angeles opens the World Series against the New York Yankees on Friday. 'I really feel like we finally arrived, I finally arrived at this stage,' Ohtani said through a translator. 'A lot of the games we played were really tough and hard to win, and it was truly a team effort to get here.' The Dodgers clinched their record 25th NL pennant, their fourth in eight years and first won at home since beating the Mets over seven games in 1988. They moved on to their 22nd World Series — 13th in Los Angeles — and first since 2020, when they beat Tampa Bay during the pandemic-delayed season. 'Every year I get to spring training and I wonder how we’re going to make a baseball team fit because we have so many talented players,' reliever Evan Phillips said. 'I wouldn’t say we planned for injuries but we planned to have multiple guys contribute throughout the year.' Next up for Ohtani and Co. is Aaron Judge and the Yankees, back in the World Series for the 41st time and first in 15 years. The matchup, which opens at Dodger Stadium, features the top two home-run hitters in Judge (58) and Ohtani (54). 'It’s kind of what the people wanted, what we all wanted,' Dodgers star Mookie Betts said. 'It’s going to be a battle of two good teams, a lot of long flights across the country.' It’ll be the 12th time the franchises meet in the World Series and the first in 43 years. The Yankees have beaten the Dodgers eight times, while the Dodgers’ three championships against the Bronx Bombers came in 1955, 1963 and 1981. 'It’s the place that I’ve dreamt of playing all my life,' Ohtani said, 'and to be able to finally come to this stage and be able to play and hopefully win it is my next goal.' Playing his first season with the Dodgers after agreeing to a record $700 million, 10-year contract as a free agent, Ohtani had two hits and scored two runs in Game 6. He hit .364 with two homers and six RBIs in the NLCS. 'The goal was to get to this far,' Ohtani said. 'And I also pictured myself getting this far with the contract that I’ve signed.' Ohtani spent his first six MLB seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, who never had a winning record or reached the playoffs during his tenure. 'We wouldn’t be here without him,' Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy said. 'We went through a lot of injuries and there was a good stretch during the regular season where he singlehandedly carried us.' The Dodgers, who were eliminated in the Division Series the previous two years, spent a combined $1 billion last winter to sign Ohtani and pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto to lucrative long-term contracts in hopes of winning the franchise’s eighth World Series title. Rookie Ben Casparius got four outs for the win and Blake Treinen the save in his first two-inning outing since the 2021 NLCS. Los Angeles trailed after Pete Alonso's run-scoring single against starter Michael Kopech. Edman gave the Dodgers the lead for good with a two-run double in the bottom half off Sean Manaea that drove in Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, who both singled. Hernández snapped an 0-for-18 skid. Edman drove in the Dodgers' first four runs and his 11 RBIs in the NLCS tied a franchise record set by Corey Seager in 2020 against Atlanta. Edman, who won the NLCS MVP award, joined the Dodgers at the July trade deadline from St. Louis. 'I think the common theme for this season has been a lot of people, different guys have been stepping up over the course of the season,' Ohtani said. Edman sent a 406-foot shot to left-center for a two-run homer in a four-run third that included Smith’s 416-foot drive to center off Phil Maton that extended the lead to 6-1. 'I never imagined once we acquired him, he’d be hitting fourth in a postseason game,' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of Edman. 'But I trust him. The guys trust him. He’s made huge defensive plays for us and had huge hits.' Vientos hit his fifth postseason homer, a two-run drive in the fourth Ryan Brasier that cut the deficit to 6-3 in the fourth. The Dodgers, whose starting pitching has been decimated by injuries, used seven pitchers in finishing off the Mets, whose $332 million payroll was the biggest in baseball. New York twice stranded the bases loaded, when Anthony Banda struck out Jeff McNeil in the third and when Jesse Winker flied out against Phillips in the sixth. Los Angeles outscored New York 40-26 in the six games. The Mets came within two wins of reaching the World Series after overcoming a 22-33 start and earning the NL’s last wild card. 'This should be our expectations moving forward every year, we should be playing games deep into October,' first year-manager Carlos Mendoza said. Manaea lasted just two innings, giving up five runs and six hits. Alonso had two hits and drove in a run in what could have been his final game for the Mets. The first baseman is eligible for free agency after the World Series. 'I love this team. I love this organization. This fanbase has treated not just myself, but my family so, so well,' Alonso said. The sellout crowd of 52,674 included Tom Hanks, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Magic Johnson, Rob Lowe, Josh Groban, Jenny McCarthy and Vanessa Bryant.

4 dead in Houston radio tower helicopter crash: Police	HOUSTON (AP) — A helicopter reportedly crashed Sunday in Houston after hitting a radio tower, killing four people on board, including a child, fire officials said. Houston authorities said the aircraft, an R44 helicopter, went down just before 8 p.m. in Houston's Second Ward, east of the city's downtown, after apparently taking off from Ellington Field about 15 miles away. The identities of the victims and their ages have not yet been released. 'PIO is en route to a reported helicopter crash at Engelke &amp; Ennis,' the fire department said Sunday evening on X. 'The helicopter that crashed in Second Ward was not an HPD helicopter, it was a private touring helicopter,' Houston City Councilmember Mario Castillo said on X, although that could not be immediately confirmed. Local media outlets reported a large amount of emergency personnel responding to the scene. Police and fire officials have urged residents near the crash site to call 911 if they find anything on their property that could help in their investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/ap-helicopter-crashes-in-houstons-second-ward-after-hitting-radio-tower-killing-4-officials-say/	2024-10-20T21:52:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1801085827.jpg?w=724
Trump overtakes Harris for first time in Decision Desk HQ/The Hil...	Former President Trump on Sunday overtook Vice President Harris for the first time in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast this cycle. The model predicts Trump has a 52 percent chance of winning the presidency while Harris has a 42 percent chance, as of Sunday. Republicans head to court in expanding battle about overseas ballots Since late August, the election forecast put Harris’s chances of winning at approximately 54 to 56 percent, with Trump’s chances at approximately 44 to 46 percent. In early October, however, those dynamics began to shift, and the election forecast predicted both candidates’ chances to be closer to 50 percent. On Oct. 17, the model predicted the two candidates were equally likely to win next month, and Trump took the advantage on Oct. 20. The shift in election forecast coincides with the Republican candidate’s improved polling averages in Wisconsin and Michigan, two battleground states that previously leaned slightly toward Harris. Trump already had a slim advantage in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Of the seven swing states seen as decisive in determining the outcome of the 2024 election, Pennsylvania is alone in still favoring Harris in its polling average. Top 5 ways education would look different under Harris vs. Trump Nonetheless, the race remains a toss-up, according to the election forecast, since the polling in all seven states remains within the margin of error, meaning typical polling inaccuracies could shift the results in either direction. These states are expected to be decisive in determining which candidate reaches the crucial 270 electoral votes. Currently, neither Trump nor Harris has a clear lead in enough states to secure that number.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/decision-desk-hq-the-hill-election-forecast/	2024-10-20T16:39:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-campaigning-10.18.png?w=900
Raffensperger: Republican voting claims will 'really hurt' GOP tu...	Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) said Sunday that claims about vote integrity from Republicans will 'really hurt' turnout for his party. Raffensperger had already pushed back on a claim from fellow Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about a Northern Georgia 'voter’s printed ballot' being 'changed from their selections made on' a Dominion Voting Systems machine in the interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. Raffensperger denies voter fraud amid Georgia’s historic early-vote turnout Stirewalt noted that 'some people, including those in your own party, don't want … don't agree with that, and they're pushing these kinds of stories.' 'What do you say to them, who are pushing this kinda stuff out there, here in the eve of the election?' Stirewalt asked Raffensperger. 'Well, at the end of the day, if you start [spreading] … stories like that, all you’re gonna do is to … we’ll really hurt our turnout on our side,' Raffensperger said. 'And I'm a conservative Republican, so I don't know why they do that … self-defeating.' As the election has inched closer, former President Trump’s denial of the 2020 election results has made its way back into the headlines. Trump notably called Raffensperger following the election, asking him to find over 11,000 votes that would have overturned President Biden’s win in the Peach State. 'When you get high marks by the Heritage Foundation, you know, they're giving us a top ranking, that means that we're doing the right things,' Raffensperger said in the interview Sunday. Trump is currently leading Vice President Harris in the battle for the White House in Georgia, up by 1.6 percent according to an average of polls from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon urges ‘respect’ for election The Hill has reached out to Greene’s office and the Republican National Committee. 'The false claim that voting machines can switch votes has been repeatedly debunked,' a spokesperson for Dominion said in a statement emailed to The Hill Sunday, adding that 'as both state and local election authorities have confirmed' the incident Greene described 'was due to voter error.'

Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon urges 'respect' for election	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a Sunday interview urged 'respect' for 'our elections' as the 2024 election looms. 'We have to respect our elections, and I get it, candidates have the right to go to court and appeal, or to challenge versus … various processes,' Bacon told NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt in an interview on 'The Hill Sunday.' Elon Musk’s daily $1 million payouts at Trump rally draw legal scrutiny Bacon, alongside five other Republicans, signed onto a bipartisan letter released in September headed up by centrists vowing to respect the results of the November election. 'In America, we respect election results especially once the courts and appeals work through the process,' Bacon said in a statement at the time. 'We fight hard to win during campaigns and then respect the results when the votes are counted. Bacon said that there should be no 'reticence at all to say we’re gonna support the winner of the elections, period.' Former President Trump’s denial of the 2020 election results has returned to the headlines as Election Day has neared. In a debate against Vice President Harris last month, Trump expressed pushback toward the idea that he had accepted losing to President Biden four years ago. Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election 'No, I don’t acknowledge that at all,' Trump said. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also recently said that the former president didn’t face a loss against Biden in 2020 'by the words that I would use.' 'I think there were serious problems in 2020. So did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use,' Vance said at a campaign event in Pennsylvania.

Trump works the drive-thru at Pennsylvania McDonald’s	Former President Trump on Sunday stepped behind the counter at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, working the drive-thru for a short time after he spent weeks mocking Vice President Harris's past experience at the fast-food chain. Trump traded his suit jacket for an apron at a McDonald's location in Bucks County. He worked the fry cooker and handed an order to a customer at the drive-thru. Elon Musk’s daily $1 million payouts at Trump rally draw legal scrutiny The former president stopped at the fast-food chain ahead of a town hall in Lancaster, Pa., later Sunday. He is also expected to attend the Pittsburgh Steelers game against the New York Jets on Sunday night. Trump has been fixated for weeks on Harris's past experience working at McDonald's in college. The Harris campaign launched an ad in August highlighting the vice president’s upbringing in an effort to appeal to middle-class voters. The ad noted that Harris worked at McDonald’s while earning her college degree at Howard University. She had referenced the experience during past campaigns as well. Republicans, Democrats preparing for legal battles over election Trump and his allies have repeatedly suggested Harris did not actually work at McDonald's because it was not listed on her resume. 'I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala,' Trump quipped Sunday. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Trump's McDonald's visit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pennsylvania-mcdonalds/	2024-10-20T12:01:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24294650830394-e1729449052463.jpg?w=900
Driving the vote: New Jersey GOP tries to flip state to red	(NewsNation) — It's the place where the first rock and roll song was ever performed, where the dance 'The Twist' first originated, and it's where Republican former president Donald Trump held a rally in May, declaring he was going to win the state in the 2024 presidential election. The place is New Jersey, a state that hasn’t gone red since 1988, when the original 'Beetlejuice' was haunting theaters. Latest polls show Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris having a comfortable lead over Trump. Republicans here are hoping they can swing enough suburban voters who are fed up with high property taxes and what they call liberal social agendas so they can 'Make New Jersey Red Again.' Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'I'm hoping to turn the state red,' one of them, Kathleen Wioland, says.

'We have wine, we have high noons, we have beer,' Republican organizer Amanda Ackerman said. 'I try to make my volunteer nights kind of a party.' Across the country, both Democrats and Republicans are focused on winning the suburban vote, especially from women — a key voting block that propelled Biden to the White House in 2020 and could reshape Washington in 2024. Still, this can be a challenging task. 'I think it's increasingly difficult to, probably, put any constituency in a box,' Randy Adkins, a professor of political science at the University of Nebraska Omaha, said in an interview.

'I realized that I was limiting my range of thought and limiting the things I was willing to even criticize or discuss because I didn't want to offend anybody,' Ackerman said. Christina Balestriere, a suburban mom with three boys, says she was a registered Democrat but plans to vote Republican this year because she's upset over recent politics regarding gender identity in schools.

Trump to work behind McDonald's counter in Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump has a busy Sunday schedule ahead of him, 16 days until Election Day -- he's scheduled for a work shift at McDonald's. Trump will be hosting a rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, attending the Jets-Steelers NFL game in Pittsburgh, and is set to work behind the counter at a McDonald's in Lower Southampton Township, his campaign says. But for Rep. Scott Perry, R-PA, this will 'highlight he's for the working class,' he said on NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Pennsylvania is one of seven battleground states both presidential candidate needs to reach 270 Electoral College votes. The Keystone State gets 19 of those votes, making last-minute campaigning all the more urgent to get undecided voters, well, decided. 'President Trump is showing that he is very different from the party of the coastal elites and that he understands the average citizen that gets up every day, oftentimes in the dark, packs a lunch, and heads out to work just to pay their bills,' Scott said. The former president has questioned the summer job Harris said she held in college, working the cash register and making fries at McDonald’s while attending Howard University in Washington. Trump has claimed the vice president never worked there, repeating the claim Friday night at a campaign rally in Detroit, saying Harris 'lied about working at McDonald’s.' A Trump-endorsed candidate also running for reelection, Scott is not worried about Trump's rhetoric and language alienating groups of independent voters, including votes of Black males. Harris makes last-ditch appeal to disenchanted Republicans 'I think he speaks plain, you know, I think most people understand the point that he's trying to make and have probably made the same point themselves behind closed doors,' Scott said. 'He's reminding them about how bad it's been for the past essentially four years, which is also a reminder of how great it was four years prior to the Harris-Biden regime.' Though admitting he wouldn't use the language Trump uses. 'But then again, I'm not President Trump, and I don't draw tens of thousands of people to my rallies week after week, day after day, so I'm going to let President Trump be President Trump.' Election Day is Nov. 5, but early in-person voting is already underway.

Worst humanitarian crisis we've seen since WWII': Doctor on Gaza	(NewsNation) — The U.S., which provides weaponry funding to Israel, urges the country to boost humanitarian aid in Gaza as 87 people are dead or missing following overnight strikes Sunday.

Israeli strikes on northern Gaza leave at least 87 dead or missin...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on multiple homes in the northern Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday left at least 87 people dead or missing, the territory's Health Ministry said. It said another 40 people were wounded in the strikes on the town of Beit Lahiya, which was among the first targets of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago. The strikes came as the United States is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel’s plans to attack Iran, according to three U.S. officials. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents, attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and marked top secret, indicate that Israel was moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. The U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The U.S. is urging Israel to press for a cease-fire in Gaza following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week. But neither Israel nor Hamas has shown any renewed interest in such a deal, after months of negotiations sputtered to a halt in August. Iran supports Hamas and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, where a year of escalating tensions boiled over into all-out war last month. Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon at the start of October. There was no immediate comment on the strikes in Beit Lahiya from the Israeli military, which said it was 'continuing to operate across Gaza in both aerial strikes and ground operations.' Among the dead were two parents and their four children, and a woman, her son and her daughter-law and their four children, according to Raheem Kheder, a medic. He said the strike flattened a multi-story building and at least four neighboring houses. Mounir al-Bursh, director general of the Health Ministry, said the flood of wounded from the strikes compounded 'an already catastrophic situation for the health care system' in northern Gaza, in a post on X. Internet connectivity went down in northern Gaza late Saturday and had not yet been restored by midday Sunday, making it difficult to gather information about the strikes. Israel has been carrying out a major operation in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, also in northern Gaza, for the last two weeks. The military says it launched the operation against Hamas militants who had regrouped there. The north has already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year, following the deadly Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the opening weeks of the war and reiterated those instructions earlier this month. Most of the population fled last year, but around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north. Palestinians who fled the north at the start of the war have not been allowed to return. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

US investigating unauthorized release of classified documents on ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted online to Telegram and first reported by CNN and Axios. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said. The documents emerged as the U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a ceasefire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel's leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran's missile attack go unanswered. In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-us-investigating-unauthorized-release-of-classified-documents-on-israel-attack-plans/	2024-10-19T17:52:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67144be3531cd4.94854082.jpeg?w=900
Trump compares imprisoned Jan. 6 rioters to Japanese Americans du...	(The Hill) - Former President Trump on Friday alleged nobody had been treated worse than those imprisoned for storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, other than Japanese Americans who were put in internment camps during World War II. Trump appeared on 'The Dan Bongino Show,' where he questioned why those prosecuted for their actions on Jan. 6 were still being held after a Supreme Court ruling in June found an obstruction law used to charge scores of rioters was improperly applied. 'The other thing is as you know they really won in the Supreme Court. The Fischer case and the various cases,' Trump said. 'Why are they still being held? Nobody’s ever been treated like this. Maybe the Japanese during Second World War, frankly. But, you know, they were held, too.' Trump, who went on to attack the House committee that investigated the events of Jan. 6, called it 'a very sad day in the country’s life.' Democrats look to quash threat from Green Party’s Jill Stein Roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans were held in internment camps during World War II after then-President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order. The treatment of Japanese-Americans during that period has been widely condemned in the decades since, with President Biden calling it 'one of the most shameful periods in American history.' On Jan. 6, 2021, a pro-Trump mob violently clashed with law enforcement at the Capitol to try to halt the certification of President Biden’s 2020 victory. The riot followed weeks of claims from Trump that his defeat was fraudulent. The Justice Department charged roughly 1,500 defendants in connection to the attack on the Capitol that day. Roughly 550 have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees. The Justice Department said nearly 900 individuals have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges in relation to the events of Jan. 6. Trump, who himself was charged over his attempts to remain in power, has in recent days repeatedly downplayed the attack on the Capitol. At a Univision town hall event, he told one voter concerned about the events of Jan. 6 that it was a 'day of love.' The former president during a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power in 2020 because he eventually left office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/dc-riots/trump-compares-imprisoned-jan-6-rioters-to-japanese-americans-during-wwii/	2024-10-19T17:28:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Trump_economicclub_detroit_4d0ba4-e1729279526437.jpg?w=900
Democratic Party eyes Swifties with new youth voter campaign	(NewsNation) — As pop megastar Taylor Swift returns to the United States for the final leg of her 'Eras Tour,' the Democratic National Committee is looking to target her audience with a new series of Snapchat filters, billboard signs and voter outreach.

What's going on in Dolton? Illinois town has 'America's worst may...	(NewsNation) — Politician Tiffany Henyard, the current mayor of the village of Dolton, Ill. who just announced her reelection bid, has faced myriad controversies during her tenure in the Chicago suburb. Accusations range from opponent sabotage to misuse of taxpayer dollars, with the embattled elected official at the center of it all. Who is Tiffany Henyard? Henyard is both the supervisor of the largest township in Illinois, Thornton Township and the mayor of Dolton, Ill. Both towns are located roughly 30 miles from bustling Chicago. Henyard, who calls herself a 'supermayor' because of her dual positions, grew up in the area. According to her bio on the city's website, Henyard was elected in 2021 with 82% of the vote, making her the 'village of Dolton’s first and youngest woman mayor in the village’s 130-year history.' She's also likely the most controversial mayor ever elected in the town of 20,000, with the two governments under control racking up expenditures on fine dining, first-class travel, an armed security detail and more. Politics aside, she also runs the Tiffany Henyard Cares Foundation, a cancer charity which has garnered criticism for its inability to show how it helps cancer patients. Mayor Tiffany Henyard's controversies Henyard faces many allegations, but some of the most damning include spending tax dollars on her own lifestyle, throwing lavish parties with community resources and retaliating against those who go against her or her allies. Henyard, her political committee, her cancer charity, her boyfriend, two of her relatives, four trustees who are allies, her deputy police chief and even her defunct burger business have all been named in the FBI subpoenas regarding financial mismanagement in the town. Most recently, Henyard has come under fire for an $85,000 party backed by taxpayer funds and named after 'Friends of Tiffany A. Henyard,' her campaign fund. Trustees in both Thornton and Dolton attempted to prevent public money being used for the festivities, which included flying in R&amp;B singer Keke Wyatt and rapper J. Holiday for a mini-concert for the 'Taste of Thornton Township.' 'Let me make sure I’m crystal clear about this: I ain’t never took a goddamn thing in my life,' Henyard told Facebook viewers during a livestream from the outdoor gathering. JD Vance town hall on NewsNation: What you need to know Henyard has defended her taxpayer-funded events as important to the community, saying 'this is all for the babies' in a Facebook video taken at one of them. Residents don't believe her. 'I was flabbergasted,' said Lansing resident Jennifer Robertz. 'I was pissed off. That’s my money. That’s the people’s money.' The extravagant party and its backlash is far from the first public outcry about Henyard's spending. Lori Lightfoot investigates Henyard In August, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a lawyer, was hired to investigate Henyard after years of chaotic meetings and accusations from her constituents. Lightfoot’s findings, released in August 2024, included exorbitant spending that landed the village in a nearly $5.5 million deficit. Just two years before, Dolton had been in a surplus. Charges to the village included: Three Amazon purchases – all made in a single day – totaling $43,000 A $7,699 Wayfair purchase PayPal money transfers and gift cards NewsNation local affiliate WGN also uncovered pricey travel expenses of $67,000 over four months by Henyard and her allies. Some of the expenditures included first-class airfare and a $9,000 stay at a Four Seasons hotel. Only after our affiliate sued Henyard did her office release spending records from July to November 2023. Travel expenses from Henyard’s 'conferences' tallied up to nearly $70,000, with $20,000 spent in Texas alone. Besides the travel, other notable Dolton credit card charges include: $24,778 at retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target $14,425 at Amazon $5,009 at Uber Eats and local restaurants $3,491 for Henyard’s personal photographer Henyard’s three vehicles also cost residents more than $374,000. One of Henyard’s top aides, Keith Freeman, has been charged in federal court with bankruptcy fraud. Another aide, former acting police deputy chief Lewis Lacey, was indicted in August on bankruptcy fraud charges for collecting more than $200,000 in overtime during the previous four fiscal years. Sentencing hearing begins for former sheriff who stole millions Butting heads: Henyard vs. trustees The ongoing power struggle has stayed mostly between Henyard, the village’s trustees and other community leaders. Trustee Carmen Carlisle, who used to be Henyard's assistant, sent an email to WGN breaking her silence about the mayor’s alleged wrongdoings. 'I am standing up, not just for myself, but for others who have been affected by what I see as Henyard’s abusive leadership,' Carlisle’s statement said. 'I believe there are many more victims who have been retaliated against, fired or lied to by Henyard, but have yet to speak out.' In front of a packed audience at an August meeting, Henyard responded by saying: ''I think I’m going to get you a new nickname: ‘Lyin’ Carlisle.' 'I’m tired of everyone in here,' Henyard said. 'There always has to be a show.' Residents have also been caught in the cross-fire. What's next for Dolton? Trustees have instituted layoffs and say they’re now crafting their own budget to try to get the village’s finances in order. Henyard filed a lawsuit last week against a majority of the village's trustees, alleging that one of the meetings held at the Dolton Park District was illegal. Henyard announced on social media Tuesday that she is running for a second term. 'So again the time is now to run for office,' she wrote, also using the hashtag 'IStandWithTiff.' Meanwhile, Dolton’s mayor pro-tem Trustee Jason House plans to run for mayor, so far Henyard's only challenger in the February Democratic primary. House supported Henyard in her 2021 election. The deadline for election filings is Oct. 28. If defeated in the mayoral election, House would be off the Village Board because his position is up for reelection as well. Comments on Henyard's reelection announcement varied from support to opposition. 'Tiffany is going to win. She’s the incumbent. The opposing slate has no chance,' one Facebook user wrote. 'Only place your (sic) going is jail,' another commented. 'Y'all must have some good weed up there cuz I can't think of any reason y'all would vote for this lady after all she's done to bankrupt her town,' yet another user posted.

3 killed and 8 injured by gunfire following a Mississippi school'...	LEXINGTON, Miss. (AP) — Three people were killed and eight others were injured in central Mississippi early Saturday when at least two people opened fire into a group of several hundred people who were celebrating a school's homecoming football win at an outdoor trail several hours after the game had ended, authorities said. The gunfire was proceeded by a fight between some of the men at the celebration, but deputies hadn't yet learned what sparked the fight, said Holmes County Sheriff Willie March. Anywhere from 200 to 300 people were on the trail celebrating, and the gunfire sent them fleeing, the sheriff said in a phone interview. 'It was chaos, to tell you the truth,' March said. 'The shooting just started and people started running.' The shootings about five miles (3 kilometers) outside of Lexington, Mississippi, followed a football game several hours earlier at the Holmes County Consolidated School’s homecoming celebration. After the victory, scores of young people headed to the trail to celebrate. Lexington is located more than 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of Jackson. Two of the victims who died were 19 and the third was 25. The injured victims were airlifted to local hospitals. Deputies were collecting ammunition at the scene in an effort to determine how many weapons were fired, March said. Shootings by young men have been an 'off and on' problem recently in the county, which has a population of almost 16,000 residents. The young men who talk to the sheriff tell him that it's often because they have a 'beef,' or disagreement with someone. 'It’s hard to see what they are fighting over. I don’t think they are fighting over turf or drugs,' March said. 'These are young men walking around with weapons. I wish I had an answer.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/ap-3-killed-and-8-injured-by-gunfire-following-a-mississippi-schools-football-game/	2024-10-19T09:21:17-07:00	
Drone strike launched toward Israeli prime minister's house. At l...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli government said a drone was launched toward the prime minister’s house Saturday, with no casualties, as Iran’s supreme leader vowed that Hamas would continue its fight against Israel following the killing of the mastermind of last year’s deadly Oct. 7 attack. Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement. In September, Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile toward Ben Gurion Airport when Netanyahu’s plane was landing. The missile was intercepted. Meanwhile, in Gaza, more than 50 people have been killed in several Israeli strikes, including children, in less than 24 hours, according to hospital officials and an Associated Press reporter. Saturday's strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. In addition to the drone launched at Netanyahu's residence, Israel's military said some 55 projectiles were fired in two separate barrages at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning. Some were intercepted, the army said, and there were no immediate reports of any casualties. Israel also said Saturday it killed Hezbollah’s deputy commander in the southern town of Bint Jbeil. The army said Nasser Rashid supervised attacks against Israel In Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a vehicle on a main highway north of Beirut, killing two people. It was unclear who was in the car when it was struck. A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. 'Hamas is alive and will stay alive,' Khamenei said. Since Israel claimed Sinwar’s death Thursday and a top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday, Hamas has reiterated its stance that the hostages they took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. The staunch position pushed back against a statement by Netanyahu that his country’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming. Sinwar was the chief architect of the 2023 Hamas raid on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospital’s building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff. At Al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, strikes hit the building’s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where the casualties were taken. An AP reporter counted the bodies at the hospital. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where they were taken. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital. Overnight Friday, at least three houses were struck in northern Gaza killing at least 30 people, more than half of them women and children, said Fares Abu Hamza, head of the health ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. The homes were hit in Jabaliya and at least 80 people were injured. The war has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza, displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, and left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel. Sinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the war in Gaza even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. But Netanyahu said in a Thursday night speech announcing the killing that 'our war is not yet ended.' Still, the governments of Israel’s allies and exhausted residents of Gaza expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwar’s killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. — Associated Press reporters Jack Jeffery from Ramallah, West Bank and Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Lebanon contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-strike-launched-toward-israeli-prime-ministers-house/	2024-10-19T02:21:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67137b71afb217.38510193.jpeg?w=900
Georgia passes 1 million votes on fourth day of early voting	(NewsNation) — A million voters have turned out in Georgia as of 11:50 a.m. on Friday, the fourth day of early voting in the critical battleground state. Georgia Secretary of State Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling announced the milestone on X, celebrating record turnout in the state. He recently told NewsNation that while there are lines at polling places, they are moving fast and the secretary of state's office is committed to ensuring fair elections and being transparent with voters. Pro-Trump yard sign leads to shooting in Las Vegas neighborhood There are more than seven million registered voters in the state, where more than five million ballots were cast in the 2020 election. President Joe Biden's narrow victory in the state was critical to winning the White House. It has also been a focus for those who maintain, without evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen. In 2024, Georgia is once again expected to play a major role in deciding the next president. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have focused campaign efforts in the state and there have already been conflicts over election procedures. Republicans have challenged thousands of voters on the rolls and a judge recently blocked Republican-led efforts to require hand-counting of ballots and allow local election officials to delay certifying results. Trump is also facing racketeering charges in the state, related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-1-million-votes/	2024-10-18T11:12:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177861107.jpg?w=900
Middle East latest: Hezbollah says its war with Israel is enterin...	Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group said Friday it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckons with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Hamas acknowledged Sinwar’s death and described him as a martyr. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Many, from the governments of Israeli allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing Sinwar’s death that 'Our war is not yet ended.' On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Israel says it has killed the Hamas militant who guarded Sinwar JERUSALEM — Israel’s military says it killed the militant who guarded the late Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar was killed by Israeli troops on Wednesday in Rafah, Gaza. In a statement released Friday night, the military identified the militant as Mahmoud Hamdan. It says troops killed Hamdan on Friday, 200 meters (650 feet) away from where Sinwar was killed. The military says Hamdan acted as a guard for six hostages who were killed in August as Israeli troops drew near to where they were being held in the Gaza tunnel network. It did not provide evidence for the claim. The six hostages included an Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Biden says it may be easier to reach a cease-fire in Lebanon than Gaza BERLIN — President Joe Biden has suggested that negotiating a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could be easier than forging one between Israel and Hamas. Biden says he discussed the way ahead to end the Middle East conflict following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza when he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Friday. Biden told reporters that the leaders 'think that there is a possibility of working for a cease-fire in Lebanon and it’s going to be harder in Gaza.' He continued: 'But we agree there has to be an outcome of what happens the day after.' Sinwar was killed Wednesday by Israeli forces in Gaza, and Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone the following day. Biden declined to say whether Netanyahu gave him assurance during that conversation that the Israelis are ready to get back to negotiations toward a cease-fire and the release of hostages. 'We’re in the middle of discussions about that,' Biden said, adding: 'I’m not going to get into that.' Asked whether he had an understanding of when and how Israel may respond to Iran’s missile barrage on Israel earlier this month, Biden responded, 'Yes and yes.' He declined to offer any further details on Israel’s potential retaliation. Netanyahu plans to meet with ministers to discuss hostages JERUSALEM — Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to convene a special meeting with government ministers to discuss hostage negotiations in the light of Israel's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. It’s unclear when the meeting will be held or what exactly is on the agenda. Israelis have urged the government to use the opportunity to seal a deal for the hostages’ release since Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces Wednesday. Among hostage families, there’s hope Sinwar’s death could restart the negotiations that sputtered to a stop three weeks ago, when Hamas and Israel accused each other of negotiating in bad faith. UNICEF takes action after cholera case confirmed in northern Lebanon BEIRUT — The U.N.’s children’s agency says it has activated an emergency cholera response to help protect children and families by containing the disease. The announcement by UNICEF Friday follows the confirmation of a cholera case in the Akkar governorate in North Lebanon. The health ministry said in a statement that the cholera case was unrelated to the growing displacement crisis in Lebanon. However, the country remains vigilant in controlling the spread of communicable diseases amid the ongoing displacement. Lebanon says 6 more killed in fighting in the past 24 hours BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit says six people have been killed and 69 wounded in the past 24 hours in the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The new numbers raise the total toll over the past year of conflict to 2,418 killed and 11,336 wounded, the Lebanese Health Ministry said Friday. The crisis response unit report also records 87 airstrikes and shellings in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Some 1,098 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are sheltering 191,501 people, including 44,646 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report says. Among these shelters, 902 are full. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. The Lebanese Ministry of Education reports that 77 % of public schools are out of service, either due to their use as shelters or their location in areas directly affected by the war. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike on the road, crowds continue to flow across the border seeking safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 18, Lebanese General Security recorded 335,948 Syrian and 135,181 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report says. UK prime minister says ‘dire humanitarian situation’ in Gaza cannot go on BERLIN — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told Israel that 'the world will not tolerate any more excuses on humanitarian assistance' to people in Gaza. Speaking Friday during a visit to Berlin to meet President Joe Biden and European leaders, Starmer said 'the dire humanitarian situation cannot continue. … Civilians in northern Gaza need food now.' The Biden administration warned Israel on Sunday that it must increase the amount of humanitarian aid it allows into Gaza within the next 30 days or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. Starmer says the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar should be a precursor to a cease-fire. Starmer says 'no one should mourn' the death of Sinwar, who had 'the blood of innocent Israelis' on his hands, as well as the blood of Palestinians 'who suffered in the chaos and violence that he sought and celebrated.' He says he strongly supports Israel’s right to self-defense, 'particularly in the face of the Iranian regime’s actions' and that Sinwar’s death 'provides an opportunity for a step towards that cease-fire that we have long called for.' Italy’s prime minister says Europe wants a ‘sustainable ceasefire’ in Gaza and Lebanon BEIRUT — Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni says European countries are working for a 'sustainable cease-fire' in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Speaking in Beirut after meeting Friday with her Lebanese counterpart, Najib Mikati, Meloni said European nations also support negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since October last year. Mikati says 'a diplomatic solution should overcome' war that has intensified in recent weeks into an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, and that Israel must agree to a cease-fire. Meloni says targeting U.N. peacekeepers deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border is unacceptable and that both sides must 'ensure at all times the safety of each of these soldiers.' She says the peacekeepers will be needed in any post-conflict scenario. Over the past two weeks, U.N. posts along the border have been subjected to fire that that has wounded at least five peacekeepers. She says the peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, must be strengthened and that UNIFIL and Lebanese troops should be the only armed forces in the area south of the Litani river along the border with Israel. According to a 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006, Hezbollah should have no presence in the area along the border with Israel. Putin hopes the conflict in the Middle East won’t escalate further MOSCOW — Asked about the possibility of an all-out war between Iran and Israel, Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced hope that tension can be defused in the region. Speaking Friday during a meeting with media representatives he said 'no one is interested in the escalation of the conflict for both economic and security reasons.' He says there is a possibility 'to find a settlement, but that will depend on the parties involved in the confrontation.' He notes that Russia has maintained contacts with Iran and Israel and stands ready to play mediator if asked, describing those relationships as 'quite trusting.' He says: 'We are ready to do what depends on us, if our role is viewed positively, to also help end those horrible strikes on civilians in the Gaza Sector and help normalize the situation in southern Lebanon to end an exchange of strikes there.' Israel says aid shipment reaches northern Gaza Israel’s military says it allowed 30 trucks of humanitarian aid into northern Gaza, the latest delivery over the past week as Israel faces pressure from the U.S. to ramp up aid. The military body in charge of humanitarian aid, COGAT, said Friday that the trucks carried food, water, medical supplies and shelter equipment. There has been no confirmation from the U.N. that the aid arrived and is being distributed in the north. Aid crossings to the north of Gaza were closed for the first two weeks of October, the U.N. says, sending food and water levels plunging in an area of Gaza where some of the heaviest fighting is taking place. The closures raised fears that Israel was implementing an extreme plan proposed by Israeli generals to besiege northern Gaza and starve out Hamas militants there. Following a letter from the U.S. saying the continual closures could risk continued weapons funding for Israel, Israel says crossings have reopened and aid is continuing to flow. White House watches to see who will succeed Sinwar BERLIN — The Biden administration says it does not have any early insight on who might succeed Yahya Sinwar or whether the new Hamas leader might be more willing to revive a cease-fire and hostage deal. White House national security spokesman John Kirby has called Sinwar the main obstacle preventing the negotiations from moving forward. But he says it remains to be seen if the killing of the Hamas leader could reinvigorate negotiations. He adds it’s 'too soon' to assess who Hamas 'might anoint as Sinwar’s successor and what that individual may be willing to pursue.' Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel’s military will keep fighting until the hostages are released and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming after a year of devastating war. Khalil al-Hayya, who was Sinwar’s Qatar-based deputy, says Hamas will not return any of the hostages 'before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza.' Iran condemns Sinwar's killing and vows to continue resistance TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and says his death will not disturb Islamic resistance. The state-run IRNA news agency on Friday quoted Pezeshkian as saying, 'Martyrdom will not create a disturbance in the Islamic Ummah’s resistance against force and occupation.' Pezeshkian also expressed condolences to the people of Gaza and all the freedom-seekers of the world. Israel releases footage of gunfight in which Sinwar died JERUSALEM — Israel’s military has released new footage showing what it says is the killing of Yahya Sinwar, including a tank firing at a home where the Hamas leader took refuge after a firefight with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military says Sinwar was killed in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday when the tank shell hit the building where he had fled following a gunfight. Israeli soldiers killed Sinwar after encountering three militants fleeing between buildings in Rafah, Israeli military spokesperson LTC Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters Friday. Under Israeli fire, two militants whose faces were covered by cloth fled into one building while another — Sinwar — entered a second. Before night fell, soldiers killed the two militants in one building and fired a tank shell at the other. It wasn’t until the following day, that soldiers inspecting the rubble noticed the body of a man who looked like Sinwar. His identity was confirmed by forensic tests in Israel. Shoshani says the military has intelligence that troops killed Sinwar during a rare moment when the Hamas leader was outside rather than in Gaza’s extensive tunnel network. At one point, Shoshani said, Sinwar spent time in the same tunnel complex where six hostages were held. The military says they were killed by their Hamas captors as Israeli soldiers drew near. Hezbollah sends condolences to Palestinians for Sinwar's death BEIRUT — The militant group Hezbollah has expressed its condolences to the Palestinian people and Hamas for the killing of Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas’ political bureau. A statement issued by the group’s leadership Friday referred to Sinwar as a 'martyr' and praised his role in leading Hamas on 'the path of resistance.' Hezbollah describes him as the leader 'who stood in the face of the American project and the Zionist occupation, and sacrificed his blood for that.' 'We in the leadership of Hezbollah, who are facing with our resistant and steadfast Lebanese people the repercussions of the criminal Zionist aggression, confirm our standing with our Palestinian people,' Hezbollah says. — By Sally Abou AlJoud Biden urges Israel to use Sinwar's death to move toward peace BERLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden is reiterating his call for Israel to use the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as an opportunity to move toward peace. Biden said as he met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin Friday that Sinwar’s killing 'represents a moment of justice.' He says Sinwar 'had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans and so many others on his hands.' Biden says he 'told the prime minister of Israel yesterday, let’s also make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas.' Scholz, also a staunch ally of Israel, has said Sinwar’s death should open 'the concrete prospect of a cease-fire in Gaza, of an agreement to release the hostages held by Hamas.' Hamas calls Sinwar a martyr who died brandishing his weapon BEIRUT — Hamas has heralded Sinwar as a hero who 'ascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks.' The Hamas statement released Friday appears to refer to a video circulating of Sinwar’s last moments, in which he sits on a chair in a badly damaged building, severely wounded and covered in dust. He then suddenly raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli miniature drone in an apparent final act of defiance. UN peacekeepers stick to their positions in southern Lebanon GENEVA — Forces in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon are maintaining their positions despite 'demands' to move from the Israeli Defense Forces. Spokesperson Andrea Tenenti of UNIFIL, the interim force in Lebanon, said Friday that a 'unanimous' decision was taken by its 50 troop-contributing countries and the U.N. Security Council to hold its positions. They will also continue to monitor the conflict and ensure aid gets to civilians. 'The IDF has repeatedly targeted our positions, endangering the safety of our troops, in addition to Hezbollah launching rockets toward Israel from near our positions, which also puts our peacekeepers in danger,' he told a U.N. news briefing in Geneva by video. Tenenti says deteriorating security in the recent fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces has forced UNIFIL — which has some 10,000 personnel — to suspend most, but not all, of its patrols near the U.N.-imposed Blue Line boundary separating Lebanon and Israel. He says UNIFIL has seen 'hundreds of trajectories, and sometimes more, crossing the Blue Line each day, forcing our peacekeepers to spend extended hours in shelters to ensure their safety, which remains our top priority.' Tenenti says UNIFIL is maintaining its positions 'despite IDF demands to move from positions close to the Blue Line.' Israeli soldiers wounded and two militants killed in exchange of fire south of the Dead Sea JERUSALEM — Israel’s military says two soldiers have been injured in a gunfight with militants who crossed from Jordan into Israel. At least two militants crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea Friday morning, before being shot dead by Israeli troops. The military says two soldiers were injured during an exchange of fire and that troops are searching the area for another militant who may have infiltrated. The identities of those who crossed the border remain unclear. Hamas praised the incursion but did not claim responsibility, calling it an 'important development' in the war in Gaza and a 'natural response' to the 'brutal crimes of the occupation against our Palestinian people.' The statement is one of the first public comments by Hamas since Israel killed its leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza. Hamas indirectly admits that its leader Sinwar was killed BEIRUT — A statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad has tacitly but not directly confirmed the death of the group’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza. Hamas said Friday that Israel is mistaken if it 'believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.' Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim says past leaders have also been killed and 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.' He says it is 'painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders' but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be 'eventually victorious.' When asked if the statement confirms Sinwar’s death, Naim said it does not. Israeli prosecutors to indict East Jerusalem man police say was planning to attack protest JERUSALEM — Israeli prosecutors are set to indict a Palestinian from East Jerusalem who police say planned to carry out an attack on a hostage protest in Tel Aviv. In a statement Friday, the police and Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said the man was a supporter of Hamas and other militant groups, and planned to carry out multiple attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers in retribution for Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Police say the man had not yet acquired a weapon or explosives to carry out any of the attacks, but that he was planning to attack a protest calling for the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Such protests occur weekly in Tel Aviv. Hezbollah says its war with Israel is entering a ‘new phase’ BEIRUT — Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group says it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, adding that it has introduced new weapons over the past days. A statement from the group’s operations room early Friday says Hezbollah’s fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. The statement appears to refer to a drone laden with explosives that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The statement also says Hezbollah’s air defense units shot down this week two Israeli Hermes 450 drones. Hezbollah says its fighters are working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. Iran commemorates Hamas leader whom Israel says it killed UNITED NATIONS — Iran’s Mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, after Israel said he had been killed in fighting. It says: 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed. However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened. He will become a model for the youth and children who will carry forth his path for the liberation of Palestine. As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.' Iran and Iraq fought a brutal war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. It killed more than 1 million people on both sides.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-middle-east-latest-hezbollah-says-its-war-with-israel-is-entering-a-new-phase/	2024-10-18T11:03:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6712a3c16deee9.26068330.jpeg?w=900
Trump calls Jack Smith ‘sick puppy’ as latest Jan. 6 evidence uns...	Former President Trump on Friday railed against special counsel Jack Smith and the judge overseeing his case on efforts to subvert the 2020 election as Smith released a slew of new documents. 'The judge is allowing him to do it. And it’s not even believable,' Trump said Friday morning on 'The Dan Bongino Show' shortly before the documents were made public. 'This guy is a sick puppy. And they’re going to release something else. And always before the election. It’s election interference. No, it’s a terrible thing what’s happening.' Trump also blasted U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who a day earlier rejected an effort from Trump's team to delay the release of additional documents from Smith. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'This judge is the most evil person,' Trump said of Chutkan. 'They all said, 'Well make sure you don’t get Chutkan.' And who did I get? I got Chutkan.' Chutkan last week agreed to a request from Smith to unseal exhibits that accompany his 180-page brief asserting that prosecutors can still bring much of their Jan. 6 case against Trump in the wake of a Supreme Court decision granting former presidents broad criminal immunity. Smith argues Trump’s efforts to thwart the transfer of power were the unlawful actions of a private citizen, not of a president. Chutkan granted Smith’s motion to post redacted versions of the exhibits, which could include grand jury transcripts, texts and other evidence assembled by prosecutors. Trump was indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., last year over his efforts to remain in power after losing the 2020 election. Smith charged Trump with four counts, alleging he was the director of a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and was also central to a campaign to block the certification of votes on Jan. 6, 2021.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-jack-smith-january-6-evidence/	2024-10-18T09:53:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Jack-Smith-Donald-Trump-09.05_5f338d.png?w=900

Delphi murders: Opening statements underway in Richard Allen tria...	(NewsNation) — Opening statements are underway Friday in the long-awaited trial of the man accused of killing two teens in Delphi, Indiana, nearly eight years ago. Richard Allen, 52, is accused of killing Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, in February 2017 after allegedly luring them to their deaths while they were on a hike not far from their home. Their deaths had gone unsolved for more than five years when Allen, then a pharmacy worker, was arrested in the case that has drawn attention from true crime enthusiasts. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case After an evidence leak, several legal filings, the removal and reinstating of the original court-appointed defense team and other delays in the Delphi murder case, Allen’s trial is now in full swing. Allen had been there all along in Delphi, living and working in the community of about 3,000 people in northwest Indiana. He faces two counts of murder and two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping. If convicted, Allen could face up to 130 years in prison. State looks to nix composite sketches The initial sketch was released in 2017 (left) and the revised sketch was released in 2019 (right) After the girls were found dead, investigators released a grainy image of the suspected killer. However. it would be another five years before Allen was arrested and charged with their murders. In October 2022, Allen was taken into custody. He’s now charged with four counts of murder in connection with the girls’ deaths. As the trial begins, attorneys for Allen laid out their argument for why widely circulated composite sketches should be admitted as evidence. Earlier this week, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland filed a motion in limine asking the court to prohibit the use of composite sketches during Allen's trial. The sketches, released in 2017 and 2019, have been part of the Delphi murders investigation for years. Indiana State released them in hopes of generating leads about the deaths of Williams and German. McLeland argued the sketches were not used to identify Richard Allen and said using them during the trial could confuse or prejudice the jury. Attorneys discussed the motion during a hearing in Allen County on Thursday. Judge Fran Gull took it under advisory and has yet to rule. The state argued that the sketches were produced as part of the investigation for the purposes of recognition, not identification, of a suspect. What do we know about Delphi suspect Richard Allen? Delphi murder trial jury selection Jury selection in the trial began on Monday. Around 300 summons were sent to prospective Allen County jurors. Eventually, 12 jurors and four alternates were selected. The three-day process of culling the jury pool began in Allen County on Monday with 100 prospective jurors scheduled to appear in the courtroom. Allen was present during the proceedings, arriving in a purple shirt, khaki pants and a pair of shackles. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, Allen’s defense team asked for a change of venue. Special Judge Fran Gull, appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court to oversee the case after the original judge recused himself, determined that was logistically challenging. She decided to bring in jurors from Allen County and transport them to Carroll County for the trial. Jury selection began Monday. The jurors will be sequestered for about a month. More than 100 people were expected to testify between the defense and prosecution. Delphi murders: Prosecutors don’t want jury to visit Delphi crime scene Richard Allen's defense arguments Defense lawyers for Allen made a startling admission during Tuesday’s jury selection. Allen’s defense team revealed that hair was found in Abby Williams’ hand that didn’t match Richard Allen. That’s the first time that information has been made public. Attorney Andrew Baldwin made the comments during 'mini opening statements' preceding jury selection. While prosecutors say an unspent bullet found at the scene is linked to a gun owned by Allen and cite dozens of confessions from him, Allen’s defense argued those confessions were made under duress and weren’t trustworthy. They said Allen confessed to details from the crime that were inaccurate. He also confessed to other crimes that didn’t happen, his defense team said.

Hezbollah vows revenge for Hamas leader Sinwar's death	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden says securing a cease-fire and bringing hostages home are the main focuses after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war isn't over. Meanwhile, Hezbollah says Sinwar's death only stands to escalate its war with Israel. US responds to death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar Israeli, US response to Sinwar's death Following Thursday's announcement, Israel’s military released a drone video that shows a person they say is Sinwar just before he died by Israeli tank fire. Biden spoke with Netanyahu after Sinwar’s death and congratulated him on the news. Despite a renewed push for a cease-fire, however, Israel said the war isn’t over. Netanyahu said he wants Israel to maintain long-term control over Gaza and added that any Hamas member who helps with hostage rescue and turns their weapons in will be offered amnesty. In Iran, Sinwar’s death has strengthened the spirit of resistance, the country’s UN team said. The U.S. military has boots on the ground in Israel operating an air defense system to protect against a possible Iranian attack. Bolton calls death of Hamas leader ‘a good day for the whole world’ Hostages in Hamas detention About 101 Israeli hostages remain in Hamas custody and dozens are believed to be dead. Twenty-three-year-old Israeli American soldier Omer Neutra is one of those remaining hostages believed to be alive. Hamas took him in October 2023. His parents called for peace after the announcement of Sinwar’s death. 'We are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,' Neutera’s father, Ronen Neutra, said. Sinwar was described as a major obstacle to a deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Israel early next week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/hezbollah-revenge-hamas-leader-sinwars-death/	2024-10-18T06:08:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/655e7f0006f8d1.34963862.jpeg?w=900

Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza: Who was he?	(NewsNation) — Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds behind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has been killed, the Israeli military confirmed Thursday. 'Eliminated: Yahya Sinwar,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) wrote on X. Sinwar — who had been the de facto head of Hamas since Ismail Haniyeh was killed in July — was a U.S.-designated terrorist and had been at the top of Israel's most-wanted list since the start of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, IDF source confirms He was one of the chief architects of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw at least 250 others taken hostage. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called Sinwar’s killing a 'military and moral achievement for the Israeli army,' saying it would 'create the possibility to immediately release the hostages,' in a statement shared with The Associated Press. Hamas had not confirmed Sinwar's death as of early Thursday afternoon. Here's what we know about Sinwar. Who was Yahya Sinwar? Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. Later, he went on to form the group's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, which became known for sending suicide bombers into Israel and firing rockets from Gaza into Israeli towns. Sinwar developed a reputation for brutality and earned the nickname 'the butcher of Khan Younis' after he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators. In 1988, Sinwar was arrested by Israel for his terrorist activity. He was sentenced to four life terms for abducting and murdering two Israeli soldiers but was later released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. After his release, Sinwar returned to Gaza, where he rose to power. The U.S. State Department designated Sinwar a global terrorist in 2015. By 2017, Sinwar had been named the new leader of Hamas in Gaza, with The New York Times describing him as a 'militant hard-liner.' 'He carries a reputation as a harsh enforcer of loyalty within the group, and as an unstinting enemy of Israel,' the Times wrote. In May, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor sought an arrest warrant for Sinwar for his alleged role in the Oct. 7 attack. According to the AP, Sinwar was killed in Rafah after an Israeli tank launched a shell at a building, causing it to collapse. Photos of Sinwar published by Israeli media show a man wearing a bulletproof vest, surrounded by grenades, lying in the rubble of a building with a head wound, the AP reported. The Associated Press and NewsNation's Robert Sherman contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/who-was-yahya-sinwar/	2024-10-17T11:36:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1251837467.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Liam Payne, a former member of One Direction, fell to his death from his balcony at the CasaSur Palermo hotel in Buenos Aires Wednesday, a sad end to a recently turbulent life. Liam Payne's death at Argentina hotel First responders were called at 5:04 pm on Wednesday by the hotel — half an hour after he was carried out of the hotel’s lobby and just minutes before Payne fell from his third-floor balcony at 5:07 pm. A newly released emergency call from the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires manager to the police was chilling. Friends and musicians express heartbreak at the death of singer Liam Payne at age 31 The frantic manager 'begged for law enforcement and requested urgent’ assistance, alleging the out-of-control singer was ‘putting his life at risk’,' according to the NY Post. 'Hello, good morning. I just called and my line got disconnected. I’m calling (from) the CasaSur hotel in Palermo, Costa Rica 6032,' the manager is heard saying in Spanish in audio obtained by the Sun UK and La Nacion. The manager, 'Esteban,' claimed that Payne was destroying his hotel room and was under the influence of 'drugs and alcohol., saying: 'Well, we have a guest who is drunk on drugs and alcohol. And, well, he’s … When he’s conscious, he’s breaking up the whole room. And, well, we need you to send someone, please.' 'We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don’t know if this guest’s life is at risk. They must be in a room that has a balcony. And well, we’re a little bit worried he’ll do something, that he’ll put his life at risk.' 'How long has he been there or is it a residential hotel?' the operator asked. 'No, no, he’s been there for two or three days,' the manager said.

(Photo by Dave J Hogan/Getty Images ) Liam Payne posts about 'lovely day' before death An insider told Page Six that 'Liam had been cycling through periods of ruinous behavior for a long time,' adding that 'his demons were much worse than he let on.' Shortly before his death, Payne claimed he was having a 'lovely day in Argentina' in a since-deleted Snapchat story during his vacation with girlfriend Kate Cassidy. Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 shocks fans around the world Cassidy flew back to Miami on Monday — two days before the tragedy insinuating she’d had enough of the elongated trip (the couple were set to leave weeks before after catching former One Direction Niall Horan’s show in the city but stayed on for 14 more days). 'I was so ready to leave,' Cassidy shared in a TikTok video. 'Honestly, love South America but I hate staying in one place for too long. And we were supposed to be there for, like, five days, turned into two weeks… I was just like, ‘I need to go home.'' Liam Payne struggled with issues linked to Maya Henry Payne — who has battled drink and drugs for years — was also dealing with his ex. According to People: 'Payne was struggling with issues related to his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry'. A source with knowledge of the situation told the magazine that Payne 'was extremely overwhelmed by all of the legal issues' involving Henry. The Texan model, 23, instructed lawyers to issue a cease and desist letter to Payne a few days earlier, accusing him of 'obsessively contacting her friends and family including her mother Azteca Henry'. Henry posted a video to TikTok that said: 'Ever since we broke up he messages me, will blow up my phone, not only from his phone, it's always from different phone numbers too, so I never know where it's gonna come from.' 'He'll create new iCloud accounts to message me — it's always a new damn iCloud account. Every time I see one pop up on my phone I'm like, 'here we f---ing go again' 'Also, he will email me... not only me, but he'll blow up my mom's phone. Is this normal behavior to you?' Henry also accused Payne of 'weaponizing' fans whom he 'preys' upon against her. Liam Payne open about struggles with drugs and alcohol Since skyrocketing to fame at the age of 16 with One Direction, Payne has been open about his struggles with drugs and alcohol. Regarding alcohol, Payne told Men’s Journal: 'It's almost like putting the Disney costume on before you step up on stage and underneath the Disney costume I was (drunk) quite a lot of the time because there was no other way to get your head around what was going on.' Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast in 2021, Payne told host Stephen Bartlett that he had struggled with 'severe suicidal thoughts' and heavy drug use while he was in the band. 'I was worried how far my rock bottom was going to be,' he said in the interview. 'Where's rock bottom for me? And you would never have seen it. I'm very good at hiding it. No one would ever have seen it. 'There is some stuff that I have definitely never, never spoken about… it was really, really, really severe. And it was a problem. And it was only until I saw myself after that, I was like ‘Right, I need to fix myself.’' Liam Payne and his bandmates all sought solo success after One Direction fame Payne spent 100 days in a Louisiana rehab in 2023. Before leaving for Argentina, Payne told fans in an Instagram story that he had things 'to square up' with Horan but didn’t get into specifics about it. Liam Payne died of 'cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' Medical officials confirmed that Payne died of 'a cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' sustained in the fall. 'Our role was to head there quickly, give medical attention, and try to resuscitate him, but his injuries were incompatible with life,' said Buenos Aires emergency services chief Alberto Crescenti, according to La Nacion. The Argentine newspaper also ran pictures from Payne’s damaged hotel room showing drugs, drug paraphernalia, booze and a broken TV. 'Liam will forever live in our hearts': Liam Payne's family On Thursday, Payne’s family issued a statement to the BBC which read: 'Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.' Payne isn’t the only member of One Direction to struggle with fame and a solo career. His former bandmate Zayn Malik has been very public about his anxiety and anorexia issues since leaving the band.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/liam-payne-death-hotel-urgent-assistance/	2024-10-17T11:08:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/gettyimages-1134037682-594x594-1.jpg?w=594

The Israeli military is investigating whether top Hamas leader Si...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military says it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. The military said in a statement Thursday that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without elaborating. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of the three was Sinwar. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He was chosen as the group’s top leader following the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. An Israeli strike on a school sheltering the displaced in northern Gaza on Thursday killed at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the strike targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza where Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera's Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Israel has struck central Beirut on two occasions in its latest war against Hezbollah, and both came without warnings. In northern Gaza, Fares Abu Hamza, head of the ministry's local emergency unit, confirmed the toll from the Israeli strike and said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by both militant groups inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Panel looking into Trump assassination attempt says Secret Servic...	WASHINGTON (AP) — An independent panel investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally faulted the Secret Service for poor communications that day and failing to secure the building where the gunman took his shots. The review also found more systemic issues at the agency such as a failure to understand the unique risks facing Trump and a culture of doing 'more with less.' The 52-page report issued Thursday took the Secret Service to task for specific problems leading up to the July 13 rally in Butler as a well as deeper one within the agency's culture. It recommended bringing in new, outside leadership and refocusing on its protective mission. 'The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,' the authors wrote Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Homeland Security Department, the Secret Services' parent agency, in a letter accompanying their report. 'Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.' One rallygoer was killed and two others wounded when Thomas Michael Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and opened fire as Trump spoke. The former president was wounded in the ear before being rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents. That shooting, along with another incident in Florida when Trump was golfing — a gunman there never got a line of site on the president or fired a shot — has led to a crisis in confidence in the agency. The report by a panel of four former law enforcement officials from national and state government follows investigations by members of Congress, the agency's own investigators and by Homeland Security's oversight body. A look at the report's key findings and recommendations: Poor communications, no plan for key buildings The panel echoed previous reports that have zeroed in on the failure to secure the building near the rally that had a clear line of site to where Trump was speaking and the multiple communications problems that hindered the ability of the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement to talk to each other. 'The failure to secure a complex of buildings, portions of which were within approximately 130 yards of the protectee and containing numerous positions carrying high-angle line of sight risk, represents a critical security failure,' the report said. The panel faulted the planning between Secret Service and the local law enforcement, and said the Secret Service failed to ask about what was being done to secure the building: 'Relying on a general understanding that ‘the locals have that area covered’ is simply not good enough and, in fact, at Butler this attitude contributed to the security failure.' The panel also cited the fact that there were two separated command posts at the Butler rally: one with various local law enforcement and another with the Secret Service: 'This created, at the highest level, a structural divide in the flow of communications.' There were other communications problems. The Secret Service had to switch radio channels because radio traffic of agents protecting first lady Jill Biden at an event in Pittsburgh was popping up on the channels of agents covering the Butler rally. The panel also noted that all the law enforcement personnel on the ground were using a 'chaotic mixture' of radio, cell phone, text, and e-mail throughout the day to communicate. Also the panel said it was unclear who had ultimate command that day. Cultural issues within the agency The report delved into the agency's culture and painted a picture of an agency struggling to think critically about how it carries out its mission, especially when it comes to protecting Trump. The panel said agency personnel operated under the assumption that they effectively had to 'do more with less.' The report said the additional security measures taken to protect Trump after the Butler shooting should have been taken before. 'To be clear, the Panel did not identify any nefarious or malicious intent behind this phenomenon, but rather an overreliance on assigning personnel based on categories (former, candidate, nominee) instead of an individualized assessment of risk,' the panel wrote. The panel also noted the 'back-and-forth' between the Trump security detail and Secret Service headquarters regarding how many people were needed to protect him. The panel also faulted some of the senior-level staff who were involved in the rally for what they called a 'lack of ownership.' In one example, the panel said a senior agent on site who was tasked with coordinating communications didn't walk around the rally site ahead of timen and did not brief the state police counterpart before the rally about how communications would be managed. It cited the relative inexperience of two specific agents who played a role in security for the July 13 rally. One was the site agent from Trump's detail whose job it was to coordinate with the Pittsburgh field office on security planning for the rally. The panel said the agent graduated from the Secret Service academy in 2020, and had only been on the Trump detail since 2023. Before the Butler rally the agent had only done 'minimal previous site advance work or site security planning.' Another agent assigned to operate a drone detection system had only used the technology at two prior events. What did the panel recommend? Having a unified command post at all large events where Secret Service and other law enforcement representatives are all physically in the same place; overhead surveillance for all outdoor events; security plans must include a way to mitigate line of site concerns out to 1,000 yards and who's in charge at the event; and more training on how to get protectees out of dangerous scenarios. The panel said the agency also needs new, outside leadership and a renewed focus on its core protective mission while expressing skepticism that the agency should continue with the investigations it currently conducts. While the Secret Service is well known for what it does to protect presidents and other dignitaries, it also investigates financial crimes. 'In the Panel’s opinion, it is simply unacceptable for the Service to have anything less than a paramount focus on its protective mission, particularly while that protective mission function is presently suboptimal,' the report said. The panel members were Mark Filip, deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush; David Mitchell, who served in numerous state and local law enforcement roles in Maryland and Delaware; Janet Napolitano, homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama; and Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/ap-panel-looking-into-trump-assassination-attempt-says-secret-service-needs-fundamental-reform/	2024-10-17T05:04:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710fde506f230.58156373.jpeg?w=900
Video: Marshals raid Atlanta mansion occupied by squatters	(NewsNation) — Georgia is cracking down on squatters, fed up with people ignoring property laws. Fulton County marshals raided a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta on Wednesday after a group of squatters showed signs they possibly identified as 'sovereign citizens,' people who believe they are exempt from U.S. law. They allegedly showed up to the property, set up camp and dared anyone to remove them. Menendez family: We suspected abuse from the beginning The video of the raid was posted to social media by the marshal's office. In the video, heavily armed officers swept through the mansion during the early morning raid. At one point, officers even used a drone to ensure the area was secure. NewsNation reached out to the Fulton County Marshal’s Department for comment but has yet to hear back. In July, the Georgia Squatter Reform Act was enacted, stating that squatters caught inside a home will now be cited and given three days to present a lease. If they can't do so, or the lease is found to be a forgery, a misdemeanor charge immediately becomes a felony. The new law also states that it doesn't have to be the property owner who reports the squatters, meaning it could be a neighbor or a homeowners association member who calls the police.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/marshals-raid-atlanta-mansion-squatters/	2024-10-17T04:40:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/image-1.png?w=900
US long-range B-2 stealth bombers target underground bunkers of Y...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels early Thursday, a major escalation in the American response to the rebels' attacks on Mideast shipping lanes that appeared to be a warning to Iran as well. While it wasn't immediately clear how much damage the strikes caused, the attack appeared to be the first use of the B-2 in combat in years and the first time the flying wing targeted sites in Yemen. In announcing the strikes against the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made a point to offer a warning likely heard in Tehran as well. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened or fortified,' Austin said. Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The B-2 would be used in any American attack on hardened Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz or Fordo given it is the only aircraft in service that can drop the GBU-57, known as the 'Massive Ordnance Penetrator.' Iran offered no immediate comment on the strike Thursday. Its foreign minister has been visiting Arab nations ahead of an expected Israeli retaliatory strike over Tehran's Oct. 1 missile assault. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. Austin said the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' Both he and the U.S. military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done. However, Central Command said it believed no civilians had been killed. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion of cargo pass through it yearly. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel and have shot down U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drones. The rebels have threatened new attacks in response to Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon and its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hamas' initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israeli miltary action in the time since has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, hundreds more in the West Bank and over 2,300 people in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the combat edges ever closer to a full-on regional war. The locations named by the Houthis on Thursday correspond to known underground bases operated by the rebels, who have been locked into a stalemated war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 that’s decimated the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthis have refurbished tunnels that once held Scud missiles when Yemen was ruled by strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, according to an analysis in April by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those sites include the al-Hafa and Jebel Attan military bases, the former Presidential House and the Yemen state television compound in Sanaa, analyst Fabian Hinz wrote. The Houthis have built what appears to be their own large-scale tunnel network near Saada as well, Hinz added. 'The fact that the Houthis began constructing major new installations after the agreement of the cease-fire with the Saudi-led coalition suggests that the group is focused on entrenching themselves and bolstering their military capabilities,' he wrote. Iran similarly relies on a network of underground missile bases. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The aircraft are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there, though some B-2s were in Australia in September. The U.S. last used the B-2 in combat in 2017 against Islamic State group targets in Libya, killing more than 80 fighters in a mission defense officials at the time said disrupted possible militant attacks in Europe. The B-2's use in Yemen comes just two days after U.N. Special Envoy Hans Grundberg warned Yemen's frozen war could heat back up given the Mideast wars and the Houthis' taking captive U.N. and aid workers in an internationally criticized crackdown. 'This cycle of retaliation is pulling Yemen deeper into the regional conflict, jeopardizing its hopes for peace and stability,' Grundberg said Tuesday. 'Moreover, it distracts from the urgent need to address Yemen’s own internal crisis.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-us-long-range-b-2-stealth-bombers-target-underground-bunkers-of-yemens-houthi-rebels/	2024-10-17T03:34:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710e79a005580.23710202.jpeg?w=900
Flight attendants in crisis: Stripping, struggling, homeless	(NewsNation) — After a long day assisting travelers on a major airline, a flight attendant by the name of 'Bree' takes off her wedding ring and begins her second shift. 'I am definitely not a girl that you would normally see in a strip club, and I come from a great family. I grew up with a lot of morals, a lot of Christian morals. I have a partner, I have a job,' Bree told NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves. Bree spoke under the condition of anonymity, concerned about keeping her job. After years of flight attending and trying other avenues of earning additional income, like delivering for DoorDash, she says the decision to strip simply came down to 'the need for survival.' 'If you tell somebody that you’re a flight attendant, they normally think you make a lot of money,' said Bree. 'The public looks up to flight attendants, and it’s like you have this glamorous life.' In reality, Bree said, 'You’re dirt poor. You’re very, very poor. So poor, you become a little scrappy. You get paid under $30,000 a year.' ‘Everybody’s angry’: Thousands of autoworkers unemployed Bree said this new line of work has exposed her to a world that was wholly foreign to her before. 'I never saw a pimp before. I never looked at a drug dealer and knew what they did for work before. I never had people asking me for blow jobs, and they would pay $500. I would never get asked all the time if I could go home and have sex with somebody for money. This was not how I grew up. This was not my way of life,' said Bree. She said a constant risk and worry is exposure to fentanyl at the strip club. She said the use of the synthetic opioid was so common among the clientele that she learned to recognize its distinctive scent. 'It smells like peanut butter,' said Bree. 'I carry Narcan with me, just little nasal injections of Narcan, and I told my boss, ‘Just in case anything happens, if you find me on the floor — I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t do drugs — and there’s Narcan in my backpack. That’s what you should treat me with.’' Bree is one of many flight attendants who spoke exclusively with NewsNation for this story, saying they are in crisis, struggling to make ends meet. Kim: Living in a shed with three children Like Bree, 'Kim' also flies with a major airline. She said her passengers would have no idea she lived in a shed with her three children with no running water. One night, she said the temperature fell to minus 20 degrees. Then, the power went out. 'I had taken all my kids basically into bed with me. And I kind of, you know, used hand warmers,' said Kim. ‘'We’re just gonna have a sleepover in mommy’s bed!’ That’s what you can tell them. You can’t say anything else. That was really rough. Actually, that was probably the worst experience of my life.' Like the other flight attendants NewsNation spoke with, Kim said she only gets paid for about half of the hours she actually works. At many airlines, there is no pay for waiting at the gate, during boarding or disembarking. 'In all reality, I’m paid less than a McDonald’s worker,' said Kim. 'You do training for six weeks, and you aren’t paid for any of that. Sometimes, you work 10 1/2-hour days, and you get paid five.' Kim said she had tried to never let the struggle show on her flights. Child care costs more than rent across 100 largest US metros 'People love me. When I get on the plane, I’m super nice, and no one would know anything about me unless I told them because my hair is done, my makeup is done. I have a uniform. I’m smiling, I’m interacting.' Kim has no plans to leave the industry. She described herself as financially 'trapped' due to the fact that she pulled a loan from her 401(k): 'If I were to quit right now, I would have to pay all that back, and it’s money I don’t have.' Kim has managed to provide for her children, moving them into a better living situation as she now looks for a second job on top of flight attending. 'Sometimes, I wish I didn’t wake up in the morning,' she says, but it is her children who keep her going. Nasstasja: Eating leftover passenger meals Nasstasja Lewis told NewsNation she will never forget receiving her first paycheck as a flight attendant for a top airline. 'My paycheck that I got was 250 bucks. And that could only buy probably one trip for me and my son at the grocery store and probably pay a bill that was lingering. So it was really, really hard. Ramen noodles were a thing,' said Lewis. She recalled wondering, ''How am I going to survive for the next month until I get paid again?' It was really, really scary.' Lewis said what attracted her to the job was the appearance of traveling to glamorous destinations and the promise of financial freedom. Instead, in order to prioritize her son, she has resorted at times to eating passengers’ leftover meals. McDonald’s largest fry producer closes factory; CEO blames $5 meals 'You have to just put your pride aside and say, ‘Hey, I have to eat, or I don’t.’ It does make you feel some kind of way during those times because you’re just like, 'What am I doing here?'' said Lewis. On top of the financial hardship, Lewis recalled an incident where she was physically shoved by a passenger. She said she made the decision not to report it. 'We’re already overwhelmed, and I just wanted to go home. It was a long trip. We had delays that day, and we were supposed to be home hours before, so I just took it and swallowed it and got home,' said Lewis. Flight attendant Nasstasja Lewis tells NewsNation she has eaten passengers' leftover meals to make ends meet. (Photo courtesy of Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) Lewis said the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated challenges at the job. During the pandemic, the incidence of depression among cabin crew increased from 8% to 23%. Reports of stress similarly increased from 8% to 24%. Even before the pandemic, flight attendants faced a higher rate of suicide as well as alcoholism. According to the CDC, in 2012, flight attendants were found to have a suicide rate that is 1 1/2 times higher than the general population. Lewis said even as she posted smiling photos showing her job on social media, internally, she struggled with burnout and mental health. 'I experienced suicidal ideation during my time as a fourth, fifth-year flight attendant,' said Lewis. 'Feeling like you don't want to be here anymore. Depression, anxiety, all those things are impacted within this profession, and more needs to be done about it.' If you or someone you know needs help, resources or someone to talk to, you can find it at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website or by calling 1-800-273-8255. People are available to talk to 24/7. Liam: Living in an apartment with 20 flight attendants Liam Horgan is a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines. He has lived on food stamps and in a 'crash pad' with 20 flight attendants in the Bay Area. 'I was paying $455 a month to share a two-bedroom apartment with 20 flight attendants,' said Horgan. 'The amount of things that would pile up, the amount of trash, the amount of bodies. It drops cold at night, but for it to be that cold outside and still be 80 degrees inside the bedroom because there are so many bodies and bunk beds. It was hard.' Liam Horgan, a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines, takes a selfie in an airport. (Photo courtesy of Liam Horgan, AFA union member) Many new hires work 'on reserve,' essentially a system of being on call. They can wait for several days for an assignment. Horgan described picking up as many hours as he could to the extent that 'there were certain months that I would only be home about 3 days a month.' Horgan added he would earn about $2,300 a month before taxes were taken out. 'I don’t think a single person who applied for this job knew what it was going to be like. Because I certainly didn’t know,' said Horgan. Horgan said that when new flight attendants exit training, they are assigned to a base, typically in a city with a high cost of living like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York or Washington, D.C. Rent has risen faster than wages in most US cities Horgan said it made an impression when management at his new base explained how he could apply for food stamps. 'I just feel like it’s kind of embarrassing that corporate greed has gotten to the point that management at these corporations are telling new hires, 'Hey, we know we don’t pay you a living wage, so here’s how you can apply for welfare,'' said Horgan. 'This is a career. This is not just starting out at an entry-level job.' Horgan said he had no concept of the extent of the mental health struggle he’d witness in his colleagues. One of the flight attendants he lived with in a crash pad attempted suicide. 'There’ve been a lot of mental health issues with a lot of flight attendants, especially new hires,' said Horgan. 'I’ve felt the pressure of it myself. There have been nights that I’ve sat in bed, almost crying myself to sleep, because I’m like, ‘What am I doing with my life?’ I was working retail, and I was not struggling to make ends meet like I am right now.' Flight attendant union president: 'They can’t survive' 'A week doesn’t go by that I don’t hear another heartbreaking story from a flight attendant, and it’s from every single base,' said Ken Diaz, United AFA Union president. Diaz described hearing reports of flight attendants all over the country experiencing 'bankruptcies, going through their life savings, taking loans against their 401(k)s. Some are living in their cars, credit cards to the max, marriages breaking up over financial debt. My heart breaks for them because it shouldn’t be this way. It shouldn’t.' The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) is the country’s largest flight attendants union.Diaz said he has been unable to reach an agreement with United after three years of negotiations. 'They’re asking for concessions during a time when they’re making billions in profits, billions,' said Diaz. United CEO Scott Kirby made nearly $19 million in 2023. 'We got these airlines through some difficult times. Whether it be bankruptcies during the eighties to the pandemic. We helped them get the government loans that allowed them to survive, and then, they just forgot about us afterward,' said Diaz. The median pay for flight attendants in 2023 was roughly $68,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Diaz said that new hire pay is projected to be much lower. 'It was always tough in the past, but no one’s ever experienced the cost of living like it is today. And when you put that wage rate in today’s cost of living, it’s nothing. They can’t survive,' said Diaz. Flight attendants ‘fed up’ over stagnant wages: Union leader The AFA told NewsNation first-year flight attendants can expect to make about $23,000 at Frontier; $25,000 at Alaska Airlines; $26,000 at United Airlines; $31,000 at American Airlines; and $32,000 at Delta Air Lines. 'When people see the actual wage rate, they say, ‘Oh, those are good.’ What they don’t realize is United flight attendants do not get paid until that aircraft starts moving back from the gate. So the time they check in, the safety checks, in between flights, all of that is unpaid for. You’re only paid almost for half the time that you’re at work,' said Diaz. 'The morale is at the lowest point I have ever seen morale at United Airlines in the 28 years I’ve been here.' NewsNation reached out to United Airlines. It did not respond. Alaska Airlines provided this statement: 'Our goal is always to provide our flight attendants and employees with market-competitive wages and benefits. We appreciate how financially challenging the beginning of any career path can be and it’s one of the reasons we are so anxious to get a contract in place so our flight attendants can start benefiting from increased wages and improved benefits.' Flight attendants helping one another Thresia Raynor has been a flight attendant with Alaska Airlines for almost 17 years. She said she only realized how many of her colleagues were homeless when she’d offer to drive them home after a flight, only to find their 'home' was a car on the side of the road. 'Every day at my job, I have to drop off a girl from a trip who has no car and transportation to a place of homelessness, or take her to a car where she lives, or quite often share meals with her at work because she has no food and no money for food. That’s what I experience quite often in my job,' said Raynor. She cofounded a Facebook group called 'Alaska Airlines Flight Attendants Experiencing Hunger and Homelessness' and did not expect the response. Flight attendant Thresia Raynor was amazed by the response to the Facebook group she made to support her struggling peers.

(Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy)A message from a struggling flight attendant sent to the th|AIR|apy advocacy group. (Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) 'Overnight, it was over a thousand members,' said Raynor. 'We just had no idea that there is that many people struggling. We wanted them to have a safe place to come and talk and be heard and just to scrape away all that shame and embarrassment. To have people come forward and talk about where they park their cars at night to sleep, how they go to back alleys in the back of restaurants. People sharing how they survive homeless and hungry.' Nastassja Lewis also turned her personal experience into the nonprofit Th|AIR|apy, which focuses on flight attendant mental health. It has grown to more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. Lewis said it provides an emergency crisis line that is used every single day. 'When you’re getting messages from your peers saying, ‘Thank you for this. It’s keeping me going,’ or ‘Thank you, I really needed someone to talk to at 2:30 in the morning, and you were here for me,' said Lewis, 'it lets me know the work we’re doing is really vital.' Bree: 'I don’t have a lot to show for it' Bree said as dangerous as working at the strip club can be, there is an unfamiliar feeling — a flood of financial relief — that she hasn’t felt in her years of flight attending. She said at the strip club, she could earn roughly $300 to $1,000 a night. 'When I would take home money at the end of the night, I would sit down on the floor, and I would just count it because I need to make sure that the time I put in was worth it,' said Bree. 'It feels good to finish a job in one day and be like, ‘Okay, I made rent,’ and then the next day, ‘Okay, I paid for all of our groceries.’' Bree described herself as 'resilient' and 'optimistic.' She said this has also been a time of taking stock. Bree is now several years into embarking on the 'dream' of flight attending. 'I’m a good employee. Any job that I’ve had, I’ve gone up the ranks quickly. I’m a hard worker. And I’m creative, I’m kind. I feel like I’ve been working so hard. And I don’t know, I don’t have a lot to show for it. I don’t even have my own car. I sold my truck to help pay for flight attending,' said Bree. When asked if she would recommend being a flight attendant, she hesitated. 'I did not realize how little I’d be getting paid. I’ve been poor before; this was a new level of stress. People selling their eggs or becoming sperm donors, flight attendant groups recommending selling your plasma if you have a longer layover in a certain city. We are literally trying to find parts of our body that will produce money. I don’t think it should be like this in this country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/going-broke-flight-attendant-strips-on-the-side-to-survive/	2024-10-17T03:24:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/A234D08CA7C21AC04ACF8D5DEF51AC89.jpg?w=900
Vance says 'no' when asked whether Trump lost 2020 election	In the months since he became Donald Trump ’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance has repeatedly deflected questions about whether the Republican presidential nominee lost the 2020 election, saying he was focused on the future. During a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, where Vance was asked by a reporter about his lack of straight answers so far, he was more declarative. 'What message do you think it sends to independent voters when you do not directly answer the question ‘Did Donald Trump lose in 2020?’' the reporter asked, eliciting boos from the crowd before Vance responded, saying he has answered the question 'a million times.' 'No. I think there were serious problems in 2020,' Vance said. 'So, did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use, OK?' The answer was the most specific Vance has been on the subject, and a departure from the series of evasions he has offered about the election Trump continues to say without evidence was decided fraudulently in favor of Democrat Joe Biden. During a debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz this month, Vance was asked about the 2020 election but responded that he was 'focused on the future.' Vance’s refusal to say whether Trump lost was widely considered his weakest debate moment with Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who called the response 'a damning non-answer.' The campaign for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris quickly turned the exchange into a television ad. During an interview with The New York Times, Vance refused five times to acknowledge Biden won. Trump's continued denial that he lost the election to Biden is a widely held opinion among the Republican's base of supporters. He warned an audience in Nevada last week, 'We never want to have happen what happened in 2020.' Trump has continued to say without evidence that he expects his opponents to 'cheat' in the 2024 election and has urged his supporters to turn out in numbers to make his vote tally 'too big to rig.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-vance-says-no-when-asked-whether-trump-lost-2020-election/	2024-10-16T19:44:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67107aa1e62a12.77687679.jpeg?w=900
One Direction singer Liam Payne found dead in Buenos Aires: Repor...	(NewsNation) — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement Payne, 31, fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had thrown himself from the balcony of his room.' He said police were dispatched to the hotel in response to an emergency call about an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' Arriving police heard a thud and found Payne’s body in the hotel courtyard, Policicchio said. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, said on Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. He declined to answer further questions about the incident, including whether Payne jumped from the balcony or fell by accident. Florida continues building in high-risk areas Payne reunited with One Direction in Argentina earlier this month for a Niall Horan concert, according to Teen Vogue. He was one of five band members of One Direction, which formed in 2010 when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor.' After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful.' They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016. They had a loyal fan base, many of whom were teen girls, who became known as 'Directioners.' Once the group disbanded, Payne pursued a solo career, putting out the album 'LP1' in 2019. His last release was a single called 'Teardrops' in March. In 2021, Payne said he had problems with addiction and mental health during his One Direction fame. 'It was really, really, really severe. It was a problem,' Payne told 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast host Steven Bartlett. He said his early boy band days were filled with 'pills and booze' and 'moments of suicidal ideation.' One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the street as police stood sentinel outside. Young women at the scene expressed shock and heartbreak. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told The Associated Press. Video showed dozens gathered on the cordoned-off street outside the hotel, with many recording videos on their cellphones. A forensic investigator was seen exiting the hotel, where Payne’s body remained Wednesday evening. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/one-direction-singer-liam-payne-found-dead-in-buenos-aires-report/	2024-10-16T14:41:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/gettyimages-1134037682-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
One Direction singer Liam Payne found dead in Buenos Aires: Repor...	Oct 16 (Reuters) - Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local newspaper La Nacion reported on Wednesday. The 31-year-old British musician was found dead after falling from the hotel's third floor, it said, citing emergency services. Several witnesses at the hotel told TMZ Payne fell from his room at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel. It's unclear if the fall was intentional or accidental. Witnesses say Payne 'had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier,' according to TMZ. He reportedly smashed his laptop and had to be carried back to his room.

Payne joined One Direction when he was 16. The group became the biggest boyband in the world after its 2010 launch on 'The X Factor' before ultimately breaking up in 2015. In 2021, Payne revealed that he struggled with addiction and mental health during his One Direction fame. 'It was really, really, really severe. It was a problem,' Payne told 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast host Steven Bartlett. He said his early boy band days were filled with 'pills and booze' and 'moments of suicidal ideation.'

FEMA leader: Misinformation about hurricane operations must stop	(NewsNation) — The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) now has four disaster recovery centers in western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. FEMA says it has approved disaster assistance for more than 75,000 households, but there is a lot of confusion regarding FEMA, militia groups and hurricane recovery in the state. Over the weekend, national media outlets reported on threats from armed militias to FEMA, causing them to temporarily pause work in North Carolina. Efforts have since resumed. One North Carolina resident, William Parsons, was arrested after posting a message on Facebook calling for people to 'overtake' the FEMA site in Lake Lure, claiming that the agency was withholding supplies from hurricane survivors. Parsons said after his arrest that the law enforcement agents who arrested him were lying. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'They want to sit here and lie and say I was carrying guns around. I had one gun on me, which was legally owned and sitting on the side of my hip, and I had a rifle and another pistol that were in my vehicle that were both lawful and legal to own,' Parsons said. Last Saturday in Carter County, Tennesee, which was also hit by the hurricane, volunteers with the International Alliance of Community Chaplains witnessed a group of people confronting and threatening FEMA workers, NewsNation local affiliate WJHL reported. Tracy Elder, president and founder of the International Alliance of Community Chaplains, said the people who confronted the FEMA workers were armed but didn't have their guns drawn. 'They had surrounded them, and there was a lady there that was yelling and threatening them,' Elder said. FEMA says they made operational changes to keep personnel safe. Deanne Criswell, FEMA's administrator, had a very specific message Tuesday. Group associated with polygamous sect builds fences on US Forest Service lands 'The ongoing spread of misinformation about operations is not OK. It has got to stop,' Criswell said. 'The federal family has been here, working side by side with the state since Day 1. These are people who put their lives on hold to help those who have lost everything.' Adam Smith, who leads a volunteer organization called Savage OPs, which is made up of special operations forces, nurse practitioners and civil engineers who help with hurricane recovery efforts, says the rumors about armed militias are directed at groups like theirs. Smith, a former Green Beret, said those threats are hurting their ability to get aid into the community. 'Misinformation is not coming from the ground up. I think the misinformation is coming from the top of FEMA down,' Smith said. 'When you have contractors that are afraid to go out into the areas they are supposed to work, and they are saying you have to carry, and you have to pack, you know, watch out people are going to come after you, not true — the people in the mountains might be suspicious of the government in general, but they are the most welcoming people you could possibly imagine.' Smith says they aren’t going anywhere and just want to help and support the community. 'The conversations that we've had with county state officials as well as National Guard personnel (is like), 'Hey, there's going to be a point when the transition happens, when the National Guard has to demobilize, when the 101st has to the mobilize,'' Smith said. 'And when that transition happens, we're not going to have those forces in the area and we're going to still be here. Moreover, we've we've been told, 'Hey, keep doing what you're doing.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/fema-leader-misinformation-hurricane-operations/	2024-10-16T12:33:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175616737-1-1.jpg?w=900
Florida continues building in high-risk areas	(NewsNation) — One week since Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida cleanup efforts are underway, and so is new construction. New data shows tens of thousands of new properties have been built in high-risk flood areas despite the growing risk of destructive hurricanes. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said hurricanes will not weaken the demand for homes on Florida's Gulf Coast because there's always going to be a demand to live in beautiful places. Hurricane fallout threatens to hinder voting More than 16 million people in Florida currently live in coastal counties and that number continues to go up despite the risks of hurricanes and flooding. Climate modeling firm First Street Foundation told NewsNation that real estate developers have actually built 77,000 new properties in high-risk flood areas since 2019. That's the highest number in the nation. Nationally, close to 300,000 new properties were built in high-risk flood areas between 2019 and 2023, a number that has been concerning for disaster-risk experts who say that in many states, it would only take one good-sized hurricane to break the entire insurance system. 'We got to a situation in our country that, while we don't lose as many lives in storms, our losses are rising because we have more people coming to the coast and we have therefore grown our exposure to these storms,' said Tracy Kijewski-Correa, a disaster-risk reduction specialist. 'We have a climate that's changing, that's going to be, regrettably, the perfect storm.' Kijewski-Correa said that while Helene was an outlier in terms of lives lost, the property damage from hurricanes could lead to some major changes. to insurance. Retired therapy dog goes back to work after Hurricane Milton 'That is probably going to require us to reimagine insurance, maybe in painful ways, and to start having more candid discussions about retreat,' she said. 'Because there will be, for some families, very little possibility of ensuring or building to withstand what might be coming.' The Federal Emergency Management Agency recently looked at what are called severe, repetitive lost properties, a designation that covers homes that have severely flooded more than once. The agency found that there are 45,000 of those properties in the U.S. at the end of 2022, with about 3,100 of those in Florida alone. Ratings for Morningstar DBRS said, in a report released this week, that it expects Hurricane Milton to be among the top five costliest natural catastrophes in the U.S., with insured losses approaching $60 billion. Experts warn we are entering a difficult situation with the insurance industry across the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, saying we need to build better before storms hit to mitigate the toll of damage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-building-high-risk/	2024-10-16T11:58:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177760605.jpg?w=900
