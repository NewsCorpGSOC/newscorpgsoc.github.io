Plane burst into flames after skidding off runway at an airport i...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A plane burst into flames after veering off a runway at an airport in South Korea on Sunday, killing at least 28 people on board, emergency officials said. The fire engulfed the aircraft carrying 181 people when it skidded off the runway just after landing and struck a barrier. The country's emergency office said its landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned. Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. The transport ministry said the incident happened at 9:03 a.m. local time. The National Fire Agency said the fire was almost put out but officials were still trying to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane at the airport in the southern town of Muan. At least 28 people had died in the fire, the agency said. Emergency workers pulled out two people — one passenger and one crew member. It said it deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire. Emergency officials said they were examining the cause of the fire. Local TV stations aired footage showing thick pillows of black smoke billowing from the plane engulfed with flame. The incident came as South Korea is embroiled into a huge political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment. Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, making Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over. Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-south-korean-media-report-28-people-dead-after-a-plane-catches-fire-at-an-airport/	2024-12-28T18:26:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6770b3eaae0256.64581136.jpeg?w=900
UnitedHealthcare taught us ways to deny claims: Former employee	(NewsNation) — A former UnitedHealthcare claims representative says employees were systematically trained to deny medical claims and rush distressed customers off phone lines, revealing internal practices at the nation's largest health insurer amid growing scrutiny of the industry. Natalie Collins, who worked for UnitedHealthcare for nine months, said Saturday on 'NewsNation Prime' that staff received 'so many different ways to deny' claims during their two to three months of training, with supervisors often standing behind representatives instructing them on denial methods. 'We weren't given proper instruction to actually pay the claim, and there wasn't enough monies in certain files in certain companies to pay medical claims,' Collins said. 'We would have to just get the client off the phone as fast as we could.' Health insurance ‘delay tactic’ is too common: Former Cigna executive Collins described crying at her desk while handling calls from desperate patients, as supervisors laughed. Collins, now the owner of 'Mother's Keeper Doula,' quit her position after attempting to approve payment for a widowed mother of five whose husband died of pancreatic cancer, saying supervisors had instructed her to deny the hospice claim and get the caller 'off our phone line.' 'They just wouldn't allow me to submit the claim. There would be alerts on each claim telling us that either we had to put it back in our queue and it would just go to someone else, 30 days later, 60 days later,' Collins said. Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to state murder Collins' experience comes after accused UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to murder and terror charges in New York State Court. Public support for Mangione has grown, with his legal defense fund reaching $250,000 in donations. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting 'It's all about your employer and who they are negotiating with to get their employees the best health coverage,' Collins said when asked what she wanted the public to know. A recent poll found that about seven in 10 adults believe insurance company denials and profits bear at least moderate responsibility for CEO Brian Thompson's death. Collins said that while she understands public anger, she condemns violence. 'We the people are sick and tired,' Collins said. 'I don't believe anyone should die ... but people are angry. People have reasons to be very angry, and I feel that to my bones. I've seen it, I lived it, I processed them and I denied them.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/unitedhealthcare-ways-deny-claims-former-employee/	2024-12-28T18:07:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/B6E2BB6B39BF576D8A806AAA0CC58447.jpg?w=900
Trump weighs in on H-1B debate, backs immigration visas	President-elect Trump backed immigration visas for highly-skilled workers as the program has been in the spotlight after Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy faced backlash within the Republican leader's base for signaling their support for the H-1B work visa, which has been criticized as too complicated and susceptible to abuse. 'I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,' Trump said in a phone interview with The New York Post published Saturday. 'I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,' he added, as reported by the NY Post. Trump's support for the program comes as two of his key allies set to run the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk and Ramaswamy, have faced heightened scrutiny on Musk's social platform X from some in the GOP, including far-right activist Laura Loomer and other hard-line anti-immigration Republicans. More battles over transgender rights await Supreme Court The dispute further escalated late Friday night after Musk pledged to 'go to war' over the issue in a post on X. 'The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,' he wrote in the post. 'I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,' he added. The debate appeared to originate from a suggestion last month from Sriram Krishnan, Trump’s pick for White House policy adviser on artificial intelligence, that Musk examine removing caps on green cards for skilled immigrants. Krishnan’s comments resurfaced in recent days after he was appointed by Trump to serve in his incoming administration. The dispute also comes as the Biden administration announced a rule earlier this month clarifying who can apply for the visas, which followed years of lobbying for a more streamlined H-1B process. Some democratic lawmakers previously called on the Biden administration to address gaps in the immigration system to prepare for the incoming Trump administration’s expected crackdown on immigration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-weighs-in-on-h-1b-debate-backs-immigration-visas/	2024-12-28T14:35:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24308063014128-e1734698903451.jpg?w=900
Trump applauds blocked sale of Texas border wall materials	President-elect Trump celebrated the blocked sale of border wall materials following a Friday ruling from a federal judge in Texas. The incoming president, in a Saturday Truth Social post, called the ruling a 'major, crucial WIN for America,' calling out President Biden and 'his cronies' for seeking to stall the construction of the border wall, which was a central piece of Trump's first administration. 'The Judge has also ordered an investigation into the illegal selling of the materials, which will expose just how corrupt and anti-American Radical Democrats are,' he added. The effort, led in part by the state’s Attorney General Ken Paxton, began amid reports the Biden administration was selling the parts. Last week, Trump asked a Texas court to intervene. Trump weighs in on H-1B debate, backs immigration visas But Congress required the Biden administration to dispose of the materials. The measure, included in the National Defense Authorization Act, allows the sale of items if they are used to repair existing barriers and not install new ones. Friday's ruling prohibits the sale of any materials intended for border wall, which Trump says he is 'going to rebuild in order to protect our Country from violent migrant crime, fentanyl smuggling, sex trafficking, terror attacks, and other heinous, Nation ending disasters,' over the next 30 days. Trump first suggested a structure be erected along the United States to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country during his first campaign for the presidency. Although Trump campaigned on the notion that Mexico would fund the wall, the neighboring country never cut a formal check for the partition. At the end of Trump's first term, 694 miles of primary barriers were put in place, according to U.S. Customs and Border patrol. More battles over transgender rights await Supreme Court Texas, per the ruling, is also entitled to documentation that proves that the Biden administration has not disposed of border wall materials, which would violate an injunction from Paxton earlier this year that required the Biden Administration to spend statutorily obligated funds on building the wall. 'This follows our major victory forcing Biden to build the wall, and we will hold his Administration accountable for illegally subverting our Nation’s border security until their very last day in power, especially where their actions are clearly motivated by a desire to thwart President-elect Trump’s immigration agenda,' Paxton wrote in the release. Republicans made border security a prominent theme in the 2024 election cycle which helped propel the party to victory, gaining a trifecta in Washington. Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation in the country’s history and hammer down ambitious immigration policies when he returns to office, with the help of 'border czar' Tom Homan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-applauds-blocked-sale-of-texas-border-wall-materials/	2024-12-28T14:32:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/TrumpDonald_MaraLago2_121624_APPhotoEvan-Vucci_e09620.jpg?w=900

Trump asks Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban so he can 'negotiate...	President-elect Trump asked the Supreme Court to delay the deadline for a potential TikTok ban, which is slated for the day before his inauguration. The court has agreed to hear TikTok’s challenge to the potential ban on an expedited schedule, but Trump told the justices that delaying the law until he returns to the White House could obviate the need for the court to weigh in. 'President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns,' wrote D. John Sauer, one of Trump’s personal appellate attorneys. Sauer is Trump’s nominee for U.S. solicitor general, which would have him take over managing the government’s defense of the ban from the Biden administration. 'In light of these interests—including, most importantly, his overarching responsibility for the United States’ national security and foreign policy—President Trump opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture, and seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office,' Sauer wrote. During the campaign, Trump voiced opposition to the law, which requires TikTok’s China-based parent company to divest from the app or face a ban by Jan. 19, and vowed to 'save TikTok.' However, the president-elect has offered few details about his plans to protect the app since winning the election. TikTok has noted the president-elect's sympathies in its legal arguments, suggesting the trajectory could change once he takes office. The new brief repeatedly touts Trump’s unique interest, calling him 'one of the most powerful, prolific, and influential users of social media in history' and noting his social media platform, Truth Social. 'Indeed, President Trump’s first Term was highlighted by a series of policy triumphs achieved through historic deals, and he has a great prospect of success in this latest national security and foreign policy endeavor,' Sauer wrote. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Jan. 10 on TikTok’s First Amendment challenge to the new law, giving the justices an opportunity to weigh in before the ban potentially goes into effect. Trump said he takes no position on the merits of the First Amendment issue but called it a 'historically challenging' question.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-delay-tiktok-ban-so-he-can-negotiate-a-resolution-to-save-the-platform/	2024-12-27T15:58:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Top-Trump_122224_AP_Rick-Scuteri.jpg?w=900
Border czar vows to 'target' Tren de Aragua gang	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump’s new border czar, Tom Homan, tells NewsNation’s Ali Bradley criminal gangs like Tren de Aragua will be his 'priority target,' and he will root them out once he takes office. 'We've been saying from Day 1 that the priority right out of the gate is public safety threats and national security threats. Tren de Aragua is a public safety threat,' Homan said. 'They have proven that they're in at least 16 states across this country, and they'll be a priority.' Tren de Aragua is a gang that started in a prison in the Venezuelan state of Aragua nearly a decade ago. It’s since expanded into what the Justice Department calls a 'transnational criminal organization.' The gang has spread to 16 U.S. states, according to a New York Post report citing an internal Department of Homeland Security memo. The Venezuelan gang is the fastest-growing transnational criminal organization, in part because the U.S. government cannot track criminal records in Venezuela. As such, members of the gang are more easily able to blend in with law-abiding migrants. What is the Tren de Aragua gang, linked to several crimes in US? In Colorado, Aurora police have acknowledged that 'components of Tren de Aragua' are operating in the area and have identified at least 10 known members. Homan vowed to 'remove them' and says he’s been working with state and law enforcement to monitor the gang’s activity. 'We'll be attacking Tren de Aragua right where they operate, where they live, and we're going to put them in detention,' he said. For the gang members who are applying for asylum, Homan said he will be putting on strict conditions of release. 'Participating in gang activity is a violation of conditions of release, so at a minimum, we want to take them back into custody,' he said. Tren de Aragua gang member arrested in El Paso Homan blamed President Joe Biden’s border policies as the reason why the U.S. hasn't been able to force Venezuela to take the gang members back, but that will all change under Trump, he said. 'Starting January 20, we'll have a very strong America-first president who's going to negotiate, if he needs to negotiate, or simply make these countries do what they should do,' Homan said. 'In the small chance they won't take them back, then we'll send them to other countries,' he said, adding that he is already in talks with several countries willing to take the gang members.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-czar-vows-to-target-tren-de-aragua-gang/	2024-12-27T15:45:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Gateway-hotel.png?w=900
Requiring federal workers to return to office will be hard: Comer	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has warned federal employees who have been working on a remote basis that if they want to keep their jobs, they will need to return to their given office spaces. However, forcing government employees back into the office may not be as easy as threatening them with termination, a Republican lawmaker tells NewsNation. U.S. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said he anticipates that as the newly formed Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) prepares to tackle government waste, a downsizing of the federal workforce may be required. Trump’s campaign promise to force federal workers back to the office comes at a time when 17 of the 24 federal office buildings in Washington are at 25% capacity or less, according to a report released by the Government Accountability Office in the fall of 2023. Trump ‘border czar’ says he will override sanctuary city roadblocks The study found that the government spends an estimated $2 billion per year maintaining the office space and an additional $5 billion per year to lease it. However, as Trump pushes to force workers back into the office, Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told NewsNation that many government employee contracts include clauses that allow for remote work on a hybrid or full-time basis. Trump said earlier this month that he plans to do away with a waiver that he said President Joe Biden provided federal employees to work from home. He said that if needed, his administration would fight the waiver in court to force workers back to the office. 'If people don't want to come back to work, come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed,' Trump said. Comer told NewsNation that enforcing such a threat won't come without a legal challenge from the unions representing federal employees. More Americans say they need a break from political news: Survey 'This will probably head to court. But in the court of public opinion, I think the people that work hard every day and have to go to work and pay taxes, I don't think they're very happy with the fact that such a high percentage of the federal workforce is working from home,' Comer told NewsNation. 'And they're not held accountable like the employees who work for the federal government, who have to go to the office every day.' Although the government is spending billions each year on physical office space, experts maintain that the solution DOGE is seeking doesn't come by filling government-leased buildings with federal employees. Comey told NewsNation that in addition to closing down excessive federal offices, more attention needs to be paid to the workforce itself. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been tasked with heading up DOGE, have suggested that they would like to eliminate 25% of the federal workforce. However, Comer, who believes employees are more responsive and efficient in the office than they are from home, says that rather than eliminating jobs, the priority should be determining what government employees actually do. The New York Times reported that of the 2.3 million civilian workers working for the government in May, 1.1 million were eligible for telework, and about 228,000 were eligible for entirely remote work. 'Some of them haven't been seen since prior to COVID,' Comer said. 'We've got to bring them back, and I would like for every employee to have to explain to some competent person exactly what their job entails and what their day looks like working from home.' As DOGE prepares to get to work, Comer said that federal officials need to find a balance when it comes to what the work environment for many of these government employees looks like. 'The bottom line is, we have too many federal employees, the taxpayers cannot continue to pay them good federal benefits: the long-term pensions, the long-term health insurance, in addition to the just the everyday payroll,' Comer told NewsNation. 'The taxpayers cannot put this burden anymore, and we're going to have to get more efficient.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-rto-fight-comer/	2024-12-27T12:20:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Congress-Comer_061124_AP_J.-Scott-Applewhite.jpg?w=900
Man charged in fatal burning of woman on NYC subway to be in cour...	(NewsNation) — The man charged in the killing of a woman who was burned alive as she slept on a New York City subway train is due in court Friday. As Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is set to appear before a grand jury, there are still more questions than answers about the victim in this case. The New York Police Department is still trying to figure out the woman's identity. Authorities say Zapeta-Calil approached the woman on the subway and lit her clothing on fire. Zapeta-Calil then fanned the flames using a shirt, prosecutors said. Tiny homes at risk of being stolen: Report The 33-year-old from Guatemala was arraigned on murder and arson charges Tuesday. In court, he stood before the judge in a white jumpsuit and black hoodie. Zapeta-Calil did not speak and was surrounded by a dozen NYPD officers the entire time. The crime was caught on camera. Body-worn cameras on responding officers caught the suspect's face and his image was blasted on social media. Three teenagers in a different part of the city recognized him and called the police. Video footage shows an NYPD patrolman passing the scene casually. At one point, someone appears with a blanket to fan the flames, while another person is filming. At the time of the incident, Zapeta-Calil was living at a homeless shelter that provides outpatient services for substance abuse and mental health. A source close to the investigation tells NewsNation that Zapeta-Calil's attorney wanted his client to have a psychiatric evaluation, possibly setting the stage for an insanity defense. Federal immigration officials said Zapeta-Calil entered the U.S. illegally. He has been jailed at New York City's Rikers Island complex. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/man-charged-fatal-burning-woman-nyc-subway-in-court/	2024-12-27T05:41:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24359026391033.jpg?w=900
Trump 'border czar' says he will override sanctuary city roadbloc...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's incoming 'border czar' told NewsNation the administration will aggressively enforce immigration laws in sanctuary cities and may seek prosecution of officials who 'knowingly harbor' undocumented immigrants. 'Sanctuary jurisdictions aren't going to stop what we're going to do,' Tom Homan said in a NewsNation interview Thursday. 'If they don't want to protect their communities, then the Trump administration will.' Homan said immigration officers would focus on 'public safety threats' and emphasized that sanctuary jurisdictions could face legal consequences if they actively interfere with federal enforcement efforts. No ‘price tag’ for mass deportations, says incoming border czar 'They can stand by and watch us do it, but they cannot impede us,' Homan said. 'They cannot knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal from ICE. Those are crimes.' He warned that forcing immigration agents to make arrests in communities rather than jails would likely result in more 'collateral arrests' of undocumented immigrants who are not primary targets. Regarding sensitive locations such as churches and hospitals traditionally considered off-limits to immigration enforcement, Homan indicated the policy is under review. He said there are already exceptions for 'significant public safety threats' or national security issues. Homan dismissed sanctuary city officials' claims that their policies help protect crime victims and witnesses, calling it 'a stone-cold lie.' 'The victims and witnesses of crime certainly don't want the bad guy released back into their neighborhood,' he said. Republican strategist Katie Frost said that given the crisis along the U.S. southern border, 'all options need to be on the table' when it comes to enforcement. 'We have to do whatever is necessary to find people who broke our laws, came into this country illegally and have overstayed their visas, ' Frost told NewsNation. Russia suspected in Azerbaijan Airlines crash; black boxes recovered Frost pointed to the case of the woman who was set on fire on a New York City subway by a man that police said entered the U.S. illegally. She said that the question that has to be answered is, 'When is enough be enough?' Frost said that one of the reasons Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in November was because Americans are sick of how the Biden administration has handled securing the southern border. However, Democratic strategist David Carlucci, says that the details of how the incoming Trump administration handles mass deportations become a critical part of the issue. Carlucci told NewsNation that based on what he has heard from Homan, the 'border czar' does not have a concrete plan for carrying out mass deportations. Instead, Carlucci believes Homan just going to try to catch illegal immigrants. He said Homan needs to specify how he plans to carry out zeroing in on convicted criminals who entered the country illegally as he proposed when he first announced mass deportations. Homan said that if illegal immigrants who do not have criminal convictions are found with those who do, they run the risk of being arrested. Carlucci said that could have dangerous ramifications. 'Is this going to be some sort of government state where we'll all be questioned and audited for harboring illegal immigrants?' Carlucci said. 'At what ends do we go to? The incoming Trump administration should be working with local officials instead of trying to make some sort of scapegoat.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/tom-homan-override-sanctuary-city-roadblocks/	2024-12-27T05:10:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/videoframe_2526.png?w=800
Average mortgage rates close 2024 at the highest since July	(NewsNation) — Average mortgage rates will end the year on a high note — financially. This week, the housing market saw its highest 30-year mortgage rate since July at 6.85%, according to data from Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. That's up from last week and up from 6.61% during the same time last year. 'While a slight improvement in new and existing home sales is encouraging, the market remains plagued by an overwhelming undersupply of homes,' said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a news release. 'A strong economy can help build momentum heading into the new year and potentially boost purchase activity.' Tiny homes at risk of being stolen: Report The 15-year mortgage rates also climbed from 5.92% last week to 6% this week. These mortgage rates come after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week. Now, market players are looking to see how next year plays out with President-elect Donald Trump's policy initiatives and how they will impact inflation, and in turn, mortgage rates.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/average-mortgage-rates-increased-december-2024/	2024-12-27T04:20:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673f4ed67b4342.65100526.jpeg?w=900
Jackpot for Mega Millions over $1 billion after no numbers match ...	Hang onto those stocking-stuffer lottery tickets. The Mega Millions jackpot has surpassed $1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers drawn on Christmas Eve. That means the estimated jackpot for Friday's drawing is $1.15 billion, potentially the fifth-largest jackpot in the game's history. 'We know that many people will likely receive tickets to Friday’s drawing as holiday gifts, and what a gift that would turn out to be if you ended up with a ticket worth a $1.15 billion jackpot,' Joshua Johnston, lead director for the Mega Millions Consortium said in a Wednesday statement. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350, while the odds of winning any Mega Millions prize are 1 in 24, according to lottery officials. Tickets for the game are sold in 45 states, along with Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions tickets are $2 a piece. Half of the proceeds from the sale of each ticket remains in the state where the ticket was sold. Drawings are held at 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesdays and Fridays. 'I can’t think of a better way to celebrate the holidays – whether Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, the Winter Solstice, or any other way people choose to celebrate the season – than by helping fulfill the dreams that come with a prize like this and prizes that will be won at all levels of the game,' Johnston said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/mega-millions-jackpot-1-billion-no-christmas-eve-wins/	2024-12-27T03:03:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1297834427-1-3.jpg?w=900
NewsNation kept a wide lens on the border crisis in 2024	(NewsNation) — One of the most important issues to Americans on both sides of the aisle has been the ongoing immigration crisis, and NewsNation has been there every step of the way in 2024, highlighting not only the plight of migrants coming to the U.S. but the challenges this posed to Border Patrol and state officials. Over the last four years, the U.S. has seen the largest immigration surge in history, averaging more than 2 million migrants a year from all around the world in search of the American dream. 2024 began with more controversial moves by GOP Texas Governor Greg Abbott to relieve some of the burden placed on cities in his state by transporting migrants to sanctuary cities like Washington, DC, New York, Chicago and Denver. The standoff between state and federal reach on immigration continued in the courts, where NewsNation covered several lawsuits between the two. The Justice Department sued Texas, claiming the state's new immigration law violated the Constitution. Who is Trump’s new border czar Tom Homan? A federal judge blocked that law, but the state would ultimately be the victor and start arresting on the state level for criminal trespass. This also came as the Biden administration was told by the Supreme Court that it could take down razor wire installed by Texas that was meant to keep migrants out. The situation reached a fever pitch in March when more than 400 migrants tore down razor fencing during a riot on the border town of El Paso. Several Texas National Guard members were injured, and roughly 200 migrants were arrested. Drones, wire walls, buoys and pepper balls were all utilized by border control to fight illegal entry. But it wasn’t always effective. NewsNation was there to capture exclusive video of smugglers destroying barbed wire fencing to get migrants across the border. The fight to control the border was made harder by the cartel. Crime exploded as groups of masked gunmen kidnapped migrants, participated in human trafficking and transported guns and drugs across the border, including deadly fentanyl. NewsNation exclusively uncovered the amazing story of a teen who barely escaped capture by the cartel. The violence played out in U.S. border towns before moving north. NewsNation closely followed a brutal attack on New York police officers by a group of migrants with a notorious Venezuelan gang. ‘High volume’ scanning system going up at Texas border crossing NewsNation got an exclusive look into the dangers border agents face hunting down migrant smugglers. A ride-along showed how Border Patrol agents are tackling the trafficking of illicit drugs in El Centro, California, which has become a drug smuggling hotspot. The network closely reported on the murder of a 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, who was killed while jogging on the university’s campus by Jose Ibarra, who entered the U.S. illegally in September 2022. The team followed the highly emotional trial and eventual conviction of Ibarra, which brought even more attention to the debate over border laws. NewsNation was there as the 'take our border back convoys, also known as 'God's Army,' made their way to the southern border stopping in Virginia, Florida and Louisiana, before arriving at Texas to raise awareness about the crisis on the border.' President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to take a zero-tolerance approach to the border when he comes into office next year, and NewsNation will continue its pledge to cover this ongoing crisis.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/newsnation-border-recap-2024/	2024-12-26T14:26:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/GettyImages-2149335672.jpg?w=900
JonBenét Ramsey’s father to meet with police, urge new DNA tech	(NewsNation) — The Boulder Police Department says it plans to use new DNA technology in hopes of solving the killing of 6-year-old JonBenét Ramsey in 1996. Ramsey’s body was found 28 years ago in her family’s Boulder home. Now, her father is planning to meet once again with local police to discuss new DNA testing technology that may hopefully fill in the forensic gaps and bring closure to the Ramsey family. 'They have the ability to separate DNA — mixed DNA samples, which is one of the issues with the sample they got in 1997. They had an unidentified male DNA sample in early 1997, and it was mixed, apparently with JonBenét’s blood,' JonBenét’s father, John Bennett Ramsey, told NewsNation in November. 'That DNA can now, technology-wise, be separated. They have the ability to do familial genealogy research, which has been wildly successful in solving old cold cases. That's what we're asking the police to do.' Teen actor from ‘Baby Driver’ dies after falling from moving vehicle He says he is expected to meet with the Boulder police chief in January alongside representatives from a leading DNA lab to push for the new approach. Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn says the department remains committed to finding JonBenét Ramsey’s killer and that the department has already taken significant steps to modernize its investigation. In a video statement released in November, Boulder police said they were working with forensic experts to find the latest advancements in DNA technology and recently digitized all of their case evidence. They hope to use those thousands of files to create a searchable database that could reveal new leads. The department has also taken inventory of more than 2,500 pieces of evidence and reviewed 40,000 reports in the last year alone.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jonbenet-ramseys-father-dna-tech/	2024-12-26T13:42:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/snapshot-2023-09-28T220700.744.jpg?w=814
No ‘price tag’ for mass deportations, says incoming border czar	(NewsNation) — Incoming Trump administration border czar Tom Homan tells NewsNation's Ali Bradley there is no 'price tag' for the mass deportations planned by the incoming administration, citing 'national security' concerns. 'What price do you put on national security? I don't think it has a price tag,' Homan said. 'What price do you put on the thousands of American moms and dads who buried their children? You want to talk about family separation; they buried their children because their children were murdered by illegal aliens that weren't supposed to be here. I don't put a price on that. I don't put a price on national security. I don't put a price on American lives.' Homan further defended the mass deportations’ $86 billion price tag, saying it would save American taxpayers money in the future. Trump criticizes Trudeau, Panama, Biden commutations on Truth Social 'This operation would be expensive,' he acknowledged. 'However, it’s going to save taxpayers a lot of money in the long run. Right now, we’re spending billions of dollars on free airline tickets, free hotel rooms, free medical care, free meals, the education system.' Homan, however, said they will also need help from Congress. 'We need more resources; we need funding. We obviously need to buy more detention beds because everybody we arrest, we have to detain to work on those removal efforts and get travel documents, get flight arrangements. So we need more detention beds,' said Homan. Homan said the Trump administration doesn’t plan on separating families but rather deporting them together. He said the administration is looking into using halfway houses to hold U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record? 'As far as U.S. children, that's going to be a difficult situation because we're not going to change your U.S. citizenship,' he said. 'Which means they’re going to be put in a halfway house or they can stay at home and wait for the officers to get the travel arrangements and come back and get the family. You know the best thing to do for a family is to self-deport themselves.' Homan also targeted birthright citizenship, saying having a child who is a U.S. citizen does not make undocumented immigrants 'immune from our laws.' 'We can't send that message,' he said. 'Because if we do, you're never going to solve the border crisis.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/deportation-price-tag-tom-homan/	2024-12-26T12:15:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot-13.jpg?w=900
US officials: Russia behind Azerbaijan plane crash, early indicat...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — U.S. officials tell NewsNation evidence indicates Russian air defenses downed the Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, killing 38 of the 67 people on board. The passenger jet flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashed while trying to make an emergency near Aktau. The flight had been en route from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia, but was diverted due to fog. The U.S. officials added that if the preliminary information proves to be true, it would further underscore Russian recklessness in its invasion of Ukraine. Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record? The Russian government on Thursday warned against spreading 'hypotheses' about the cause of the crash. 'The investigation is underway,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'And until investigators make their conclusions, it would be incorrect to make any kind of hypothesis. So, we cannot do it and nobody should do it. We must await the end of this investigation.' Azerbaijan observed a nationwide day of mourning on Thursday. National flags were lowered across the country, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals were sounded from ships and trains. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/us-officials-russia-behind-azerbaijan-plane-crash-us-officials-say/	2024-12-26T11:02:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24360347887622.jpg?w=900
Biden grants clemency to BMF co-founder Terry 'Southwest T' Fleno...	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has granted clemency to Terry 'Southwest T' Flenory, co-founder of the organization Black Mafia Family (BMF). Flenory was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 after prosecutors linked him and his brother, Demetrius 'Big Meech' Flenory, to an international drug trafficking operation, according to WXIA-TV. In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, Terry Flenory was released from federal prison and ordered to serve the rest of his sentence on house arrest, WXYZ-TV reported. Which members of Congress have missed the most votes — and why? Terry Flenory celebrated the decision on Instagram, sharing a photo of his clemency affidavit and videos of him removing his house arrest device, writing, 'It’s been a journey, but prayer and unwavering faith beyond mere human comprehension got us to this point.' Demetrius Flenory has not yet been pardoned. However, in October, he was transferred to a residential reentry program in Miami to serve the remainder of his sentence. Known for their leadership in BMF, both Terry and Demetrius Felonry's stories have been widely covered in the media and are dramatized in the Starz series 'BMF.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/biden-grants-clemency-bmf-co-founder-terry-southwest-t-flenory/	2024-12-26T08:16:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2186740159.jpg?w=900
Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record?	(NewsNation) — After U.S. Rep. Kay Granger’s five-month absence from Congress came to light, some Americans are left wondering if their elected officials are doing their jobs or if they are missing critical votes. As the 81-year-old is in a retirement facility dealing with dementia-related issues, other members of Congress have been chronically absent from Capitol Hill, too. NewsNation's Tom Dempsey reviewed data from govtrack.us, a congressional watchdog site, and found Granger isn't even the most absent member of Congress this year. Matt Gaetz ethics report: Rep. Ivey says ‘public deserves to know’ Arizona Democrat Rep. Raúl Grijalva missed 455 votes, roughly 88% of the House votes taken this year, as he battled cancer. The 76-year-old was reelected in November and has said his upcoming term will be his last. Pennsylvania Democrat Rep. Dwight Evans is the second most absent member of Congress, having missed nearly 63% of votes after suffering a stroke in May. He also won reelection in November after running unopposed. By comparison, Granger ranks third on this list, missing 54% of the votes. Coming in fourth is Minnesota Democrat Rep. Dean Phillips, who missed 149 votes this year, most of which were during his failed effort to run against President Biden in the primaries. Trump announces ambassador to Panama amid fight over canal On the other side of Congress, Vice President-elect JD Vance missed the most votes in the Senate, most of which were after being tapped as President-elect Donald Trump's running mate. Retiring West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin ranked second, having skipped 90 votes in the Senate this year. He's followed by a fellow outgoing senator, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who missed 73 votes this year, and Indiana Republican Sen.

Trump criticizes Trudeau, Panama, Biden commutations on Truth Soc...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump made more than 30 posts on his social media platform Truth Social in the span of 1 hour on Christmas. Among the posts Trump made on Tuesday was one announcing his pick for U.S. Ambassador to Panama, though he criticized the country itself. 'Kevin Marino Cabrera will serve as the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, a country that is ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dreams,' Trump wrote. This echoes comments the Republican made Sunday at the conservative conference 'AmericaFest,' where he said that the United States 'foolishly' ceded control of the canal to Panama, and suggested his administration would try to get it back. The president of San Jose, José Raúl Mulino rejected that notion as an affront to his country’s sovereignty. A million taxpayers will soon receive up to $1,400 from the IRS Along with revealing his new choice for his incoming administration, Trump used Truth Social to urge others to confirm his nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth and FBI director, Kash Patel. Both are facing criticism — Hegseth for sexual misconduct allegations and Patel for comments he's made about the 'Deep State' and other conspiracy theories. To Republican strategist Whitley Yates, the flurry of social media posts by the president-elect are 'very Trump.' 'He is someone who's consistently thinking about America, consistently on Truth Social talking about America,' Yates said on 'Morning in America' Wednesday. Democratic Strategist Brad Howard said although the 'meat' of the story is who Trump is nominating to be in his administration, he likes to throw other topics out there 'because he's really good at grabbing headlines and narratives and media attention.' 'It's working,' Howard said. 'But there are some troubling things here that he's proposing.' President-elect Donald Trump strongly defended cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Kash Patel in a flurry of Christmas Day Truth Social posts.

'If Canada was to become our 51st State, their taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World,' Trump wrote. He previously called making Canada the 51st state a 'great idea' in another Truth Social post as well. Instead of Trudeau, Trump suggested former professional hockey player Wayne Gretzky run for prime minister of Canada. Greenland, Trump added, is 'needed by the United States for National Security purposes.' Last week, Trump said the U.S. owning Greenland 'is an absolute necessity.' Múte Egede, Greenland’s prime minister, said in a statement that Greenland 'is not for sale and will never be for sale.' What is ‘walking pneumonia’? Trump slams Biden commutations Among his multiple posts on Tuesday were ones criticizing current President Joe Biden for commuting the death row sentences of 37 federal inmates to life in prison. 'I refuse to wish a merry Christmas to those lucky souls, but instead will say, go to hell,' Trump said. The White House announced Biden's commutations Monday. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said in a statement released for publication on Monday. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.' Throughout his time on the campaign trail for the 2024 election, Trump said his administration would not shy away from the death penalty. During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death.

Year-end travel: What you need to know about post-holiday trips	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Millions of Americans are traveling on Thursday as a record-breaking post-holiday rush continues. The Transportation Security Administration anticipates Friday to be one of the season's busiest days, with 40 million passengers projected to be screened on New Year's Day. AAA projects 119.3 million people will travel during the year-end holiday period, which runs through next Thursday. Here's what you can expect for holiday travel as the year comes to a close: 14K flights delayed since Monday: FlightAware Americans flying in the next few days are hoping to get to their destinations smoother than they did before Christmas. The flight-tracking website FlightAware reported some 14,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed since Monday, with over 400 cancellations. As of Thursday morning, more than 570 flights into and out of the U.S. have been delayed and 21 have been canceled. Return your 2024 holiday gifts by these deadlines Winter weather from Boston to Baltimore may have given folks in the northeast a White Christmas, but it also contributed to Christmas Eve delays. American Airlines reports it's all hands on deck after Tuesday's technical glitch that grounded flights for over an hour. Over 40% of American flights were delayed Tuesday, according to FlightAware. What will be the busiest travel days? Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Dec. 20 and 21, followed by Dec. 26, Dec. 27, and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on New Year’s Day. The slowest U.S. air travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day. AAA: 107M driving through New Year's Day About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA. The 107 million people hitting the road is 2.5 million more than last year. Additionally, AAA expects nearly 4.5 million people to take buses and trains this year, up nearly 10 percent from last year. Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per kilowatt hour, but varies by state. Transportation data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation’s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays. New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, the company said. Body found in wheel well of United Airlines flight from Chicago to Maui AAA recommends traveling early to avoid heavy traffic, as the peak driving times are in the afternoon and early evening. It also urges drivers to slow down and stay alert and refreshed behind the wheel. Planning ahead for 2025 Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But travel analysts suggest early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.

Ex-NASA astronaut encounters mysterious flying orbs 9,000 ft. in ...	(NewsNation) — Two months before the recent wave of unexplained drones in New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast, a former NASA astronaut encountered mysterious metallic orbs while flying a private plane, he revealed in an interview with NewsNation's The Hill. Leroy Chiao, who was a commander on the International Space Station, had a near-collision with unidentified flying objects in the panhandle of Texas in August as he was flying from Colorado in a small airplane. 'I was about 9,000 feet (in the air), and suddenly, out of nowhere, these two big metallic spherical orbs, one on top of the other about three feet in diameter, each went zipping by the left side of my airplane right underneath about 20 feet away,' Chiao said. The unmanned aircraft was not on the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control radar, Chiao said. Over a month later, the northeast drone mystery remains unsolved 'I got a good look at them only for a second, and it happened so quick, there wasn't even a chance to get scared, but it could have been a bad result if they had actually hit me,' he said. The former astronaut has flown several state space missions before, three of which lasted six months on the ISS. He said it's 'hard to believe' the government doesn't know what's going on with the drones that have been flying in New Jersey near U.S. military facilities. 'I think they could tell us what they know,' Chiao said. 'How could we have the best, most advanced military and technological capabilities in the world, and if they don't know? That's even more disconcerting.' Reports of drones began in mid-November, and residents and local officials have voiced their frustration over the lack of government transparency. 'To me, it seems like it's some kind of a military program,' Chiao said. 'It seems like it's way too widespread and organized to be some kind of prank unless somebody's got a lot of money to spend on that.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/nasa-astronaut-mysterious-flying-orbs/	2024-12-26T04:08:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-486714640.jpg?w=724
What is 'walking pneumonia'?	(NewsNation) — Cases of 'walking pneumonia' are rising for the first time since the start of the pandemic, with health providers reporting an increase in young children. Cases began climbing in the spring and peaked in late August, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Diagnoses appear to be rising the most among children, according to diagnosis data from March 31 through October 5, 2024. The percentage grew from 1% to 7.2% among children ages 2 to 4 years and from 3.6% to 7.4% among children ages 5 to 17 years, according to the CDC. The agency said the increase in babies and toddlers is notable because the infection is historically known to affect school-age more than younger children. Cases of ‘walking pneumonia’ are rising across the US 'We've seen a dramatic increase in illness and hospitalization due to Mycoplasma pneumonia,' said Dr. Mary Fairchok, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, told MedicalExpress. 'Adults can get Mycoplasma too, but it's really hitting the pediatric population.' What is 'walking pneumonia Walking pneumonia is a respiratory tract infection caused by the bacterium mycoplasma pneumoniae, according to the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. It is the common term for atypical or a mild form of pneumonia. Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes airways to swell, the air sacs in your lungs to fill with mucus and other fluids and a high fever and a cough with mucus, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The main differences between walking pneumonia and the more common pneumonia is that the former is milder and usually doesn’t require bed rest or hospitalization, the clinic stated. The highest rates of walking pneumonia generally occur in school-age children and teens, and people who have weakened immune systems or are recovering from another respiratory infection are at higher risk of severe infection. What are the symptoms of walking pneumonia? Symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, chest pain, cough and low-grade fever in adults. The infection doesn't tend to cause much nasal or sinus congestion in adults, the medical center stated. Walking pneumonia can feel like a bad cold or the flu. Children under 5 may experience symptoms other than a chest cold, including nasal congestion, sneezing, and watery eyes or gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, according to the CDC. What is ‘walking pneumonia,’ and why are cases rising? The infection is highly contagious and spreads through droplets in the air through coughing and sneezing. It can take up to three to four weeks from the time someone was exposed to the germ to the time that they're feeling sick. Walking pneumonia may last from four to six weeks. A cough is usually the longest-lasting walking pneumonia symptom, according to the Cleveland Clinic. How to test for walking pneumonia? Medical professionals can test for walking pneumonia with a nose swab similar to the COVID-19 test, the Cleveland Clinic stated. They could also order chest X-rays to see if there’s an infection in the lungs. Providers can also do a blood test and send the sample to a laboratory to confirm the infection. How to treat walking pneumonia The infection, like most, can be treated with antibiotics. Hospitalization is generally rare with this infection. Most people can recover on their own, but over-the-counter medicine can help ease symptoms. Why are cases rising? The infection has risen to levels unseen since the pandemic. The reason why it dropped since 2020 is because of infection prevention measures that went into place, like social distancing and masking, reported Johns Hopkins. 'In North America, we began to detect M. pneumoniae more frequently on tests in 2024. Since the summer, the proportion of tests that are positive for M. pneumoniae has gone up and is still going up right now,' the organization stated.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/what-is-walking-pneumonia/	2024-12-25T17:41:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67198c0c4990a0.81738904.jpeg?w=900

Alleged shoplifters learn retail crime now a felony in California	(NewsNation) — Two alleged shoplifters figured out the hard way retail crime is now a felony in California under Proposition 36. California's Seal Beach Police shared video on social media of an exchange between two suspects sitting in the back of a squad car where one realizes repeat offenders of retail theft can now face felony charges. 'That’s a felony?' the female suspect asked, referring to retail theft. 'B----, new laws. Stealing is a felony,' the other replied, adding, 'And this is Orange County, b----. They don't play.' Californian voters crack down on crime, pass Proposition 36 Police captioned the post 'Remember folks, Don’t Steal in Seal,' and they said the 'new proposition only strengthens our commitment to combating Organized Retail Theft.' Police also released video surveillance from several locations, including a Kohl’s and an Ulta store, that the suspects visited. In the video, three women are seen carefully selecting and stealing nearly $2,000 worth of merchandise from the stores. They are also seen calmly walking out holding the allegedly stolen items. The social media post also includes bodycam video from when officers chase the suspects. California voters approved Proposition 36 in November, which made shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increased penalties for some drug charges. A felony conviction could mean jail time of up to three years. ‘Peek-a-boo’: California police catch alleged shoplifter hiding in car trunk The measure partly rolls back a progressive law passed by voters in 2014 that downgraded several nonviolent crimes to misdemeanors, including theft under $950 in value and some drug offenses. The reversal reflects widespread anger among voters who are increasingly pinning the blame for homelessness and retail theft on criminal justice reform and progressive district attorneys. California Governor Gavin Newsom had opposed Prop 36, claiming that it would disproportionately impact minority communities and worsen jail overcrowding, but the legislation was approved by nearly 70% of California voters. Business owners have expressed their support for the new law but say they are waiting to see how it plays out in the legal system.

NewsNation became the voice for all Americans in 2024	(NewsNation) — NewsNation became the voice for all Americans in 2024 by focusing on the people behind the stories, taking on the issues that matter and bringing together all perspectives. Through town halls and in-depth reporting, NewsNation met communities where they are across the country. In 2024, NewsNation focused on the value of learning trades, as opposed to attending a four-year college or university, alongside 'Dirty Jobs' host Mike Rowe. One American shared his journey during a NewsNation town hall in April, saying he left college after realizing the pride of learning a trade like his forefathers. CUOMO Special Edition: Trading Up with Mike Rowe 'My whole heritage has been based on working a skill, having trades,' Micheal Gamez told Rowe and NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'That means a lot to me. Those are my heroes; my grandfather does that, and my dad does that, so I just said, ‘You know what? Now I'm out.' ... It is the land of the brave, and I got to be able to go out there and be brave enough to show that pride.' NewsNation continued to put into focus brewing issues at the border, highlighting not only the plight of migrants coming to the U.S. but the challenges this posed to border patrol and state officials. NewsNation took a ride with law enforcement officials at the U.S.-Mexico border, capturing four encounters on camera during one hour of live coverage. During the 'Dan Abrams Live' special episode, NewsNation reporters fanned out nationwide, reporting live on the border crisis and its impact on communities, education and crime rates. Teams used night-vision technology and a specially outfitted NewsNation border truck.

Migrants rushing to board dangerous 'beast' train to border	(NewsNation) — Migrants who want to reach the border before President-elect Donald Trump takes office has led to a surge of people boarding a deadly 'beast' train that travels near the U.S. border. The freight train, called 'La Bestia' or 'The Beast' is infamously known to be one of the deadliest trains in Mexico. Claudia Rios, a Durango resident living near the train stop, told NewsNation that she’s seen more than 200 people attempt to board the treacherous train in recent days. 'Lately they come very aggressive, like all the good, all the kind migrants have crossed, because in this group that's coming, they're fighting among themselves,' she told NewsNation in Spanish. Trump wants mass deportations. A ride-along with immigration officers shows the challenges Rios also said she’s seen an alarming number of children and even people in wheelchairs trying to get on the train. Previously it was mostly adults traveling alone, she said. The train has no passenger railcars and only carries products north for export. Migrants have been known to ride atop the moving trains, facing physical dangers that range from amputation to death if they fall or are pushed. They are also subject to extortion and violence at the hands of cartels and gangs that control the routes north, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Authorities have also reported a rise in kidnappings and extortion by cartels who see the migrants as easy money. Fifteen Vietnamese migrants and a Mexican national were rescued from a ransom kidnapping. In Sonora, Mexico, 36 migrants, mostly from India, were crowded to a house until desperate cries for help brought authorities to the scene. Mexican officials have launched efforts to stop the rush aboard the train by trying to get those migrants off and into safety. They're also offering migrants bus rides to the border if they have an appointment with Customs and Border Patrol. However, sources tell NewsNation it’s impossible to stop every single one of these migrants. Cartels taking advantage of holiday deliveries Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott launched his own state efforts to slow down the crossings at the border putting up over 40 billboards in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico warning migrants about the dangers of crossing, especially sexual assault against women and children. The $100,000 campaign includes warnings written in Spanish, Chinese, Russian and even Arabic. 'This is tough medicine,' Abbott said. 'We want no more ‘rape trees’ in Texas. Do not make the dangerous trek to Texas.' Abbot said one billboard would warn migrants, 'Your wife and daughter will pay for their trip with their bodies.' Abbot also said Texas is excited about President-elect Donald Trump shoring up security along the southern border and he reiterated that mass deportations will happen on 'Day 1.' Abbott said that according to conversations he’s had with Trump, the border barrier will be expanded all along the Southwest border. With Donald Trump returning to the White House, there is intense interest in how the Republican will carry out his immigration agenda, including a campaign pledge of mass deportations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/migrants-beast-train-border/	2024-12-24T10:55:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/GettyImages-1488958111.jpg?w=900
Trump vows to direct DOJ to pursue death penalty in wake of Biden...	President-elect Trump vowed Tuesday to direct his Department of Justice (DOJ) to pursue the death penalty in the wake of President Biden’s clemencies of nearly every federal death row inmate. 'As soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families and children from violent rapists, murderers, and monsters,' Trump said on Truth Social. 'We will be a Nation of Law and Order again!' Trump’s remarks come just a day after Biden officially announced he has commuted sentences of 37 out of 40 prisoners on federal death row, reclassifying their sentences from execution to life in prison. The move, which has drawn mixed reaction, leaves only three 'hard cases' behind — that of two notorious mass shooters who carried out their killings in a church and synagogue and one of the brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. Some of the prisoners granted clemency have been on death row for more than a decade with their crimes including the murders of other prisoners and prison guards. Biden in a statement said he was commuting the sentences in part because he expected Trump's incoming administration to remove a moratorium placed on federal executions under Biden's White House, with the exception of those involving terrorism and hate-fueled murders. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said. Trump’s team criticized the president’s decision Monday, characterizing it as 'abhorrent' and a 'slap in the face.' 'These are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones,' Trump communications director Steven Cheung said. 'President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people,' Cheung added. Trump has said during his 2024 presidential campaign that he is in favor of seeking the death penalty for lesser offenses including for drug traffickers. While the president has faced criticism over the decision, he has gotten praise from some civil rights groups: the American Civil Liberties Union and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-vows-to-direct-doj-to-pursue-death-penalty-in-wake-of-biden-clemencies/	2024-12-24T10:24:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Leading-Trump_122224_AP_Rick-Scuteri.jpg?w=900

What to know about death of a woman set on fire in NYC subway	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — Attorneys for the suspect accused of burning a woman to death on a New York subway are gearing up for a possible insanity defense. New York City police have arrested a man on murder and arson charges in the death of a woman who was set on fire inside a subway train early Sunday morning. Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, was arrested Monday after being taken into custody the previous day. He's charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder and arson. It is unclear if Zapeta-Calil has an attorney and when he would be arraigned. One Menendez brother could be freed: DA Immigration officials say Zapeta-Calil, who is from Guatemala, had been deported in 2018 and didn’t have permission to be in the U.S. Zapeta-Calil is currently being held at Brooklyn Central Brooking. It is unclear when and where Zapeta reentered the U.S. Here’s what else is known so far. Defense may seek insanity plea: Source Zapeta-Calil's attorneys are seeking a psychological evaluation, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The suspect was taken to Interfaith Medical Center Monday night; however, officials have not confirmed if he was given a psych evaluation. Police told me the victim had no identification on her and that they may need the victim's dental records to identify her given the condition of the body. A Brooklyn address listed for Zapeta-Calil released by police matches a service center for Samaritan Daytop Village, which provides housing and substance abuse support. The organization has not yet responded to NewsNation's request to confirm whether Zapeta-Calil lived there or at a different facility. Woman severely burned, only teeth can ID her: NYPD The woman was asleep on a stopped F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. Sunday when the suspect set her clothing on fire, The New York Police Department said. Officers at the station reportedly smelled and saw smoke and observed the victim in the train car fully engulfed in flames, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The fire was extinguished, and the woman was pronounced dead. Police have not yet released her identity. Authorities said the victim was burned so badly that teeth will likely be needed to identify her, NewsNation WPIX reported. Georgia homeowner arrested after attempting to remove squatter Teens help police find suspect Police say the suspect stayed on the scene and was seated on a bench on the platform outside the train car. Body-worn cameras from responding officers provided a detailed look at the suspect. After pictures of the suspect were released, three high school-age New Yorkers called 911 saying they saw and recognized him on a train at the York Street station, police say. 'Our officers at District 2 stopped that train at Herald Square and was able to keep the doors closed, walk the train, and place this very dangerous individual in custody. This is amazing work done by the public and the police working together.' The suspect had a lighter in his pocket, police say. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul this year has sent New York National Guard members to the city’s subway system to help police conduct random searches of riders’ bags for weapons following a series of high-profile crimes on city trains.

Eggs added to FDA's updated healthy claim food list	(NewsNation) — Eggs are now considered healthy under new guidance released recently by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA included eggs under its updated healthy claim definition, which the federal agency said reflects current nutrition science and dietary guidance. Under the new definition, eggs fit into the FDA’s healthy classification that requires foods to contain a minimum number of individual nutrients. Current dietary guidance recommends Americans build healthy eating patterns that include a variety of vegetables, fruits, dairy, proteins and whole grains. Soda manufacturers push to keep sugary drinks on SNAP list Other foods that qualify for the FDA’s healthy guidelines include fresh whole fruits and vegetables, salmon, trail mix with nuts and dried fruits, and plain low-fat or fat-free yogurt. States like Colorado will enact a new law beginning on Jan. 1 requiring stores to only sell cage-free eggs. NewsNation affiliate KDVR reported about 40% of eggs produced in the United States are cage-free. 'This news makes eggs a clear healthy choice, vindicating them from outdated science, Jen Houchins, director of nutrition research for the American Egg Board's Egg Nutrition Center, said in a statement released by the FDA. 'The FDA announcement reaffirms the egg's role in supporting the health of American families, with nutritional benefits for everyone. Eggs offer a good source of high-quality protein and contribute nutrients to the diet that Americans don't get enough of, like vitamin D and choline.' The health values of eggs have long been considered high in cholesterol and therefore, a risk to Americans’ health. However, research conducted by the FDA indicates that the cholesterol level in eggs does not negatively affect the body’s cholesterol levels as once believed. Organizations like the American Heart Association have added eggs to their heart-friendly list of foods. 'We applaud the FDA for this important update, which reflects decades of research and unequivocally affirms the value of eggs for healthy living,' Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board, said in a statement. 'Eggs are accessible in the refrigerator of nearly every U.S. household. Whether you're scrambling them for breakfast, grabbing them hardboiled for a quick lunch on the go, or enjoying some egg-and-veggie fried rice at dinner, Americans now know for certain that eggs are one of the healthiest foods for your family.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/eggs-fdas-updated-healthy-food-list/	2024-12-24T08:44:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/eggs-e1700070627909.jpg?w=900
Georgia homeowner arrested after attempting to remove squatter	(NewsNation) — Loletha Hale, a Georgia homeowner, was arrested while attempting to remove an alleged squatter from her home. Hale joined 'Morning in America' to detail why she was arrested after calling police to remove the woman from her Livingston, Georgia, home. 'I'm just not believing this, that she had the audacity to break the law to re-enter my home,' Hale said. Live Updates: Greensboro police officer killed in shooting at Food Lion on Lawndale Drive She added local courts and police have been unhelpful and cannot fathom why she was arrested and spent a night in jail after being charged with criminal trespassing and a misdemeanor count of terroristic threats. 'Your guess is just as good as mine,' Hale said of why she was arrested. 'I would have never imagined in a million years that not only myself but any homeowner would be arrested as a result of a squad event in their house. It's just no logical explanation. I can't explain it.' Per WSB-TV, Sakemeyia Johnson has been allegedly squatting in the home but was ruled to not be a squatter by a Clayton County Magistrate Court due to Johnson's relation to a formerly evicted tenant's partner. Despite a judge ruling in Hale's favor since, she told NewsNation she is unable to go to her home until she gets a writ, and is unsure when her home will be vacated. 'I have no clue when I will be able to get back into my home,' she said. 'I did speak with the court last week, and I was informed that a hearing would be scheduled for some type of evidentiary hearing on her appeal, although she has not met any of the statutory requirements for her to have an appeal. So I don't know why we're having a hearing, but I've not received notice of a date.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/georgia-homeowner-arrested-alleged-squatter/	2024-12-24T07:06:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Loletha-Hale.jpg?w=900

Starbucks baristas end strike, return to work for holiday	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Starbucks baristas returned to work on Wednesday following the largest strike of its kind at stores across the U.S. Meanwhile, Amazon delivery drivers paused their picket lines but plan to resume their fight for better wages and working conditions. Amazon workers are demanding the companies recognize them as unionized employees or meet their demands for an inaugural labor contract. This major year-end push stems from failed negotiations and strategically hits during the busiest week of the year. Contract negotiations at Starbucks The Workers United Union represents about 10,000 Starbucks employees at more than 500 stores. Union leaders said the strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio. In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. The five-day strike, which began on Friday, initially closed Starbucks cafes in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle. It's now expanded to 10 cities, though it impacts just a fraction of the more than 16,000 Starbucks locations across the country. Workers blame Starbucks for an impasse in talks, as the company blames workers for demanding unsustainable wage increases. A million taxpayers will soon get up to $1,400 from the IRS: Here's why The union argues Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. In launching the strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, Workers United said Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years. Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week. The company said it is ready to continue negotiation when the union wants to come back to the bargaining table. 'Workers United will seek to cause more stores to close and claim that their strike has reached 'hundreds of stores in dozens of cities,'' Sara Kelly, Starbucks executive vice president and chief partner officer, said in a statement Tuesday. 'The public conversation may lack the important context that the vast majority of our stores (97-99%) will continue to operate and serve customers, and we expect a very limited impact to our overall operations.' Teamster-led strikes at Amazon Action against Amazon is more extensive, centering around claims of corporate greed that shortchange employees. The Internal Brotherhood of Teamsters claims to have nearly 9,000 workers on strike nationwide, demanding higher pay and improved working conditions. According to the union, workers who voted to authorize strikes began picketing on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. Drivers argue they should get paid the same as United Postal Service workers or UPS drivers. Amazon and Starbucks workers are on strike. Trump might have something to do with it Amazon announced plans to raise wages for its subcontracted drivers to $22 an hour following union pressure. However, Teamsters members driving for UPS earn an average of $49 an hour. The Teamsters union has primarily focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors handling Amazon's deliveries. However, Amazon has rejected calls to negotiate, since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees. Teamsters also say the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers, totaling about 10,000 Amazon workers nationwide — a small portion of Amazon's 1.5 million employees. The union hasn't disclosed the number of workers participating in the strike or how long it will last. But it included Amazon-employed warehouse workers in San Francisco and subcontracted delivery drivers in cities like Chicago, New York City, Atlanta, and other parts of California. Will the strike impact holiday packages? For customers, logistics experts suspect there could be minor delays in California, Georgia, Illinois and New York. However, Amazon told NewsNation it doesn't expect the strike to impact operations, and won't affect customers receiving their packages on time. Additionally, Amazon argues the drivers are not its employees. The company also says these actions are protests, not strikes since no Amazon employee or third-party driver pays Teamsters union dues.

Ex-US Rep. Gaetz paid women for sex while in Congress: Ethics rep...	(NewsNation) — Former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz allegedly used illicit drugs and paid for sex with multiple women — including a 17-year-old girl — according to the final draft of a House Committee ethics report, which was was released to the public on Monday. Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the ethics committee on Monday, challenging the body’s 'unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of the report. Committee-ReportDownload The 37-page report concludes that Gaetz regularly paid women for sex between 2017 and 2020 and that on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2019, he possessed drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy. The committee also concluded that Gaetz knowingly and willfully sought to impede and obstruct the House Committe's investigation of his conduct. NewsNation reported last week that the ethics report would be released by Christmas after the House Committee initially voted not to release the report after the Florida Republican resigned his House seat. The report indicated that Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s initial pick for Attorney General, paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex or drugs on several occasions. That included money he paid to a 17-year-old girl in 2017. The report indicated Gaetz violated Florida’s statutory rape law as well as other state laws. Luigi Mangione, UnitedHealthcare CEO killing suspect, to be arraigned in Manhattan 'The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,' panel investigators wrote in the report. In his lawsuit, Gaetz claims that the report contains 'potentially defamatory allegations' that violate the House committee’s own rules. The suit said that while Gaetz was a member of Congress, the committee began an investigation of previously unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct. The suit said that the investigation continued after Gaetz resigned his seat and 'apparently voted' to release the report without proper notice to Gaetz. In a post on X on Monday, Gaetz wrote, 'There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.' The ethics report found Gaetz often used Venmo or PayPal to pay women during his tenure in Congress. Investigators zeroed in on a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, which they said 'violated the House gift rule.' The report also said that during the trip, Gaetz 'engaged in sexual activity' with multiple women, including one who described the trip itself as 'the payment' for sex on the trip. On the same trip, he also took ecstasy, one woman on the trip told the committee, the report found. The report concluded that in 2018, Gaetz arranged for his Chief of Staff to assist a woman with whom he engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the U.S. Department of State that she was a constituent. The report said that Gaetz paid 'Victim A' $400 to have sex with him, which she understood was payment for sex. The report indicated that Victim A was 17 and recently completed her junior year of high school. Investigators also determined that Gaetz had sex twice at a party, including one occasion that was witnessed by other party attendees. In response to the news that the ethics report would be released, Gaetz wrote on X last week, 'My 30's were an era of working very hard – and playing hard too. It’s embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.' Gaetz resigned after Trump named the former Florida lawmaker as his pick for Attorney General. Gaetz, however, withdrew his name as the nominee following controversy over him being tabbed by Trump. In a social media post, Gaetz said it was clear his confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction for the transfer of power over to Trump.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/gaetz-paid-women-sex-congress-report/	2024-12-23T07:51:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn02_w_f52f00.jpg?w=900
Frustration, fascination with drone sightings continue to grow	(NewsNation) — Americans' fascination and frustration levels with mysterious drone sightings continue to grow although the number of reports involving unidentified objects has dipped in the past few days. Federal agencies like the FBI have not provided definitive answers about where the drones are coming from. The agencies continue to maintain that the drones are not the property of the U.S. military and that there is no reason for concern about the objects being operated by foreign governments. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drones in certain parts of New York and New Jersey, where Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy maintains that anti-drone technology that was sent to the state isn’t working. Government handling of drones a ‘catastrophe’: Elizondo 'I think momentum and frustration is growing on this issue,' Brad Crispin, the co-founder of Americans for Safe Aerospace, told NewsNation. Crispin said out of the thousands of reported drone sightings, some have been misidentified. But he said that the main story surrounding the issue is the vulnerabilities that now exist in American airspace and the nation’s critical infrastructure. He said that a percentage of what people are seeing in the sky is 'truly concerning.' Crispin said that sightings at Picatinny Arsenal and Trump National Golf Course in New Jersey likely sparked the national fascination with drones. But the sightings are instead a 'years-running pattern' with mysterious overflights in sensitive areas by unidentified objects. 'Pilots are concerned, members of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee are concerned, and they’ve been raising the warning for years,' Crispin said. Crispin said the biggest concern is that federal agencies don’t know where the drones are coming from. Given the temporary bans in two states that will last until mid-January and anxiety over the misidentification of drones, Crispin said it has become evident that federal officials don’t have the drone issue under control. 'I think only a fraction of these (sightings) are concerning,' Crispin told NewsNation. 'But people want answers. Let’s identify what’s in our skies, There shouldn’t be unknown objects operating over military bases, operating over critical infrastructure. There’s no reason for it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/frustration-fascination-with-drone-sightings-continue-to-grow/	2024-12-23T07:31:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ.jpg?w=900
Gaetz sues Ethics Committee in last-minute bid to block release o...	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) on Monday filed a lawsuit against the House Ethics Committee in a last-minute attempt to block the panel from releasing its report on the Florida Republican. Gaetz, who resigned from Congress last month, filed the lawsuit as several outlets reported on leaked drafts of the Ethics Committee’s report, which CNN and CBS say found 'substantial evidence' that the ex-congressman violated House rules or Florida state laws that prohibit prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges and obstruction of Congress. The panel is expected to publicly release the report as early as Monday. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., asks a judge to issue an emergency order blocking the report’s release. Gaetz claims the committee is acting beyond its authority because it has no jurisdiction over him now that he has resigned from Congress. Gaetz’s attorneys said the report contains 'untruthful and defamatory information' that would 'significantly damage' his reputation. 'The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections,' Gaetz’s attorneys wrote. The suit names the Ethics Committee and its chair, Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), as defendants. Spokespeople for the Ethics Committee and Guest did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment. While the Ethics Committee does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress, there is precedent to the panel releasing the report on ex-lawmakers — though it is rare. In 1987, for example, the committee released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. The legal action could be the final battle for Gaetz in the years-long investigation into the firebrand Republican. Before the Ethics panel resumed its investigation, the Department of Justice had investigated Gaetz for sex trafficking and whether he had sex with a 17-year-old girl. The DOJ in 2023 declined to charge Gaetz with a crime. Gaetz has repeatedly denied having sex with a minor and other wrongdoing, and pointed to the lack of charges as a means of discrediting the Ethics panel investigation. 'These claims would be destroyed in court — which is why they were never made in any court against me,' Gaetz told The Hill on Monday. The Ethics Committee continued investigating Gaetz after the DOJ declined to charge the Florida Republican, probing allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, accepting improper gifts, dispensing special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship and seeking to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. In a lengthy statement posted on X last week, after news broke that the panel reversed course and voted to release its report into Gaetz, the ex-congressman defended his conduct, saying it was 'embarrassing, though not criminal.'

Luigi Mangione, UnitedHealthcare CEO killing suspect, to be arrai...	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare is set to be arraigned Monday in a New York City court on state murder and terror charges. The Manhattan district attorney formally charged Luigi Mangione last week with multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism. His initial appearance in the New York State Supreme Court was preempted by federal prosecutors bringing their own charges over the shooting. What’s next for the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO? The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. The district attorney's office told NewsNation that it's working with federal authorities to coordinate Monday's arraignment, but has not yet confirmed a specified time for Mangione's court appearance. CEO killing 'intended to evoke terror': DA Alvin Bragg Mangione is accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan on Dec 4. He was arrested in Pennsylvania after a five-day search and was extradited to New York City on Thursday. On Tuesday, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg announced Mangione is now being indicted on one count of first-degree murder in the furtherance of terrorism, arguing the killing 'was intended to evoke terror.' Mangione's defense questions fed charges Meanwhile, Mangione’s defense team appears taken aback by the federal charges, which were introduced late last week. Federal investigators argue Mangione meticulously planned the murder, alleging the 26-year-old expressed hostility toward the insurance industry and wealthy executives. Karen Friedman Agnifilo, an attorney for Mangione, has accused federal and state prosecutors of advancing conflicting legal theories. In federal court last week, she called their approach 'very confusing' and 'highly unusual.' Prosecutors have said both cases will be worked on simultaneously, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Mangione is set to return to court next month for the federal charges, which could carry the death penalty.

Biden commutes sentences of 37 death row inmates to life without ...	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden announced that he is commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, meaning they will now have life sentences without the possibility of parole instead. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said in a statement released for publication on Monday. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.' In 2021, the Biden administration put a moratorium on federal death sentences in cases other than terrorism and 'hate-motivated mass murder.' Drones over New Jersey: Mystery continues month after first sightings Throughout his time on the campaign trail for the 2024 election, Trump said his administration would not shy away from the death penalty, however. 'We’ve never had (such) massive amounts of drugs pouring into our country,' he said during a campaign event in Arizona. 'And by the way, you’ll never solve the problem without the death penalty.' During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death. The last of these executions happened just days before Biden took office. The number far surpasses executions under any president for more than a century. Before July 2020, the federal government hadn’t executed anyone in 17 years. The Trump administration also approved using pentobarbital in lethal injections even with evidence it could cause pulmonary edema, a painful condition akin to drowning. Hundreds of anti-capital punishment groups had been calling on Biden to commute the death row sentences, as they feared a renewed 'execution spree' in a Trump presidency. Death Penalty Action, an anti-capital punishment coalition of more than 350 groups, sent Biden a letter talking about the 'renewed concern and urgency' they had with Trump coming into office in less than two months. What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory? 'Suddenly the whole world has changed and if Joe Biden doesn’t commute these sentences, then Donald Trump is going to kill them,' Abraham Bonowitz, the executive director of Death Penalty Action, previously told NewsNation before Biden's commutations were revealed. Earlier this month, Biden pardoned 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes and commuted the sentences of 1,500 people placed on home confinement. It was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. At the time, Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. Biden also issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons and broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia. In addition, he's pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex.

Mexican, US police deploy more officers at border for holiday tra...	(NewsNation) — Officials on the southern border are warning that there will be major traffic in the area as thousands of people across the United States travel to see their families in Mexico this holiday season. In Laredo, Texas, the police department say lines of congestion can cause people to wait for hours. Officials in Eagle Pass, Texas are also reporting long lines of congestion on International Bridge One and International Bridge Two that could affect commerce. Some of the traffic on those bridges being rerouted to different roads. That journey to see loved ones can take up to two weeks for some — and lately, it's been much more dangerous to travel to Mexico, because of drug cartels working along the southern border. Travel tracker: What you should know as you prepare for holiday travel In recent years, hundreds of police officers have been monitoring roads and assisting travelers. To facilitate the holiday travel, Mexican officials have stepped up security on their side even more. For instance, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, police say they've deployed an additional 400 officers. On the American side, the Texas Department of Public Safety deployed additional officers as at least 9.1 million Texans will be hitting the skies and roads this year. In total, an estimated 119.3 million Americans will travel during the year-end holidays, according to the American Automobile Association. Officials are recommending that all those who head into Mexico look on social media for any statements from local law enforcement that come in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-police-holiday-travel/	2024-12-22T18:38:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Laredo-Welcome-Sign-061323.jpg?w=900
White House made 'friendliest threat' over Biden's decline: DNC c...	(NewsNation) — A Democratic National Committee finance committee member told NewsNation Sunday she received a 'friendly threat' from the White House before publicly discussing President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. Lindy Li, who had raised millions for Biden's campaign, said on 'NewsNation Prime,' that a White House official called her the night before her scheduled appearance on Fox News Sunday in July. According to Li, the official told her, 'You're one of the President's most loyal supporters. We know you're going to stay loyal.' 'It was the friendliest threat possible,' Li said, comparing the exchange to dialogues from 'The Sopranos' and 'The Godfather.' Texas US Rep. Kay Granger in senior living facility: reports Li's comments come amid a Wall Street Journal report that sheds light on the 46th president's challenges, citing interviews with nearly 50 sources. Li said she observed concerning changes in Biden during fundraising events, noting an incident at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in May where Biden declined to take questions or work the rope line after a $1.1 million fundraiser. The DNC finance committee member also described increasingly restrictive practices at fundraising events, including pre-approved questions printed on note cards for donors to read. At some events, she said, no questions were permitted at all. While Li maintained she saw no signs of cognitive decline during the 2020 campaign, she said she noticed significant changes beginning in 2023. She characterized the current administration as a 'shadow presidency' run by Biden's inner circle. Trump pushes back on ‘President Musk’ claims 'President Biden, as a human being, is no longer capable of executing the duties of the commander in chief,' Li said. She added that she faced significant backlash for speaking out, including losing tens of thousands of social media followers. 'I don't want to get crucified again, but there are certain people around him, his senior advisors, who are essentially running the country,' Li told NewsNation. Li said she decided to come forward after feeling 'lied to at worst and manipulated at best' about campaign prospects and fundraising efforts, citing $2.5 billion in campaign spending that she helped raise. GOP lawmaker says Johnson made spending fight ‘way too complicated’ Biden’s decline widely reported in final days of presidency In the WSJ report, White House aides admitted to Biden having 'good days' and 'bad days' and making attempts to manage his cognitive 'limitations' while in office. The report details accounts from administration officials who say Biden would grow 'tired if meetings went long' and occasionally 'make mistakes.' Aides often repeated instructions, even for tasks like entering or exiting a stage. The report further claims that Biden’s inner circle has implemented stricter controls than in past administrations, limiting his interactions, information flow and conversations. The administration has denied any decline in the president’s abilities.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-decline-threat-lindy-li/	2024-12-22T18:01:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot-1-5.jpg?w=900
Trump pushes back on 'President Musk' claims	President-elect Trump on Sunday rejected the recent dubbing of tech billionaire Elon Musk as 'President Musk' by Democrats. 'No, he’s not gonna be president, that I can tell you,' Trump said at conservative group Turning Point's 'America Fest' in Phoenix, Ariz. 'And I’m safe, you know why? He can’t be, he wasn’t born in this country.' GOP lawmaker says Johnson made spending fight ‘way too complicated’ Democratic leaders have recently implied that the tech billionaire is the 'real leader' of the GOP in the wake of Musk’s hard-line campaign opposing a stopgap spending measure. In the last week, Musk railed against the stopgap measure on social media, with the president-elect following him in his disapproval of the deal negotiated by strong Trump ally House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) 'Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!' Musk said Wednesday on the social platform X, which he owns. At 'America Fest,' Trump said Musk 'went to Pennsylvania, and he stayed — stayed up there for a month, and helped us to win that state, which we won by a lot.' 'So he was really good,' Trump added. Trump said last month that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would serve as the heads of the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) panel, which aims to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and 'restructure federal agencies.' Biden ‘AWOL’ amid shutdown fight: ‘He’s completely disappeared’ DOGE will 'provide advice and guidance from outside of government' and work alongside the White House Office of Management and Budget, the president-elect said. 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,' Trump added. 'Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.'

Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) said on Sunday that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) made the government funding battle 'way too complicated.' 'I think he made it way too complicated,' McClintock said Sunday on NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The California Republican argued Johnson likes to have people 'beat him up from time to time' but doesn’t think it is necessary under a second White House term under President-elect Trump.

2 US Navy pilots shot down over Red Sea in apparent 'friendly fir...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become, with ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time of the friendly fire incident, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what the pilots' mission was and did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen which the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. However, there were no images or information released regarding the strikes — which has happened previously when airstrikes hit vital facilities for the rebels. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, released a prerecorded statement hours later in which he claimed the rebels launched eight drones and 17 cruise missiles in their attack. He also claimed without offering any evidence that the Houthis shot down the F/A-18, likely following a pattern of him making exaggerated claims. During the Eisenhower's deployment, he repeatedly falsely claimed the carrier had been struck by Houthi fire. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.

KILLEEN, Texas (KXAN) — A driver was shot and killed by law enforcement officers after driving a truck into a busy mall on Saturday night, injuring five people, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. At around 5 p.m., a DPS trooper tried to stop a black pickup truck after a 911 caller reported a possible intoxicated driver in Belton, about 20 miles from Killeen. The driver refused to stop, prompting a chase, DPS explained during a Saturday night press conference. The pickup then turned into the parking lot of the Killeen Mall, nearly 70 miles north of Austin, before driving into the building, striking people as it went. Blake Lively accuses ‘It Ends With Us’ director Justin Baldoni of harassment, smear campaign 'The suspect drove through the doors and continued to drive through the JCPenney store, striking multiple people,' Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety said in an evening news briefing. 'The trooper and the Killeen police officer continued on foot after this vehicle, which was driving through the store, actively running people over. He traveled several hundred yards.' At least five people were injured by the vehicle, according to DPS. Four victims were taken to area hospitals, while another traveled to a hospital separately. They ranged in age from 6 to 75 years old and their conditions were not immediately known, Washko said.

(KXAN Photo/Frank Martinez) Troopers and Killeen Police officers followed the truck into the mall on foot, linking up with off-duty officers from three other local agencies. Officers from the state public safety department, Killeen, and the off-duty officers 'engaged in gunfire to eliminate this threat,' Washko said. The Texas Rangers will investigate the shooting. Washko did not have information about the suspect's identity at the time of the briefing. A public information officer for DPS said posts sharing misinformation spread rapidly online in the midst of the incident, including several seen by Nexstar's KXAN that claimed there was an active shooter within the Killeen Mall. At around 6 p.m. Killeen Police said on Facebook that there was no active shooter in the mall, adding that while the mall and surrounding area were 'secure,' the public should avoid it. Daniel Bartlett was at work at JC Penney when the incident happened. He said he was in the store's backroom when he heard gunshots and ran into the store to help people get out, not knowing what happened. 'It's, it's only what, four days till Christmas? And so there's a lot of shoppers, and, you know, there's a lot of people that are running,' Bartlett explained. 'There's only two entrances to get out, and so people are running out the salon entrance, and I go, and I hold the door open to help people out because people are panicking.' Deer wearing hi-visibility vest spotted in Michigan 'I didn't know someone drove through our store. All I knew is that there was gunshots.' Bartlett told KXAN he also helped people get into a safe area within the store office before returning to the shopping floor, and that's when he saw the destruction. 'So I get out there and I'm looking for co-workers, and that's when I see the destruction. It is clean through.' Bartlett said he'd never seen anything like it. 'I don't know. I really don't. It's just ... you never expect anything like this to happen, and the best you can do is stay calm.'

German authorities received tipoffs last year about the suspect i...	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — German authorities said they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged on Sunday about the five people killed. Authorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven’t publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Authorities say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. He described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. He is being held in custody as authorities investigate him. The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said in an interview on the German broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that his office received a tipoff from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, which led authorities to launch 'appropriate investigative measures.' 'The man also published a huge number of posts on the internet. He also had contact with various authorities, made insults and even threats. However, he was not known to have committed acts of violence,' said Münch, whose office is the German equivalent of the FBI. He said that the warnings, however, proved to be very unspecific. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also said Saturday on X that it received a tipoff about the suspect in the late summer of last year. 'This was taken seriously, like every other of the numerous tips,' the office said. But it also noted that it is not an investigative authority and that it referred the information to the responsible authorities. It gave no other details. The Central Council of Ex-Muslims said in a statement that the suspect had 'terrorized' them for years as it expressed shock at the attack. 'He apparently shared beliefs from the far-right spectrum of the AfD and believed in a large-scale conspiracy aimed at Islamizing Germany. His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,' said the statement. The group's chairwoman, Mina Ahadi, said in the same statement: 'At first we suspected that he might be a mole in the Islamist movement. But now I think he is a psychopath who adheres to ultra-right conspiracy ideologies.' Police in Magdeburg, the capital of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Sunday that those who died were four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy. Authorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond. The suspect was on Saturday evening brought before a judge, who behind closed doors ordered him to be kept in custody on allegations of murder and attempted murder. He is facing a possible indictment. The horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany make it likely that migration will remain a key issue as the country heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. A deadly knife attack in Solingen in August pushed the issue to the top of the agenda, and led the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tighten border security measures. Right-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union’s migration policies and described it as a 'terrorist act.' At an annual press conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orbán insisted that 'there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.' Orbán vowed to 'fight back' against the EU migration policies and alleging without evidence that 'Brussels wants Magdeburg to happen to Hungary, too.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland. Associated Press writer Bálint Dömötör in Budapest, Hungary, contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-german-police-say-4-women-and-a-boy-were-killed-in-the-christmas-market-attack/	2024-12-22T04:15:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676803afe37311.60253963.jpeg?w=900
Government handling of drones a 'catastrophe': Elizondo	(NewsNation) — The public has yet to get answers regarding the mysterious drone sightings reported in eastern states, showing how much the Biden administration 'doesn’t seem to have a handle on things,' a former Pentagon official says. Lue Elizondo, who led Pentagon investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), aka UFOs, told NewsNation the public messaging surrounding the unexplained drones has been a 'catastrophe.' 'I have never seen an administration handle a topic as poorly as this,' he said. 'We're not informing the American people of the truth and this is yet another example of, for whatever reason, this administration doesn't seem to have a handle on things.' Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey and parts of New York since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. New Jersey drones not national security risk: White House The FAA temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey and 30 areas in New York, where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17. The agency has warned that 'deadly force' could be used against the drones if they pose an 'imminent security threat' and that the government is using 'drone busters' to take down unauthorized flyers. Elizondo blasted officials, saying the only two possibilities for the lack of information is that they are either 'lying or they’re incompetent.' 'Either one of those is really a bad place for this administration to be in,' he said. Elizondo believes the incoming Trump administration may do a better job with transparency, saying many key figures tapped by the former president are known to be 'extremely proactive and dedicated to getting to the bottom of what's actually going on.' FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating the drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. Speculation has run rampant, with some expressing concerns the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Authorities say many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. While not identifying the drones as UAPs, Elizondo says the drones fit into what he calls the 'five observables' associated with UAPs. The possibility is there, he said. 'Once people really know the truth, the whole truth, about this topic, and particularly the UAP topic, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of reconciliation.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elizondo-government-drones/	2024-12-21T18:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot_19458a.jpg?w=900
NJ rep. says it's alarming Feds can't bring down one drone	(NewsNation) — U.S. Rep. Chris Smith says he is 'disturbed' more isn’t being done by federal officials to bring down even one of the mysterious drones flying over that state in order to get answers. Smith, a Republican serving New Jersey's Fourth District, told NewsNation he has been disappointed by the lack of transparency and effort put forth by the Biden administration to quell concerns about who is behind the drone flap. 'Why can't they bring one of these down?' he asked. 'Is our airspace so susceptible and so easily violated that we can't go and say, ‘OK, here they are, let's get at least one and find out...what's the origin?' Smith said many New Jersey residents have been 'alarmed' by the flying objects, and all they want is answers and support to handle the air infestation. New Jersey drones: State senator wants state of emergency Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey and parts of New York since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.

The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating the drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. 'They keep saying it’s not a foreign threat, but they don’t know that,' Smith said, adding that he is highly concerned the drones could be from China or Iran. FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey 'It certainly begs the question, why are we not aggressively looking to determine the source, and they're not doing that,' he said. 'If they are doing it, they are failing in a colossal way.' Speculation has run rampant, with some expressing concerns that the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Authorities say many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. But those are not reassurances, Smith said, adding that he believes the drone activity has been 'ramping up.' He also said the flight restrictions imposed by the FAA lead him to believe all is not well as the government is implying. 'If there's nothing to see here, then why are you taking further action to protect because that's where the sightings are,' Smith said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/new-jersey-feds-drone/	2024-12-21T18:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/07/64a2eaf73e05e1.31816879.jpeg?w=900
Chicago closing last migrant shelter as it moves to 'unified syte...	(NewsNation) — Chicago, Illinois will close its last shelter specifically for migrants later this month as it merges these services with others the city currently offers to homeless people. A migrant shelter at 1310 N. Elston Avenue is set to shut down by Dec. 31, city officials said at a news conference Friday. Besides that shelter, Fox 32 Chicago writes, there are five other shelters in Chicago, two of which are run by the state of Illinois and three that are operated by the city. These will be integrated into Chicago's One System Initiative, meaning these shelters won't only be for migrants, but any homeless individuals in need of housing. What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory? Under the new unified shelter system, which will launch in January 2025, will be 3,800 beds added to the 3,000 already existing in the system. On Dec. 20, SPARC, or Shelter Placement and Resource Center, opened. SPARC is a new, 24/7 access point for single adults with 200 temporary beds. About a year ago, there were around 15,000 migrants, some of whom were sent from Texas under a program by Gov. Greg Abbott, who lived in 28 shelters, according to city data compiled by The Chicago Tribune. During this time, over 30,000 measles vaccines and tens of thousands of other vaccines were administered to migrants and 17,000 people were resettled in apartments. At Friday's press briefing, officials said there are currently 2,476 migrants in city shelters, but these numbers will no longer be tracked under the new system. Deputy Mayor for Immigration Beatriz Ponce de León said this information is no longer needed because Chicago is no longer in 'that crisis state.' 'Everyone in the new system will be under will be under the same policy,' she said. 'There’s no need to collect that data.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/chicago-closing-last-migrant-shelter-unified-sytem/	2024-12-21T16:06:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/6543b0834ef3e9.01583529.jpeg?w=900
Senate Democrats condemn ethical lapses by Thomas, Supreme Court ...	Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee condemned the Supreme Court for an 'ethical crisis of its own making' in a new report released Saturday. The report follows Democrats’ 20-month investigation into the court’s ethics, spurred by ProPublica reports last year detailing how Justice Clarence Thomas accepted various luxury gifts and trips from a billionaire while on the court. In particular, the majority staff report critiques Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, all prominent conservative justices, claiming they violated their legal obligations by not disclosing gifts or failing to recuse from certain cases. Biden signs bill to avert government shutdown 'Any claim that the Court can adequately police itself is belied by the fact that the Court has not taken meaningful action to address ethical misconduct and no justice has faced consequences for unethical behavior—despite dozens of credible allegations of misconduct by multiple justices over decades,' the report states. 'An enforceable code of conduct for the Supreme Court is essential in light of the Court’s failure to police itself,' it continued. Democrats have pushed the Supreme Court to strengthen its ethics standards for years, but revelations of Thomas’s trips and other ethics controversies sparked renewed interest as public trust in the court plummeted. 'The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,' the report states, critiquing the judiciary’s policymaking body for not taking further corrective action. Thomas has denied wrongdoing and said he was not previously obligated to disclose the trips, provided by billionaire Harlan Crow, under a personal hospitality exception that has since been clarified. Here’s what made the cut in Congress’ 1,500-page government funding deal 'On a personal note, Kathy and I are saddened that our dear friends, Clarence and Ginni Thomas, have been subjected to these baseless smears for the past two year,' Harlan Crow said in a statement. 'They are good and honorable people and no one should be treated this way.' In response to the pressure, the justices ultimately adopted a statement of ethical principles last November. Democrats have criticized it for including no binding enforcement mechanism, as opposed to the code in place for other federal judges. The new report reups Democrats’ calls to pass legislation that would create an enforceable ethics code. Republicans blocked the bill, expressing confidence in the justices to police their own ethics and view Democrats’ investigation as a partisan attempt to tear down the conservative-majority court. Thomas and the other justices did not return a request for comment sent to a court spokesperson. Mark Paoletta, a close friend of Thomas whom President-elect Trump has selected for a senior role in the Office of Management and Budget, called the report 'pathetic' and criticized Democrats for releasing it the Saturday before Christmas. 'When they come back, they will thankfully be in the minority. Good riddance,' Paoletta wrote on X.

Funding saga forecasts future struggles for Speaker Johnson	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) averted a government shutdown, but the days-long rollercoaster as the leaders cycled through multiple plans leaves serious questions about how the Speaker will manage the House GOP under President-elect Trump — and whether he can keep his gavel. The intra-party clashes that were on full display this week will be even more consequential next year as Johnson aims to push through an ambitious legislative agenda in Trump’s first 100 days in office with an even slimmer GOP majority in the House. Republican frustration with Johnson this week boiled over beyond the typically antagonistic hardline conservative wing as he went from unveiling a bipartisan 1,500 bill and then abandoning it due to GOP opposition; to pushing a slimmed-down plan B that included a debt ceiling increase requested by Trump, which failed on the House floor; to finally ushering through the slimmed-down version without a debt ceiling lift. 'There’s zero communication from leadership to the membership. And it’s frustrating. And it’s something that should change before January 3,' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) said as she entered a House GOP conference meeting on Friday. 'We need a clear understanding of how we’re going to do things next session, because what’s happening now is completely unacceptable.' Jan. 3 is the first day of the 119th Congress, where the first order of business for House members will be electing the Speaker. Johnson cannot afford more than one Republican defection on the House floor in the Jan. 3 Speakership election, assuming all members are present and voting. Republicans are set to have 219 Republicans taking the oath of office on Jan. 3, and all 215 Democrats are expected to vote for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) – with Jeffries saying this month that Democrats will not save Johnson from a GOP revolt. One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.), is already publicly pledging to vote against the Speaker on Jan. 3. 'We’re legislating by braille here,' Massie said Friday. 'I think this wasn’t handled well. And then I still have all the grievances from last at the beginning of this year; FISA, Ukraine, all of those things. I think there's going to be a reckoning eventually.' A number of other Republicans who spoke to The Hill this week also withheld their support for Johnson. And Johnson is losing backing from others who previously supported him. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, told The Hill on Wednesday after the initial 1,500-page funding bill was released that he still supported Johnson. But on Friday after the House passed the stripped-down version, Harris said in a statement on X that he was 'undecided on what leadership should look like in the 119th Congress,' citing concerns about unpaid new spending not offset by cuts. Yet even some who were highly critical of Johnson’s handling of the funding deal this week, such as Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.), said they are not ready to force a floor fight over the Speakership. 'We’ll see how it goes … I want a consensus pick,' McCormick said. 'Of course, he's made mistakes. And any quarterback in any Super Bowl, including the MVP, can make mistakes. But you know, nothing's done until it's done.' The situation echoes the sequence of events that led to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) being ousted from the Speakership in October 2023 just days after he pushed through a short-term government funding bill with the help of Democrats. But there are several differences in the dynamics. While former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) claimed that he moved to oust McCarthy over policy gripes, McCarthy maintained that Gaetz had a personal vendetta against him over an ethics investigation. Delaying the election of a Speaker for multiple days, as was the case with McCarthy in 2023, would also clash with Congress’s statutory responsibility to count the electoral votes that certify Trump’s victory on Jan. 6. Johnson has also enjoyed the support of Trump, which helped him get nominated as Speaker in an unanimous internal voice vote in November. The Speaker on Friday night emphasized that he was in 'constant communication' with Trump during the continuing resolution negotiation process — and that he had talked to Elon Musk, who had posted incessantly against Johnson’s original bipartisan deal, within an hour of the stopgap and disaster aid package passing. Musk, in turn, posted on X that Johnson 'did a good job here, given the circumstances.' But some members think Trump could be doing more to signal his support for Johnson. Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) said that 'going multiple rounds, fighting with one another' over the Speakership, as members did with McCarthy over 15 ballots in 2023, would 'delay the work that we have to do to deliver on the America first mandate.' 'I think President-elect Trump can play an enormously constructive role in helping speaker Johnson get there early,' Barr said. Asked after the vote Friday if he is confident that he can keep the Speakership, and if he could win on the first ballot, Johnson said to each question: 'Yes.' Difficulties for Johnson will extend far beyond Jan. 3, though. 'There's going to be a reckoning when Trump figures out that Mike Johnson has constraints on him that were imposed before President Trump won the election,' Massie said, adding that there will be tensions between what Trump wants Johnson to do and what GOP members want him to do. Some of that tension emerged this week, when Trump made a last-minute demand to increase the debt limit as part of a deal to continue government funding. Trump wanted to get the issue out of the way before he takes office in January so Democrats could not use it as leverage, but many Republicans balked at raising the debt limit without significant spending cuts. In an attempt to appease Trump, Republicans struck an agreement to raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion in exchange for $2.5 trillion in net cuts to spending, done through a reconciliation package next year, two sources confirmed to The Hill. That adds a significant layer of complexity to an already-ambitious legislative agenda that Republicans were hoping to push through Congress and onto Trump’s desk without Democratic support. Republicans were already eyeing that party-line reconciliation process to extend tax cuts first passed under Trump’s term and to address border issues. And after some members of the House GOP are confirmed to join the Trump cabinet, Johnson will be able to afford zero defections on party-line measures until GOP replacements are chosen in special elections. 'It’s gonna be a fist fight on every vote,' Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) said. Given the steep challenges, Johnson was asked by a reporter Friday evening if he even wants to keep the job. 'Being Speaker of the House is a challenge in this modern era, but it’s a challenge that we accept,' Johnson responded. 'I wouldn't say it's the most fun job in the world all the time, but it's an important one. A hugely consequential moment for the country.'

Death toll in attack on Christmas market in Germany rises to 5, w...	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Germans on Saturday mourned both the victims and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor intentionally drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers, killing at least five people, including a small child, and injuring at least 200 others. Authorities arrested a 50-year-old man at the site of the attack in Magdeburg on Friday evening and took him into custody for questioning. He has lived in Germany for nearly two decades, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg. officials said. The governor of the surrounding state of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters that the death toll rose from two to five and that more than 200 people in total were injured. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that nearly 40 of them 'are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.' Several German media outlets identified the suspect as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Mourners lit candles and placed flowers outside a church near the market on the cold and gloomy day. Several people stopped and cried. A Berlin church choir whose members witnessed a previous Christmas market attack in 2016 sang Amazing Grace, a hymn about God's mercy, offering their prayers and solidarity with the victims. The man behind the attack There were still no answers Saturday as to what caused him to drive into a crowd in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. Describing himself as a former Muslim, the suspect shared dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he said was the 'Islamism of Europe.' Some described him as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers. Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann said he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile. 'After 25 years in this ‘business’ you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists — that really wasn’t on my radar, ' Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King’s College London, wrote on X. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn’t be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt’s governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' Magdeburg is still shaken The violence shocked Germany and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that’s part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt’s capital. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Chancellor Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser traveled to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening. Faeser ordered flags lowered to half-staff at federal buildings across the country. A recount of the horrifying attack Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers swarmed around the suspect and took him into custody. Thi Linh Chi Nguyen, a 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam whose salon is located in a mall across from the Christmas market, was on the phone during a break when she heard loud bangs and thought at first they were fireworks. She then saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car. Shaking as she described the horror of what she witnessed, she recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at the tram stop where the suspect was arrested. The number of injured people was overwhelming. 'My husband and I helped them for two hours. He ran back home and grabbed as many blankets as he could find because they didn’t have enough to cover the injured people. And it was so cold,' she said. The market itself was still cordoned off Saturday with red-and-white tape and police vans every 50 meters (about 54 yards). Police with machine pistols guarded every entry to the market. Some thermal security blankets still lay on the street. Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the attack on X. ___ Aboubakr reported from Cairo and Gera from Warsaw, Poland.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-germans-mourn-attack-on-christmas-market-with-no-answers-about-why/	2024-12-21T03:27:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6766a67f1a8b28.74242458.jpeg?w=900
House passes bill to avoid government shutdown	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The House voted to support a measure keeping the government funded past Friday night’s deadline, sending the bill to the Senate just hours before a looming shutdown. The chamber voted 366-34-1 in support of the legislation to avoid a shutdown. The Senate is expected to vote on the plan later Friday evening. After weeks of back and forth, Congress was able to come up with a funding bill to keep the government running. This marks the end of tumultuous negotiations on Capitol Hill. More Americans optimistic about coming year: Marist survey Republicans had abandoned a bipartisan plan Wednesday to prevent a shutdown after President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk came out against it. What is the spending bill? The spending bill lays out how to distribute federal money to agencies, departments and programs that keep the government running. Creating this budget has led to many clashes between Republicans and Democrats. What were the two sides arguing about? Trump had tied a demand for dealing with the debt ceiling to the dispute over government funding, saying one should not be addressed without the other. When he rejected the spending proposal on Wednesday, Trump said that he wanted the debt ceiling debate settled before he takes office next month. Warning of trouble ahead for Johnson and Republicans in Congress, Trump told Fox News Digital, 'Anybody that supports a bill that doesn’t take care of the Democrat quicksand known as the debt ceiling should be primaried and disposed of as quickly as possible.' GOP Senator Rand Paul pushes Elon Musk for House Speaker After meeting with his caucus, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries rejected any possibility that his members would bail out Republicans as the shutdown threat loomed. 'GOP extremists want House Democrats to raise the debt ceiling so that House Republicans can lower the amount of your Social Security check,' Jeffries posted Thursday on social media. 'Hard pass.' Jeffries and other Democrats said Republicans should honor the spending agreement that was negotiated before Trump got involved. Which agencies would have been impacted by a shutdown? Each federal agency determines its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, but basically any government operations deemed nonessential stop happening, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees would have seen their work disrupted. Wisconsin lawmakers to set up DOGE-inspired committee called ‘GOAT’ Sometimes workers would have been furloughed, meaning that they kept their jobs but temporarily didn't work until the government reopened. Other federal workers might have stayed on the job but without pay, with the expectation that they would be paid back in full once the government reopened. What was Elon Musk's role? Elon Musk brought to a sudden halt a bipartisan budget proposal by posting constantly on X (formerly Twitter) and threatening Republicans with primary challenges. The social media warnings preceded Trump's condemnation of a measure negotiated by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, which effectively killed the stopgap measure that was designed to prevent a partial shutdown of the federal government.

Live coverage: House to vote at 5 pm on new effort to prevent shu...	The House is poised to vote on a measure to keep the government funded past Friday night's midnight shutdown deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Friday afternoon that the House would vote on a modified version of the bill that was defeated Thursday — minus the debt ceiling provision pushed by President-elect Trump. Democrats and a few dozen Republicans on Thursday rejected the bill that paired a three-month government funding extension, $110 billion in disaster and farm aid and other measures with a two-year extension of the debt limit. Senate Republicans were left fuming over what they called the dysfunctional 's‑‑‑ show' and 'fiasco' they witnessed in the House, as two proposals to fund the government through Christmas failed this week. 'I guess it’s back to the drawing board,' incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told The Hill as he exited the Capitol. These 38 Republicans voted against the Trump-backed spending bill We'll be tracking developments here all day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/live-coverage-house-to-vote-at-5-pm-on-new-effort-to-prevent-shutdown/	2024-12-20T14:31:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/johnsonmike_111224gn11_w.jpg?w=900
Drones over New Jersey: Mystery continues month after first sight...	(NewsNation) — After more than a month of sightings across multiple states, lawmakers and the general public are no closer to finding out what the mysterious drones are spotted in New Jersey and a handful of other states. An unexplained large number of drones began flying over sensitive military sites in New Jersey in mid-November, and while the White House and the Pentagon insist they don't pose a threat, lawmakers are demanding answers. For the second week in a row, NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will examine the enduring mystery of the drones being spotted over New Jersey and other states. Tune in to Coulthart's second special report 'Drones over New Jersey' at 9 p.m. ET on Saturday, Dec. 21. Not sure where to watch NewsNation? Use our ChannelFinder app to locate NewsNation on your TV. And get caught up with what we know so far by watching last week's special report here. Why shooting down mystery drones carries big risks What are lawmakers doing about the drones? On Dec. 12, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with three other U.S. senators, sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Aviation Administration requesting a briefing on the situation. Since sightings of the drones have spread in news outlets and on social media, a slew of elected officials -- local, state and federal -- have been outspoken about what they call a lack of transparency from the government. FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey Last week, a group of New Jersey lawmakers met with state police and DHS, but some were left frustrated about the lack of answers they received. Republican New Jersey state Rep. Brian Bergen told NewsNation that meeting was 'a whole lot of nothing.' 'All they did was tell us they don’t know anything that’s going on,' he said. Where are the drones? Other than New Jersey, they have been spotted in other Northeastern states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Sightings have also been reported in California, Florida, Ohio and Minnesota. NewsNation confirmed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., received a classified briefing on the drones, and lawmakers on both sides have called for the drones to be intercepted. 'We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,' said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., last week. Eyewitness accounts of New Jersey drones include politicians, journalist FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey Following the large number of mysterious drone sightings, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said federal security agencies requested the flight restrictions, which are effective through Jan. 17. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the restrictions are out of an 'abundance of caution,' without explaining further.

Can you fly with pot? Here’s what the TSA says	(WJW) – Ohio is one of the most recent states to legalize recreational marijuana. About half the US has legalized recreational marijuana, and more states have legalized marijuana for medical use. So, what does that mean for you when you’re flying to see friends and family for the holidays – or any other time of year? How many local ER visits are blamed on marijuana? Can I travel on a plane with marijuana? The short answer is no. Most cannabis products remain illegal under federal law. Since TSA security is under federal jurisdiction, bringing marijuana through a TSA checkpoint could lead to criminal charges. Here’s the TSA’s official statement on traveling with marijuana – which applies to both carry-on and checked bags. Marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law except for products that contain no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis or that are approved by FDA. (See the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334.) TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law to local, state or federal authorities. TSA’s screening procedures are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers. Accordingly, TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs, but if any illegal substance is discovered during security screening, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer. TSA notes that its employees are not trained for drug screening and that they’re looking for security threats, not drugs. Will marijuana eventually be allowed? The rules will likely change if marijuana is reclassified. Marijuana is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Yes, marijuana can cause psychosis In the spring, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration proposed to shift marijuana from a Schedule I drug, which includes heroin and LSD, to a less tightly regulated 'Schedule III' drug, which includes ketamine and some anabolic steroids. Federal rules allow for some medical uses of Schedule III drugs. The proposed change faces a lengthy regulatory process, and there’s no timeline for the change as of now.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/can-you-fly-with-pot-heres-what-the-tsa-says/	2024-12-20T12:05:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2161792208.jpg?w=683

Would the US Postal Service stop during a shutdown?	(NewsNation) — A government shutdown will not affect the mail, meaning even if Congress does not pass a funding plan, holiday gifts still out for delivery should arrive. Congress has until midnight Saturday to avoid a government shutdown. If it misses the deadline, several agencies would not have the funds to continue operating, meaning some services would be delayed or stopped and federal workers would be furloughed or work without pay. What services are impacted when the government shuts down? However, the USPS is funded through the sale of its products and services, not by tax dollars, meaning it will stay operational if Congress fails to avert a shutdown. 'U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,' according to a 2023 post on the government agency’s website. Services that would be impacted by a shutdown National parks Facilities that require staffing would close but visitors could still access some memorials and open-air parks where staffing isn’t required. Federal courts Federal courts usually have enough money on hand from court filings and other fees to stay open for several weeks during shutdowns. After that, they curtail services. Federal prisons stay open. Veterans Veterans Administration hospitals stay open and benefit checks are issued during a shutdown, but new benefit applications and pending claims aren’t processed. Active duty military During a shutdown, military personnel would continue to work, but they don’t get paid until Congress provides funding. Some civilian military employees are furloughed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/would-post-offices-close-during-shutdown/	2024-12-20T07:58:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP20231702729442-e1730217747717.jpg?w=800
Richard Allen sentenced to 130 years for Delphi murders	(NewsNation) — Richard Allen, who was convicted of killing two Indiana girls in the 2017 Delphi murders, was sentenced to 130 in prison during a sentencing hearing held on Friday. The sentencing range for Allen was 45 years to 130 years in prison. He was given 65 years for counts three and four, to be served consecutively, for a total of 130 years. Counts one and two were vacated because of double jeopardy. Allen was convicted on Nov. 11 in the killings of Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14. A jury found him guilty of two counts of murder and two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case When he was arrested in October 2022, more than five years after the February 2017 killings, Allen was employed as a pharmacy technician just blocks from the county courthouse where he later stood trial. The trial came after repeated delays, a leak of evidence, the withdrawal of his public defenders and their reinstatement by the Indiana Supreme Court. Allen’s defense team has said that they would not participate in Friday’s sentencing hearing as they prepare to appeal Allen’s conviction. He has continued to maintain his innocence throughout the legal process.

What services are impacted when the government shuts down?	(NewsNation) — Federal lawmakers have until midnight Friday to pass a budget, or else the government will shut down, impacting millions of employees and consumers ahead of the holiday. Without a funding plan, the shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 21 and last until Congress passes a spending bill. Here are the government services and agencies that would be affected if the government shuts down. What does a government shut down impact? Federal employees, including military members, would not be paid. Non-essential agencies would stop service, while essential workers, such as police officers and air traffic controllers, would still report for duty. Citizens who don't work for the government may be impacted as well if certain agencies are closed or understaffed. Johnson says plan C reached to avert shutdown, vote expected Air Travel: The Transportation Security Administration is considered essential, so employees would be working without pay. Still, delays and interruptions could happen. Social Security: Payments for current recipients would continue because Social Security is deemed essential, but services for new claims could be delayed due to furloughed staff. Medicare and Medicaid: Current recipients would continue to receive benefits, but new applicants could see delays. Mail Service: The United States Postal Service would continue operations and remain open. Student Loans: Student loan services would continue to process payments, and payments will still be due. Speaking with an agent or getting help may come with delays, however. Government employee pay: Furloughed federal employees would receive back pay when a shut down ends, but government contractors will not. Passport Services: The processing of passport applications may be slowed or halted. FEMA cleanup and protection: The agency will still respond to emergencies in the event of a disaster, but long-term projects would be delayed. National Parks and Museums: Many national parks and federally funded museums would likely close or have limited operating hours. Food Assistance Programs: People who receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would continue to payments, but new enrollment or renewals could face delays.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/government-shutdown-impacted-agencies-and-services/	2024-12-20T06:17:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2184674649.jpg?w=900
Amazon drivers strike at multiple hubs over pay, conditions	SKOKIE, Ill. (NewsNation) — More Amazon warehouse workers are set to join the picket lines on Friday, as thousands of workers affiliated with the Teamsters union continue their strike, demanding higher wages and improved safety conditions just days before Christmas. Delivery drivers went on strike Thursday at seven major hubs across the United States, fighting for better pay and safer working conditions. The NYPD reported two arrests during a strike in the New York City borough of Queens but didn't specify why. The timing is strategic, as Amazon relies heavily on drivers during the holidays, and delays in deliveries could Amazon says the workers represent a small fraction of their workforce and expect holiday shipments to be delivered on time. Travel tracker: What you should know as you prepare for holiday travel Why are workers striking? The Teamsters said the workers, who voted to authorize strikes in recent days, joined picket lines on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. Drivers argue they should get paid the same as United Postal Service workers or UPS drivers. Amazon announced plans to raise wages for its subcontracted drivers to $22 an hour following union pressure. However, Teamsters members driving for UPS earn an average of $49 an hour. 'I'm gonna get paid this Friday, and more than half my check is going to go towards paying bills, paying insurance, and then my benefits that get taken out. More than half my check is about just benefits alone,' an Amazon worker told NewsNation. 'We should be getting fair pay, especially with the cost of living in California.' Where are the strikes happening? Amazon employs a few hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters union has primarily focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors handling Amazon's deliveries. However, Amazon has rejected calls to negotiate, since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees. Teamsters also say the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers, totaling about 10,000 Amazon workers nationwide — a small portion of Amazon's 1.5 million employees. The union hasn't disclosed the number of workers participating in the strike or how long it will last. But it included Amazon-employed warehouse workers in San Francisco and subcontracted delivery drivers in cities like Chicago, New York City, Atlanta, and other parts of California. Will Amazon strike affect your holiday packages? How has Amazon responded? Amazon says the strike will not affect customers receiving their packages on time and argues the drivers are not its employees. The company also says these actions are protests, not strikes since no Amazon employee or third-party driver pays Teamsters union dues. 'They've worked hard over the last several weeks to drum up a lot of attention and also to try to convince employees and third-party drivers to join them out there on their protest lines. They weren't successful so they brought in a bunch of outsiders to harass our employees and to make it difficult for them to get in and out of our facilities,' said Kelly Nantel, Amazon's director of Global Media Relations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/amazon-drivers-strike-multiple-hubs-over-pay-conditions/	2024-12-20T05:21:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2190075792.jpg?w=900
Johnson says plan C reached to avert shutdown, vote expected	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Republicans have arrived at a plan C to avert a shutdown and the House will vote Friday morning on the legislation. 'Yeah, yeah, we have a plan,' Johnson said Friday morning as he entered the Capitol. 'We're expecting votes this morning, so you all stay tuned. We've got a plan.' He did not say what it entails. Lawmakers have little time to avoid a shutdown: Government funding runs out when the clock strikes midnight late Friday. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) said on CNBC on shortly after Johnson’s comments Friday morning that he thinks Washington will probably avoid a shutdown since 'we’re pushed up against Christmas here,' alluding to the likely path forward without directly confirming it, saying that will be up to the Speaker’s office to announce it. 'There’s a chance today a clean CR [continuing resolution], short term clean CR, it may be for two, three weeks,' Mullin said. 'That was something that was discussed, you know, late last night, you know, even some discussions this morning. I’m not going to say that’s going to happen, but you know, that’s really the option that’s on the table.' If Johnson does move forward with a clean, short-term stopgap, it is unclear if that will muster enough votes to clear the House. A handful of Republicans have historically opposed continuing resolutions, and Democrats have evaluated the Speaker’s proposals on a case-by-case basis, two factors that are fueling the chances of a shutdown so close to the deadline. It's also unclear if Johnson’s plan will appease President-Trump and his demand to raise the debt ceiling as part of the CR. Friday’s vote will be the latest effort by the House to fund the government ahead of the partial shutdown deadline. And it will come hours after the House on Thursday voted down Johnson’s plan B bill that combined a three-month government funding extension with $110 billion in disaster and farm aid, some other policy measures, and a two-year suspension of the debt limit — the latter of which was a last-minute demand by Trump. The failed vote marked a blow for Johnson and Trump, who endorsed the package, urged lawmakers to support it and threatened primary challengers for anyone who opposed it. Aside from the debt limit increase, the plan B proposal was a stripped-down version of an initial funding deal that Johnson negotiated with Democrats and revealed earlier in the week. That initial bill included measures like a health care deal and an increase in pay for members of Congress that ballooned the bill to over 1,500 pages, prompting outrage from Republicans, Trump, and Elon Musk helped kill the package. Members on Thursday night were unsure how they would solve the funding impasse after the plan B failed. They will have to not only get a bill that can appease Trump and pass in the narrow House GOP majority, but get approval from the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House. Johnson's comments Friday morning came moments before he was scheduled to huddle in his office with members of the far-right Freedom Caucus and at least two figures in the incoming Trump administration: JD Vance, the vice president-elect, and Russell Vought, who served as head of the White House budget office in Trump's first term. A long list of conservative House Freedom Caucus members trickled into the room after Johnson's arrival, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Andy Harris (R-Md.), the chairman of the group. None of them commented. 'It's gonna be beautiful,' said GOP Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.). House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) also arrived at Johnson’s office early Friday morning. Trump’s last-minute demand to address the debt limit has drastically complicated the government funding process. It emerged as one of the main sticking points in negotiations, which is drawing opposition from Democrats and Republicans. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) wrote on social media Thursday that increasing the borrowing limit at this juncture was a 'hard pass,' in-part prompting most of the caucus to oppose the proposal that hit the floor that day. On the other side of the aisle, conservative Republicans have criticized raising the debt ceiling without cutting spending. 'New bill: $110BB in deficit spending (unpaid for), $4 TRILLION+ debt ceiling increase with $0 in structural reforms for cuts. Time to read the bill: 1.5 hours. I will vote no,' Roy wrote on X. Congress is not expected to have to deal with increasing the debt until summer 2025.

Luigi Mangione held in same jail as 'Diddy'	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, will reportedly be housed in the same New York City jail as rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs. 'He just walked into paradise,' said Gene Borrello, a former organized crime associate who spent 13 years behind bars, including at BMDC and Rikers Island. Mangione will be at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center. Some previously suspected Mangione may have been booked at Rikers Island jail. 'Rikers Island is an absolute hell hole... It's the most violent jail in the country,' Borrello said on NewsNation's 'Banfield' Thursday night. 'So he actually got lucky. He should be happy the feds came and got him because he's going to be in a much safer place.' Borrello said he thinks Mangione will be in the 4 North unit, which is also where Diddy is. 'It's going to be with a whole bunch of other high-profile people with no violence going on,' Borrello said, but if he's housed with the general population, then 'he's going to be dealing with a lot of gang members. They all hate murder.' NewsNation contributor faces death threats for Mangione analysis Could Mangione face the death penalty? Mangione was extradited to New York Thursday facing 11 federal criminal charges, including first-degree murder, and could face the death penalty. 'I have rarely seen the kind of support pretrial for somebody charged with murder that there is for this young man,' said criminal attorney Mark Geragos, whose daughter works for the law firm representing Diddy and Mangione. 'The polling I've seen... this guy has support exceeding 40% in people under 30. It's astonishing,' Geragos said, referring to an Emerson College poll that found 41% of people ages 18-29 think Mangione's actions were 'acceptable.' Geragos said he thinks the death penalty is 'entirely likely,' but it could be a difficult task for prosecutors in federal court in New York City, which is traditionally 'anti-death penalty.' Shooting of Brian Thompson Brian Thompson, 50, was fatally shot just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 in front of a Hilton hotel while walking to UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting in New York City. The words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on bullet shell casings found at the scene. It is an apparent reference to the title of the book 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which covers ways insurance companies reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. NYPD finds drone in Brooklyn, owner steps forward: Report Authorities arrested Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania on Dec. 9. With him at the time were a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting, police said. Mangione also had a manifesto and a spiral notebook with a 'to-do' list. In the manifesto, Mangione wrote that he acted alone and that he 'apologizes for any strife or traumas, but it had to be done.' 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' he wrote. Mangione case reactions Thompson's death and Mangione's arrest have sparked strong reactions both online and in real life. Before Thursday's hearing, some supporters of Mangione were at the courthouse holding signs saying 'Luigi the people hear you,' 'Murder for profit is terrorism' and 'Free Luigi.' At the Altoona McDonald's where police arrested Mangione, employees told NewsNation they hired security guards after they received death threats. Those who live near that McDonald's say the arrest was quiet, and they had no idea what was happening until it showed up on the news.

Republicans scramble for funding plan C as shutdown deadline draw...	Congress is racing toward a shutdown at the end of the day Friday, and Republicans appear no closer to finding a path forward that will keep the lights on and appease President-elect Trump. The latest setback roiled the House on Thursday evening, when Democrats and a band of Republicans rejected a bill that paired a three-month government funding extension, $110 billion in disaster and farm aid and other measures with a two-year suspension of the debt limit — the latter of which was a last-minute demand by Trump. That plan B was cobbled together after GOP lawmakers, Trump and Elon Musk torpedoed the first deal Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) negotiated with Democrats, with the influential Republicans criticizing the policy add-ons included — like a health care policy deal and cost of living raise for members of Congress — that ballooned the legislation to over 1,500 pages. With Johnson’s first two proposals up in flames, Republicans are unsure where to turn. 'There’s no plan,' Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said after the plan B vote failed, adding: 'Trump wants the thing to shut down.' Johnson told reporters Thursday night, shortly after the failed vote, that Republicans would 'regroup' and 'come up with another solution,' adding 'stay tuned.' But Republicans, who are eager to stay on the incoming president’s good side, and Johnson, trying to keep his grasp on the gavel come next year, are struggling to unify behind a plan. Trump’s last-minute debt limit increase demand is opposed by many Republicans — 38 of whom joined with Democrats to tank the plan B bill on Thursday. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Republicans are not currently planning to try to bring the bill up through a longer regular rule process, which would require near-unified GOP support for passage. Beyond the struggles in the House, any bill would have to not only pass the GOP-controlled House but get approval from Democratic-controlled Senate and White House, which are rejecting the last-minute GOP changes. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) kept his posture steady even following the vote, indicating he was in no mood for negotiating further after Johnson reneged on their original accord. 'It's a good thing the bill failed in the House,' Schumer told reporters. 'And now it's time to go back to the bipartisan agreement.' Senators voting on an unrelated bill across the Capitol complex as the latest stopgap measure was going up in smoke were unsure where negotiations will go from here with the clock ticking down toward a shutdown and a likely pre-Christmas weekend session. 'I guess it’s back to the drawing board,' Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) told The Hill as he exited the Capitol. 'We’ll see. We’ll figure out in the House what they want to do next, and they’ll digest this last effort and see what Plan B is.' 'We have to be able to figure out a path forward,' the incoming majority leader continued. 'We’re little over 24 hours away from a shutdown, so it’s going to have to happen quickly, but we’ll figure it out.' With little direction, members were throwing out ideas that could potentially stick. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) predicted a three-week 'clean' continuing resolution without a hike in the debt limit could be the next course of action. He, however, acknowledged that he is 'labor, not management.' Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), the top Senate GOP appropriator, told reporters she would back a multi-week continuing resolution that would help get members through the holiday season, but conceded that she is unsure where negotiators will go next with the hourglass running out. 'I don't know what the plan is now,' she said, adding that the inclusion of a debt ceiling increase 'seems to have aggravated the Democrats.' 'My number one goal is to prevent a government shutdown,' she added. The reaction was similar on the House side, where Republicans floated various ideas with no off-ramp in sight. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), for example, told reporters after Thursday’s failed vote that he pitched Johnson on splitting the stopgap package into four separate bills: A clean continuing resolution, disaster aid, the farm bill extension and the debt limit suspension, passing them under one procedural rule then voting on each one individually. Massie said he pitched Johnson on the idea and that 'it wasn’t rejected outright.' It’s also unclear if Trump would support that. Massie said that Trump’s team initially asked for a five-year extension of the debt limit, so it would not come up again during his presidential term. Another idea brought up to Johnson was to add spending cuts to the bill to offset the unpaid disaster and farm aid spending, one source said, as a means of trying to woo hardline conservatives to support the bill. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), the chairman of the self-proclaimed pragmatic Main Street Caucus, said he 'suggested a number' of ideas to Johnson, but would not divulge specifics. Another House Republican predicted to The Hill that Republicans would move to a 'clean' continuing resolution next. Another GOP lawmaker, meanwhile, said the 'rumor' in GOP circles is that the Senate will try to pass the initial proposal negotiated by congressional leaders in an attempt to 'jam' the lower chamber. Senate Republicans are balking at that idea — but not ruling it out. Collins, the top Senate GOP appropriator, told reporters that a bill originating from the Senate is not the 'preferred way to proceed,' but is something she could potentially foresee amid the ongoing troubles. 'I don't know what the plan is now,' she said, adding that the inclusion of a debt ceiling increase 'seems to have aggravated the Democrats.' Collins also said that she would be supportive of a short-term measure that would get lawmakers past the holiday season. 'Yes,' she said about the possibility of a three-week 'clean' bill. 'My number one goal is to prevent a government shutdown.' As the clock ticks to Friday at 11:59 p.m., lawmakers are becoming acutely aware of the time crunch they face to craft a proposal that can muster bipartisan support, move it through the House and usher it through the Senate. With time running out, Republicans are urging their colleagues to get down to business. 'At some point, let’s just put on our big boy, big girl pants, let’s understand that we got to get to 218 here and we got to get 60 over there,' Dusty Johnson said. 'Ideas that don’t move us in that direction are not helpful.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-scramble-for-funding-plan-c-as-shutdown-deadline-draws-near/	2024-12-20T01:51:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/IMG_4878.jpeg?w=900
House rejects Johnson's plan B to prevent shutdown	The House on Thursday torpedoed Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) plan B to avert a government shutdown and suspend the debt limit, dealing a blow to the GOP leader and catapulting the conference back to square one as it stares down Friday's funding deadline. The measure — which Johnson rolled out hours roughly three hours before the vote — failed to clear the chamber in a 174-235-1 vote, falling short of the two-thirds threshold needed for passage under the fast-track suspension of the rules process. The bill met its demise after Democrats — led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), who called the legislation 'laughable' — and a handful of conservative Republicans came out against the legislation, largely over the inclusion of a two-year suspension of the debt limit, which was a demand made by President-elect Trump. It remains unclear what path Johnson pursues next. Given the Republican opposition, the bill is unlikely to pass in the slim GOP majority if Johnson attempts to another vote it through a longer regular rule process that requires just a simple majority. After the vote, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said leadership did not plan to send the bill to the Rules Committee. 'Not on this bill … not right now,' he said. 'We're going to have some more talks. I won't say anything's dead because we're going to continue having talks.' Speaking to reporters as the vote occurred, Johnson did not say what the next step will be. The clock, however, is ticking: If Congress does not approve any legislation by 11:59 p.m. on Friday, the government will shut down. The unsuccessful vote deals a blow to Johnson, who is scrambling to avert a shutdown by the looming deadline — and keep his grasp of the gavel come next year — and to Trump, who endorsed the package after torpedoing the Speaker’s initial proposal. Johnson rolled out the plan B Thursday afternoon after hours of closed-door meetings with an ideologically diverse array of House Republicans. The proposal would have kept the government funded at current levels through March 14, suspended the debt limit for two years and appropriated roughly $100 billion in disaster relief and about $10 billion for farmer economic assistance, while stripping away a number of policy provisions that were in an original 1,500-page deal. Trump quickly backed the package, calling it 'a very good Deal for the American people' and urging lawmakers to support it. But a handful of Republicans rejected that call almost immediately, hammering away at the legislation. 'More debt. More government. Increasing the Credit Card $4 trillion with ZERO spending restraint and cuts. HARD NO,' Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, wrote on X. Democrats also came out against the legislation in droves. During a closed-door House Democratic Caucus meeting after the bill’s rollout, lawmakers were heard chanting 'hell no.' Thursday’s proceedings mark the latest twist in this week’s government funding debacle, which began after congressional negotiators rolled out a stopgap, heated up when Republicans of all stripes came out against the measure, and reached a fever pitch after Trump came out against the bipartisan bill, tanking its prospects of clearing the chamber. The series of events sent Republicans back to square one, huddling in Johnson’s office for hours trying to come up with an alternative plan. Vice President-elect JD Vance joined those talks at various points. The initial funding plan, which was crafted by congressional negotiators, would have funded the government at current levels through March 14, extended the farm bill for one year and appropriated roughly $100 billion in disaster relief and $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers, among other authorizations. Johnson, however, never put that legislation on the floor after Trump, his allies and a large number of Republicans said they would oppose it. Trump’s demand to lift the debt limit hurled an eleventh-hour curveball into government funding talks, inserting the issue — which typically requires painstaking and lengthy negotiations — into the discussions with just hours to go until the funding deadline. Congress is expected to have to act on the debt by at least mid-2025. But Trump on Wednesday expressed concern about Democrats using the must-pass issue as a leverage point, calling it a 'TRAP' at one point.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-rejects-johnsons-plan-b-to-prevent-shutdown/	2024-12-19T16:00:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/johnsonmike_121024gn07_w.jpg?w=900
Shutdown odds rapidly rise as House seeks plan B	The odds of a shutdown were rapidly growing on Thursday after President-elect Trump upended the talks by urging GOP lawmakers to shutter the government unless Democrats agree to a clean stopgap spending bill that raises or abolishes the debt limit. 'If we don’t get it, then we’re going to have a shutdown, but it’ll be a Biden shutdown, because shutdowns only inure to the person who’s president,' Trump told ABC’s Jonathan Karl. Trump’s blunt demand leaves leaders in Congress scrambling for some kind of compromise measure, and they have less than 36 hours to do it, heightening the chance of a federal shutdown over the weekend and possibly past Christmas. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is the figure at the center of the storm, and he and other Republicans in the House were seeking to pick up the pieces after their initial compromise bill was toasted by Trump and his allies on Wednesday. The House GOP is eyeing a plan B that would cut some of the parts of the bill that caused Wednesday’s political storm, including a pay hike for lawmakers. Yet their new plan would not include Trump’s demand for a debt ceiling increase, a move that risks triggering his opposition. Instead, two sources told The Hill, GOP lawmakers would commit to raising the borrowing limit twice next year through reconciliation, the budget process that Republicans are relying on to pass Trump’s agenda without Democratic support. 'They want a commitment from the Republicans that we can move during reconciliation and support a debt ceiling increase so that President Trump can function and do what he needs to do,' one of the sources said. Some of Trump’s government affairs staffers are in the meeting, the source said. Republican senators said Thursday that they have little idea how a shutdown will be averted given that Trump has shifted the debate so dramatically only a few hours before federal funding is due to lapse. 'I honestly don’t know what the endgame is,' said one GOP senator who requested anonymity to comment on the sense of confusion in the Senate Republican Conference. 'I don’t get a sense of where the House is. 'I just don’t have any idea how they’re going to get out of this,' the senator added. Doubts were also being expressed on the House side of the Capitol. Asked about the odds of a shutdown, Freedom Caucus member Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said: 'Well, I’ll say it is, in fact, noon, 36 hours before we run out of funding.' 'When you’re 24 hours out, you never know,' Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) told reporters when asked about the likelihood of a shutdown. 'We’re trying to work on something that we could either get done tomorrow or over the weekend, so it’s mitigate and minimize.' Trump’s intervention in the talks, which came after his allies Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy railed against the bill on social media, has left plenty of observers doubtful of the GOP’s chances. It has also raised risks for Johnson’s Speakership. Two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), said in the last 36 hours they would not back Johnson for Speaker. He faces a vote two weeks from Friday. Trump offered only a muted endorsement of Johnson keeping his job as Speaker, despite having endorsed him strongly in a meeting with GOP lawmakers a week after the election. 'We’ll see,' Trump told NBC when asked whether he still has confidence in Johnson. One Republican lawmaker who had spoken to Trump recently said the president-elect was not aware of the scope and many of the details of the government funding and disaster relief bill that Johnson put together behind closed doors with a handful of other leaders. One source close to Trump's orbit told The Hill that getting rid of Johnson could create even more complications for an already fractious GOP at a time when they are hoping to unify around Trump's agenda. 'There are a lot of people that aren’t happy with Johnson, but you get rid of Johnson, then what?' the source said. 'It’s the ‘then what’ that's part of the issue.' Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a staunch Trump ally, said it wouldn’t be the end of the world if the government shut down over Christmas, arguing that most people will be on vacation and federal employees will get paid anyway. 'Everybody’s on vacation, nobody’s not going to get paid,' he said, arguing that it would be better for President Biden, President-elect Trump and congressional leaders to have some time to think about how to solve the government funding and debt-limit impasse over Christmas and New Year’s Day. The House Republican leaders gathered midday in Johnson’s Capitol office to hash out a plan-B stopgap included House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (Minn.), House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole (Okla.), Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (Fla.) and leaders from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, the more centrist Republican Governance Group, Main Street Caucus and Republican Study Committee. James Braid, the incoming White House head of legislative affairs, was spotted walking into the Speaker’s suite. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), the chair of the Main Street Caucus, told reporters the internal talks were 'making progress' but declined to reveal any details. A big and important question to any internal GOP plan is whether House Democrats will back it. Republicans are almost certain to need Democratic votes, and if they take the bill to the floor under a suspension of House rules, it will need to pass with a two-thirds majority. Democratic support will also be needed in the Senate. But there’s no guarantee that Democrats will be ready to accept a new offer from Johnson after spending the last several weeks negotiating the continuing resolution that sparked strong pushback from Trump and House conservatives Tuesday and Wednesday. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) insisted Thursday that the spending deal that Johnson had agreed to initially was the 'best path' for avoiding a shutdown. 'We are prepared to move forward with the bipartisan agreement that we thought was negotiated in good faith with House Republicans, along with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans, that meets the needs of the American people at this moment in time,' he said. But Jeffries also left the door open to supporting a new stopgap that would include only government funding, farm aid and disaster relief. 'The debt-limit issue and discussion is premature, at best,' Jeffries said.

Dems say 'hell no' to GOP plan B on government funding, debt ceil...	House Democrats are rallying in overwhelming opposition to the Republicans' second stab at a government funding bill, vowing to sink it on the House floor and force GOP leaders back to the table to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. Huddling behind closed doors in the Capitol basement, party leaders detailed their opposition to the bill and urged their troops to join them in voting against it. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) foreshadowed that message going in, saying the GOP bill is 'laughable.' If there were any questions about the message resonating, they were dispelled by the loud chants of 'hell no' that could be heard deep into the hallway outside the meeting room. 'You heard the two-word position,' Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said afterward. 'We're all there,' echoed Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). The vote, which is expected shortly after 6 p.m. on Thursday, is governed by a fast-track procedure known as the suspension calendar, which requires two-thirds of the House chamber to pass the bill. The Democrats' opposition means GOP leaders will fall far short of that bar, forcing Republicans either to attempt to move the bill through the Rules Committee, where hard-line conservatives could sink it, or abandon the bill in favor of a plan C. President-elect Trump brought Congress to a standstill this week when he came out against the previous bipartisan funding plan that both sides had agreed to, while also making a last-minute demand for Republicans to put in language tackling the nation’s borrowing ceiling. 'Unless the Democrats terminate or substantially extend Debt Ceiling now, I will fight ‘till the end,' he wrote in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday. He also warned any Republicans who back a stopgap funding bill without the debt ceiling component will face primary challenges. Lawmakers are expected to have to tackle raising the debt ceiling, which caps how much money the Treasury can owe to cover the country’s bills, next summer. Rep. Richard Neal (Mass.), top Democrat on the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said 'the debt ceiling is legitimate, but it has to be decided and discussed in a separate forum.' 'It has been demagogued by both sides over my time here, and I do think deserving of a conversation. But not to be had with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning,' Neal said. The debt limit has previously been used as a key point of leverage for the party out of power, which can demand major concessions in return for agreeing to raise the debt limit. And Republicans have successfully used the task of acting on the debt limit in the past to secure concessions from Democrats — most recently last year. Congress currently has until Friday to pass legislation to keep the government funded or risk a shutdown. Democrats have pushed for Republicans to uphold a previously agreed-to, roughly 1,500-page package to keep the government funded that also includes a sweeping bipartisan health care deal, along with about $110 billion in disaster relief and economic assistance for farmers. Jeffries earlier Thursday opened the door to a slimmed-down package, but one without a debt ceiling suspension. In addition to suspending the debt limit for two years, the new 116-page plan unveiled by Republicans also includes billions of dollars in disaster relief and economic assistance, but strips out reforms to how pharmacy benefit managers operate and chips away at extensions for some health care programs that were included in the earlier package. It also cuts other bipartisan provisions singled out by Trump allies that would end a years-long pay freeze for congressional members and language that would transfer administrative jurisdiction over RFK Stadium to the District of Columbia. Trump is urging both sides to vote for the legislation on Thursday night, saying the bill 'will keep the Government open, fund our Great Farmers and others, and provide relief for those severely impacted by the devastating hurricanes.' 'A VERY important piece, VITAL to the America First Agenda, was added as well - The date of the very unnecessary Debt Ceiling will be pushed out two years, to January 30, 2027,' Trump said. 'Now we can Make America Great Again, very quickly, which is what the People gave us a mandate to accomplish.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dems-say-hell-no-to-gop-plan-b-on-government-funding-debt-ceiling/	2024-12-19T15:01:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/jeffrieshakeem_092524gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump backs plan B spending deal, urges swift passage	President-elect Trump on Thursday backed a new spending deal brokered by House Republicans to avert a shutdown after an initial proposal was torpedoed amid opposition from Trump and several of his allies. The plan now includes a two-year suspension of the debt ceiling in what became an unexpected sticking point by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance in the negotiations in the last 24 hours. 'All Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote ‘YES’ for this Bill, TONIGHT!' Trump posted on Truth Social. In a break from that package, however, language that would provide lawmakers with a pay raise was removed. The legislation also will not contain the E15 ethanol provision. It will, however, including $100 billion for disaster aid $10 billion in farmer economic assistance. Trump had come out against the previous agreement reached late Tuesday, focusing specially on concerns that it did not raise the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling, which limits how much money the federal government can borrow in part to pay off its debts, was set to come up as an issue in June during Trump's first term. The president-elect had argued lawmakers should deal with the debt ceiling as part of government funding talks now under President Biden, seeking to remove it as a potentially thorny issue for him after he takes office in January. A vote is scheduled for Thursday night, but it remains unclear whether it will pass both chambers. Some House Republicans have balked at raising the debt ceiling, and Democrats hold a majority in the Senate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-plan-b-spending-deal/	2024-12-19T14:57:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Politics-Johnson_071824_AP_Matt-Rourke.jpg?w=900
Travel tracker: What you should know as you prepare for holiday t...	(NewsNation) — Nearly 120 million people are expected to travel at least 50 miles away from home over the Christmas and New Year holidays. The heavy traffic load of cars, buses, trains and airplanes over the coming two weeks could create snags in arrival times, but there are ways to make your holiday travel plans smoother. The American Automobile Association estimates that 119.3 million Americans will venture away from home during the year-end holidays. The travel period extends from Saturday through Jan. 2. The agency’s domestic travel prediction would surpass a previous record set in 2019 by 64,000 travelers. AAA said 3 million more people will travel for the holidays than last year. Disney vacations push families into debt, but 59% say it’s ‘worth it’ AAA estimates that 90% of holiday travelers (107 million) will commute by car while 7.85 million people will fly to their destinations. An additional 4.47 million people will travel by bus, train or cruise ship, up 10% from 2023. Weather forecasts affecting travel Several states could experience wintery bursts of weather in the coming days and leading up to Christmas, forecasters predict. With the year-end travel season kicking off this weekend, winter-related weather alerts are expected to begin Thursday for North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. The National Weather Service alerts and advisories are associated with an Alberta clipper, which originates in western Canada. The system could produce heavy snow, high winds and icy roads for the affected areas. The NWS said that once the system arrives in the Northeast, flurries and spotty snow could have mild travel impacts. However, meteorologists say that the clipper could possibly run into a storm system that is reportedly building off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. If the two systems converge, that could create a major travel disruption over the next several days, including hazardous conditions along the I-95 corridor that could affect major cites on the East Coast such as New York and Boston. How drone activity could affect US holiday travel plans Rainstorms are also expected to hit the Pacific Northwest, including Washington, Idaho, Oregon and northern California before Christmas. The storms likely will produce heavy rain and mountain snow and wind that should begin early next week and extend through the day after Christmas. The storms could cause air traffic delays between San Francisco and Seattle and could also hamper drivers traveling in higher elevation areas including Donner Pass in California and Snoqualmie Pass in Washington, Accuweather reported. Gas prices ahead of holiday travel Americans traveling by car this year are receiving an added holiday gift as Christmas gas prices nationwide are expected to be the lowest in four years. GasBuddy estimates that the price at the pumps will be a national average of $2.95 per gallon Christmas Day. Gas prices have finally gotten closer to normal thanks to the Federal Reserve, which has been cutting back on high interest rates that slowed the economy in recent years, GasBuddy reported. Other factors include a weak Chinese economy as well as the passage of time since the economy was growing at a 'blistering pace.' The nation’s lowest gas prices are expected to be found in Oklahoma ($2.46 per gallon), Texas ($2.53) and Mississippi ($2.55 per gallon). The highest prices are in Hawaii ($4.58 per gallon), California ($4.31 per gallon) and Washington ($3.93 per gallon). Holiday flight status The record number of people traveling by air over the next few weeks will increase traffic in and around the nation’s airports. Weather conditions could affect whether flights depart and arrive on time. The TSA estimates that it will screen more than 39 million people during the year-end holidays. Will Amazon strike affect your holiday packages? The heavy rains that are expected to hit the West Coast could lead to delays for passengers traveling through Seattle and San Francisco. Should the Alberta clipper and storm system that is brewing off the East Coast develop into a significant weather event, airports in New York and Boston could see travel delays, according to the weather service. Fliers can use the FlightAware site to track the status of their plane. For those who do find themselves rerouted, delayed or stuck, the Department of Transportation maintains a list of rights for passengers, including how to contact the department if one believs an airline carrier has violated rules around refunds or compensation. Will a possible United flight attendant strike affect air travel? United Airlines flight attendants were expected to begin demonstrating outside of airports across the country Thursday as part of an ongoing contract dispute between union flight attendants and the carrier. The union said that flight attendants have been working without a contract since 2021 and filed for federal mediation nearly a year ago. The union reported that in August, more than 99% of flight attendants represented by the union agreed to strike. Will drones affect holiday travel? The FBI has received tips about more than 5,000 drone sightings in recent weeks around the United States. The sightings have included reports of drone activity around airports in New York and Boston, including sightings that closed down the runways at Stewart International Airport in New York for an hour. No flights were affected by the activity, officials said. Two Massachusetts men were also recently arrested in connection with allegations they were flying a drone too closely to the airspace at Logan International Airport in Boston. Federal officials, including President Joe Biden, have said they do not believe there is any public safety risk associated with the drone sightings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/holidays/travel-tracker-what-you-to-know-as-you-prepare-for-holiday-travel/	2024-12-19T14:27:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2168330898.jpg?w=900
FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey	(NewsNation) — The Federal Aviation Administration has issued flight restrictions on drones over parts of New Jersey after a large number of mysterious drone sightings have been reported all over the state. The FAA temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17. The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. The agency has warned that 'deadly force' could be used against the drones if they pose an 'imminent security threat,' and that the government is using 'drone busters' to take down unauthorized flyers. Eyewitness accounts of New Jersey drones include politicians, journalist The agency said pilots who fail to abide by those restrictions could be 'intercepted, detained, and interviewed by the law enforcement/security personnel.' Democratic U.S. Rep. Joshua S. Gottheimer of New Jersey has called on the agency to do a public briefing to explain the call to ban drones. 'Decisions like these made in a vacuum only lead to more confusion and uncertainty. These federal agencies must do better by Jersey families,' he said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said the restrictions are out of an 'abundance of caution,' without explaining further. The agency also restricted uncrewed aircraft systems and certain flights. FBI says it has no answers for drones seen over New Jersey Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said it’s unlikely the drones are engaged in intelligence gathering, given how loud and bright they are. He reiterated this week that the drones being reported are not being operated by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Republicans announce funding agreement, Thursday vote as shutdown...	House Republicans have reached an agreement on a plan B to avert a government shutdown ahead of Friday’s deadline and plan to vote Thursday, lawmakers announced. The bill, titled the American Relief Act, includes a three-month continuation of government funding and a two-year suspension of the debt limit, a provision that President-elect Trump called for Wednesday. It keeps a chunk of the bipartisan provisions from the initial package negotiated by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) while stripping out controversial measures like a pay raise for members of Congress — but there are other key differences. Getting the bill across the finish line will be tough. Democrats still control the Senate and White House, and the plan B package is already getting opposition from hard-line conservatives in the House. Because leadership is bringing the bill to the floor under a suspension of the rules, it needs two-thirds support to pass. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) quickly panned the new bill. 'The Musk-Johnson proposal is not serious — it’s laughable. Extreme MAGA Republicans are driving us to a government shutdown,' Jeffries said. Clocking in at 116 pages, the legislation is significantly shorter than the more than 1,500-page bipartisan deal from earlier in the week. One source said a vote is expected on the bill at 6:30 p.m EST. The bill keeps roughly $100 billion in disaster relief and about $10 billion for farmer economic assistance, in line with the dollar amounts included in the previous bipartisan funding agreement struck days back. And it will include a one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill. In a break from Johnson’s initial package, however, language that would provide lawmakers with a pay increase was removed. Sources also said a deal for year-round E15 ethanol sales will not be included. It includes extensions for some health care programs — but not all that were in the original deal. And reforms to how pharmacy benefit managers operate were stripped from the package — a bipartisan measure that significantly added to the initial bill’s length and complexity — were removed. Reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which got heat from Elon Musk and right-wing commentators, was removed. The SUPPORT Act, a bipartisan bill to address the opioid crisis, was also stripped. The new package also doesn’t include previous language that would transfer administrative jurisdiction over RFK Stadium to the District of Columbia. The move comes after Musk also elevated misinformation that the prior package included a provision to 'facilitate a $3 billion NFL Stadium' in D.C. Federal funding for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore that was destroyed by a cargo ship crash earlier this year remains in the new bill. One source said the bill will be titled the American Relief Act. Top House Republicans told reporters they plan to vote on the agreement Thursday, as Friday’s shutdown deadline rapidly approaches. It remains unclear, however, if the legislation will muster enough support to pass. Even some Republicans teed off on the agreement quickly after details leaked: Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) called it a 'bad deal' on Sean Hannity’s radio show. Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.) also expressed early skepticism of the bill to reporters: 'Tell me what changed that was good. I just don't understand unless somebody's missing something or somebody's not telling me the details.' Trump, for his part, endorsed the new spending deal — particularly the debt ceiling increase, which he called 'A VERY important piece, VITAL to the America First Agenda.' 'SUCCESS in Washington!' he wrote on Truth Social. 'Speaker Mike Johnson and the House have come to a very good Deal for the American People.' 'All Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote 'YES' for this Bill, TONIGHT!' he added. An ideologically diverse group of House Republicans huddled in Johnson’s office for hours Thursday looking into alternate spending plans, including one stopgap that would have excluded a debt ceiling increase but instead been accompanied by a commitment to raise the borrowing limit twice next year. That version would have excluded Trump's biggest ask — and a Democratic red line. The plan, however, ran into a brick wall as hard-line conservatives, including those in the House Freedom Caucus, demanded spending cuts to offset the debt limit increases, a source told The Hill. The source said the group was unable to find enough areas to cut in such a short period of time with the shutdown looming, prompting a 'logjam' and leading them to scrap that plan. The plan B comes after Johnson’s initial funding proposal that he had negotiated with Democrats was torpedoed by frustrated GOP lawmakers with help from opposition from Trump and a swarm of posts against it from incoming 'Department of Government Efficiency' co-chiefs Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.

Texas Gov. Abbott lays out new ‘border security’ measures	EAGLE PASS, Texas (NewsNation) — Republican Gov. Greg Abbott was expected Thursday to lay out the state’s new 'border security strategy' to deter migrants from entering the U.S. illegally, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Several local ranchers, officials with the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), the state’s border czar, and more were expected to be on hand for the announcement. The new strategy precedes President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, when he promised mass deportations on day one of his administration. CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione waives extradition to New York Texas has spent over $11 billion since 2021 on Texas Department of Public Safety troopers stationed at the border, along with Texas National Guard troops, and has built miles of state-funded border wall — much of it in South Texas. The state is building a new operating base in Eagle Pass to hold up to 2,300 National Guard troops at a cost of over $131 million Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, an informal adviser to Trump's transition team, expects Trump to take action that will spark a legal challenge over the citizenship status of children born in the U.S. to immigrants living in the country illegally. He also expects Trump to encourage local and state law enforcement officers to help with efforts to arrest and detain migrants. He said Wednesday that he's in regular contact with Trump's team, including Tom Homan, Trump's pick for border czar, and Stephen Miller, incoming deputy White House chief of staff for policy. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that 11 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the U.S. as of 2022, the latest statistics available. While campaigning, Trump talked about creating 'the largest mass deportation program in history' and called for using the National Guard and domestic police forces in the effort.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/greg-abbott-new-border-security-measures/	2024-12-19T10:42:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2169698251.jpg?w=900
How to help Hurricane Helene victims over the holidays	(NewsNation) — Christmas will be extra challenging this year for those still struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene. Many are still without proper homes and basic necessities after the category 4 storm ripped through North Carolina in September. NewsNation’s Brian Entin spoke with a family of four living in a small RV and shed. Christmas tree farm loses 80,000 trees to Helene floodwaters The family put up Christmas lights, but did not have enough gas in their generator to turn them on. But that didn’t dampen their holiday spirit. There are glimmers of hope for many in the community. Christmas decorations have been put out on Hurricane debris and one resident decorated a massive Christmas tree in the center of the devastation. He turns the lights on at sunset every night, which he says brings hope. Neighbors have come together to support each other through the holidays like one resident who is providing sheds to families who need shelter.

Will Amazon strike affect your holiday packages?	(NewsNation) — Nearly 10,000 Amazon workers who are part of the Teamsters union are striking across the United States ahead of the Christmas holiday, but the online retailer says it doesn't expect the strike to affect holiday gift deliveries. Picket lines are being seen in cities like New York, Chicago and Atlanta as workers are walking off the job as the holiday rush to get packages delivered across the country heats up. Amazon says the drivers represent a small fraction of its delivery workforce and should not slow down operations, the company told Fox 5 in New York. Why are Amazon drivers striking? Teamsters are demanding more money for workers and claim that Amazon officials have not done enough to fix workplace safety issues. Amazon has denied the claims. 1,000 toys dropped off for patients at Bronson Children’s Hospital In suburban Chicago, about 400 Teamster drivers work at a facility where some employees are encouraging their colleagues to join the picket lines. The main demand is better pay. Drivers claim they are living paycheck to paycheck. Workers are also upset with how quickly they must process packages at Amazon fulfillment centers, citing a study that showed that workplace injuries at Amazon are double that of the industry standard. Where are the areas affected by the Amazon strike? Drivers are walking out of facilities in Southern California as well as San Francisco, Queens, New York, Atlanta, and outside of Chicago. The union calls it the 'largest strike against Amazon in U.S. history.' Teamsters are also setting up picket lines at Amazon Fulfillment Centers nationwide, the organization said, adding drivers and warehouse workers who are not unionized are legally allowed to honor those picket lines. 'If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed. We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,' said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien. 'These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they’ve pushed workers to the limit and now they’re paying the price. This strike is on them.' What do I do if my Amazon packages are delayed? If your package is delayed, the retailer says to wait 48 hours before contacting them or the seller, according to Amazon's website. You can also find out how to track your order on the website or in the app. Senate report on Amazon workforce This week, a report released by the majority staff for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, found that Amazon accepted employee injuries as part of the 'cost of doing business.' Amazon responded by saying that the committee's chair, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders is 'misleading the American public.' Teamsters’ officials also argue Amazon management did not come to the bargaining table. Amazon executives maintain that the Teamsters are not representative of all of the company’s drivers. Amazon pays a driver service which in turn, provides about 7,000 independently contracted drivers for Amazon, which says the drivers are not Amazon employees. Those drivers, the company says, represent less than 1% of its workforce.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/amazon-drivers-across-us-strike-over-pay-and-work-conditions/	2024-12-19T06:22:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/02/GettyImages-1208650169.jpg?w=900
UnitedHealthcare CEO murder 'acceptable' among 40% of young peopl...	(NewsNation) — Four in ten young adults find the actions of the UnitedHealthcare CEO's killer 'acceptable,' according to a new Emerson College Polling national survey. The poll was conducted the week after a man, suspected to be 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, allegedly shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Bryan Thompson over his discontent with the American healthcare system. The poll asked about 1,000 people, 'Do you think the actions of the killer of the UnitedHealthcare CEO are acceptable or unacceptable?' Will Luigi Mangione face the death penalty? Respondents aged 18-29 were almost split; 41% of this age group voted acceptable, whereas 40% voted unacceptable. However, the majority of the larger poll respondent pool (68%) voted that the killer's actions were 'unacceptable.' From a political lens, more Democrats were OK with the killing with 22% voting acceptable compared to 12% of Republicans. Men were more likely to find the actions acceptable with 19%, compared to 14% of women.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/unitedhealthcare-ceo-murder-national-poll/	2024-12-19T05:23:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Luigi-mangione-brian-thompson.jpg?w=900
CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione expected to waive extradition	(NewsNation) — Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is expected to waive extradition to New York while in Pennsylvania court on Thursday, sources tell NewsNation. Mangione's New York attorney is vowing to fight every charge, as his client could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. The 26-year-old is charged with first-degree murder in the furtherance of terrorism, as well as two counts of second-degree murder. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says extradition is going to happen one way or another. 'I'm ready to bring him back and make sure justice is served to someone who had the audacity to gun down any New Yorker,' Hochul said. 'I don't care what their title is. That brazen move on our streets must result in severe consequences.' What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory? According to a local news outlet, if Mangione does get extradited to New York, he could be booked, processed, and arraigned in front of a different judge as soon as Thursday afternoon. NewsNation reached out to Mangione's attorneys for comment. Shooting of Brian Thompson Thompson, 50, was fatally shot just before 7 a.m. Dec. 4 in front of a Hilton hotel while walking to UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor meeting in New York City. The words 'deny,' 'depose' and 'defend' were written on the shell casings found at the scene. It is an apparent reference to the title of the book 'Delay, Deny, Defend,' which is about the ways insurance companies reject requests for medical coverage deemed necessary by doctors. NYPD finds drone in Brooklyn, owner steps forward: Report Authorities arrested Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania on Dec. 9. With him at the time were a mask, firearm, suppressor and fake New Jersey ID that connected him to the shooting, police said. Mangione also had a manifesto and a spiral notebook with a 'to-do' list. In the manifesto, Mangione wrote that he acted alone and that he 'apologizes for any strife or traumas, but it had to be done.' 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' he wrote. Mangione has been held without bail at the State Correctional Institution Huntingdon in Pennsylvania.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-court-hearing/	2024-12-19T04:45:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2188645013.jpg?w=900

Will Luigi Mangione face the death penalty?	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors in New York announced they are charging UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione with first-degree murder and killing as an act of terrorism, which comes with a penalty of up to life in prison. But could Mangione face the death penalty? Mangione, 26, is charged with the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was on his way to an investor meeting when he was shot outside of a Manhattan hotel. Police have described the crime as 'brazen' and targeted, with bullets engraved with the words 'deny' 'defend' and 'depose.' Gaetz ethics report to be released before Christmas: Sources Authorities launched a manhunt for the suspect, releasing photos taken from surveillance footage around New York. Mangione was eventually arrested at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. New York abolished the death penalty in 2004 and even before that, the last execution in the state took place in 1963. In order to face the death penalty, Mangione would have to be charged federally, which isn't likely for a murder charge. Dane Elkins missing case gains new leads While hiring someone to kill another person across state lines qualified as a federal crime, crossing state lines to murder someone yourself does not, making it unlikely for Mangione to face a federal murder charge on top of the state charges. Even if he were to face such a charge, the federal government might not make the case for the death penalty, something that is relatively rare in federal prosecutions.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-death-penalty/	2024-12-18T15:20:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709519032.jpg?w=900
NYPD finds drone in Brooklyn, owner steps forward: Report	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The NYPD recently discovered an abandoned drone in Brooklyn amid a spate of sightings in the Tri-State Area. This one, however, has a known owner. A photo obtained by The New York Post shows an officer holding up the 5-foot aircraft. The object, according to The Post, was found on Fifth Street between Market Street and Morris Avenue. The drone turned out to be owned by Amogy Inc., a sustainable energy startup working to use ammonia as a renewable fuel source for, among other things, drones. CDC reports first severe case of human bird flu in US A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over New Jersey and across the eastern U.S., sparking speculation and concern over where they came from and why they're being seen in such numbers. The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. In fact, authorities say, many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. President Joe Biden said Tuesday night that there appears to be nothing nefarious about the flying objects. 'There are a lot of drones authorized. We are following this closely. So far, no sense of danger,' the president said as he left the White House for a trip to Delaware. Despite federal officials' comments, many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly unmanned aircraft — and for authority to shoot them out of the sky.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/nypd-finds-drone-in-brooklyn/	2024-12-18T14:50:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/NYPDGettyImages-1147477406.jpg?w=900
State of Emergency declared in California over the spread of bird...	(KRON) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a State of Emergency in response to bird flu on Wednesday. The declaration comes following the spread of avian influenza in 16 states, including California and outside the Central Valley. The declaration, according to Newsom's office, is meant to streamline the state's response to bird flu. This latest action from the governor comes as cases were detected in dairy cows on farms in Southern California. CDC reports first severe case of human bird flu in US This signals 'the need to further expand monitoring and build on the coordinated statewide approach to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus,' according to a statement from the governor's office. After first being detected in Texas and Kansas back in March, the virus has spread in 16 states among dairy cattle. To date, however, no person-to-person spread of bird flu has been detected in California. According to Newsom's office, nearly all infected individuals in California had exposure to infected cattle. California has the largest testing and monitoring system in the nation, according to the governor's office. 'This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak. Building on California’s testing and monitoring system — the largest in the nation — we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information. While the risk to the public remains low, we will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus.' -- Gov. Gavin Newsom The declaration of a State of Emergency will provide state and local agencies with additional flexibility around staffing, contracting, and other rules to support the state's response, Newsom's office said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/california-bird-flu-state-of-emergency/	2024-12-18T11:54:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6740dfad13d111.44398605.jpeg?w=900
CDC reports first severe case of human bird flu in US	(NewsNation) — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported the first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. in Louisiana. There have been a total of 61 human cases of H5N1 avian influenza reported in the U.S. since April but this is the first one to be considered severe. Partial genomic analysis indicates the virus affecting the Louisiana patient belongs to a genotype found in wild birds and poultry rather than the type detected in dairy cows. Couple allowed child to go severely malnourished: Police Public health experts are still working to determine the source of the infection, but the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks. It is also the first case of bird flu linked to exposure from a backyard flock in the U.S. Sporadic cases of bird flu in humans are expected, often due to contact with infected wild or domestic birds. The agency has not detected any person-to-person spread of the virus and said the current risk to the public remains low. Doomscrolling among teens leads to growing ‘brain rot’ concerns To avoid contracting bird flu, the CDC recommends those who are in contact with livestock or wild birds, including backyard poultry owners, hunters and bird enthusiasts, should avoid contact with sick or dead birds. For those who must come in contact with wild birds or other poultry that could be infected, the CDC recommends wearing personal protective equipment and avoiding contact with surfaces or material that can be contaminated with saliva, mucous or animal feces.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/cdc-severe-bird-flu/	2024-12-18T11:07:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66949c1279f880.67501612.jpeg?w=900
Louisiana health officials confirm human case of bird flu: What t...	BATON ROUGE, La. (BRPROUD) — The Louisiana Department of Health has reported the first human case of bird flu (H5N1) in a person in the state. A person from southwestern Louisiana is hospitalized after exposure to sick and dead birds suspected of having the virus. According to state health officials, H5N1 is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in birds. Outbreaks in wild birds and poultry have been reported since 2022 in the U.S. 2 cats die from suspected bird flu traced to raw milk in California 'While the current public health risk for the general public is low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk,' the agency said. According to LDH, 60 human cases have been reported nationwide as of Dec. 13, all linked to contact with infected animals. No human-to-human transmission has occurred in the U.S. 'The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure. That means avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses,' LDH said. USDA orders nationwide testing of milk for bird flu to halt the virus How to protect yourself Avoid contact with sick or dead birds or animals. Keep pets away from dead animals. Always cook poultry, eggs, and animal products thoroughly. Avoid raw or unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals. Farm workers should consider seasonal flu vaccines to lower risks of co-infection. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Gaetz ethics report to be released before Christmas: Sources	(NewsNation) — A long-awaited ethics report into former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz will be released before Christmas, sources have confirmed to NewsNation. A House committee considering the report’s release has not announced a timeline for when the report will be released. However, sources told NewsNation that the committee has already voted to release the report in the next week. In response, Gaetz wrote on X, 'My 30’s were an era of working very hard - and playing hard too. It’s embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.' Most Republicans have argued that any congressional probe into Gaetz ended when he resigned from the House. Speaker Mike Johnson also requested that the committee not publish its report, saying it would be a terrible precedent to set. While ethics reports have previously been released after a member’s resignation, it is extremely rare. Shortly before the votes took place, Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., who introduced one of the bills to force the release, said that if Republicans reject the release, they will have 'succeeded in sweeping credible allegations of sexual misconduct under the rug.' Gaetz has repeatedly denied the claims. This is a developing story. Refresh for updates.

Here's what made the cut in Congress’ 1,500-page government fundi...	Congress on Tuesday rolled out its last major funding deal of the year and is expected to move quickly to try to pass it ahead of a Friday government shutdown deadline. The bill, which is more than 1,500 pages, would keep the government funded at current levels through March 14, buying time for the incoming Congress to finish its funding work for fiscal 2025. It also includes a number of add-ons, including more than $100 billion in disaster and emergency funding, a health care-related package, and an extension of the farm bill. Below are just some of the highlights from the package: Disaster assistance FILE - A tattered American flag flaps outside a home with furniture and household items damaged by Hurricane Helene piled outside along the street awaiting pickup ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Milton in Holmes Beach on Anna Maria Island, Fla., Oct. 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File) Lawmakers agreed to tack on roughly $100 billion in disaster aid as members on both sides of the aisle have dialed up pressure on leaders for relief following hurricanes Helene and Milton. That includes nearly $30 billion in funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as officials have sounded alarm over the agency’s Disaster Relief Fund in recent months. It also includes disaster relief for farmers, and $4 million for the Office of Inspector General for oversight. There’s also about $20 billion for disaster assistance to farmers and producers that falls under dollars for the Department of Agriculture, roughly $1 billion for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, and more than $800 million for the Emergency Conservation Program, as outlined in a breakdown of the disaster relief portion of the package. More than $10 billion in funding would also go toward the departments of Interior, Agriculture Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency for costs incurred by disasters in 2024 and in recent years. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would also receive $12 billion for Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery, and negotiators say more than $3 billion would go to the Defense Department for repair from extreme weather events for military programs. The Defense Department would also receive about $2 billion in funds partly for construction on Guam following Typhoon Mawar. PBM reforms, health extenders Prescription pills are shown Wednesday, Nov. 10, 2021 in Washington. Medicare enrollees who take expensive medicines could save thousands of dollars a year under the Democrats’ sweeping social agenda bill, but those benefits would build gradually, starting in a couple of years with a check on price increases and limits on insulin costs. A cap on out-of-pocket costs would follow in 2024, and a year later patients will begin to see lower prices negotiated by Medicare. (AP Photo) Lawmakers agreed to attach an expansive health care package to the legislation. The health portion contains reforms to the pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) industry, extensions of Medicare telehealth flexibilities, reauthorizations of legislation to prevent pandemics and address the opioid crisis, payments to community health centers and other policies. The PBM changes have been a bipartisan priority for years but until now never made it to the finish. PBMs negotiate discounted drug prices for insurers and employers. The measures include a ban on linking PBM compensation to a drug’s Medicare price. Lawmakers and PBM critics say higher drug prices lead to higher fees to PBMs; the higher the price of a covered drug, the steeper the potential discount, some of which PBMs keep as profit. So there’s an incentive for PBMs to steer patients to the highest cost drugs. Critics have long argued PBMs operate essentially in the shadows, and the funding bill includes new reporting requirements to increase transparency, including requiring PBMs to disclose the cost and reimbursement of drugs and any fees or discounts involved. The PBM changes will be used to help pay for some of the other health provisions. Farm bill extension Farmers of the Voznesenka-Agro farm harvest with their combine in a wheat field not far from Melitopol, south Ukraine, July 15, 2022. The package includes another one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill after Congress also failed to pass a longer extension last year, as well as an additional $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers. Lawmakers said some of the assistance for farmers had emerged as a key sticking point as funding talks ramped up in the past week. Some Republicans threatened to vote against the stopgap measure if it did not include economic assistance for farmers and ranchers. Key bridge funding Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in the early morning hours of March 26 after a container ship called the Dali lost power and smashed into it. Democrats have also lauded a section of the bill they say would cover replacement costs for the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. 'With the inclusion in the Continuing Resolution of our Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act, Congress is now committed to covering the full cost of replacing the bridge. This will allow the bridge it to be built as quickly as possible,' Maryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen said in a joint statement Tuesday. 'Our provision also ensures that the federal taxpayers will be reimbursed through proceeds from insurance payments and litigation taken on by the Department of Justice, the Maryland Attorney General and others.' There’s also $8 billion in funding for federal highway and roads disaster relief that falls under the Transportation Department.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Another line item in the stopgap would also transfer administrative jurisdiction over the RFK Memorial Stadium Campus to the District of Columbia in a move that could lead to the return of the Washington Commanders to the nation’s capital. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.), who led a legislative effort along with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), expressed excitement about language getting tucked into the stopgap to make the move earlier Tuesday. If it passes, the legislation unveiled Tuesday would direct the Interior secretary to transfer administrative jurisdiction to the District, allowing it to use the campus for stadium redevelopment and other purposes. 'We figured out a way to make this work, to be able to attract the Commanders back to Washington. It’s a win-win for Washington,' Comer told The Hill, adding he and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) have 'been in constant communication for months' as part of the ongoing effort.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) The Biden administration’s request for $24 billion in funding related to Ukraine does not make an appearance, after Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) rejected the request for further assistance earlier this month. 'I’m not planning to do that,' Johnson said at the time. He also said Trump’s election would 'change the dynamic of the Russian war on Ukraine' and that lawmakers would 'wait and take the new commander in chief’s direction on all that.' Offsets Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) is seen following a joint meeting of Congress to hear Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on April 11, 2024. The designated emergency and disaster funding tacked onto the continuing resolution clocks in at about $110 billion – but without the offsets some Republicans had hoped for. 'I’m always happy to look at any offsets we have and that we can pass, and so far, we haven’t been able to get something to get the votes for them,' House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told The Hill on Tuesday when asked about past discussions around offsets. Still, the lack of offsets is sure to upset conservatives who have called for any additional funding to be offset with savings elsewhere. RECA deal Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) speaks to reporters as he leaves the Capitol following a vote on Thursday, December 12, 2024. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also called out Johnson in a post on social media shortly after the package’s release for the absence of a deal on the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Hawley wrote that Johnson 'personally killed a bipartisan, bicameral expansion + spending cap RECA deal.' 'It was him alone. BUT he’s willing to spend BILLIONS on Ukraine and foreign wars and every pork barrel project known to man,' he added. The Hill has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment. Congressional pay freeze The legislation could also end a years-long freeze on cost of living adjustments for lawmakers. The news was first reported by the Bloomberg Government. Lawmakers on both sides have come out for and against the push over the years. President-elect Trump criticized the push in larger statement opposing the package on Wednesday, writing on Truth Social that 'this is not a good time for Congress to be asking for pay increases.' 'This bill would also give Congress a pay increase while many Americans are struggling this Christmas,' he also said in a statement. However, supporters have raised questions of fairness over the matter. 'I think that if you're going to have people serve here, and look, the most money I've ever made my lifetime has been in this body, but it's also the most expensive place I've ever lived in my lifetime,' outgoing Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) told The Hill on Wednesday. 'So, you've got to make sure that the wages are commensurate, and if you don't, you're going to end up with people that are uber rich. That's the only people are going to be able to afford to do this. So, I don't have a problem.' Nathaniel Weixel contributed.

Doomscrolling among teens leads to growing brain rot concerns	(NewsNation) — The amount of time teens spend on their phones and tablets, excessively scrolling through social media posts, is likely diminishing their brain activity and creating health concerns. The act of excessively soaking in negative news or social media posts, known as 'doomscrolling' has led to growing amounts of brain rot over the past year, experts found. Oxford University Press selected 'brain rot' as its word of the year for 2024. Researchers found that between 2023 and 2024, the times 'brain rot' was used in conversation increased by 230%. Brain rot is defined as 'the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state' as a result of over-consumption of online content, Oxford University Press wrote this month in announcing its annual Word of the Year honor. Republicans butt heads on daylight saving time after Trump directive In addition to popular online platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, researchers also included artificial tools such as ChatGPT as a source of brain rot. The term 'brain rot' dates back to 1854 when author Henry David Thoreau used the word in his book 'Walden' when he criticized society’s tendency to devalue complex ideas. Oxford University Press experts found that 'brain rot' has increased because of the impact of teens and other online users consuming excessive amounts of 'low-quality online content.', especially on social media. Media psychologist Dr. Don Grant told NewsNation that social media engineers are tapping into the psychological flaw in the limbic system that causes humans to seek intermittent rewards. He described doomscrolling as a form of a digital slot machine that humans feed off of. Grant, the national adviser of healthy device management at Newport Healthcare in Los Angeles, said one of his major concerns is how brain rot is affecting imagination and education. 'We don’t have to imagine anything anymore,' Grant told VICE. 'We pick up our devices every time. I’m worried about memory. I’m worried about education.' In Australia, social media usage has been banned for children under the age of 16 over health concerns connected to too much time being spent online. 'There’s a direct correlation between the rising anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm and suicide among teenagers and the introduction of social media into their world,' Greg Attwells, the director of 36 Months Movement, told NewsNation. Other experts warn that concerns over brain rot only continue to grow. The more teens and others spend on screens, the more they struggle with things like attention span, VICE reported. 'They feel brain foggy, they (have) less concentration,' Dr. Kyra Bobinet, told Fox News. 'They can’t do deep work. And then there’s also this epidemic of loneliness that has been kind of sitting on the heels of this, because we can’t really focus on anything, including relationship-building.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/doomscrolling-among-teens-leads-to-growing-brain-rot-concerns/	2024-12-18T07:11:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/11/GettyImages-671711967.jpg?w=724
Lawmakers want to see legislation to better monitor drones	(NewsNation) — The House Intelligence Committee had a classified briefing on Capitol Hill Tuesday over the drone sightings in New Jersey and across the eastern United States, but lawmakers were left with more questions than answers. Former FAA official: Don’t shoot down suspected drones Several lawmakers told NewsNation they believe there needs to be new legislation to better monitor drones in U.S. airspace, as well as to decide what can be flown there. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is pushing for a bill to give local authorities more power to respond to and track drones as well. 'We're actually reasonably good, but we can be better about monitoring restricted airspace,' Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn.,said after Tuesday's briefing. Intelligence officials and FBI officials say there's no threat in our night skies. Federal authorities said Monday evening that sightings have been identified as legal commercial drones, hobbyist drones, law enforcement drones, as manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. Speaking to reporters Tuesday night as he headed to Deleware, President Joe Biden said officials are 'following this closely, but so far, no sense of danger.' 'Nothing nefarious apparently, but they're checking it all out,' he said. Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., echoed these sentiments. 'I think the FBI, the intelligence community, is taking this very seriously, is looking at every report, and to date, there's no evidence that there's anything nefarious going on,' Bera said. Michael Melham, the mayor of Belleville, New Jersey floated the idea that the drones might be connected to radioactive material in an interview with 'Good Day New York.' He reiterated these claims on 'Morning in America' Wednesday. Earlier this month, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported radioactive material contained in medical equipment used for cancer scans was lost in transit. On Dec. 3, an an Eckert &amp; Ziegler model HEGL-0132 device was sent for disposal from Nazha Cancer Center in Newfield New Jersey. However, the shipping container it was in arrived at its destination 'damaged and empty,' according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 'We know we have drones flying in a grid-like pattern. In my opinion, they're looking for something,' Melham said on 'Good Day New York.' 'What might they be looking for? Maybe that's radioactive material.' The Department of Energy and other officials told ABC News that Melham's theory has been disproven. In addition, a doctor at the Nazha Cancer Center said to ABC that the missing material was found and disposed of properly. Jared McColloch disappeared during a last-minute road trip Dr. James Dalzell told ABC the device was shipped by Fed-Ex, which temporarily misplaced it. The equipment was found later and sent to the manufacturer, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said. According to the NJDEP, drones were not used to locate the radioactive material, ABC wrote. Former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman said on 'Morning in America' that she has seen '0 evidence' that the drones are related to nuclear material. 'I would caution the public to be extremely skeptical of those kinds of theories,' Ballman said in an interview with NewsNation's Markie Martin. Melham said on NewsNation Wednesday that he wasn't the one who brought up the radioactive material during the 'Good Day New York' interview. 'I merely said that I believe (the government) is searching and sniffing something,' Melham said. 'There's no doubt in my mind that our federal government has assets that have the ability to know where something is on the ground.'

Murdered Kansas moms: Testimony leads to 'eruption,' producer say...	(NewsNation) — A preliminary hearing was waived and two plea deals were announced Tuesday in the case of murdered Kansas mothers Veronica Butler, 27, and Jilian Kelley, 39. Butler and Kelley were murdered earlier this year after they traveled from Hugoton, Kansas, to pick up Butler’s children in Oklahoma. Their bodies were found buried in a freezer in April, and an autopsy revealed that both women had been stabbed to death. Police have been investigating their deaths and charged Tifany Adams, 54; Tad Cullum, 43; Cora Twombly, 44; Cole Twombly, 50, and Paul Grice, 31, with kidnapping and first-degree murder. Luigi Mangione indicted on first-degree murder charge Adams, Cullum, and Twombly went into the Texas County Courthouse on Tuesday for their preliminary hearings, NewsNation Kansas affiliate KSNW reported. The other two suspects in the case, Twombly and Grice, previously waived their right to a preliminary hearing. The district attorney filed a motion to have them testify at the preliminary hearings. Their testimony revealed details about what led up to the murders of Butler and Kelley. Adams reportedly showed up, admitted guilt and has waived her right to a preliminary hearing and speedy trial. She is due back in court April 16. Kansas moms killings: What we know Senior NewsNation producer Allison Weiner said Grice's testimony was like nothing she'd ever seen before in court. 'It caused an eruption in court,' Weiner said on 'Banfield.' 'Paul Grice was on the stand, and he starts talking about how he actually murdered Veronica Butler. ... He said that the light came out of her eyes, and he fell to the ground. And he said Grandma Tifany (Adams) was walking around in a circle laughing.' She said the whole courtroom was 'sobbing' and that it got so loud that the judge stopped the proceedings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/murdered-kansas-moms-testimony-eruptions/	2024-12-17T21:56:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/snapshot-2024-04-12T171412.320.jpg?w=900
Luigi Mangione murder terrorism charge 'risky': Former prosecutor	(NewsNation) — Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani warns that the terrorism and first-degree murder charges against UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione are 'a risky move' that could complicate the prosecution. A grand jury indicted Mangione on Monday on first-degree murder and terrorism charges, a case that has sparked widespread public attention and debate. 'I understand why Bragg's office did this, but now, it raises the question as to why Mangione did this,' Rahmani said on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'It raises the element of why, and you have to get into Mangione's intent and his history.' Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting Mangione, 26, is accused of shooting Thompson on Dec. 4 with a 3D-printed ghost gun. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Mangione with one count of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and weapons- and forgery-related offenses. The charges include a terrorism count, which Rahmani noted requires proving 'intent to intimidate the public or influence government policy.' This classification could increase the potential prison sentence from 15 years to 20 to 25 years without parole. The case has sparked a national conversation about health care industry practices. On social media in particular, some users gloated about the killing, a reaction they framed as rooted in their enmity for the health insurance industry. 'I have never, ever seen an accused murderer with this much sympathy and support on traditional and social media,' Rahmani said, warning that this could potentially lead to a jury nullification risk. 'You have to get 12 out of 12 jurors unanimously to convict, and this case presents a very real possibility of a holdout juror, a stealth juror that tries to get on this panel to send a message to executives of the health care industry,' Rahmani said. Health insurance ‘delay tactic’ is too common: Former Cigna executive New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch condemned what she called a 'shocking and appalling celebration of cold-blooded murder.' Mangione was captured in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a five-day search and is currently fighting extradition. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday that could return him to New York City. The defendant, described as coming from a wealthy background, has garnered a surprising level of public support, which Rahmani suggests might stem from his perceived image as an attractive, intelligent and now-famous individual. His defense attorney, Karen Friedman, is expected to challenge the extradition, though Rahmani noted that such challenges typically only verify the defendant's identity. 'She's going to focus her attention on those New York charges,' Rahmani said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-murder-terrorism-charge-risky/	2024-12-17T15:41:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot_12f47e.jpg?w=900
Luigi Mangione indicted on first-degree murder charge	(NewsNation) — Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced Luigi Mangione is now being indicted on one count of first-degree murder in the furtherance of terrorism in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was previously indicted on second-degree murder charges and still faces two counts of second-degree murder, one for killing in an act of terrorism. Thompson was shot outside a hotel in Manhattan as he arrived for an investor meeting. Police described the attack as targeted, and bullet casings had the words 'deny,' 'delay' and 'depose' carved onto them. Nima Momeni found guilty in Cash App CEO’s death Authorities began a search, releasing surveillance photos of a person of interest from locations around New York. Mangione was eventually arrested at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. He is facing firearms charges in that state as well as the murder charges in New York. In a press conference, authorities called the attack 'brazen' and said the shooting was designed to invoke terror. Investigators also condemned popular support for Mangione from Americans who have expressed positive views of the shooting on social media while sharing stories of health insurance claim denials and the impact those have had on their lives. In response to a question from a reporter, one official confirmed that police had reached out to Mangione's mother, who had said the shooting was something she 'could see' him doing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-indicted-first-degree-murder/	2024-12-17T12:35:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709541836.jpg?w=900
Nima Momeni found guilty in CashApp CEO's death	(NewsNation) — Nima Momeni was found guilty of second-degree murder by a jury in the high-profile trial of the tech consultant who was charged in the stabbing death of CashApp founder Bob Lee in 2023. A jury reached a verdict in the case on Monday after deliberating for seven days before agreeing on a unanimous decision, the Associated Press reported on Monday night. The verdict was not read until Tuesday morning so jurors, the judge, Momeni, Lee’s family, Momeni’s supporters, defense attorneys, prosecutors, and reporters could all gather in the courtroom. The only family member present at the courthouse Monday afternoon was Momeni’s mother, who immediately began sending text messages on her cellphone. Wisconsin school shooting: Police investigating shooter’s motive In California, a second-degree murder conviction carries a 15-year sentence. Sentencing is expected to be handed down in about six weeks. Emotions inside the courtroom were varied after the verdict was read. Momeni's family was said to be crying while the defendant showed litle emotion. Jury deliberations began earlier this month after prosecutors concluded during their closing argument that Momeni planned the 2023 attack after hearing that the tech mogul had introduced his younger sister to a drug dealer who she says gave her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her at his apartment. Prosecutors maintain that Momeni lured Lee to an isolated location near the Bay Bridge and stabbed him three times with a knife from his sister’s kitchen. Defense attorneys, however, said that Lee was on a multi-day cocaine and alcohol bender and attacked Momeni with a knife over a bad joke. John Kirby’s drone statement ‘very misleading’: New Jersey rep. The defense argued that Momeni acted in self-defense. Momeni testified during the trial that Lee walked away from the incident and showed no signs of injury.

Lee was found detected around 2:30 a.m. in downtown San Francisco, dripping in blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital. The knife used in the attack was described as a paring knife with a 4-inch blade and had Momeni’s DNA on the handle and Lee’s DNA on the blade, prosecutors said. Defense attorneys said that the DNA evidence was not definitive and that the handle of the knife should have included the DNA of both men. The Associated Press reported that testimony included the fact that Lee and Momeni’s sister, Khazar Momeni, had been doing drugs and drinking at the apartment belonging to a drug dealer that Lee knew.

DENVER (KDVR) — Fourteen people were detained by Aurora police following a reported armed home invasion at the troubled apartment complex, the Edge at Lowry. The Aurora Police Department posted on X that just before 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, officers responded to calls about an armed home invasion, a stabbing and kidnapping at an apartment in the 1200 block of Dallas Street. According to preliminary reports, investigators said several suspects entered an apartment unit that had two people inside. The suspects then reportedly moved the victims to another apartment on the property where police said they were threatened and bound. An adult man sustained a non-life-threatening stab wound. Police said the victims were eventually released by the suspects and called 911. Aurora police said they are still in the very early stages of the investigation and will provide more information as it becomes available. At this time, police said it's unclear if the suspects are connected to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. FOX31 has a crew on the way to learn more. Apartment complex known for its troubled past The Edge at Lowry has been deemed a troubled apartment complex after a viral video of a group of armed men surfaced in August. The owners of the video said it was taken shortly before a shootout at the complex that left one person seriously injured. Several vehicles were also damaged by gunfire. Tenants of troubled Aurora apartment complex worry about looming closure The apartment became a national topic when President-elect Donald Trump discussed the video during his presidential campaign. He visited Aurora in October and displayed enlarged mugshots showing the men identified in the video. The apartment is now set to close after the owner reached an agreement with the city. Proceedings will continue in January and if the buildings close the city will give at least 30 days’ notice to current residents lawfully staying at the property.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/14-detained-following-reported-armed-home-invasion-at-troubled-aurora-apartment/	2024-12-17T07:48:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Use_Descriptive_File_Name-2024-12-17T075206.220.jpg?w=900
Wisconsin school shooting: Residents 'eager' to know what happene...	(NewsNation) — Residents in Madison, Wisconsin, continue to wrestle with Monday’s shooting at Abundant Life Christian School, where a 15-year-old student opened fire and killed two people while injuring six others. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes told NewsNation that people continue to struggle with how another school shooting took place in the U.S. and how future tragedies can be prevented. 'Our community is really trying to grapple with this,' Barnes said. Madison school shooting: Police investigating shooter’s motive Two students who sustained non-life-threatening injuries were released from the hospital on Monday night, Barnes said. Meanwhile, the investigation continues into the shooting in which Natalie Rupnow, who went by the name Samantha, opened fire at the non-denominational Christian school. Rupnow was pronounced dead in transport to a hospital, while one teacher and one teenager were declared dead at the scene. Barnes said Rupnow’s family is cooperating with the police and that investigators spoke at length with Rupnow’s father on Monday night. Barnes said Rupnow was not on police radar but said in many cases, information about suspects involved in school shootings comes to light after the fact. Police plan to hold a news conference on Tuesday afternoon to discuss new details in their investigation, including about items that were taken from the family’s home Monday night. Barnes said that the search was done voluntarily and that investigators did not need a search warrant. Barnes said police also hope to soon verify an online document that was circulating that could speak to the shooter’s motive. The chief said that other documents were taken from the home on Monday that could provide clues. 'We want to make sure that before we put any information out that certainly we are as accurate as we possibly can knowing that things may change,' Barnes told NewsNation. 'But we also want to make sure that if this document is being circulated, that people know about it.' He added: 'We have to do everything in our power to prevent these (shootings) from happening again, again and again in our country.' Madison police are working with the ATF to trace where the handgun used in Monday’s shooting came from, Barnes said. Police are trying to determine if the gun was in the home or if the weapon was given to Rupnow by another person. 'We don’t know,' Barnes said about the gun’s origin, adding, 'Everyone is eager to know why this happened and we may never know.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/wisconsin-school-shooting-residents-what-happened/	2024-12-17T06:56:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24351656962051.jpg?w=900
Rex Heurermann case: 'Significant update' coming in Gilgo Beach k...	(NewsNation) — New York prosecutors say they plan to announce a 'significant update' in the Gilgo Beach killings case Tuesday, following a court appearance by suspect Rex Heuermann. Heuermann is charged with killing six women whose remains were found on Long Island. He's pleaded not guilty. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office will hold a news conference Tuesday morning following Heuerman's court appearance, be has not provided much information on what they plan to address. Investigators are still looking into the deaths of several other people whose remains were discovered in the area. Timeline: Rex Heuermann charged with Gilgo Beach Four deaths Rex Heuermann could be a suspect in other homicides District Attorney Ray Tierney has previously indicated that Heuermann is a suspect in the death of Valerie Mack, whose remains were found in 2000. In addition to Mack, prosecutors are also looking into the death of Karen Vergata, whose remains were first discovered in 1996 and finally identified in 2022 after a new DNA analysis. In September, authorities released new renderings of an unidentified victim who was found in 2011. Officials said the victim, who for years they had identified as male, may have presented outwardly as female and died in 2006. Seven identified Gilgo Beach victims.

Four bodies found dumped on a remote Long Island beach were officially identified as prostitutes who were likely slain by a serial killer, police said. The women were killed at another location and their bodies were transported to Gilgo Beach, about 64 km (40 miles) east of New York City, Suffolk county, New York police said. The bodies were discovered in early December. 'All of the women were escorts, who were self-employed and used Craig's List and other sites to arrange meetings with clients,' said a police spokesperson, reading from a statement issued by Police Commissioner Richard Dormer.

(James Carbone/Newsday via AP, Pool) This will be Heuermann's first court appearance since October. The government has frozen assets from the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office as part of a separate investigation involving the previous administration. The probe into a former district attorney has tied up an estimated $13 million and significantly slowed the movement of Heuermann’s case, court officials said. Background of Gilgo Beach investigation Heuermann is charged with murder in connection with the deaths of six women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. He was initially charged with murder in the deaths of the first four women, and prosecutors later charged him in the deaths of Taylor and Costilla. Gilgo Beach task force seeks information about ‘Asian Doe’ victim Police spent the past 14 years investigating the deaths of at least 10 people — most of whom were sex workers — whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway near Gilgo Beach on Long Island. Heuermann lived across the bay from where officials discovered the bodies. He pleaded not guilty to all charges in June. He was initially charged in the deaths of three women in 2023 and was subsequently charged in three more earlier this year. In a court filing for the most recent charges, prosecutors said they had recovered a file on a hard drive in Heuermann’s basement that he used to 'methodically blueprint' his killings — including checklists with tasks to tick off before, during and afterward, as well as lessons for 'next time.' Where does Rex Heuermann’s case stand now? The district attorney’s office has turned over 99.9% of the electronic data extracted from the 400 devices investigators recovered from Heuermann’s home — about 120 terabytes of information. Heuermann’s attorney, Michael Brown, said he plans to seek separate trials for the fifth and sixth victims. Brown also announced plans to ask for a change of venue, joking that 'Mars' is the only place the case might receive a fair trial because of extensive news media coverage.

Madison school shooting: Police investigating shooter's motive	(NewsNation) — Police in Madison, Wisconsin, continue to investigate the shooting at a Christian school in which a 15-year-old student opened fire and killed two people and injured six others, but have not yet determined a motive. The area around Abundant Life Christian School remains an active crime scene, and the school community is grieving after the shooting in which police said a second grader was the first to call 911 just before 11 a.m. on Monday. Madison School Shooter Identified Authorities identified the shooter as Natalie Rupnow, who went by the name Samantha. Rupnow was pronounced dead in transport to a hospital, while one teacher and one teenager were declared dead at the scene. Madison shooting ‘should not be happening’: Ex-Sandy Hook cop Two students remain in critical condition and several others were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. FBI given online document connected to Madison school shooting Police have not authenticated a document that is circulating online that speaks to the shooter’s motive. Barnes said that Rupnow’s family is cooperating with police and allowed officers in their home on Monday without a search warrant. Police interviewed Rupnow’s father on Monday night. The online document has been given to the FBI, police said. 'The person who posted (the document) is alleged to have a connection with the victim. We have not located him yet,' Barnes said on Monday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/madison-school-shooting-investigating-shooters-motive/	2024-12-17T04:58:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24351670276885-1.jpg?w=900
Suspected UFO in Connecticut: Witness to 2022 sighting speaks out	(NewsNation) —Something unexplained is happening over a reservoir in Connecticut. On the back deck of a community center in Fairfield County, a woman named Diane says she noticed a light in the sky, potentially an unidentified aerial phenomenon, during what was otherwise a routine shift in April 2022. 'I'm always a skywatcher, so I was wondering if it was a plane. But the way it was moving, there's no way it was a plane,' Diane exclusively told NewsNation's Brian Entin. 50 drone sightings prompt New Jersey sheriff to action She's the second witness to come forward this year after a reported close encounter with a UFO near a Fairfield County reservoir in April 2022. In an exclusive interview last month, Robert Klein, a 25-year law enforcement veteran, told NewsNation's 'Banfield' about a similar incident, during which he encountered a spherical object approximately the size of a 'Mini Cooper,' hovering just 30 feet from his patrol car. In April 2022, Connecticut police officer Robert Klein says he had a UFO encounter straight out of Hollywood. Klein, a 25-year law enforcement veteran and respected coach, says a glowing light filled his patrol car, shifted colors and zipped over a lake at unearthly speeds. On NewsNation's 'Banfield,' Klein shares his story exclusively along with evidence.

Judge rules Trump's conviction withstands Supreme Court immunity ...	A New York judge upheld a jury’s verdict that made President-elect Trump a felon, ruling the conviction in the hush money case can withstand the Supreme Court’s new test for presidential immunity. Judge Juan Merchan’s decision comes on the heels of Trump’s presidential election victory against Vice President Harris, when voters chose to catapult him back to the White House despite his years of legal peril. The judge has not yet ruled on Trump’s efforts to toss the case entirely now that he is president-elect. Trump’s attorneys contended that New York prosecutors introduced evidence during his seven-week trial that was protected by the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity doctrine. Among other things, the challenged evidence included testimony from Trump White House aides, tweets Trump issued while in office and his government ethics form. The judge ruled Trump failed to preserve some of his immunity objections by not raising them earlier, but regardless, none of the evidence was protected. 'The evidence related to the preserved claims relate entirely to unofficial conduct and thus, receive no immunity protections; and as to the claims that were unpreserved, this Court finds in the alternative, that when considered on the merits, they too are denied because they relate entirely to unofficial conduct,' Merchan wrote in his ruling. After the trial, the high court held that former presidents enjoy absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for exercising core constitutional powers and at least presumptive immunity for other official acts. Unofficial conduct can be prosecuted, but the jury cannot question the motivation behind a presidential decision, the court said. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) urged the judge to reject Trump’s arguments, arguing that no evidence placed before the jury was protected, and even if it was, it paled in comparison to 'other overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt.' Merchan agreed, writing that even if immunity did extend to the evidence in question, he 'would still find that the People's use of these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch, a conclusion amply supported by non-motive-related evidence.' Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election to conceal an affair, which he denies. Prosecutors with the district attorney’s office portrayed the scheme as an effort to unlawfully influence the election’s outcome. The New York hush money case was the first-ever criminal prosecution of a former president, and the only one to have reached trial. Trump has separately argued that his White House victory compels the dismissal of the jury’s verdict and the case in its entirety. Bragg has pushed back, instead laying out alternatives like freezing the proceedings during Trump’s term. The judge has yet to rule on that matter. 'Today’s decision by deeply conflicted, acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s decision on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence,' Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson and incoming White House communications director, said in a statement. Bragg’s office declined to comment on the ruling. In a separate letter, Merchan revealed that Trump also sent a Dec. 3 letter alleging juror misconduct. The judge provided sparse details but indicated the issue would be made public with redactions. Trump’s other criminal proceedings have fared worse following his presidential win. Special counsel Jack Smith dismissed all charges against Trump in his federal election subversion and classified documents cases, while the president-elect's Georgia criminal case is paused indefinitely as an appeals court weighs a pretrial defense challenge. Trump’s lawyers have pushed to end that case, too.

Teacher, student killed; 6 hurt in Madison school shooting 'I think it has become normalized in our society, and it really should not be because this is devastating to see,' he continued. Police said the shooting was confined to one area, though it is not clear if it was a classroom or hallway. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed a handgun was used in the shooting. 'I am frustrated with how slow progress has been happening,' Govindarajan added.

Madison shooting 'should not be happening': Ex-Sandy Hook cop	(NewsNation) — More than 12 years on from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a former police captain had hoped he would no longer have to discuss the deaths of children from a school shooting. Christopher Vanghele, Newtown's police former captain during the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut, joined 'NewsNation Now' to discuss the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, where three people died. Madison police said the three were a teacher, a teenage student and the teenage suspect. Two other students are currently hospitalized with life-threatening injuries. 'You hope that it doesn't happen again ... but unfortunately, that's not the reality,' Vanghele said. Live: Teacher, student killed; 6 hurt in Madison school shooting 'Between [Sandy Hook] and now, we've had hundreds of school shootings, and once again, a community has a great loss,' he continued. The K-12 school has roughly 300 students on a 28-acre campus with close to 60 staff members. This was the final week of school before Christmas break. 'It should not be happening at a place where kids are supposed to take refuge,' Vanghele added. 'So right now, my hearts go out our house go out to the families, to the people that are affected, and, of course, to the law enforcement officers that also have to deal with what they've seen today for the rest of their careers and the rest of their lives.'

Luigi Mangione's New York attorney married to Diddy lawyer	(NewsNation) — The New York attorney for Luigi Mangione, the man accused in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is not the only person in her intermediate family linked to a high-profile client. Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who has been retained to represent Mangione on second-degree murder charges, is married to Marc Agnifilo, the attorney for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, according to multiple media reports. Combs, the disgraced hip-hop mogul, faces sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Friedman Agnifilo served as the Manhattan chief assistant district attorney between 2014 and 2021. She worked previously in private practice and served as general counsel on criminal justice policy for New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s office between 2006 and 2010. The New York Post reported Friedman Agnifilo joined her husband's firm, Agnifilo Intrater, in 2021. 2 teens killed, 4 injured in shooting at makeshift club in Houston Friedman Agnifilo told the New York Daily News that she does not plan to issue any comment at this time about representing Mangione. However, she worked for CNN before she was retained by Mangione and gave an indication of how she may treat the case, Newsday reported. 'It looks like to me there might be a 'not guilty by reason of insanity' defense because the evidence is going to be so overwhelming that he did what he did,' Friedman Agnifilo said on a CNN broadcast. Mangione’s case will be the latest high-profile trial for Friedman Agnifilo, who has worked in criminal justice, litigation, and trials for three decades. In between cases, Friedman Agnifilo serves as a legal analyst for cable news networks and even as a legal advisor for the show 'Law and Order.' Three arrested for beating bank worker, robbing ATM Mangione is currently being held without bail in Pennsylvania where he faces gun and forgery offenses. He was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania when a McDonald’s customer recognized him and tipped off employees. He is expected to waive extradition to New York at a hearing that is scheduled for Tuesday. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to charges he faces in Pennsylvania, including possession of an unlicensed gun, forgery and providing false identification to police. According to his profile on his firm’s website, Marc Agnifilo has won acquittals in many of the country’s most complex and difficult trials.

(Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) He worked previously as a supervisor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. He also worked previously as a Manhattan assistant district attorney. At the Agnifilo Intrater firm, Agnifilo serves as the lead trial counsel on complicated and serious criminal cases, investigations and financial regulatory matters. Before requesting bail be granted for his client, Agnfilio said that Combs was not adjusting well to a new prison diet, saying that the food 'is probably the roughest part of it.' The firm’s website said Friedman Agnifilo specializes in internal investigations relating to misconduct, discrimination and sexual assault. The New York Daily News reported that the couple was previously on opposing sides of the sexual assault case involving International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011. Friedman Agnifilo was working for the Manhattan District Attorney’s office at the time, which meant she would not have to recuse herself in the matter, The New York Times reported. The New York Post reported, however, that Friedman Agnifilo was forced to recuse herself from several of her husband's cases, including one against Harvey Weinstein. 'It’s never been awkward,' Marc Agnifilo told the newspaper about being part of a two-lawyer household tied to high-profile cases. 'We’re pretty regimented about it. If she’s recused from a case, we really don’t talk about it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangiones-new-york-attorney-married-to-diddy-lawyer/	2024-12-16T11:59:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24345709519032.jpg?w=900
What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory?	(NewsNation) — As drones become more visible across New Jersey and New York, conspiracy theories continue to spread. Project Blue Beam is a conspiracy theory dating back to the 1990s, but some believe the current drone sightings are a sign of it coming to fruition. What is Project Blue Beam? Canadian journalist Serge Monast is credited with coming up with the theory of Project Blue Beam, wherein there is a plot to engender a dictatorial, universal government that abolishes Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) in favor of a new world order. Mystery drones: Where they have been spotted? In theory, this totalitarian state is to be achieved through staged futuristic NASA technology pretending to be proof of alien presence or attacks. Monast claimed NASA and the U.S. were collaborating to abolish Abrahamic religions to establish a 'New Age' religion with the anti-Christ as the figurehead. Who is talking about Project Blue Beam? Several prominent figures have discussed how they believe continued drone sightings and Project Blue Beam are intertwined. Actress Roseanne Barr posted on X Sunday: 'Now you see why I mention Project Blue Beam every week on my podcast....' 50 drone sightings prompt New Jersey sheriff to action Alex Jones also discussed the topic, sharing a 2021 interview with ufologist and former physician Dr. Steven Greer, in which the latter suggested a 'hoax cosmic threat' would soon be coming into effect. A fan page of influencer Charlie Kirk shared an image of a post from a Reddit 'conspiracy' thread on X, purportedly written by a '25-year radar operator for a major [government] agency' which echoed similar rhetoric to Jones. On Sunday, Jones quote-tweeted footage of drones appearing in New Jersey, describing their presence as 'part of a larger psychological warfare operation ahead of major events.' Experts' opinions on drone sightings University of Pennsylvania mechanical engineering professor Vijay Kumar told Newsweek does not believe the drones are a foreign state actor, but rather a U.S. government initiative. Multiple drones are seen over Bernardsville, N.J., Dec. 5, 2024 (Brian Glenn/TMX via AP) 'Firstly, it's not a coincidence, I think, that all these sightings have been near military bases. I'll just leave it at that,' he told the outlet. 'If I was an adversary, I would take great trouble to conceal what I was doing. So that leads me to believe that it's not a military power that's trying to attack the U.S.' East Coast drone sightings reach San Diego Director of Mason Autonomy and Robotics Center at George Mason University, Missy Cummings suggested to Newsweek they may not be drones at all. 'It is highly unlikely these are large drones as you describe, and if they are drones, they likely would be controlled by line-of-sight, so possibly from the water but probably not miles out to sea,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/what-is-project-blue-beam-drone-conspiracy/	2024-12-16T10:04:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2189936159.jpg?w=900

Mysterious drones shut down air base in Ohio	DAYTON, Ohio (WJW) – Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, was shut down for hours this weekend due to drone activity. The shutdown occurred amid reports of clusters of drone-like objects flying low in the night sky in several states, but very little information has been released about them. Some of the drones, or suspected drones, have also been flying over military installations, alarming residents in states including New Jersey and New York. Officials have attempted to reassure the public that military installations are able to detect and respond to drones, and security personnel are trained to identify them. Mystery drones: Where they have been spotted? The FBI had said last week that the drones do not belong to the U.S. military and that foreign governments are not behind the objects. This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) On Sunday, officials at Wright-Patterson confirmed its airspace was closed for four hours on Friday night and early Saturday because of small unmanned aerial systems being spotted in the vicinity. The shutdown meant that no airplanes were allowed in and out of the base. Wright-Patterson's officials did not divulge the altitude at which the systems were flying, but they said they ranged in different shapes and sizes. 'Installation leadership has determined none of the incursions impacted our base, our residents, our facilities or our assets,' said Wright-Patterson Public Affairs Chief Robert Purtiman. There is growing bipartisan outrage that the federal government has not offered a clear explanation as to who is behind the confirmed drone sightings. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has asked the Department of Homeland Security to immediately deploy the Robin Radar System to get to the bottom of this. 'We’re asking The Department of Homeland Security to deploy special detection systems like the Robin, which use not a linear line of sight, but 360-degree technology that has a much better chance of detecting these drones,' said Senator Schumer.

As pressure grows on federal agencies like the FBI to provide answers, drone sightings have caused airspace closures. Places like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and Stewart International Airport in New York closed its runway for an hour due to drone activity.
