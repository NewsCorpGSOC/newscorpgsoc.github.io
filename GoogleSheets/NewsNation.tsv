Hezbollah vows revenge for Hamas leader Sinwar's death	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden says securing a cease-fire and bringing hostages home are the main focuses after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war isn't over. Meanwhile, Hezbollah says Sinwar's death only stands to escalate its war with Israel. US responds to death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar Israeli, US response to Sinwar's death Following Thursday's announcement, Israel’s military released a drone video that shows a person they say is Sinwar just before he died by Israeli tank fire. Biden spoke with Netanyahu after Sinwar’s death and congratulated him on the news. Despite a renewed push for a cease-fire, however, Israel said the war isn’t over. Netanyahu said he wants Israel to maintain long-term control over Gaza and added that any Hamas member who helps with hostage rescue and turns their weapons in will be offered amnesty. In Iran, Sinwar’s death has strengthened the spirit of resistance, the country’s UN team said. The U.S. military has boots on the ground in Israel operating an air defense system to protect against a possible Iranian attack. Bolton calls death of Hamas leader ‘a good day for the whole world’ Hostages in Hamas detention About 101 Israeli hostages remain in Hamas custody and dozens are believed to be dead. Twenty-three-year-old Israeli American soldier Omer Neutra is one of those remaining hostages believed to be alive. Hamas took him in October 2023. His parents called for peace after the announcement of Sinwar’s death. 'We are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages,' Neutera’s father, Ronen Neutra, said. Sinwar was described as a major obstacle to a deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Israel early next week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/hezbollah-revenge-hamas-leader-sinwars-death/	2024-10-18T06:08:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/655e7f0006f8d1.34963862.jpeg?w=900

Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza: Who was he?	(NewsNation) — Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds behind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has been killed, the Israeli military confirmed Thursday. 'Eliminated: Yahya Sinwar,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) wrote on X. Sinwar — who had been the de facto head of Hamas since Ismail Haniyeh was killed in July — was a U.S.-designated terrorist and had been at the top of Israel's most-wanted list since the start of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is dead, IDF source confirms He was one of the chief architects of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw at least 250 others taken hostage. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called Sinwar’s killing a 'military and moral achievement for the Israeli army,' saying it would 'create the possibility to immediately release the hostages,' in a statement shared with The Associated Press. Hamas had not confirmed Sinwar's death as of early Thursday afternoon. Here's what we know about Sinwar. Who was Yahya Sinwar? Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. Later, he went on to form the group's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, which became known for sending suicide bombers into Israel and firing rockets from Gaza into Israeli towns. Sinwar developed a reputation for brutality and earned the nickname 'the butcher of Khan Younis' after he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators. In 1988, Sinwar was arrested by Israel for his terrorist activity. He was sentenced to four life terms for abducting and murdering two Israeli soldiers but was later released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. After his release, Sinwar returned to Gaza, where he rose to power. The U.S. State Department designated Sinwar a global terrorist in 2015. By 2017, Sinwar had been named the new leader of Hamas in Gaza, with The New York Times describing him as a 'militant hard-liner.' 'He carries a reputation as a harsh enforcer of loyalty within the group, and as an unstinting enemy of Israel,' the Times wrote. In May, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor sought an arrest warrant for Sinwar for his alleged role in the Oct. 7 attack. According to the AP, Sinwar was killed in Rafah after an Israeli tank launched a shell at a building, causing it to collapse. Photos of Sinwar published by Israeli media show a man wearing a bulletproof vest, surrounded by grenades, lying in the rubble of a building with a head wound, the AP reported. The Associated Press and NewsNation's Robert Sherman contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/who-was-yahya-sinwar/	2024-10-17T11:36:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1251837467.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Liam Payne, a former member of One Direction, fell to his death from his balcony at the CasaSur Palermo hotel in Buenos Aires Wednesday, a sad end to a recently turbulent life. Liam Payne's death at Argentina hotel First responders were called at 5:04 pm on Wednesday by the hotel — half an hour after he was carried out of the hotel’s lobby and just minutes before Payne fell from his third-floor balcony at 5:07 pm. A newly released emergency call from the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires manager to the police was chilling. Friends and musicians express heartbreak at the death of singer Liam Payne at age 31 The frantic manager 'begged for law enforcement and requested urgent’ assistance, alleging the out-of-control singer was ‘putting his life at risk’,' according to the NY Post. 'Hello, good morning. I just called and my line got disconnected. I’m calling (from) the CasaSur hotel in Palermo, Costa Rica 6032,' the manager is heard saying in Spanish in audio obtained by the Sun UK and La Nacion. The manager, 'Esteban,' claimed that Payne was destroying his hotel room and was under the influence of 'drugs and alcohol., saying: 'Well, we have a guest who is drunk on drugs and alcohol. And, well, he’s … When he’s conscious, he’s breaking up the whole room. And, well, we need you to send someone, please.' 'We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don’t know if this guest’s life is at risk. They must be in a room that has a balcony. And well, we’re a little bit worried he’ll do something, that he’ll put his life at risk.' 'How long has he been there or is it a residential hotel?' the operator asked. 'No, no, he’s been there for two or three days,' the manager said.

(Photo by Dave J Hogan/Getty Images ) Liam Payne posts about 'lovely day' before death An insider told Page Six that 'Liam had been cycling through periods of ruinous behavior for a long time,' adding that 'his demons were much worse than he let on.' Shortly before his death, Payne claimed he was having a 'lovely day in Argentina' in a since-deleted Snapchat story during his vacation with girlfriend Kate Cassidy. Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 shocks fans around the world Cassidy flew back to Miami on Monday — two days before the tragedy insinuating she’d had enough of the elongated trip (the couple were set to leave weeks before after catching former One Direction Niall Horan’s show in the city but stayed on for 14 more days). 'I was so ready to leave,' Cassidy shared in a TikTok video. 'Honestly, love South America but I hate staying in one place for too long. And we were supposed to be there for, like, five days, turned into two weeks… I was just like, ‘I need to go home.'' Liam Payne struggled with issues linked to Maya Henry Payne — who has battled drink and drugs for years — was also dealing with his ex. According to People: 'Payne was struggling with issues related to his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry'. A source with knowledge of the situation told the magazine that Payne 'was extremely overwhelmed by all of the legal issues' involving Henry. The Texan model, 23, instructed lawyers to issue a cease and desist letter to Payne a few days earlier, accusing him of 'obsessively contacting her friends and family including her mother Azteca Henry'. Henry posted a video to TikTok that said: 'Ever since we broke up he messages me, will blow up my phone, not only from his phone, it's always from different phone numbers too, so I never know where it's gonna come from.' 'He'll create new iCloud accounts to message me — it's always a new damn iCloud account. Every time I see one pop up on my phone I'm like, 'here we f---ing go again' 'Also, he will email me... not only me, but he'll blow up my mom's phone. Is this normal behavior to you?' Henry also accused Payne of 'weaponizing' fans whom he 'preys' upon against her. Liam Payne open about struggles with drugs and alcohol Since skyrocketing to fame at the age of 16 with One Direction, Payne has been open about his struggles with drugs and alcohol. Regarding alcohol, Payne told Men’s Journal: 'It's almost like putting the Disney costume on before you step up on stage and underneath the Disney costume I was (drunk) quite a lot of the time because there was no other way to get your head around what was going on.' Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast in 2021, Payne told host Stephen Bartlett that he had struggled with 'severe suicidal thoughts' and heavy drug use while he was in the band. 'I was worried how far my rock bottom was going to be,' he said in the interview. 'Where's rock bottom for me? And you would never have seen it. I'm very good at hiding it. No one would ever have seen it. 'There is some stuff that I have definitely never, never spoken about… it was really, really, really severe. And it was a problem. And it was only until I saw myself after that, I was like ‘Right, I need to fix myself.’' Liam Payne and his bandmates all sought solo success after One Direction fame Payne spent 100 days in a Louisiana rehab in 2023. Before leaving for Argentina, Payne told fans in an Instagram story that he had things 'to square up' with Horan but didn’t get into specifics about it. Liam Payne died of 'cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' Medical officials confirmed that Payne died of 'a cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries' sustained in the fall. 'Our role was to head there quickly, give medical attention, and try to resuscitate him, but his injuries were incompatible with life,' said Buenos Aires emergency services chief Alberto Crescenti, according to La Nacion. The Argentine newspaper also ran pictures from Payne’s damaged hotel room showing drugs, drug paraphernalia, booze and a broken TV. 'Liam will forever live in our hearts': Liam Payne's family On Thursday, Payne’s family issued a statement to the BBC which read: 'Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.' Payne isn’t the only member of One Direction to struggle with fame and a solo career. His former bandmate Zayn Malik has been very public about his anxiety and anorexia issues since leaving the band.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/liam-payne-death-hotel-urgent-assistance/	2024-10-17T11:08:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/gettyimages-1134037682-594x594-1.jpg?w=594

The IDF said it couldn’t confirm the identities of the other alleged Hamas members who died. 'There were no signs of the presence of hostages in the area,' Israel’s military wrote on X. 'The forces that are operating in the area are continuing to operate with the required caution.' This story is developing.

The Israeli military is investigating whether top Hamas leader Si...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military says it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. The military said in a statement Thursday that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without elaborating. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of the three was Sinwar. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He was chosen as the group’s top leader following the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. An Israeli strike on a school sheltering the displaced in northern Gaza on Thursday killed at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the strike targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza where Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera's Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Israel has struck central Beirut on two occasions in its latest war against Hezbollah, and both came without warnings. In northern Gaza, Fares Abu Hamza, head of the ministry's local emergency unit, confirmed the toll from the Israeli strike and said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by both militant groups inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Panel looking into Trump assassination attempt says Secret Servic...	WASHINGTON (AP) — An independent panel investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally faulted the Secret Service for poor communications that day and failing to secure the building where the gunman took his shots. The review also found more systemic issues at the agency such as a failure to understand the unique risks facing Trump and a culture of doing 'more with less.' The 52-page report issued Thursday took the Secret Service to task for specific problems leading up to the July 13 rally in Butler as a well as deeper one within the agency's culture. It recommended bringing in new, outside leadership and refocusing on its protective mission. 'The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,' the authors wrote Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Homeland Security Department, the Secret Services' parent agency, in a letter accompanying their report. 'Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.' One rallygoer was killed and two others wounded when Thomas Michael Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and opened fire as Trump spoke. The former president was wounded in the ear before being rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents. That shooting, along with another incident in Florida when Trump was golfing — a gunman there never got a line of site on the president or fired a shot — has led to a crisis in confidence in the agency. The report by a panel of four former law enforcement officials from national and state government follows investigations by members of Congress, the agency's own investigators and by Homeland Security's oversight body. A look at the report's key findings and recommendations: Poor communications, no plan for key buildings The panel echoed previous reports that have zeroed in on the failure to secure the building near the rally that had a clear line of site to where Trump was speaking and the multiple communications problems that hindered the ability of the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement to talk to each other. 'The failure to secure a complex of buildings, portions of which were within approximately 130 yards of the protectee and containing numerous positions carrying high-angle line of sight risk, represents a critical security failure,' the report said. The panel faulted the planning between Secret Service and the local law enforcement, and said the Secret Service failed to ask about what was being done to secure the building: 'Relying on a general understanding that ‘the locals have that area covered’ is simply not good enough and, in fact, at Butler this attitude contributed to the security failure.' The panel also cited the fact that there were two separated command posts at the Butler rally: one with various local law enforcement and another with the Secret Service: 'This created, at the highest level, a structural divide in the flow of communications.' There were other communications problems. The Secret Service had to switch radio channels because radio traffic of agents protecting first lady Jill Biden at an event in Pittsburgh was popping up on the channels of agents covering the Butler rally. The panel also noted that all the law enforcement personnel on the ground were using a 'chaotic mixture' of radio, cell phone, text, and e-mail throughout the day to communicate. Also the panel said it was unclear who had ultimate command that day. Cultural issues within the agency The report delved into the agency's culture and painted a picture of an agency struggling to think critically about how it carries out its mission, especially when it comes to protecting Trump. The panel said agency personnel operated under the assumption that they effectively had to 'do more with less.' The report said the additional security measures taken to protect Trump after the Butler shooting should have been taken before. 'To be clear, the Panel did not identify any nefarious or malicious intent behind this phenomenon, but rather an overreliance on assigning personnel based on categories (former, candidate, nominee) instead of an individualized assessment of risk,' the panel wrote. The panel also noted the 'back-and-forth' between the Trump security detail and Secret Service headquarters regarding how many people were needed to protect him. The panel also faulted some of the senior-level staff who were involved in the rally for what they called a 'lack of ownership.' In one example, the panel said a senior agent on site who was tasked with coordinating communications didn't walk around the rally site ahead of timen and did not brief the state police counterpart before the rally about how communications would be managed. It cited the relative inexperience of two specific agents who played a role in security for the July 13 rally. One was the site agent from Trump's detail whose job it was to coordinate with the Pittsburgh field office on security planning for the rally. The panel said the agent graduated from the Secret Service academy in 2020, and had only been on the Trump detail since 2023. Before the Butler rally the agent had only done 'minimal previous site advance work or site security planning.' Another agent assigned to operate a drone detection system had only used the technology at two prior events. What did the panel recommend? Having a unified command post at all large events where Secret Service and other law enforcement representatives are all physically in the same place; overhead surveillance for all outdoor events; security plans must include a way to mitigate line of site concerns out to 1,000 yards and who's in charge at the event; and more training on how to get protectees out of dangerous scenarios. The panel said the agency also needs new, outside leadership and a renewed focus on its core protective mission while expressing skepticism that the agency should continue with the investigations it currently conducts. While the Secret Service is well known for what it does to protect presidents and other dignitaries, it also investigates financial crimes. 'In the Panel’s opinion, it is simply unacceptable for the Service to have anything less than a paramount focus on its protective mission, particularly while that protective mission function is presently suboptimal,' the report said. The panel members were Mark Filip, deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush; David Mitchell, who served in numerous state and local law enforcement roles in Maryland and Delaware; Janet Napolitano, homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama; and Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/ap-panel-looking-into-trump-assassination-attempt-says-secret-service-needs-fundamental-reform/	2024-10-17T05:04:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710fde506f230.58156373.jpeg?w=900
Video: Marshals raid Atlanta mansion occupied by squatters	(NewsNation) — Georgia is cracking down on squatters, fed up with people ignoring property laws. Fulton County marshals raided a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta on Wednesday after a group of squatters showed signs they possibly identified as 'sovereign citizens,' people who believe they are exempt from U.S. law. They allegedly showed up to the property, set up camp and dared anyone to remove them. Menendez family: We suspected abuse from the beginning The video of the raid was posted to social media by the marshal's office. In the video, heavily armed officers swept through the mansion during the early morning raid. At one point, officers even used a drone to ensure the area was secure. NewsNation reached out to the Fulton County Marshal’s Department for comment but has yet to hear back. In July, the Georgia Squatter Reform Act was enacted, stating that squatters caught inside a home will now be cited and given three days to present a lease. If they can't do so, or the lease is found to be a forgery, a misdemeanor charge immediately becomes a felony. The new law also states that it doesn't have to be the property owner who reports the squatters, meaning it could be a neighbor or a homeowners association member who calls the police.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/marshals-raid-atlanta-mansion-squatters/	2024-10-17T04:40:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/image-1.png?w=900
US long-range B-2 stealth bombers target underground bunkers of Y...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels early Thursday, a major escalation in the American response to the rebels' attacks on Mideast shipping lanes that appeared to be a warning to Iran as well. While it wasn't immediately clear how much damage the strikes caused, the attack appeared to be the first use of the B-2 in combat in years and the first time the flying wing targeted sites in Yemen. In announcing the strikes against the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made a point to offer a warning likely heard in Tehran as well. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened or fortified,' Austin said. Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The B-2 would be used in any American attack on hardened Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz or Fordo given it is the only aircraft in service that can drop the GBU-57, known as the 'Massive Ordnance Penetrator.' Iran offered no immediate comment on the strike Thursday. Its foreign minister has been visiting Arab nations ahead of an expected Israeli retaliatory strike over Tehran's Oct. 1 missile assault. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. Austin said the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' Both he and the U.S. military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done. However, Central Command said it believed no civilians had been killed. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion of cargo pass through it yearly. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel and have shot down U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drones. The rebels have threatened new attacks in response to Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon and its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hamas' initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israeli miltary action in the time since has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, hundreds more in the West Bank and over 2,300 people in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the combat edges ever closer to a full-on regional war. The locations named by the Houthis on Thursday correspond to known underground bases operated by the rebels, who have been locked into a stalemated war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 that’s decimated the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthis have refurbished tunnels that once held Scud missiles when Yemen was ruled by strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, according to an analysis in April by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those sites include the al-Hafa and Jebel Attan military bases, the former Presidential House and the Yemen state television compound in Sanaa, analyst Fabian Hinz wrote. The Houthis have built what appears to be their own large-scale tunnel network near Saada as well, Hinz added. 'The fact that the Houthis began constructing major new installations after the agreement of the cease-fire with the Saudi-led coalition suggests that the group is focused on entrenching themselves and bolstering their military capabilities,' he wrote. Iran similarly relies on a network of underground missile bases. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The aircraft are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there, though some B-2s were in Australia in September. The U.S. last used the B-2 in combat in 2017 against Islamic State group targets in Libya, killing more than 80 fighters in a mission defense officials at the time said disrupted possible militant attacks in Europe. The B-2's use in Yemen comes just two days after U.N. Special Envoy Hans Grundberg warned Yemen's frozen war could heat back up given the Mideast wars and the Houthis' taking captive U.N. and aid workers in an internationally criticized crackdown. 'This cycle of retaliation is pulling Yemen deeper into the regional conflict, jeopardizing its hopes for peace and stability,' Grundberg said Tuesday. 'Moreover, it distracts from the urgent need to address Yemen’s own internal crisis.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-us-long-range-b-2-stealth-bombers-target-underground-bunkers-of-yemens-houthi-rebels/	2024-10-17T03:34:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6710e79a005580.23710202.jpeg?w=900
Flight attendants in crisis: Stripping, struggling, homeless	(NewsNation) — After a long day assisting travelers on a major airline, a flight attendant by the name of 'Bree' takes off her wedding ring and begins her second shift. 'I am definitely not a girl that you would normally see in a strip club, and I come from a great family. I grew up with a lot of morals, a lot of Christian morals. I have a partner, I have a job,' Bree told NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves. Bree spoke under the condition of anonymity, concerned about keeping her job. After years of flight attending and trying other avenues of earning additional income, like delivering for DoorDash, she says the decision to strip simply came down to 'the need for survival.' 'If you tell somebody that you’re a flight attendant, they normally think you make a lot of money,' said Bree. 'The public looks up to flight attendants, and it’s like you have this glamorous life.' In reality, Bree said, 'You’re dirt poor. You’re very, very poor. So poor, you become a little scrappy. You get paid under $30,000 a year.' ‘Everybody’s angry’: Thousands of autoworkers unemployed Bree said this new line of work has exposed her to a world that was wholly foreign to her before. 'I never saw a pimp before. I never looked at a drug dealer and knew what they did for work before. I never had people asking me for blow jobs, and they would pay $500. I would never get asked all the time if I could go home and have sex with somebody for money. This was not how I grew up. This was not my way of life,' said Bree. She said a constant risk and worry is exposure to fentanyl at the strip club. She said the use of the synthetic opioid was so common among the clientele that she learned to recognize its distinctive scent. 'It smells like peanut butter,' said Bree. 'I carry Narcan with me, just little nasal injections of Narcan, and I told my boss, ‘Just in case anything happens, if you find me on the floor — I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t do drugs — and there’s Narcan in my backpack. That’s what you should treat me with.’' Bree is one of many flight attendants who spoke exclusively with NewsNation for this story, saying they are in crisis, struggling to make ends meet. Kim: Living in a shed with three children Like Bree, 'Kim' also flies with a major airline. She said her passengers would have no idea she lived in a shed with her three children with no running water. One night, she said the temperature fell to minus 20 degrees. Then, the power went out. 'I had taken all my kids basically into bed with me. And I kind of, you know, used hand warmers,' said Kim. ‘'We’re just gonna have a sleepover in mommy’s bed!’ That’s what you can tell them. You can’t say anything else. That was really rough. Actually, that was probably the worst experience of my life.' Like the other flight attendants NewsNation spoke with, Kim said she only gets paid for about half of the hours she actually works. At many airlines, there is no pay for waiting at the gate, during boarding or disembarking. 'In all reality, I’m paid less than a McDonald’s worker,' said Kim. 'You do training for six weeks, and you aren’t paid for any of that. Sometimes, you work 10 1/2-hour days, and you get paid five.' Kim said she had tried to never let the struggle show on her flights. Child care costs more than rent across 100 largest US metros 'People love me. When I get on the plane, I’m super nice, and no one would know anything about me unless I told them because my hair is done, my makeup is done. I have a uniform. I’m smiling, I’m interacting.' Kim has no plans to leave the industry. She described herself as financially 'trapped' due to the fact that she pulled a loan from her 401(k): 'If I were to quit right now, I would have to pay all that back, and it’s money I don’t have.' Kim has managed to provide for her children, moving them into a better living situation as she now looks for a second job on top of flight attending. 'Sometimes, I wish I didn’t wake up in the morning,' she says, but it is her children who keep her going. Nasstasja: Eating leftover passenger meals Nasstasja Lewis told NewsNation she will never forget receiving her first paycheck as a flight attendant for a top airline. 'My paycheck that I got was 250 bucks. And that could only buy probably one trip for me and my son at the grocery store and probably pay a bill that was lingering. So it was really, really hard. Ramen noodles were a thing,' said Lewis. She recalled wondering, ''How am I going to survive for the next month until I get paid again?' It was really, really scary.' Lewis said what attracted her to the job was the appearance of traveling to glamorous destinations and the promise of financial freedom. Instead, in order to prioritize her son, she has resorted at times to eating passengers’ leftover meals. McDonald’s largest fry producer closes factory; CEO blames $5 meals 'You have to just put your pride aside and say, ‘Hey, I have to eat, or I don’t.’ It does make you feel some kind of way during those times because you’re just like, 'What am I doing here?'' said Lewis. On top of the financial hardship, Lewis recalled an incident where she was physically shoved by a passenger. She said she made the decision not to report it. 'We’re already overwhelmed, and I just wanted to go home. It was a long trip. We had delays that day, and we were supposed to be home hours before, so I just took it and swallowed it and got home,' said Lewis. Flight attendant Nasstasja Lewis tells NewsNation she has eaten passengers' leftover meals to make ends meet. (Photo courtesy of Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) Lewis said the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated challenges at the job. During the pandemic, the incidence of depression among cabin crew increased from 8% to 23%. Reports of stress similarly increased from 8% to 24%. Even before the pandemic, flight attendants faced a higher rate of suicide as well as alcoholism. According to the CDC, in 2012, flight attendants were found to have a suicide rate that is 1 1/2 times higher than the general population. Lewis said even as she posted smiling photos showing her job on social media, internally, she struggled with burnout and mental health. 'I experienced suicidal ideation during my time as a fourth, fifth-year flight attendant,' said Lewis. 'Feeling like you don't want to be here anymore. Depression, anxiety, all those things are impacted within this profession, and more needs to be done about it.' If you or someone you know needs help, resources or someone to talk to, you can find it at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website or by calling 1-800-273-8255. People are available to talk to 24/7. Liam: Living in an apartment with 20 flight attendants Liam Horgan is a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines. He has lived on food stamps and in a 'crash pad' with 20 flight attendants in the Bay Area. 'I was paying $455 a month to share a two-bedroom apartment with 20 flight attendants,' said Horgan. 'The amount of things that would pile up, the amount of trash, the amount of bodies. It drops cold at night, but for it to be that cold outside and still be 80 degrees inside the bedroom because there are so many bodies and bunk beds. It was hard.' Liam Horgan, a first-year flight attendant with United Airlines, takes a selfie in an airport. (Photo courtesy of Liam Horgan, AFA union member) Many new hires work 'on reserve,' essentially a system of being on call. They can wait for several days for an assignment. Horgan described picking up as many hours as he could to the extent that 'there were certain months that I would only be home about 3 days a month.' Horgan added he would earn about $2,300 a month before taxes were taken out. 'I don’t think a single person who applied for this job knew what it was going to be like. Because I certainly didn’t know,' said Horgan. Horgan said that when new flight attendants exit training, they are assigned to a base, typically in a city with a high cost of living like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York or Washington, D.C. Rent has risen faster than wages in most US cities Horgan said it made an impression when management at his new base explained how he could apply for food stamps. 'I just feel like it’s kind of embarrassing that corporate greed has gotten to the point that management at these corporations are telling new hires, 'Hey, we know we don’t pay you a living wage, so here’s how you can apply for welfare,'' said Horgan. 'This is a career. This is not just starting out at an entry-level job.' Horgan said he had no concept of the extent of the mental health struggle he’d witness in his colleagues. One of the flight attendants he lived with in a crash pad attempted suicide. 'There’ve been a lot of mental health issues with a lot of flight attendants, especially new hires,' said Horgan. 'I’ve felt the pressure of it myself. There have been nights that I’ve sat in bed, almost crying myself to sleep, because I’m like, ‘What am I doing with my life?’ I was working retail, and I was not struggling to make ends meet like I am right now.' Flight attendant union president: 'They can’t survive' 'A week doesn’t go by that I don’t hear another heartbreaking story from a flight attendant, and it’s from every single base,' said Ken Diaz, United AFA Union president. Diaz described hearing reports of flight attendants all over the country experiencing 'bankruptcies, going through their life savings, taking loans against their 401(k)s. Some are living in their cars, credit cards to the max, marriages breaking up over financial debt. My heart breaks for them because it shouldn’t be this way. It shouldn’t.' The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) is the country’s largest flight attendants union.Diaz said he has been unable to reach an agreement with United after three years of negotiations. 'They’re asking for concessions during a time when they’re making billions in profits, billions,' said Diaz. United CEO Scott Kirby made nearly $19 million in 2023. 'We got these airlines through some difficult times. Whether it be bankruptcies during the eighties to the pandemic. We helped them get the government loans that allowed them to survive, and then, they just forgot about us afterward,' said Diaz. The median pay for flight attendants in 2023 was roughly $68,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Diaz said that new hire pay is projected to be much lower. 'It was always tough in the past, but no one’s ever experienced the cost of living like it is today. And when you put that wage rate in today’s cost of living, it’s nothing. They can’t survive,' said Diaz. Flight attendants ‘fed up’ over stagnant wages: Union leader The AFA told NewsNation first-year flight attendants can expect to make about $23,000 at Frontier; $25,000 at Alaska Airlines; $26,000 at United Airlines; $31,000 at American Airlines; and $32,000 at Delta Air Lines. 'When people see the actual wage rate, they say, ‘Oh, those are good.’ What they don’t realize is United flight attendants do not get paid until that aircraft starts moving back from the gate. So the time they check in, the safety checks, in between flights, all of that is unpaid for. You’re only paid almost for half the time that you’re at work,' said Diaz. 'The morale is at the lowest point I have ever seen morale at United Airlines in the 28 years I’ve been here.' NewsNation reached out to United Airlines. It did not respond. Alaska Airlines provided this statement: 'Our goal is always to provide our flight attendants and employees with market-competitive wages and benefits. We appreciate how financially challenging the beginning of any career path can be and it’s one of the reasons we are so anxious to get a contract in place so our flight attendants can start benefiting from increased wages and improved benefits.' Flight attendants helping one another Thresia Raynor has been a flight attendant with Alaska Airlines for almost 17 years. She said she only realized how many of her colleagues were homeless when she’d offer to drive them home after a flight, only to find their 'home' was a car on the side of the road. 'Every day at my job, I have to drop off a girl from a trip who has no car and transportation to a place of homelessness, or take her to a car where she lives, or quite often share meals with her at work because she has no food and no money for food. That’s what I experience quite often in my job,' said Raynor. She cofounded a Facebook group called 'Alaska Airlines Flight Attendants Experiencing Hunger and Homelessness' and did not expect the response. Flight attendant Thresia Raynor was amazed by the response to the Facebook group she made to support her struggling peers.

(Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy)A message from a struggling flight attendant sent to the th|AIR|apy advocacy group. (Photo courtesy Nastassja Lewis, founder th|AIR|apy) 'Overnight, it was over a thousand members,' said Raynor. 'We just had no idea that there is that many people struggling. We wanted them to have a safe place to come and talk and be heard and just to scrape away all that shame and embarrassment. To have people come forward and talk about where they park their cars at night to sleep, how they go to back alleys in the back of restaurants. People sharing how they survive homeless and hungry.' Nastassja Lewis also turned her personal experience into the nonprofit Th|AIR|apy, which focuses on flight attendant mental health. It has grown to more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. Lewis said it provides an emergency crisis line that is used every single day. 'When you’re getting messages from your peers saying, ‘Thank you for this. It’s keeping me going,’ or ‘Thank you, I really needed someone to talk to at 2:30 in the morning, and you were here for me,' said Lewis, 'it lets me know the work we’re doing is really vital.' Bree: 'I don’t have a lot to show for it' Bree said as dangerous as working at the strip club can be, there is an unfamiliar feeling — a flood of financial relief — that she hasn’t felt in her years of flight attending. She said at the strip club, she could earn roughly $300 to $1,000 a night. 'When I would take home money at the end of the night, I would sit down on the floor, and I would just count it because I need to make sure that the time I put in was worth it,' said Bree. 'It feels good to finish a job in one day and be like, ‘Okay, I made rent,’ and then the next day, ‘Okay, I paid for all of our groceries.’' Bree described herself as 'resilient' and 'optimistic.' She said this has also been a time of taking stock. Bree is now several years into embarking on the 'dream' of flight attending. 'I’m a good employee. Any job that I’ve had, I’ve gone up the ranks quickly. I’m a hard worker. And I’m creative, I’m kind. I feel like I’ve been working so hard. And I don’t know, I don’t have a lot to show for it. I don’t even have my own car. I sold my truck to help pay for flight attending,' said Bree. When asked if she would recommend being a flight attendant, she hesitated. 'I did not realize how little I’d be getting paid. I’ve been poor before; this was a new level of stress. People selling their eggs or becoming sperm donors, flight attendant groups recommending selling your plasma if you have a longer layover in a certain city. We are literally trying to find parts of our body that will produce money. I don’t think it should be like this in this country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/going-broke-flight-attendant-strips-on-the-side-to-survive/	2024-10-17T03:24:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/A234D08CA7C21AC04ACF8D5DEF51AC89.jpg?w=900
Vance says 'no' when asked whether Trump lost 2020 election	In the months since he became Donald Trump ’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance has repeatedly deflected questions about whether the Republican presidential nominee lost the 2020 election, saying he was focused on the future. During a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, where Vance was asked by a reporter about his lack of straight answers so far, he was more declarative. 'What message do you think it sends to independent voters when you do not directly answer the question ‘Did Donald Trump lose in 2020?’' the reporter asked, eliciting boos from the crowd before Vance responded, saying he has answered the question 'a million times.' 'No. I think there were serious problems in 2020,' Vance said. 'So, did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use, OK?' The answer was the most specific Vance has been on the subject, and a departure from the series of evasions he has offered about the election Trump continues to say without evidence was decided fraudulently in favor of Democrat Joe Biden. During a debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz this month, Vance was asked about the 2020 election but responded that he was 'focused on the future.' Vance’s refusal to say whether Trump lost was widely considered his weakest debate moment with Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who called the response 'a damning non-answer.' The campaign for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris quickly turned the exchange into a television ad. During an interview with The New York Times, Vance refused five times to acknowledge Biden won. Trump's continued denial that he lost the election to Biden is a widely held opinion among the Republican's base of supporters. He warned an audience in Nevada last week, 'We never want to have happen what happened in 2020.' Trump has continued to say without evidence that he expects his opponents to 'cheat' in the 2024 election and has urged his supporters to turn out in numbers to make his vote tally 'too big to rig.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-vance-says-no-when-asked-whether-trump-lost-2020-election/	2024-10-16T19:44:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67107aa1e62a12.77687679.jpeg?w=900
One Direction singer Liam Payne found dead in Buenos Aires: Repor...	(NewsNation) — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement Payne, 31, fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had thrown himself from the balcony of his room.' He said police were dispatched to the hotel in response to an emergency call about an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' Arriving police heard a thud and found Payne’s body in the hotel courtyard, Policicchio said. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, said on Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. He declined to answer further questions about the incident, including whether Payne jumped from the balcony or fell by accident. Florida continues building in high-risk areas Payne reunited with One Direction in Argentina earlier this month for a Niall Horan concert, according to Teen Vogue. He was one of five band members of One Direction, which formed in 2010 when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor.' After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful.' They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016. They had a loyal fan base, many of whom were teen girls, who became known as 'Directioners.' Once the group disbanded, Payne pursued a solo career, putting out the album 'LP1' in 2019. His last release was a single called 'Teardrops' in March. In 2021, Payne said he had problems with addiction and mental health during his One Direction fame. 'It was really, really, really severe. It was a problem,' Payne told 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast host Steven Bartlett. He said his early boy band days were filled with 'pills and booze' and 'moments of suicidal ideation.' One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the street as police stood sentinel outside. Young women at the scene expressed shock and heartbreak. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told The Associated Press. Video showed dozens gathered on the cordoned-off street outside the hotel, with many recording videos on their cellphones. A forensic investigator was seen exiting the hotel, where Payne’s body remained Wednesday evening. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/one-direction-singer-liam-payne-found-dead-in-buenos-aires-report/	2024-10-16T14:41:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/gettyimages-1134037682-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
One Direction singer Liam Payne found dead in Buenos Aires: Repor...	Oct 16 (Reuters) - Former One Direction singer Liam Payne died outside a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, local newspaper La Nacion reported on Wednesday. The 31-year-old British musician was found dead after falling from the hotel's third floor, it said, citing emergency services. Several witnesses at the hotel told TMZ Payne fell from his room at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel. It's unclear if the fall was intentional or accidental. Witnesses say Payne 'had been acting erratic in the hotel lobby earlier,' according to TMZ. He reportedly smashed his laptop and had to be carried back to his room. Florida continues building in high-risk areas Payne reunited with One Direction in Argentina earlier this month for a Niall Horan concert, according to Teen Vogue. Payne joined One Direction when he was 16. The group became the biggest boyband in the world after its 2010 launch on 'The X Factor' before ultimately breaking up in 2015. In 2021, Payne revealed that he struggled with addiction and mental health during his One Direction fame. 'It was really, really, really severe.

FEMA leader: Misinformation about hurricane operations must stop	(NewsNation) — The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) now has four disaster recovery centers in western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. FEMA says it has approved disaster assistance for more than 75,000 households, but there is a lot of confusion regarding FEMA, militia groups and hurricane recovery in the state. Over the weekend, national media outlets reported on threats from armed militias to FEMA, causing them to temporarily pause work in North Carolina. Efforts have since resumed. One North Carolina resident, William Parsons, was arrested after posting a message on Facebook calling for people to 'overtake' the FEMA site in Lake Lure, claiming that the agency was withholding supplies from hurricane survivors. Parsons said after his arrest that the law enforcement agents who arrested him were lying. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'They want to sit here and lie and say I was carrying guns around. I had one gun on me, which was legally owned and sitting on the side of my hip, and I had a rifle and another pistol that were in my vehicle that were both lawful and legal to own,' Parsons said. Last Saturday in Carter County, Tennesee, which was also hit by the hurricane, volunteers with the International Alliance of Community Chaplains witnessed a group of people confronting and threatening FEMA workers, NewsNation local affiliate WJHL reported. Tracy Elder, president and founder of the International Alliance of Community Chaplains, said the people who confronted the FEMA workers were armed but didn't have their guns drawn. 'They had surrounded them, and there was a lady there that was yelling and threatening them,' Elder said. FEMA says they made operational changes to keep personnel safe. Deanne Criswell, FEMA's administrator, had a very specific message Tuesday. Group associated with polygamous sect builds fences on US Forest Service lands 'The ongoing spread of misinformation about operations is not OK. It has got to stop,' Criswell said. 'The federal family has been here, working side by side with the state since Day 1. These are people who put their lives on hold to help those who have lost everything.' Adam Smith, who leads a volunteer organization called Savage OPs, which is made up of special operations forces, nurse practitioners and civil engineers who help with hurricane recovery efforts, says the rumors about armed militias are directed at groups like theirs. Smith, a former Green Beret, said those threats are hurting their ability to get aid into the community. 'Misinformation is not coming from the ground up. I think the misinformation is coming from the top of FEMA down,' Smith said. 'When you have contractors that are afraid to go out into the areas they are supposed to work, and they are saying you have to carry, and you have to pack, you know, watch out people are going to come after you, not true — the people in the mountains might be suspicious of the government in general, but they are the most welcoming people you could possibly imagine.' Smith says they aren’t going anywhere and just want to help and support the community. 'The conversations that we've had with county state officials as well as National Guard personnel (is like), 'Hey, there's going to be a point when the transition happens, when the National Guard has to demobilize, when the 101st has to the mobilize,'' Smith said. 'And when that transition happens, we're not going to have those forces in the area and we're going to still be here. Moreover, we've we've been told, 'Hey, keep doing what you're doing.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/fema-leader-misinformation-hurricane-operations/	2024-10-16T12:33:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175616737-1-1.jpg?w=900
Florida continues building in high-risk areas	(NewsNation) — One week since Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida cleanup efforts are underway, and so is new construction. New data shows tens of thousands of new properties have been built in high-risk flood areas despite the growing risk of destructive hurricanes. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said hurricanes will not weaken the demand for homes on Florida's Gulf Coast because there's always going to be a demand to live in beautiful places. Hurricane fallout threatens to hinder voting More than 16 million people in Florida currently live in coastal counties and that number continues to go up despite the risks of hurricanes and flooding. Climate modeling firm First Street Foundation told NewsNation that real estate developers have actually built 77,000 new properties in high-risk flood areas since 2019. That's the highest number in the nation. Nationally, close to 300,000 new properties were built in high-risk flood areas between 2019 and 2023, a number that has been concerning for disaster-risk experts who say that in many states, it would only take one good-sized hurricane to break the entire insurance system. 'We got to a situation in our country that, while we don't lose as many lives in storms, our losses are rising because we have more people coming to the coast and we have therefore grown our exposure to these storms,' said Tracy Kijewski-Correa, a disaster-risk reduction specialist. 'We have a climate that's changing, that's going to be, regrettably, the perfect storm.' Kijewski-Correa said that while Helene was an outlier in terms of lives lost, the property damage from hurricanes could lead to some major changes. to insurance.

'Because there will be, for some families, very little possibility of ensuring or building to withstand what might be coming.' The Federal Emergency Management Agency recently looked at what are called severe, repetitive lost properties, a designation that covers homes that have severely flooded more than once. The agency found that there are 45,000 of those properties in the U.S. at the end of 2022, with about 3,100 of those in Florida alone. Ratings for Morningstar DBRS said, in a report released this week, that it expects Hurricane Milton to be among the top five costliest natural catastrophes in the U.S., with insured losses approaching $60 billion. Experts warn we are entering a difficult situation with the insurance industry across the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, saying we need to build better before storms hit to mitigate the toll of damage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-building-high-risk/	2024-10-16T11:58:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177760605.jpg?w=900
Retired therapy dog goes back to work after Hurricane Milton	(NewsNation) — Before Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida, tornadoes ripped through the state, with St. Lucie County being one of the areas hit hardest. A local therapy dog, Ben, came out of retirement and now goes door-to-door, offering a head to pet for residents who are now picking up the pieces after the storm. 'He has come a long way, but I'm very proud of him, and he's a natural at what he does,' Olivia Chasse, Ben's owner, said. Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist Ben worked at a nursing home, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, they stopped allowing visitors, so Chasse decided the time had come to let him 'just be a dog and enjoy life.' After the hurricane, though, Chasse saw people donating food, time and supplies and also wanted to help. 'I thought, 'Well, we've got something a little bit different that we can offer,'' Chasse said. '(Ben) got pretty excited about going to work. He knew he was going to get some back scratches.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/retired-therapy-dog-helps-after-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-16T07:36:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Milton.jpg?w=350
Delphi killings trial: State seeks to nix composite sketches	CARROLL COUNTY, Ind. – The state doesn’t want a pair of composite sketches that were highly publicized early in the investigation to be part of the Delphi murders trial. On Monday, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland filed a motion in limine asking the court to prohibit the admission of the sketches or any reference to them during the trial. 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German. (Credit: Family) The motion refers to a pair of widely circulated composite sketches of the Delphi suspect. Law enforcement released two sketches—one in July 2017 and another in April 2019.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } The second sketch showed a suspect who looked considerably younger than the person seen in the original one. The sketches were based on the recollections of witnesses and were released to the public to generate tips about the February 2017 murders of Abby Williams and Libby German. For several years, online sleuths attempted to match various suspects to the sketches. The initial sketch released in 2017 (left) and the revised sketch released in 2019 (right) McLeland’s motion argued that 'a composite sketch is not relevant, admission would result in undue prejudice, confuse or mislead the jury, or is impermissible hearsay, and the witnesses who participated in the preparation of composite sketch(s) will not be presented by the State for the purpose of in-court identification of the defendant.' McLeland went on to argue that the sketches were not related to the identification of Allen as a suspect and weren’t relevant to his trial, which started with jury selection this week in Allen County. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the girls’ deaths near the Monon High Bridge. McLeland argued that 'the witnesses who assisted in the preparation of composite sketches of the Bridge Guy would testify that they did not see the person depicted in their sketch for a sufficient length of time to allow them to positively identify the defendant.' Richard Allen Mugshot - Oct. 13, 2024 He added that it was the state’s belief that Allen’s defense intended to 'use composite sketches from the investigation as demonstrative evidence and for impeachment purposes.' The sketches were not 'instrumental in identifying' Allen, McLeland wrote. The motion contended that the 'prejudicial effect' of admitting the sketches would far outweigh their 'probative value' in court. Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court The motion asks the court to order the defendant, his counsel and witnesses to 'refrain from mentioning, commenting, or making any reference whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, to composite sketches without first obtaining permission of the Court outside the presence and hearing of the jury.' The motion is now one of several outstanding motions Special Judge Fran Gull must mull ahead of this week’s opening statements.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-trial-sketches/	2024-10-16T07:11:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Delphi-sketches.jpg?w=770
Family pushes to free Menendez brothers after nearly 30 years	(NewsNation) — Nearly two dozen family members of Erik and Lyle Menendez, the two brothers convicted of killing their parents in 1996, are holding a news conference Wednesday in Los Angeles in hopes it will move the needle in the brothers' appeal of their conviction. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced earlier this month that he was reviewing new evidence in the case against the brothers. New evidence allegedly includes a letter from Erik Menendez to a cousin before the killings. In it, Erik Menendez details some of the sexual abuse he survived at the hands of his father, Jose Menendez. Plus, new allegations against Jose Menendez from a second, young boy claiming to have been raped by him at 14 have come into the spotlight. Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court Family stands by Menendez brothers Family members have said the Menendez brothers should not have been charged with murder, but manslaughter — but that wasn't an option. The brothers' extended family will advocate for the brothers’ release from prison during the news conference as prosecutors review new evidence to determine whether they should be serving life sentences for killing their parents. Erik Menendez, now 53, and his 56-year-old brother, Lyle Menendez, are currently incarcerated in state prison without the possibility of parole after being convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion more than 35 years ago. Lyle Menendez, who was then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, admitted they fatally shot their entertainment executive father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, in 1989. However, they argued self-defense, saying they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father’s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. While testimony and evidence about the sexual abuse was allowed in the brothers' first trial that ended in a hung jury, it was not allowed in the second trial that ended in guilty verdicts. 'I always believed that they were sexually molested,' Karen Vandermolen Copley told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo earlier this month. 'My sister Diane lived with them, and they have evidence that was not allowed. We have always supported the boys once we knew and understood the facts.' The extended family’s attorney Bryan Freedman previously said they strongly support the brothers’ release. Comedian Rosie O’Donnell also plans to join the family Wednesday. Texas man facing execution in shaken baby syndrome case awaits clemency ruling New evidence sparks case review Earlier this month, Gascón said there is no question the brothers committed the 1989 murders, but his office will be reviewing new evidence and will make a decision on whether a resentencing is warranted in the notorious case that captured national attention. The brothers’ attorneys said the family believed from the beginning they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder. Manslaughter was not an option for the jury during the second trial that ultimately led to the brothers’ murder conviction, attorney Mark Geragos previously said. The case has gained new traction in recent weeks after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.' The new evidence includes a letter written by Erik Menendez that his attorneys say corroborates the allegations that he was sexually abused by his father. A hearing was scheduled for Nov. 29. Prosecutors at the time contended there was no evidence of any molestation. They said the sons were after their parents’ multimillion-dollar estate. In a recorded conversation in a Netflix documentary, Erik Menendez claimed the spending was to 'cover up the horrible pain of not wanting to be alive.' Jurors in 1996 rejected a death sentence in favor of life without parole. NewsNation reached out to relatives and the brothers' attorney for comment. However, they said they would not comment on the case until after Wednesday's news conference.

Accused Gilgo Beach killer Rex Heuermann due in court	(NewsNation) — The man accused of killing six women over the course of 30 years near Gilgo Beach, New York, is due in court Wednesday. Rex Heuermann will go before a Suffolk County judge at 9 a.m. EDT, marking his first court appearance since July. He pleaded not guilty in June to all charges filed against him. Texas man facing execution in shaken baby syndrome case awaits clemency ruling Heuermann is charged with murder in connection with the deaths of six women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. He was initially charged with murder in the deaths of the first four women, and prosecutors later charged him in the deaths of Taylor and Costilla. Heuermann, an architect, lived across the bay from where officials discovered the bodies. His attorney said he’ll seek to separate the cases so the charges relating to the first four women are tried independently from the two most recent charges. Police spent the past 14 years investigating the deaths of at least 10 people — most of whom were sex workers — whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway near Gilgo Beach on Long Island.

Harris peppered with questions by Charlamagne tha God’s audience	Vice President Harris was peppered with questions Tuesday about her plan for Black Americans from radio host Charlamagne tha God and his listeners in an interview that’s part of a late-campaign media blitz before Election Day. The interview began with Charlamagne asking Harris to respond to criticism about the quality of her responses to questions and the notion that she is repetitive, which she characterized as 'discipline.' She also addressed 'the weight of the moment' in her role running for president against Trump. 'I feel an extraordinary weight of responsibility right now to do everything I can,' Harris said. 'When I go to bed at night, in addition to my prayers, I will ask, ‘Have I done everything I could do today?’' 'This is a margin-of-error race. It's tight,' she added. 'But I'm going to win. I'm going to win.' Throughout the interview, Harris shared her position on topics such as reparations — which she said she supports studying — building up Black homeownership and the opportunity to grow generational wealth. The interview was an opportunity for Harris to speak directly to Black voters, a group that polls show overwhelmingly support her over Trump. But some of the interview questions also revealed some disenchantment about voting and whether the candidate could fulfill the promises she’s making on the campaign trail. At one point, Charlamagne pointed out that Harris is facing the issue of misinformation in this year’s election, particularly on her history as a prosecutor. 'One of the biggest pieces of misinformation, one of the biggest allegations against you, is that you targeted and locked up thousands of Black men in San Francisco for weed,' Charlamagne said. 'Some say you did it to boost your career. Some say you did it out of pure hate for Black men. Please tell us the facts.' Harris immediately denied the allegations and instead said she was 'the most progressive prosecutor' in California. She then pledged to work to decriminalize marijuana if elected president. 'I know exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations, and specifically Black men,' Harris said. Questions around Black men and what Harris plans to do for them popped up repeatedly during the interview — unsurprising as polls show her support among the demographic slipping while Trump’s numbers are improving. Harris released an 'Opportunity Agenda for Black Men' on Monday, but one caller asked her why she didn’t do so sooner and why support for Black men is only sought out during election cycles. 'I've been in this race about 70 days. You can look at all my work before those 70 days to know that this, what I'm talking about right now, is not new, and is not for the sake of winning this election,' Harris responded. 'This is about a long-standing commitment, including the work that I've done as vice president and before, when I was senator.' Harris’s time as a senator came up at another point in the interview when a caller from Nevada asked what she plans to do to address police brutality and its disproportionate impact on Black Americans. The vice president quickly pointed to her work on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) during her time in the upper chamber. 'We couldn't get the votes in Congress,' she admitted. 'But what we did when we came in office and during the time that I've been vice president, is we passed an executive order … that says that for federal law enforcement, the following things have to happen, which we, for the first time, put in place: no knock warrants, barring chokeholds, a national database for us to collect information and track police officers who have broken the law.' 'I'm still going to always work on getting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,' she added. 'Part of the work that I'm doing as a candidate for president of the United States includes lifting up those candidates who are running, either for reelection or for the first time to Congress, who are supportive of what we need to do on all of the issues we've been discussing.' While the interview was Harris’s chance to speak directly to Black voters, Charlamagne also pressed her on recent comments that she said she would not do anything specifically for Black people. Harris denied making the statement, reminding Charlamagne of the start of the conversation around misinformation. Later, she added that she is running 'to be a president for everybody.' 'But I am clear-eyed about the history and the disparities that exist for specific communities and I'm not going to shy away from that,' Harris said. 'It doesn't mean that my policies aren't going to benefit everybody, because they are. Everything I just talked about will benefit everybody.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-peppered-with-questions-by-charlamagne-tha-gods-audience/	2024-10-16T02:16:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24289047511075-e1729028318895.jpg?w=900
Georgia judge blocks ballot hand-count rule from taking effect be...	(NewsNation) — A new Georgia election rule that would require a hand-count of ballots on election night will not take effect before November’s contest, a state judge ruled. In a decision late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney agreed to block the rule’s application, writing that the public is 'not disserved by pressing pause.' 'This election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away, regardless of one’s view of that date’s fame or infamy,' McBurney wrote in an eight-page ruling. 'Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.' The rule, passed by the Republican-led State Election Board, was set to go into effect Oct. 22, just two weeks before the election, and after early voting in the state is underway. Under the rule, three poll workers at each facility would have been required to count the physical ballots — not votes — 'separately' and 'independently' in stacks of 50 until all three counts matched. The hand-count would be completed on election night unless a scanner had more than 750 ballots by the end of voting, at which point a poll manager could push counting to the next day. Election officials and poll workers vocally objected to the change, warning that hand-counting ballots is overly burdensome and prone to error. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has called the rule 'misguided' and suggested it would delay the reporting of election results. Additionally, the state would have little time to train poll workers under the new guidance. During a bench trial over the matter Tuesday, a lawyer for the Cobb County Board of Elections told McBurney that 444 county poll officers would have to be trained to comply with the new rule. Lawyers for the State Election Board pushed back by saying the panel was tasked by Georgia’s Legislature with defining election rules — and put under no time constraints to do so. McBurney said in his ruling that his decision was not final and would be further detailed at a later date, but not until after the election. He said that the county election board made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm, pointing to the chaos that could ensue if the '11th-and-one-half hour' rule was implemented. 'Our Boards of Election and Superintendents are statutorily obligated to ensure that elections are ’honestly, efficiently, and uniformly conducted,’' he wrote. 'Failure to comply with statutory obligations such as these can result in investigation by the SEB, suspension or even criminal prosecution.' He added, in parentheses, 'While the latter is far-fetched, it is not an impossibility in this charged political climate.' The judge did not issue a decision on five other rules, which were discussed at the hearing Tuesday, nor weigh the merits of the hand-count rule. The Cobb County election board did not seek to halt implementation of the other rules. The Democratic National Committee intervened in the case. Following McBurney's ruling, DNC acting co-Executive Director Monica Guardiola, Georgia Democratic Party Chair Rep. Nikema Williams and Harris-Walz Deputy Campaign Manager Quentin Fulks issued a statement in support of the decision. 'From the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it,' they said. 'We will continue fighting to ensure that voters can cast their ballot knowing it will count.' McBurney’s decision is the second major ruling he made Tuesday. Earlier, the judge established that county election officials may not delay or decline to certify election results, rejecting a challenge from a Fulton County election board member who refused to certify during Georgia’s spring primary. That board member is one of at least 19 Republican county officials in the state who have refused to certify election results since 2020 in a marked increase from previous years, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Georgia is one of seven critical battleground states that could shape the election's outcome. McBurney is also weighing two other new State Election Board rules, which would allow for a 'reasonable inquiry' before election certification and let election workers 'examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.' He has not issued any decision on the matter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-judge-blocks-ballot-hand-count-rule-from-taking-effect-before-election/	2024-10-15T19:39:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/c75854e51ef346528ac6c8dd13ca9ff4-e1677590583917.jpg?w=900

ISIS-K orchestrated foiled Election Day terror plot: Report	(NewsNation) — The Afghan branch of the Islamic State, ISIS-K, orchestrated an Afghan man's foiled Election Day terror plot, two senior U.S. officials briefed on the matter told NBC News. Afghan native Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was arrested in early October and accused of planning to target large groups of people on Nov. 5. He told investigators he and a co-conspirator — whose identity has not been released — planned to die as martyrs. Tawhedi first arrived in the United States in September 2021. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, the Oklahoma City resident bought AK-47 rifles, liquidated his family’s assets and purchased one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan, charging documents revealed. Did migrants from Hamas cross into US after Oct. 7? Those same documents show that Tawhedi, who officials say consumed Islamic State propaganda, was in contact with an ISIS affiliate named 'Mailk.' A family member of Tawhedi was arrested and charged by French law enforcement this past weekend for allegedly planning a similar terror scheme, according to NBC News reporting. NewsNation has reached out to federal officials about these reports but has not yet heard back.

Majority find 2025 Social Security COLA bump insufficient: Survey	(NewsNation) — The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment for recipients in 2025, the smallest such increase since 2021. On average, Social Security retirement benefits will increase by about $50 per month starting in January, a minor increase for most. And recipients are feeling the pinch, with a recent survey from the Motley Fool showing a majority (54%) view this year's COLA adjustment as insufficient. A similar number, 50% — have considered going back to work to make ends meet. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits An even wider majority, 81%, agreed that the 2025 COLA will help 'very little' or not 'at all' with key expenses like food, housing and energy costs. Social Security cost-of-living adjustments have varied over the past few years. Here’s how they have changed: 2025: 2.5% 2024: 3.2% 2023: 8.7% 2022: 5.9% 2021: 1.3% The recent drop is due to a cooling pace of inflation, which is good for the overall economy but may leave retirees struggling to cover costs. Often, retirees rely heavily (32%) or exclusively (28%) on payments despite Social Security being designed to cover 40% of the average worker's salary. Medicare open enrollment begins Tuesday Most respondents, 71%, don't think the formula to determine the COLA accurately reflects how retirees experience inflation. How is Social Security COLA determined? Each year, the government determines the COLA by comparing the average inflation rate from July to September to the same period the year before. That calculation is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Some senior advocacy groups want the government to determine the COLA based on the CPI-E, a different inflation index specifically for seniors, arguing it would more accurately reflect the spending patterns of those 62 and older. The vast majority of Social Security beneficiaries, roughly 75%, are retired workers who received an average monthly check of $1,920 as of August. That’s about $80 more than the year prior. What’s the average amount of credit card debt Americans carry? Social security shortfall Thursday’s COLA announcement comes as the national social insurance plan faces a looming financial shortfall. In roughly a decade, Social Security recipients could see their benefits cut by 21% if Congress doesn’t take action. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have vowed to protect the program and promised not to slash benefits, though neither has offered many specifics. The 2025 COLA increase will be reflected in your January Social Security check.

Millennials doing better financially than baby boomers were: Stud...	(NewsNation) — Contrary to popular belief, millennials are better off financially than previous generations at the same age, according to a new study. LendingTree found that millennials ages 26 to 41 had a median net worth of $84,941 in 2022 — more than Gen Xers ($78,333) and baby boomers ($58,101) at similar ages after adjusting for inflation. The findings suggest millennials’ net worth is 8.4% higher than Gen Xers’ and 46.2% higher than baby boomers’ at the same age. Tracking debt: Which generation owes the most? 'The scars from the Great Recession and the pandemic have helped shape millennials’ views on money, forcing them to be more focused on their finances than other generations have had to be,' said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst. Millennials have more money partially because they're better educated than their predecessors, allowing for superior employment opportunities. The report found that midpoint millennials — those born in the middle of the generation — earned a median cumulative income of $446,570 between 2014 and 2023. By comparison, midpoint baby boomers earned about 20% less, $362,330, between 1980 and 1989 after adjusting for inflation. With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings? But it's not all good news for millennials. One of the reasons their finances are in better shape is because they're delaying major milestones like marriage and homeownership, the report noted. Millennials are also more likely to live at home than previous generations — a win for their wallets but potentially a negative for overall life satisfaction. As for debt, LendingTree found millennials have nearly twice as much as baby boomers did at the same age but because their assets are worth significantly more, millennials come out ahead on net worth. One important caveat: More millennials (12.7%) had a negative net worth compared to Gen Xers (11.5%) and baby boomers (11.9%) at similar ages. That finding is supported by other research pointing to a widening wealth gap within the millennial cohort. What about the cost of housing? The cost of housing is one area where millennials are worse off. That's true for both renters and home buyers. In 1990, midpoint baby boomers paid a median monthly rent of $1,174 adjusted for inflation. That's $307 less than millennials' current median rent of $1,481. Homeownership is also more expensive today. A 20% down payment on a median home purchase in 2024 is $85,960 for midpoint millennials compared to $57,107 for baby boomers in 1990. However, millennials have benefitted from lower mortgage rates, which were much higher, around 10%, in 1990. Overall, millennials ages 25 to 34 spent an average of $15,429 on shelter in 2022 — 26% more than baby boomers did at the same age. Are millennials really doing better financially? Academics and media organizations have continued to debate whether younger generations are worse off than their parents — and that discussion is likely to continue. On the whole, recent research suggests younger generations in the U.S. are doing better than many expected compared to a few years ago, and, inequality within, not between, generations is growing. In August, the Wall Street Journal highlighted 'the dramatic turnaround in millennials' finances.' The report cited research showing the median household net worth of older millennials skyrocketed from $60,000 in 2019 to $130,000 in 2022. 'The turnaround has been so dramatic that millennials — mocked at times for being perpetually behind in building wealth, buying homes, getting married and having children — now find themselves ahead,' WSJ wrote. Researchers at the University of Cambridge found that U.S. millennials were not 'universally worse off' than baby boomers in a 2023 study but noted a 'vast and increasing wealth gap.' 'The wealthiest millennials now have more than ever, while the poor are left further behind,' the study's lead author Rob Gruijters said in a statement. He added: 'Individuals with typical working-class careers, like truck drivers or hairdressers, used to be able to buy a home and build a modest level of assets, but this is more difficult for the younger generation.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/millennials-financially-baby-boomers/	2024-10-15T15:05:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/PayingBillsGettyImages-1313653794.jpg?w=900
Mystery drones flew over US base	(NewsNation) — New details are emerging about drones that flew over U.S. military bases last year, though there is still no explanation for where they came from. Air Force officials confirmed several drones flew over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December of 2023, an incident that has been brought up in a number of congressional hearings and even brought to the attention of President Joe Biden. Langley houses one of the Defense Department's largest and most important military infrastructures and is home to some of the nation's most advanced fighter jets. ‘Once in a lifetime’ comet viewing in Utah — here’s how It's still not clear exactly what the objects were, and if the Pentagon has an answer, it has not released that information publicly. A recent Wall Street Journal report says that the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which is tasked with studying reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, was involved in the investigation alongside the FBI. That means the Pentagon had at least some indication that these might be something we can't fully explain. Exclusive video given to NewsNation by someone who lives near the base shows lights in the sky with the person who took the video describing the drones being the size of cars. Some of the new reporting has corroborated that description. According to The Wall Street Journal's reporting, Pentagon officials who have seen the drones in person say they were about 20 feet long, traveling at around 100 mph or faster and at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Some speculate that the drones were not part of intelligence-gathering efforts by a foreign adversary like China or Russia, in part because they were out in the open with no apparent effort to hide them. Former Air Force pilot Ryan Graves, an advocate for pilots who have seen UAPs, told NewsNation the objects don't fit usual patterns. Maybe advanced civilizations aren’t all that advanced: Scientist 'We are seeing these objects blinking with white lights, not in the strobe pattern that one would expect due to FAA regulations, but patterns that don't seem to meet anything I'm aware of,' he told NewsNation. 'Additionally, the objects apparently have been lit up while they're operating over the base itself. So it did not appear, at least from the information I received, that these objects were trying to conceal their location or presence.' Senators who spoke to NewsNation also said they are not sure what the objects are either. NewsNation has reached out to the Pentagon for comment but has not received a response.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/mystery-drones-us-base/	2024-10-15T11:50:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/DroneLangley.jpg?w=900
What is the 'blue wall,' and what does it mean for 2024 election?	(NewsNation) — With less than a month until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is making stops this week in three states that experts say are critical to winning the White House. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is visiting Michigan on Tuesday for an event with Charlamagne tha God and another one with Black entrepreneurs in Detroit following a Monday trip to Pennsylvania. Next, she’s set to travel to Wisconsin. How to register to vote Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump also stopped in Pennsylvania this week for a rally in Pittsburgh. All three states are part of the so-called 'blue wall,' a set of states that have typically voted for Democrats in presidential elections since 1992. Which states are part of the blue wall? California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin are included as part of the 'blue wall.' Of these, California is the largest, as it has 54 electoral votes, followed by New York with 28. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, especially, are top priorities for candidates in the 2024 election. Trump, in 2016, flipped the states to Republican, but Biden was able to win them back in 2020. ‘False allegations’: Man arrested near Trump rally speaks out Could Trump break the blue wall? NewsNation partner The Hill writes that Harris and Trump are polling within close margins of each other in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Harris has a 0.7% lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, according to Decision Desk HQ/The Hill’s poll aggregate, while Trump has a 0.8% advantage in Michigan and 0.1% more than the vice president in Wisconsin. 'There’s no getting around the fact that those three states in the so-called blue wall are pivotal to both campaigns,' Al Mottur, a Democratic strategist and bundler at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, told The Hill.

McDonald's largest fry producer closes factory; CEO blames $5 mea...	(NewsNation) — 'Do you want fries with that?' America's largest fast food chain may have a fry issue as its largest supplier shuts off production and cuts costs at its Connell, Washington, plant. Lamb Weston, an Idaho-based company, announced the closure and a 4% cut in its workforce at the beginning of the month. The news comes as part of a restructuring plan expected to generate nearly $55 million of pre-tax cost savings for the company in 2025. Listeria meat recall hits Walmart, Target, more stores 'Lamb Weston is confident in the world’s ongoing love of fries — the closure of one of our older facilities accounts for less than 5% of our production capacity, so this adjustment simply helps address a current supply-and-demand imbalance,' Lamb Weston spokesperson Teresa Paulsen said in a statement to TODAY.com. Now, Tom Werner, the CEO of Lamb Weston, is blaming McDonald's $5 meal deal, which was introduced back in May. The meal deal is supposed to provide an affordable option for American families, especially during a time when inflation remains the highest in recent history. 'Restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand, relative to supply, continue to be soft, and we believe it will remain soft through the remainder of fiscal 2025,' Werner said. He said the steps to close one of its plants and cut costs is an effort to remain proactive to improve operating efficiency, profitability and cash flows.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/food/mcdonalds-french-fries-production/	2024-10-15T10:43:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-94500987-1-e1708631223656.jpg?w=800
Georgia on pace to break early voting record	(NewsNation) — Georgia, one of America's tightest swing states has opened its early voting window to a horde of people who are on track to break a record, according to a state official. 'This 1st day of early voting is a blowout,' Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, posted on X. Sterling said as of noon 122,049 Georgians have voted. On the first day in 2020, a total of 136,000 people voted early. Jill Biden expected to hold surrogate events for Harris, but when will Joe Biden? 'We will be blowing past the previous First Day record,' Sterling posted.

Nevada says volleyball match will go on despite players' forfeitu...	(NewsNation) — The University of Nevada in Reno said an upcoming women's volleyball match will still be held despite the team's players saying they would forfeit the match. As Outkick.com first reported Monday, the Nevada volleyball team decided via player vote to forfeit the Oct. 23 game against the San Jose State Spartans following reports that the team has a transgender woman on its roster, redshirt junior Blaire Fleming. 'We, the University of Nevada Reno women’s volleyball team, forfeit against San Jose State University and stand united in solidarity with the volleyball teams of Southern Utah University, Boise State University, the University of Wyoming, and Utah State University,' the team said in a statement provided to Outkick. Georgia university leaders ask NCAA to ban transgender women from sports Hours later, the university acted in opposition to the 'majority' of its women's volleyball team, providing a statement to Outkick saying the game would go ahead. 'The players’ decision and statement were made independently, and without consultation with the University or the athletic department. The players’ decision also does not represent the position of the University,' the school said. 'The University and its athletic programs are governed by the Nevada Constitution and Nevada law, which strictly protect equality of rights under the law, and that equality of rights shall not be denied or abridged by this state or any of its subdivisions on account of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, ancestry or national origin. 'The University is also governed by federal law as well as the rules and regulations of the NCAA and the Mountain West Conference, which include providing competition in an inclusive and supportive environment. 'The University intends to move forward with the match as scheduled, and the players may choose not to participate in the match on the day of the contest. No players will be subject to any team disciplinary action for their decision not to participate in the match.' Jean-Pierre blocking Kirby from White House podium, report says Southern Utah was the first team to forfeit against San Jose State before its Sept. 14 match. Boise State, Wyoming and Utah State followed suit, surrendering their games on Sept. 28, Oct. 5 and 23, respectively. The teams did not cite Fleming or any other reason for their forfeiture. Fleming has played in all 12 of San Jose State's games this season and has been part of the Spartans' squad for three seasons after one season at Coastal Carolina in 2020-21. San Francisco, Saint-Mary's, Fresno State, Colorado State, San Diego State, and Nevada Las Vegas have all played against the Spartans since Southern Utah's decision. The Spartans' next game is Thursday at New Mexico. San Jose State team co-captain Brooke Slusser claimed the school tried to sweep 'under the rug' the fact that Fleming is transgender after a report in April brought it to public consciousness. Slusser transferred to San Jose State in 2023 after playing two seasons at Alabama. Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas fails in challenge to rules that bar her from elite women’s races 'When that first article came out, it was quite literally just a media meeting talking about, 'Don't make comments. If media people come up to you, it's not your story to tell,'' Slusser told Outkick on Monday. 'And that was really it. It wasn't, ‘How do we feel about this? Are we OK?’ It was how to handle the media and not make it look like there's a problem, and almost just the feeling of just sweeping it under the rug, and that was really it.' Slusser is among numerous female athletes suing the NCAA for alleged violations of Title IX by allowing transgender athletes to play on women's teams. She supports the decision of teams to forfeit. 'There's obviously a part of me that it's sad because there's only so many volleyball games you get in your career. On the other hand, I'd be doing the exact same thing,' she told Outkick the Morning on Monday. 'I fully support every school that is deciding to find the courage, take this stance and not play against us because those are the steps in the right direction of women standing up and finding that courage to say 'No, this isn't OK.''	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/nevada-volleyball-match-forfeit-trans-athlete/	2024-10-15T09:35:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175714174.jpg?w=900
Delphi murders trial: Defense claims hair found with victim didn'...	ALLEN COUNTY, Ind. – Defense lawyers for Richard Allen made a startling admission during Tuesday's jury selection. Allen's defense team revealed that hair was found in Abby Williams' hand that didn't match Richard Allen. That's the first time that information has been made public. Attorney Andrew Baldwin made the comments during 'mini opening statements' preceding jury selection. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the deaths of Abby and her friend Libby German in February 2017. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. 14 jurors seated so far in Delphi murders trial While prosecutors say an unspent bullet found at the scene is linked to a gun owned by Allen and cite dozens of confessions from him, Allen's defense argued those confessions were made under duress and weren't trustworthy. They said Allen confessed to details from the crime that were inaccurate. He also confessed to other crimes that didn't happen, his defense team said. During Tuesday's proceedings, three previously selected jurors were dismissed from the trial, bringing the total number of selected jurors down to 11. One was removed because of childcare issues, another over health concerns. A third was dismissed as well. By noon, four new jurors were selected, bringing the total to 15. The group now includes 12 jurors and three alternates, with one alternate still needing to be seated. The current makeup of the jury is 10 women and five men. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, Allen’s defense team asked for a change of venue. Special Judge Fran Gull, appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court to oversee the case after the original judge recused himself, determined that was logistically challenging. What to know ahead of the Delphi murders trial She decided to bring in jurors from Allen County and have them transported to Carroll County for the trial. Jury selection began Monday. The jurors will be sequestered for about a month. More than 100 people were expected to testify between the defense and prosecution. Gull is scheduled to hear some evidentiary motions in the afternoon. Wednesday will mark a break in the trial before an additional hearing on Thursday in Allen County concerning the admissibility of widely circulated composite sketches in the case. The state filed a motion asking the sketches to be excluded from the trial. Opening statements are scheduled to begin on Friday, when the proceedings shift to Carroll County.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-trial-defense-claims-hair-found-with-victim-didnt-match-richard-allen/	2024-10-15T09:07:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Allen-Co-courthouse-VO-ININDOF1ENC002_mxf_00.04.10.20.jpg?w=900
Pandas arrive in the US. Next stop is the National Zoo	WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought is coming to an end. Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears arrived in the United States on Tuesday. They will be transported from Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia to the zoo. A pair of three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan and will soon be flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 'Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine,' the statement said, adding that the partnership will 'make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries.' Once the bears arrive in Washington, there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. On Monday evening, the zoo's website posted an alert that the entire facility would be closed Tuesday, without giving a reason. The lead article on the site still said the pandas would be coming sometime before the end of the year. Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions. Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week. That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco. In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, zoo director Brandie Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year. The Chinese announcement said the National Zoo had sent 'three experienced keepers and veterinary experts' to China to assist the transport and accompany the bears. Zoo officials on Monday declined to confirm the Chinese announcement. Zoo spokesperson Jennifer Zoon said in an email, 'For the safety of animals and staff, we are not able to confirm any details at this time.' But signs at the zoo and on its social media site have heralded the planned return of the pandas and panda-themed merchandise still dominates the gift shops. 'The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,' said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. 'The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.' The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four. Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation's capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable. 'The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,' Liu said in an email. 'We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-the-pandas-are-coming-the-pandas-are-coming/	2024-10-15T08:52:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670e90c0126171.83675344.jpeg?w=900
Two giant pandas arrive in DC from China	(NewsNation) — Two giant pandas have landed in Washington, D.C., as they head toward the National Zoo less than a year after a previous pair were returned to China. The pandas are on loan from China to the U.S. and the zoo is closed to the public Tuesday to allow for the pandas' safe arrival. The male and female pair are named Bao Li and Qing Boa and are said to be lively 3-year-old pandas who enjoy climbing. Kidney recipient comes full circle with job at dialysis center Pandas first came to the National Zoo in 1972 after President Richard Nixon traveled to China to open diplomatic and trade relations between China and the U.S. It was the start of what's been called panda diplomacy, with China using the animals to achieve diplomatic goals. In 2000, China sent Mei Xiang and Tian Tian to the National Zoo and the pair had a cub, Xiao Qi Ji, in 2020, and all three were returned to China in November 2023. With the panda family's departure, Zoo Atlanta, which is set to return its pandas this year, became the only zoo in the U.S. to house giant pandas. This summer giant pandas returned to the San Diego Zoo, and now the National Zoo will once again be home to the species that is considered a national treasure in China. Hurricanes Helene, Milton devastate Florida animal rescue The black and white bears are considered vulnerable, and U.S. zoos are only allowed to import giant pandas if they can ensure China uses half the loan fee for conservation efforts. Bao Li, the male panda, has a D.C. connection, as his mother Bao Bao was born at the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in 2013. Upon arrival at the zoo, the pandas will be quarantined for at least 30 days and after that will be given a few weeks to settle into their habitat before being viewed by the public.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/giant-pandas-arrive-dc/	2024-10-15T07:55:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/20240516-817A0262-03RP.webp?w=900
Hurricanes Helene, Milton devastate Florida animal rescue	(NewsNation) — The double dose of damage caused by two major storms in less than two weeks has locals in Florida questioning their ability to rebuild. That includes efforts at a Bradenton Beach wildlife sanctuary, where several animals did not survive the hurricanes. Floridians are still reeling from Hurricane Milton, which has killed at least 23 people across the state. Couple Gail and Ed Straight run the nonprofit Wildlife Inc. Education and Rehabilitation Center about 60 miles south of Tampa. Ed Straight, who is on dialysis and was away during the storms, has worked tirelessly with volunteers to rescue and rehabilitate about 150,000 injured or orphaned animals over the years. Now, the rehab center faces a double disaster. Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the sanctuary hard. The first storm’s floodwaters surged into the Straights’ home within minutes. Although Gail Straight stayed put during Helene, she was forced to evacuate ahead of Milton. As for the animals, most were evacuated before Hurricane Helene, including multiple 100-pound tortoises. Despite the owners' efforts, they lost some animals to the storms. 'It got really scary pretty quick,' Gail Straight said. 'It's the fastest I've ever seen it. We’ve had hurricanes here before, but not like this one.' Helene’s flooding destroyed thousands of dollars worth of food and equipment. Mold took over the sanctuary, and Gail was electrocuted while trying to move appliances when the floodwaters started to recede. The couple also lost two cars. Now, they don’t know if or when they’ll be able to rebuild. After dedicating more than 30 years to rescuing animals for free, the ordeal could put Gail Straight into lifelong debt, she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/florida-hurricanes-helene-milton-animal-wildlife-inc-sanctuary/	2024-10-15T06:22:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/ECA63689D66F794B02C3DFD38B7A9D7B.jpg?w=900
Massive meat recall includes hundreds of products sold at Walmart...	(NEXSTAR) — Check your fridge and freezer: A massive meat recall linked to possible listeria contamination has impacted hundreds of ready-to-eat meals sold at major grocery store chains across the U.S., including Walmart, Trader Joe's and Target. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released an updated list of affected products, some featuring popular brand names like Dole, Taylor Farms, Great Value and Michelina's. The recall, initiated by BrucePac, involves more than 9.9 million pounds of pre-cooked meat and poultry items that were produced from June 19, 2024, to October 8, 2024. Major home improvement retailer files for bankruptcy, announces sale plans The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service discovered the issue during routine testing, when Listeria monocytogenes was found in poultry samples. Subsequent testing traced the source of the bacteria back to BrucePac’s ready-to-eat chicken. The affected products were shipped to distributors across the country and later reached restaurants and other food service providers. They appeared in a variety of items, from frozen dinners to pre-made salads. Photos provided by USDA Aside from Walmart, Trader Joe's and Target, some other retailers affected by the recall include: 7-Eleven, Albertson's, Aldi, Amazon Fresh, H-E-B, Kroger, Meijer, Publix, and Save Mart.

Man arrested outside Trump rally says it's 'all false allegations...	(NewsNation) — Vem Miller, the Las Vegas man arrested Saturday for possessing multiple guns and fake press passes outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump, tells 'Dan Abrams Live' he had no such things on him. 'I didn't have fake passports. They were valid passports. I didn't have fake IDs. That's a false accusation,' Miller said. A self-proclaimed 'kindergarten kid when it comes to guns,' Miller said he was stopped and arrested because gun laws vary from Nevada to California. 'I've never owned guns in in California. I've owned guns in Nevada. And in Nevada, you're allowed to have the mag loaded up in the gun. Apparently, in California, they have to be separated,' he said. Who is Vem Miller, man arrested outside Trump rally? While that legal difference is true, NewsNation's Jesse Weber pointed out that whether the guns were loaded or not, bringing a weapon to a former president's rally after two previous attempts on his life would be reasonable cause for law enforcement concern. Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures while walking onstage for a campaign rally on October 12, 2024 in Coachella, California.Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Calhoun Ranch in Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024. Miller, a registered Republican, pointed to police misconduct and his own past as the founder of 'The America Happens Network,' which he claims has gotten him some death threats for 'exposing corruption.' 'Are you saying that you were specifically targeted by the sheriff in law enforcement, or that you were picked up for a reason or being made a scapegoat?' Weber asked. 'I'm being made whatever you call it, a targeted scapegoat. But nothing they did is lawful. I did not do anything that they were claiming I did,' Miller responded. What we know about arrest outside Trump’s California rally He reportedly claims to be a sovereign citizen, an anti-government group that Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco associated with him during a Sunday news conference. Miller also pointed to reports of his release on a $5,000 bond Sunday as false, telling NewsNation 'there was never a bail in the situation at all, whatsoever.' Multiple outlets, including USA Today and Fox News, reported his bail release. Federal agencies said the Republican nominee 'was not in any danger' at the event, and have not released any further information about pursuing higher charges against Miller. Miller, however, has promised a lawsuit against those who arrested him. 'The sheriff is going to be investigated, is going to lose his position,' he said. 'The deputy sheriff that was part of this is going to be investigated, is going to lose his position. There's going to be a massive lawsuit.' Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco also joined 'Dan Abrams Live' on Tuesday, saying his agency did all it needed to do to prevent any violence at the former's president's rally. New suits filed Monday accuse Diddy of sexual assault On Sunday, Bianco told a room full of media: 'If you are asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that stopped the third assassination attempt.' Federal agencies haven't announced any movements to classify Miller's arrest as a third assassination attempt, as Trump wasn't even at the rally when the arrest happened. It's something Bianco told NewsNation he can 'understand ... in a factual perspective and context.' 'I believe that they are still going to be looking into Mr. Miller and why he could have been there, or making sure it was legitimate,' Bianco said. 'But we are outside of their investigation, and ours was strictly the stop with the guns, and that's what we arrested him for.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

All my deputy knows is at the inner perimeter, he has a man showing up with firearms who has multiple IDs, multiple passports with different names and a vehicle that is not registered to anyone, with fake papers,' Bianco explained.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/vem-miller-trump-rally-interview/	2024-10-14T19:48:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/C86EB0FC4CE357E13D9CEEAF4F036D88.jpg?w=900
Detroit police officer killed in shootout with other officers	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — An officer with the Detroit Police Department is dead and two others are injured after a mental health call turned into a shootout. Around 2:26 p.m. Monday, DPS got a 911 call for a 'suicide in progress' on East Davison Service Drive and Saint Aubin Street in Detroit. The caller was identified as a member of the DPS Special Response Team, who was off-duty. He was threatening suicide and 'asking for suicide by cop,' according to Police Chief James E. White. Responding officers heard shots and White said the suspect was shooting in the air. The officers retreated and took cover behind a vehicle. The suspect shot the back of the vehicle multiple times, hitting two officers, one in the leg and one in the thigh. Whitehall buys $49,000 drone as privacy questions linger One of the officers returned fire, killing the suspect. White called it a 'very tragic situation.' 'He was struggling with a mental crisis. Tragically, we are not immune to mental crisis, we’re just like everyone else. Our officers deal with this every single day,' White said at a news conference. He said the 45-year-old man who died had been suffering with a 'very serious degenerative condition' and had returned to work just over a week earlier, after working on a restricted schedule due to his illness. He had been working with the department for 13 years. The two officers who were shot were in stable condition, according to White. The mayor noted their injuries were not life-threatening. Murder trial of man in Cash App founder's death begins Detroit Mayor Mike Duggin commended the courage of the responding officers. 'It’s a reminder of the courage that the officers of this department show every day. They went to that scene knowing they were going to be confronted by a highly trained and armed officer in the department who was having a significant mental issue,' Duggin said. Grief counseling will be made available and White said the department will work with the families involved to 'make sure they get what they need.' Michigan State Police is handling the investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/detroit-police-officer-killed-in-shootout-with-other-officers/	2024-10-14T18:23:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Detroit-Police-Department-030420.jpg?w=650
With interest rates falling where should I keep my savings?	(NewsNation) — High savings rates have been a bright spot in the recent interest rate environment but with the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates further, savers are likely to see their returns dip. Last month, the Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate for the first time in over four years and additional rate cuts are expected. Further cuts could mean lower rates on mortgages, car loans and credit cards, but also lower returns for savers who have been able to get 4% to 5% on their cash in recent years. But even if yields on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) drop, they'll still be attractive saving options for many. Is now the time to lock in a good CD rate? 'It may not be as much as you were getting pre-rate cut, but it's still a lot more than you would have if you just left (your money) in something that's not going to yield as much interest,' said Elizabeth Ayoola, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the national average annual percentage yield (APY) on savings accounts was 0.46% as of 09/16/2024. By comparison, the best high-yield savings accounts have APYs that are about ten times higher. Here's what to know about falling interest rates and your savings. Are high-yield savings accounts still a good idea? High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) are like traditional savings accounts, except they pay a higher interest rate which means your money grows faster. That will still be true even if the Fed cuts rates further. 'I don't think high-yield savings accounts ever become 'unattractive,'' Ayoola said. 'They are evergreen in the sense that they usually offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts do.' As it stands now, several banks are offering HYSAs with APYs between 4% and 5%. Over a year that can mean much better returns than a traditional savings account: $10,000 in a traditional savings account at 0.46% APY Interest earned: $46 $10,000 in a HYSA at 5.0% APY Interest earned: $500 Unlike investments in stocks or bonds, HYSAs are essentially risk-free. Just make sure you're using an FDIC-insured bank, which protects your money up to $250,000. The other benefit of a HYSA is liquidity. You can pull out or transfer money without penalty, which makes it a popular place for savers to keep their emergency fund. Do I have to pay taxes on my high-yield savings account? The main caveat is that HYSA interest rates can change at any time, so your return could be lower tomorrow than it is today. Another thing to keep in mind: HYSAs typically offer better rates than brick-and-mortar bank accounts but if you want to build wealth, investing in the stock market provides higher average returns. 'It's not recommended that you put tons of money in a high-yield savings account. Usually, it's used for things like an emergency fund or a short-term goal,' Ayoola said. Don't forget, the interest you earn from your HYSA will get taxed so prepare to fork over some of those returns to Uncle Sam. Are certificates of deposit (CDs) a better option? Unlike HYSAs, which have interest rates that fluctuate, certificates of deposit (CDs) allow savers to lock in a fixed rate for a set period. The downside is that your money is tied up for the duration of the CD. With interest rates likely to fall in the coming months, CDs are one way to guarantee a return at today's rates. As of late September, the median APY on a 6-month CD was 4.55%, down from 5.00% in January, according to NerdWallet. The rate on a 1-year CD was slightly better, 4.60%. The math works out like this: A $10,000 deposit on a 6-month CD at 4.55%: You are guaranteed a return of roughly $225 after six months. A $10,000 deposit on a 1-year CD at 4.60%: You are guaranteed a return of $460 after one year. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits Whether CDs are better than a HYSA will depend on your financial goals. CDs offer less liquidity and generally have penalties for early withdrawals, meaning it's harder to access your funds in a pinch. Then again, if you know you won't need the money for several months, CDs offer a stable return while HYSA yields could drop. 'If — and when — rates do drop as fed cuts continue, you'll still have the same rate locked in,' Ayoola said. 'At the moment, short-term CDs are still relatively attractive.' What about the stock market? High-yield savings accounts and CDs are low-risk options compared to stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cryptocurrency but they potentially come with less upside. The S&amp;P 500 is up 34% over the past year and nearly 23% year to date. Historically, the average annual return on the stock market is around 10% per year, significantly higher than the typical HYSA yield. The bottom line is that HYSAs are savings accounts, not investments. They are a stable option for those hoping to earn interest on cash that might otherwise be sitting dormant in a traditional bank account but they aren't intended to hyperdrive your retirement savings.

'Consumers could put money needed for a medium-term goal in a CD and then they could put money for an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account,' she said. 'It doesn't have to be either or.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/interest-rates-falling-savings/	2024-10-14T14:41:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/6446a16b9873b3.00956252.jpeg?w=900
New suits filed Monday accuse Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual assaul...	This article mentions sexual assault. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673. (NewsNation) — Six lawsuits were filed Monday against music producer and rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs that allege he sexually assaulted two men and two women between 1995 and 2021. These suits were filed anonymously in the Southern District of New York. Among them is one by a man who says he was a minor at the time of the assault. 'Defendant Sean Combs routinely recruited individuals to parties, drugged them, and then sexually exploited them,' according to a complaint. A lawsuit filed by a man from North Carolina states Combs was talking to him about the music industry when he ordered the then 16-year-old to drop his pants. 'Don’t you want to break into the business?' the lawsuit alleges Combs asked him. Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Then, the lawsuit said, Combs grabbed and began feeling the teenager's genitals. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani tells 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that if the accusations made by a minor against Diddy were included in his federal indictment, much of his defense’s argument about consenting relations between adults would go out the window. But that's only if these civil suits influence the trial — which Rahmani said would only happen if the victims come forward and testify. Monday’s suits were filed by Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, who previously said he’s representing 120 people who’ve experienced sexual misconduct by Combs. 'There’s an overarching theme here, as you probably can see, which is basically Sean Combs feels like he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it,' Buzbee said in an interview with NBC News before filing the documents. In addition to multiple civil suits filed, the first being one by Combs’ ex-girlfriend Cassandra 'Cassie' Ventura, the producer is also criminally charged with sex trafficking and racketeering. A grand jury indicted Combs, who is now being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn despite attempts by his defense attorneys to get him freed on bail. NewsNation has reached out to a representative for Combs. Erica Wolff, Combs’ lawyer, said in a previous statement to NewsNation that the rap mogul 'cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a reckless media circus.' 'That said, Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors,' Wolff said in a statement. Another suit filed Monday alleges Combs raped a woman when she was a college freshman in a locked hotel room in 2004. Combs, the lawsuit said, invited the woman, identified as 'Jane Doe,' and a friend to a party there, where he gave them drinks and told them to snort cocaine. The woman said in the lawsuit that Combs forced her friend to perform oral sex on him and threatened to have them both killed if they didn’t do what he wanted. Diddy accuser’s lawyer: Combs used oil, knife In a different lawsuit, a separate Jane Doe says Combs attacked her in the bathroom at a 2005 party celebrating the late rapper Biggie Smalls’ music video, 'One More Chance.' Combs, according to the lawsuit, brought the woman into the bathroom and started kissing her. The woman tried to pull away, she said, but he slammed her head against the wall, and she fell to the floor. When she tried to get away, Combs hit her and raped her, the woman says. After, Combs allegedly told her not to tell anyone, 'or you will disappear.' A man identified as John Doe said that Combs gave him an alcoholic drink at his white party in 2006 that he believes included a drug that made him sick. Then, the lawsuit said, Combs pushed John Doe into a van and sexually assaulted him. Other incidents detailed in lawsuits include a man stating he was forced to give Combs oral sex in a Macy’s stockroom in Manhattan’s Herald Square, as well as one where a man says the producer gave him a drugged beverage. At one point, the man, who says multiple men assaulted him, saw Combs naked above him, according to the lawsuit.

Dad accused of fatally shooting man found with missing child	LONOKE COUNTY, Ark. (KARK) – Officials in Arkansas said a man is facing a murder charge after a confrontation turned deadly early Tuesday morning. According to authorities, deputies with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office responded to a home shortly after 1 a.m. after a juvenile was reported missing. The deputies were told on the way to the home that Aaron Spencer, the father of the juvenile, had found the juvenile in a car with Michael Fosler, according to officials. Authorities said there was an altercation between the two men which led to Fosler being shot. Officials said Fosler was pronounced dead at the scene. Man accused of threatening FEMA workers with assault rifle Deputies said they took Spencer into custody on a preliminary charge of first-degree murder, and he was taken to the Lonoke County Detention Center. As of Monday, no formal charges have been filed against Spencer, and no additional details have been released. A woman claiming to be Spencer's wife claimed they had a no-contact order for Fosler, accusing him of stalking their child. In an online fundraiser, the woman said Spencer began driving around to search for their child after discovering she was missing. She explained that her husband happened to pass a man driving with their child in his vehicle and chased him. 'The chase ended in an accident. Aaron was able to retrieve our child alive, but in the process, he was attacked and did what he had to do to protect himself and our minor child,' the woman wrote. US soldier given 14-year sentence for plotting to help ISIS She added that they are working to 'retain a legal team' to help keep her husband, a combat veteran, 'home with us where he belongs.' 'We are private people, so all of this being public has been very difficult,' she wrote on Facebook last week. Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley told USA Today that Fosler, the man who was killed, was arrested earlier this summer for internet stalking of a child and sexual assault, but was out on bond. He added that his agency was investigating what led to the Oct. 8 incident.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/arkansas-dad-accused-fatally-shooting-man/	2024-10-14T11:50:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1801085827.jpg?w=724
Who is Vem Miller, man arrested outside Trump rally?	(NewsNation) — Over the weekend, authorities in Riverside County, California, stopped an armed man outside a rally for former President Donald Trump. Vem Miller, 49, was taken into custody by local sheriff's deputies after multiple IDs and weapons were allegedly found in his vehicle outside the rally in Coachella Valley. Authorities described the incident as having stopped a third assassination attempt against Trump. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case In July, Trump was grazed on the ear after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German. (Credit: Family) Around 300 summons were sent to prospective Allen County jurors. Eventually, 12 jurors and four alternates will be selected. The three-day process of culling the jury pool began in Allen County on Monday. During the proceedings, six jurors were seated. Six additional potential jurors were excluded, including one individual who claimed to have psychic abilities. Six jury seats remain open, as do positions for four alternates. The jury will be sequestered for up to a month as it decides Allen’s fate. During Monday's proceedings, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland told prospective jurors that Allen is the 'Bridge Guy' who killed the girls and whose image was widely seen in a grainy still taken from Libby German's phone. Richard Allen Mugshot - Oct. 13, 2024 The prosecution said an unspent round found next to the bodies matches a gun owned by Allen. The state also said Allen has confessed dozens of times. Defense attorney Bradley Rozzi said Allen made those confessions under duress. He also suggested infighting between federal and local law enforcement left some evidence unanalyzed. The prosecution seemed to indicate it may not have conclusive DNA or phone data or weapon evidence. The defense appeared to lay the groundwork to keep Allen off the witness stand.

Georgia sheriff calls deputies after Burger King got order wrong	(NewsNation) — A Georgia sheriff up for reelection in his county was seen on body camera videos asking his deputies for help after Burger King got his order wrong. The footage from March 4, 2023, was obtained by WSB-TV last week and was also posted on Facebook by the sheriff's opponent in the upcoming election, David Cavender. It shows deputies responding to a Burger King in Mableton and approaching Cobb County Sheriff Craig Owens Sr., who is in his truck. 'Hey, do me a favor,' Owens told one deputy in the video. 'I need to get, all I need is the owner name of whoever owns this damn facility or the manager.' Referring to a passenger in the vehicle, Owens says, 'I wanted her a Whopper, no mayo, cut in half, right?' He then says he doesn't need his money back, but to 'find out who owns this place so I can do an official complaint.' Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment Employees locked themselves inside the restaurant but opened the doors for the three deputies. A deputy told the assistant manager that 'nobody is in trouble. We just want to get some names' and that there wouldn't be a report written. After getting the name of the manager and the company that owns that Burger King location, the deputy brought this information to Owens. Mike Dondelinger, who is running for chief deputy with Cavender, called Owens' actions an 'abuse of power' as well as a waste of resources. 'I’m shocked the sheriff feels so flippant about this issue that he would have deputies run lights and sirens, placing citizens at risk and his deputies at risk, just so he could get information from a business owner that clearly could have been followed up on another day,' Dondelinger said. Medicare open enrollment begins Tuesday However, Owens characterized what happened in the video as a 'business dispute call.' 'The type of call referenced in the video is a business dispute call. This is a call that ANY citizen can make, and law enforcement will respond,' Owens said Friday in a statement posted to Facebook. Owens said he was not in uniform during the incident and went through the drive-thru as a regular patron. 'At no point did I indicate my position, nor did I ask the responders to do anything that they would not, had not, or have not done for anyone else who makes a business dispute call,' Owens said. While Owens said the call is 'being politicized' by Cavender to win votes, he apologized. 'Whether as a Command Sergeant Major, or a major in the Cobb Police Department, or as sheriff, I have always worked to build confidence and trust in leadership,' Owens said in the statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/georgia-sheriff-deputies-wrong-order-burger-king/	2024-10-14T07:56:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/police-lights-e1707156650724.jpg?w=800
Florida aims to fix hurricane-caused power outages by Tuesday	(NewsNation) — Nearly a week after Hurricane Milton left a trail of destruction in Florida, power should be restored to all residents by Tuesday night, according to state and utility company officials. President Joe Biden visited the hard-hit areas of Saint Petersburg and Saint Pete Beach on Sunday, where he announced $600 million of aid after Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Residents face an uphill battle as they rebuild from the back-to-back storms that devastated Florida communities. Aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Biden is on the way as many locals struggle with debris, power outages and fuel shortages. What $35 trillion in US national debt means for Americans Restoring electricty after Helene, Milton Power restoration efforts are progressing, but more than 400,000 Floridians remained in the dark as of 9 a.m. ET Monday, according to poweroutage.us. Electricity has been restored to 3.25 million customers by crews working around the clock with help from out-of-state teams, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Duke Energy and Florida Power &amp; Light both said they expect to have power restored to nearly all customers in all impacted areas by Tuesday night, except for those in areas heavily damaged by flooding, tornadoes or storm surge. Biden also announced $612 million in funding to strengthen the power grid, with $94 million earmarked for Florida. Both state and federal leaders are pushing to restore full power as quickly as possible. Fetterman unworried by tight Pennsylvania race Gasoline shortages Fuel shortages remain a critical challenge as long lines persist at the few operating gas stations in the hardest-hit areas. About a quarter of all of the nearly 7,900 gas stations in the state of Florida didn't have gas or power Thursday. Damage to a pair of major fuel ports in the area created the largest barriers to fuel. Port Tampa Bay's fuel terminals lost power after Hurricane Milton, which prevented fuel distribution to the community. Power had been restored to all seven private fuel terminals as of Friday. The state has also set up free fuel distribution sites in Bradenton, St. Petersburg and Plant City, offering up to 10 gallons per vehicle. For many, those free fuel stations have been a lifeline, helping families stay connected and mobile during the crisis. DeSantis said more sites will open soon and additional fuel is on the way via the Tampa shipping port. Debris cleanup Debris removal could take up to a year, despite the nearly 3,000 workers assisting with cleanup, DeSantis said. Biden has approved 100% federal reimbursement for those efforts for 90 days. 'The (removal of) debris has to be 24/7 over this 90-day period,' DeSantis said while speaking next to a pile of furniture, lumber and other debris in Treasure Island, an island city near St. Petersburg that has been battered by both recent hurricanes. 'That’s the way you get the job done.'

Hurricane Helene victims vow to rebuild and return	(NewsNation) — One couple lost the Asheville, N.C. business they spent ten years building. Another became instantly homeless when part of their apartment complex along the Swannanoa River was swept away. All four are alive and thinking about rebuilding their lives – and processing what happened. 'It was terrifying,' Jacqueline Twohig told 'NewsNation Prime' about the flooding river that destroyed two buildings of the riverfront apartment complex in which they lived. 'At first we thought it was going to be just a little flooding in the apartment,' she said. That notion quickly changed when she and her husband, Doug Frieders, saw the water covering the 20-foot stilts on which the complex’s buildings sit. New tropical disturbance pops up in the Atlantic, NHC monitoring 'We got out as fast as we could,' which means scaling a cement barrier on the complex and then walking through ankle-deep water to their car. Todd and Megan Walsh didn’t have to run for their lives, but they quickly realized how different their lives would be when they returned to Asheville to find their business, Atomic Furnishing and Design, destroyed. 'This is our dream business,' said Todd Walsh. 'We started from nothing, and we built it to this point, and it's kind of unreal that it's gone. It's hard to look at the pictures of what it was like before, and now seeing what it's like.' 'The day we saw the river over top of our store, we knew immediately it was gone,' said Megan Walsh. 'We immediately started thinking, okay, we need to secure a new space,' for not just their business but the dozens of vendors who occupied the space, she said. Still recovering from Helene, SC county rattled by cluster of 8 earthquakes 'Most of our vendors are week-to-week, month-to-month. We care about them greatly. Their kids come into our stores. They play with our children. And so our main priority and focus right now is to find a new, secure, new place and get back to business as soon as possible,' she added. Meanwhile, Twohig and Frieders are not only dealing with the loss of their home but the fact that two of their neighbors were killed when two of the apartment complex’s six buildings were washed away. 'The survival guilt is immense,' she said. 'It just feels awful. We knew them. We saw them every single day. Had we known that this was going to be the case, that the apartment was going to fully collapse, we would have gone banging on doors.' FEMA makes ‘operational adjustments’ following safety concerns in North Carolina Jacqueline Twohig and Doug Frieders have set up a GoFundMe page and so have the Walshs to help their neighbors, vendors and friends to rebuild and return.

What we know about arrest outside Trump’s California rally	(NewsNation) — The Las Vegas man arrested Saturday for possessing multiple guns and fake press passes outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump never made it inside while Trump was there, an official said Sunday. The man was released on a $5,000 bail on Sunday, less than a day after his arrest. Federal agencies said the Republican nominee 'was not in any danger' at the event and the incident is under investigation. In a Sunday press conference, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a noted supporter of Trump, addressed the media and discussed safety measures taken at the event in Coachella, California. Man arrested outside of Trump's SoCal rally on gun charges Man arrested outside Trump rally Authorities stopped 49-year Vem Miller at a checkpoint outside the Coachella, California, rally just one minute before it was scheduled to start on Saturday. Trump was not yet at the venue. Bianco said Miller presented fake VIP and press presses at the sheriff's office's inner checkpoint, leading to a further search of his vehicle. That vehicle was unregistered and had a homemade license plate that Bianco said could connect him to the anti-government 'Sovereign Citizen' extremist movement. Inside Miller's black SUV was a shotgun, a loaded handgun and a high-capacity magazine along with his fake entry passes. Miller had already successfully passed through an outer checkpoint and gave officials 'all indications that he belonged there,' Bianco clarified. The outer perimeter was not manned by Riverside deputies. Trump says national abortion ban is ‘off the table,’ but ‘we’ll see what happens’ Riverside County Sheriff’s Office personnel took Miller into custody and transferred him to the John J. Benoit Detention Center, where he was released on Sunday on $5,000 bail. Miller is a registered Republican in Nevada, a fact which Bianco said he 'couldn't care less' about. 'It’s fringe one way or the other, I couldn’t care less,' Bianco said. 'It's people trying to do harm, and thank God we prevented it.' Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Calhoun Ranch in Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024.Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures while walking onstage for a campaign rally on October 12, 2024 in Coachella, California. Sheriff: Deputies 'probably' prevented assassination attempt Previous reporting cited Bianco as saying the incident was 'probably' a third assassination attempt on the former president, a statement he echoed after some back-and-forth during Sunday's press conference. 'I will be honest with you, I don’t remember saying that, but it certainly would be something that I did say,' he told a reporter, instead focusing on the prevention of any potential bloodshed. 'I certainly wouldn’t want to be saying, after the fact, that I wish we would have done something to prevent that shooting. And there is absolutely no way that any of us are going to truly know what was in [Miller's] head,' Bianco said, adding that 'it’s all going to be speculation.' Few Americans believe Donald Trump will concede election: Poll Minutes later, Bianco changed his tune again, saying: 'If you are asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that stopped the third assassination attempt.' He clarified that the FBI and United States Secret Service would have to lead the investigation classifying Saturday's arrest as an assassination attempt. Neither organization has done so. 'From my perspective … the firearms charges is what we arrested him for and booked him on. Anything further will come from the federal government and, quite frankly, I don’t know if we will be a part of that,' Bianco said. 'Trump was not in any danger': Federal officials The U.S. Attorney's Office released the following statement just minutes after the press conference concluded: 'The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI are aware of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office’s arrest on Saturday. The U.S. Secret Service assesses that the incident did not impact protective operations and former President Trump was not in any danger. While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI extend their gratitude to the deputies and local partners who helped ensure the safety of last night’s events.' Attempts on Trump's life The arrest comes as multiple high-profile attempts of violence against the former president have taken place during the heated election cycle. On July 13, Trump was grazed in the ear by a bullet coming from the gun of 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. Crooks was shot and killed by a member of the Secret Service. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, is currently being prosecuted on gun charges after he hid out near a Florida golf course in an alleged attempt to have a clean shot at the former president and current Republican presidential nominee on Sept. 15.

What $35 trillion in US national debt means for Americans	(NewsNation) — The United States currently carries nearly $35.7 trillion in federal debt, which is only expected to grow regardless of whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris is elected next month, political analysts believe. A recent analysis completed by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the national debt could grow by $3.5 trillion over the next 10 years under Harris. The Democrat has vowed at campaign rallies that her economic plan, which focuses on the middle class, would be fully offset by her plan to raise the corporate tax rate and her plans for taxing the wealthy, the Associated Press reported. The same analysis found that the national debt could add another $7.5 trillion onto the national debt should Trump be elected – a number that could grow to $15.2 trillion under some scenarios, the AP reported. Trump says national abortion ban is ‘off the table,’ but ‘we’ll see what happens’ What is the US national debt? In basic terms, the national debt is the amount of money that the country has borrowed to cover the outstanding balance of its expenses over time. According to the U.S. Treasury, in each fiscal year when the country's revenue does not cover its spending, a budget deficit is created. The federal government borrows money to cover the deficit by selling securities such as Treasury bonds, bills, notes and other securities. The national debt is the ongoing accumulation of this spending plus the interest that is owed to investors who purchased the securities, the government says. How the US national debt breaks down According to an analysis completed by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the $35 trillion of debt owed by the United States equals the value of the economies of countries such as China, Germany, Japan, India and the United Kingdom. It also amounts to $266,000 being owed by each American household or $104,000 worth of debt for every person living in the United States. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits The organization found that even if each U.S. household contributed $1,000 per month to pay off the debt, it would take 22 years to pay off. It also estimates that the $35 trillion would cover four years of college education for every graduating American high school senior for the next 103 years. The federal debt tally has grown year-over-year, including from 2023, when, according to figures, the U.S. government spent $6.1 trillion while taking in only $4.4 trillion from sources such as corporate tax, payroll tax and individual income tax. This resulted in a deficit of $1.7 trillion. Meanwhile, the government continued to pump money into expenditures such as Medicaid and Obamacare ($707 million), Medicare ($832 million) as well as other mandatory spending programs on which federal officials doled out $893 million. Social security topped the spending at $1.32 trillion, according to federal figures. Meanwhile, interest payments on the national debt were expected to reach $892 billion in 2024, according to reporting by Econofact, which is more than the U.S. was projected to spend on defense. It is almost one-third higher than the interest payments totaled in 2023, which is a combination of higher interest rates and a jump in the amount of debt the country is carrying, the report indicated. Groceries more affordable than in 2019, but consumers not feeling it Although interest rates are expected to drop in the coming years as inflation falls off, the Congressional Budget Office expects that the amount the country is paying in interest as a percent of the Gross Domestic Product will just continue to grow, the Econofact report indicated. In 2023, the Congressional Office found that the debt held by the public amounted to $26.2 trillion, which represents 97% of the GDP, according to the Peterson Foundation. Where does the national debt go from here? The Associated Press reported that as of this month, the federal debt held by the public has risen to more than $28 trillion – which is expected to only get higher as the U.S. cannot generate enough revenue to keep up with its spending. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the country’s debt load will only get bigger regardless of who wins the White House in next month’s election. Mortgage calculator: Calculate your monthly payment Other forecasts show that Trump’s pledge to have other countries pay tariffs would not generate nearly enough revenue to cover spending. One analysis showed that Trump tariffs could generate $2.7 trillion, but that at the same time, tax cuts would cost the country an estimated $9.2 trillion with an additional $350 million being spent on securing the border and a promised mass deportation of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. One analysis projects that if elected, Harris would introduce $4.6 trillion in tax cuts but that an estimated $4 trillion that could be generated through a higher corporate tax rate would not cover the spending. 'Debt would continue to grow faster than the economy under either candidate’s plans and in most scenarios would grow faster and higher than under current law,' the report by the Committee for A Responsible Federal Budget concluded.

US will send a missile defense system and troops to run it to Isr...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it, the Pentagon said Sunday, even as Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. He said the system will help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran’s ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October. The delivery of the sophisticated missile defense system risks further inflaming the conflict in the Middle East despite widespread diplomatic efforts to avoid an all-out war. The Iranian warning came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who noted the earlier reports that the U.S. was considering the deployment. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. Late last month, Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Florida on Sunday, Biden said he agreed to deploy the THAAD battery 'to defend Israel.' Biden spoke at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa after making a quick visit to to see the damage caused by Hurricane Milton and meet with first responders, residents and local leaders. Ryder, in his statement, said the deployment 'underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran.' It was not immediately clear where the THAAD battery was coming from or when it will arrive. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli army spokesman, declined to provide any timeline for its arrival, but thanked the U.S. for its support. The U.S. deployed one of the batteries to the Middle East along with additional Patriot battalions to bolster protections for U.S. forces in the region late last year after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants. Ryder also said that the U.S. sent a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training. It also is not unusual for the U.S. to have a limited number of troops in Israel, which the U.S. considers a key regional ally. There generally has been a small number of forces there consistently as well as routine rotational deployments for training and exercises. The THAAD will add another layer to Israel's already significant air defenses, which include separate systems designed to intercept long-range, medium-range and short-range threats. Israel recently retired its U.S.-made Patriot systems after decades of use. According to an April report by the Congressional Research Service, the Army has seven THAAD batteries. Generally each consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, radio and radar equipment and requires 95 soldiers to operate. The THAAD is considered a complementary system to the Patriot, but it can defend a wider area. It can hit targets at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles), and is used to destroy short-range, medium-range and limited intermediate-range ballistic missile threats that are either inside or outside the atmosphere. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing the system, but it is operated by the Army. An eighth system has been funded and ordered and is expected to be in the field sometime next year. ____ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Aamer Madhani in Tampa, Florida, and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-us-will-send-an-air-defense-battery-and-american-troops-to-israel-to-bolster-defenses-against-iran/	2024-10-13T13:43:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670c31b4af48b5.15954439.jpeg?w=900

A man was arrested outside of a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump in Southern California, and multiple guns were illegally in his possession, according to authorities. The arrest took place at a checkpoint at the intersection of Avenue 52 and Celebration Drive in Coachella at 4:59 p.m. on Saturday, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said. The rally was scheduled to start at 5 p.m. The driver of a black SUV, who was later identified as 49-year-old Vem Miller of Las Vegas, was found to be in illegal possession of a shotgun, a loaded handgun, and a high-capacity magazine. Miller was then taken into custody and booked at the John J. Benoit Detention Center on suspicion of possession of a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine. According to the Riverside County Inmate Information System, Miller was released from the detention center Sunday on $5,000 bail. The Sheriff's Office said the incident had no impact on the safety of rally attendees or former President Trump. No additional details were immediately made available.

Drone strike in Israel wounds more than 60 as Hezbollah claims re...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A drone strike hit central Israel on Sunday, wounding more than 60 people, some of them critically, rescue services said, in one of the bloodiest attacks in Israel in a year of war. The Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group claimed responsibility, saying it targeted a military camp. Hezbollah said the strike was retaliation for two Israeli strikes in Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. With Israel’s advanced air-defense systems, it's rare for so many people to be hurt by drones or missiles. Israeli media reported that two drones were launched from Lebanon, and the military said one was intercepted. It was not immediately clear whether military members were hurt or what was hit in the city of Binyamina. There were no details from Israel's military, which earlier reported that at least 115 rockets were fired from Lebanon. It was the second time in two days that a drone has struck in Israel. On Saturday, during the Israeli holiday of Yom Kippur, one hit a suburb of Tel Aviv, causing damage but no injuries. The latest strike came on the same day that the United States announced it would send a new air-defense system to Israel to help bolster its protection against missiles, along with the troops needed to operate it. An Israeli army spokesperson declined to provide a timeline. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — both Iran-backed militant groups — and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. Iran has said it will respond to any Israeli attack. Netanyahu calls UN peacekeepers ‘human shield’ for Hezbollah The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon known as UNIFIL said Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one of its positions early Sunday and destroyed the main gate, and later fired smoke rounds near peacekeepers in that location, causing skin irritation. UNIFIL said the incident was a 'further flagrant violation of international law.' International criticism is growing after Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on U.N. peacekeepers since the start of the ground operation in Lebanon. Five peacekeepers have been wounded in attacks that struck their positions in recent days, with most blamed on Israeli forces. The military says Hezbollah operates in the vicinity of the peacekeepers, without providing evidence. Israel’s military said a tank trying to evacuate wounded soldiers backed into a U.N. post while under fire. It said a smoke screen was used to provide cover. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani asserted that Israel has tried to maintain constant contact with UNIFIL and that any instance of U.N. forces being harmed will be investigated at 'the highest level.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called for UNIFIL to heed Israel’s warnings to evacuate, accusing them of 'providing a human shield' to Hezbollah. 'We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers, and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,' he said in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. Israel has long accused the United Nations of being biased against it, and relations have plunged further since the start of the war in Gaza. Israel has accused the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees of being infiltrated by Hamas, allegations the agency denies. Israeli strike in Lebanon destroys Ottoman-era market Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation earlier this month. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since September, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Israeli airstrikes overnight destroyed an Ottoman-era market in Lebanon’s southern city of Nabatiyeh, killing at least one person and wounding four more. Lebanon’s Civil Defense said it battled fires in 12 residential buildings and 40 shops in the market, which dates back to 1910. 'Our livelihoods have all been leveled,' said Ahmad Fakih, whose shop was destroyed. Rescuers searched pancaked buildings as Israeli drones buzzed overhead. The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets, without elaborating, and said it continued to target the militants on Sunday. Separately, the Lebanese Red Cross said paramedics were searching for casualties in a house destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon on Sunday, when a second strike left four paramedics with concussions and damaged two ambulances. The Red Cross said the operation had been coordinated with U.N. peacekeepers, who informed the Israeli side. Bodies rot in the streets in northern Gaza A year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza almost daily. A strike hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp late Saturday, killing parents and six children ages 8 to 23, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies there. 'They were safe, while he was sleeping, and he and all his children died,' said the man’s brother, Mohammad Abu Ghali. Women stroked the body bags, in tears. Israel’s military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the war's opening weeks. Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The United Nations says no food has entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1. The military confirmed that hospitals were included in evacuation orders but said it had not set a timetable and was working with local authorities to facilitate patient transfers. Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service, said the bodies of a 'large number of martyrs' remain uncollected from the streets and under rubble. 'We are unable to reach them,' he said, asserting that dogs are eating some remains. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked a year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, a third believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and its ground invasion of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. The ministry doesn't distinguish between militants or civilians, but says women and children make up over half the deaths. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

SpaceX Starship pulls off historic launch with booster intact	(NewsNation) — SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket into orbit for its latest test flight on Sunday morning, but did so with a historic twist. The rocket, which stands almost 400 feet tall, launched and then successfully caught its returning booster at the launch pad with mechanical arms that are called 'chopsticks' which caught the booster in mid-arm to keep from damaging it. The feat, which is considered an engineering marvel by many aerospace experts, was lauded by SpaceX founder Elon Musk on social media. Former astronaut Jose Hernandez told NewsNation that the main booster provides the thrust of the power to the rocket. 'You go from zero to 17,500 mph in about 8 ½ minutes,' Hernandez said. 'It’s the best ride Disney can ever hope for.' Rare comet visible in the night sky won’t return for 80,000 years SpaceX's Starship is the largest rocket ever built and weighs more than 10 million pounds. The spacecraft, which is produced by Musk's SpaceX company, is sustainable and will be completely reusable, Hernandez said. The reusable aspect of the rocket will significantly reduce the price of future missions, the former astronaut said. SpaceX is hoping to use Starship to eventually transport humans to the Moon and Mars. In addition to the historic nature of the booster being caught by the mechanical arms, Hernandez said other aspects of Sunday’s test flight are important. 'You’re going to be landing the whole rocket in two separate pieces,' Hernandez told NewsNation. 'The upper stage is going to land softly in the Indian Ocean and the primary booster is going to come back and land in a launch pad that has this chopstick, scissor-like contraption that sort of hugs it as it comes down and safely lands it so it can be re-used.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/spacex-starship-pulls-off-historic-launch/	2024-10-13T09:20:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2081837995_b0e774.jpg?w=900
Walz defends using the term 'socialism': 'It's what the right use...	Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) on Sunday defended his use of the word 'socialism' over the summer, saying he believes 'capitalism works' but that there are things society must do collectively. In an interview on 'Fox News Sunday,' host Shannon Bream asked Walz about his use of the word 'socialism' during a 'White Dudes for Harris' livestream in July. 'One person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness,' Walz said in the July livestream. Bream began by citing the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of socialism, which defines it as 'a system of society or group living in which there is no private property,' adding that 'means of production are owned and controlled by the state.' 'Did you mean to advocate for that here in the U.S.?' Bream asked Walz. Walz responded with an enthusiastic no, adding that he is a capitalist. 'Republicans oftentimes talk about socialism, and what I would make the case of is we build our roads collectively together,' he said. 'I don't think anybody's arguing that you should have to build your own road from your house to your business place or whatever. So I said this definition that the right uses about these things that we collectively do together.' He added, 'I believe in moral capitalism. I believe capitalism works and lifts everyone up, but I also believe you have to make sure there's things we collectively do together.' That includes public education and public health, Walz said. When pushed by Bream as to whether the use of the word was a 'knucklehead thing,' Walz continued to defend using the term, saying it is 'what the right uses.' 'Look, the point being is, is Donald Trump says that this is a socialist or Marxist government,' he added.

Few Americans believe Donald Trump will concede election: Poll	(NewsNation) — While much of the country remains uncertain about who will emerge victorious in the race for the White House, more American voters are confident in who will concede the election should they lose, a new Pew Research poll shows. Research shows that just 24% of those polled believe that former President Donald Trump will concede next month’s election should he lose to Vice President Kamala Harris. Of those 24% who responded, only 4% of Harris’ supporters expect Trump to acknowledge the vice president as the winner should she win the White House. Trump doubles down on insults and mockery in attacks on Harris Among Trump supporters, 46% of those polled believe that Trump will concede the election. Meanwhile, 72% of the more than 5,100 Americans surveyed believe that Harris will acknowledge that she lost the election if Trump claims enough electoral votes to earn a second term in the White House. The research showed that 95% of Harris supporters believe that the Democrat will acknowledge a Trump victory while about half (48%) of Trump backers said they would expect Harris to concede. Trump has continued to tell supporters at campaign rallies that he believes the 2020 election in which he was defeated by President Joe Biden was stolen from him. The Republican has continued the claims of a rigged election despite no evidence that anything improper happened in Biden winning the White House. In the recent Pew Research poll, only 32% of Trump supporters say that should the former president lose to Harris it is very important to them that he acknowledge Harris as the legitimate president. Comparatively, 61% of those planning to vote for Harris say it is very important for the vice president to declare Trump the winner. The polling takes place as Trump and Harris are locked into a tightly contested battle. National polling shows Harris with a slight lead over the former president, but all of the polls fall within the margin of error. Polling remains especially tight in swing states that likely will determine who wins the election. The Pew Research poll shows that with less than a month remaining before election day, about 86% of those who were surveyed believe it is clear who will win. Polling done since September shows that 48% of those surveyed by Pew favor Harris or are leaning toward supporting her while 47% support Trump or are leaning toward voting for the former president. Another 5% of those surveyed say that they are leaning toward supporting a third-party candidate in the upcoming election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/few-americans-believe-donald-trump-will-concede-election-poll/	2024-10-13T07:13:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e3590b998697.70230121.jpeg?w=900
Musk's Starlink Internet free for hurricane victims through 2024	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk's internet company Starlink will offer victims of hurricanes Helene and Milton free service through the end of the year, an extension of an initial offer that received internet backlash. 'For those impacted by Hurricanes Helene or Milton, Starlink service is now free through the end of the year to help with response and recovery efforts,' the company said in a post on X, which Musk also owns. Starlink is described as 'internet from space for humans on Earth.' SpaceX, also owned by Musk, engineers it. The company initially offered Hurricane Helene victims a free month of service, but some would-be customers noticed a price tag that came with it. Even with a $0 monthly fee, the satellite dish would cost a few hundred dollars plus shipping and taxes. One woman posted to X that her total cost would be $344.52 as a 'Helene relief' customer. After 30 days, the subscription would require a monthly payment. Can someone (@elonmusk) explain why @Starlink is being offered for 'free' as an emergency srvc but when they sign up for the Hurricane Relief service ppl are being charged $345 for hardware that arrives in 1-2 weeks?! Are the trucks not the hardware for the emergency?!?! #HELENE pic.twitter.com/2ePbcTLwXb&mdash; Mary Williams (@mary_scw) October 3, 2024 Starlink offers a free 30-day trial to regular customers regardless of hurricane status. A monthly subscription for residential customers costs $120 a month for unlimited data. Following backlash, the company issued a new offer weeks later that extended the free service through the end of the year for victims of both hurricanes Helene and Milton. The free subscription applies to residential households, both new and existing customers, and provides unlimited data, according to Starlink's website. Users must enter their address on their website to see if they qualify for the offer. 'Starlink is providing free service in your area for those impacted by Hurricanes Helene or Milton. Select the ''Hurricane Relief' option below for this subscription,' the website says after inputting information. 'These will be moved to a paid, residential subscription after the end of the year.' Elon Musk unveils Tesla’s ‘Cybercab’ as stock sinks Like the initial offer, this 'free' internet service comes with a $349 charge for the hardware. Delivery will take about three weeks, according to the website. Current customers who were impacted by the hurricanes must create a support ticket requesting a relief credit. SpaceX said it has delivered more than 10,000 Starlink kits to Helene victims, as of Oct. 8. The company also said it teamed up with T-Mobile to provide 'direct to cell' satellites to provide emergency alerts for all phones and carriers in affected areas. The service works best outdoors, the company said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/musks-starlink-internet-free-for-hurricane-victims-through-2024/	2024-10-13T04:32:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2162679051.jpg?w=900
Biden to tour Milton damage in Florida, 974K still without power	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will tour the damage from Hurricane Milton in Florida on Sunday, four days after the storm, as just under 1 million homes and businesses remain without power. In his first visit to the Sunshine State since Milton’s landfall Wednesday evening, Biden will arrive in Tampa and depart on an aerial tour of the surrounding areas. Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Florida Saturday, the second in as many weeks. The state is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm, which hit late September. A disaster declaration allows states to use federal funds, and people in affected areas can apply for assistance through FEMA. The president is expected to meet with federal, state, and local officials in St. Pete Beach, Florida, about nine miles west of St. Petersburg where his aerial tour will end. Florida deputies help pregnant woman in labor during Milton Post-Milton cleanup efforts ongoing Day four post-Milton looks similar to the previous days: cleanup, recovery, and power restoration. Category 3 storm winds tore panels off the roof of Tropicana Field, home of MLB's Tampa Bay Rays, and a construction crane crashed into the Tampa Bay Times building. Cleanup is an ongoing effort in St. Pete Beach and statewide. The St. Pete Beach Fire Department had to erect a makeshift fire station location at a hotel because one of their stations was hit by Helene two weeks prior. 'I don’t think you ever get used to being hit by hurricanes,' Deputy Fire Chief Adam Poirrier told NewsNation’s Mills Hayes. 'Certainly two (hurricanes) within two and a half weeks was out of the norm … I don’t think we believed that was going to happen because it’s never happened in the past. Sadly, we’re getting pretty good at this now.' The number of power outages has decreased significantly from the initial 3.3 million after the storm. Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news conference Saturday afternoon that crews from as far as Canada are working to restore power to the remaining 974,000 homes and businesses without it. Couple who moved to Florida heartbroken after Milton ruins their ‘happily ever after’ Fuel shortages across Florida Many gas stations still don’t have power, causing a statewide fuel shortage. Twenty-eight percent of gas stations in the state do not have fuel, according to GasBuddy’s Fuel Tracker. Hundreds of cars formed an hours-long line outside one gas station in Bradenton, Florida, Saturday morning. Gov. Ron DeSantis said three fuel depots opened Saturday. More will open Sunday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET in Port Charlotte, Pinellas County, Hillsborough County, and Sarasota County. The state’s majority of remaining power outages are in those counties. Milton barreled through the central-western part of the state upon landfall, first hitting Sarasota County.

At least a dozen tornadoes tore through St. Lucie County, Florida, in just two hours, according to St. Lucie County’s communications director Erick Gill. Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges, and flooding. Ft. Myers is under a foot of floodwater days later. 'You can hide from the wind, but you've got to run from the water,' said Ft. Myers Mayor Kevin B. Anderson on NewsNation Saturday morning. The National Weather Service reported almost 19 inches of rainfall in the St. Petersburg area. A storm surge of 8 to 10 feet was reported in Sarasota County. Milton rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm as it moved inland. Polk County officials shared a harrowing tale of life in a deadly storm. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said some of the office’s deputies helped transport a pregnant woman to the hospital early Thursday morning as she was going into labor, successfully getting her to the hospital to deliver her daughter, Jade. In Venice Beach, a home was entirely buried in sand, with the pile high enough to push furniture halfway up a doorway nearly hitting the ceiling. The City of Venice said the area remains highly dangerous due to deep holes, trip hazards, exposed utilities, and sharp debris. Asheville BBQ restaurant owners trying to recover from Helene What we know about Florida's recovery All highways are open, and all commercial airports are open except for the Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, Gov. DeSantis said Saturday afternoon. The airport aims to reopen on Wednesday, Oct. 16. Other updates include: 1,000 people were rescued from floodwaters 12,000 miles of roadway have been cleared. 2,400 bridges have been inspected. 90% of traffic signals are back in operation. 43 of the 54 school districts will reopen Monday Determination to rebuild follows Florida’s hurricanes with acceptance that storms will come again Disaster assistance The IRS announced tax relief for Milton victims. People and businesses in affected parts of Florida have until May 1, 2025, to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments. People in affected counties can also apply for financial assistance through FEMA.

Israeli strike on Gaza kills a family of 8	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip has killed a family of eight, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday, as Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants and pushed for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the territory's north. Israel is also waging an air and ground campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. The strike in Gaza late Saturday hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing parents and their six children, who ranged in age from 8 to 23, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. It said another seven people were wounded, including two women and a child in critical condition. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies and filmed funeral prayers held at the hospital. More than a year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza nearly every day. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck schools being used as shelters by displaced people, accusing militants of hiding among them. Israel presses for full evacuation of northern Gaza In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other hard-hit areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the opening weeks of the war. The Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The military confirmed Saturday that hospitals were included in the evacuation orders but said it had not set a specific timetable. It said a medical convoy scheduled to transfer patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days was canceled for security reasons — without elaborating — but that the convoy had delivered fuel to the hospital on Saturday. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasions of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. Palestinian medical officials do not say whether those killed by Israeli forces are militants or civilians, but say women and children make up over half the fatalities. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israel expected to strike Iran as fighting rages in Lebanon Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with a wave of Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon earlier this month. At least 2,255 people have been killed in Lebanon since the start of the conflict, including more than 1,400 people since September, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which also does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in the rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who died in an explosion in Iran's capital in July that was widely blamed on Israel. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/ap-israeli-strike-on-gaza-kills-a-family-of-8/	2024-10-13T00:23:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670b764cf03683.49775739.jpeg?w=900
1 dead, at least 9 injured after shooting reported near TSU durin...	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) -- Nashville police officers and first responders were called to a Saturday evening shooting near Tennessee State University (TSU) that killed one person and injured at least nine others. According to the Metro Nashville Police Department (MNPD), gunfire erupted between two groups at approximately 5:10 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 12 near the intersection of Jefferson Street and 27th Avenue North. A TSU spokesperson sent the following statement to News 2 around 5:45 p.m.: Nashville Metro Police are investigating a shooting at 27th and Jefferson near the House of Legends and Jefferson Street Baptist Missionary Baptist Church. Police say the suspect remains at large and everyone should use caution if traveling in the area. Just after 6:30 p.m., authorities confirmed the scene had been secured. 'At this point, there are 10 victims that have been confirmed to have been involved in that gunfire, one of which is deceased. Five of them were transported from the Nashville Fire Department to local hospitals. Five others were dropped off by private vehicles, and at least some of those that were injured at area hospitals are also suspected to have been involved in the gunfire,' MNPD Public Information Officer Brooke Reese said during a briefing shortly before 7:15 p.m. MNPD later posted on social media platform X that a 24-year-old man had died and three non-critical juvenile victims were at Vanderbilt Pediatrics. According to Kendra Loney with the Nashville Fire Department (NFD), crews were already staged throughout the area because they were participating in the TSU homecoming parade and engaging with the community amid the homecoming festivities. When the gunfire broke out, Loney said some NFD personnel thought it was fireworks, but when they realized what was happening, they jumped into action, with some even using their belts as tourniquets because they didn't have their medical bags with them. 'While we don't wish any ill on anyone, we are upset, we are angry about that disruption, we are angry that there were persons whose days were disrupted, that the innocence in this event was taken away, and that lives were endangered,' Loney said. Loney reported that one NFD employee was transported for an unrelated medical emergency, in addition to the five people injured in the shooting that NFD brought to the hospital. 'Of course, everybody knows homecoming celebration for Tennessee State University is a huge event,' MNPD Cmdr. Anthony McClain said. 'I graduated from Tennessee State University, so my family and I was enjoying this occasion today. It's unfortunate that a few folks pretty much ruined it for everybody, okay? So we have to come to the point where we stop this violence. Fortunately for us, we had quite a few officers working the area. I think they were able to mitigate the carnage, so to speak. We appreciate that effort. We appreciate the efforts of the fire department, as well.' According to McClain, the shooting was not a direct reflection on TSU itself and is believed to be something that was 'kind of a side bar to the celebration.' He said there have been some shootings up and down the Jefferson Street corridor, but it's been pretty uneventful for the past couple years. The commander added that most of the people celebrating TSU's homecoming were down at Nissan Stadium for the football game against Eastern Illinois University, which kicked off at 5 p.m. MNPD Public Information Officer Don Aaron shared additional details in an 8 p.m. press conference. When asked about a shots fired call near Nissan Stadium amid the football game, Aaron said a noise that sounded like a gunshot may have been heard outside the stadium, but there are no reports of anyone being hit or any indication that it's related to the shooting near TSU.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/1-dead-9-injured-after-shooting-reported-near-tsu/	2024-10-12T17:43:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/processed-0D5216ED-D394-4D02-ADE4-B155A2325DF0.jpeg?w=900
Heavy Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza as UN peacekeepers in ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Palestinians in northern Gaza described heavy Israeli bombardment Saturday in the hours after airstrikes killed at least 22 people, as Israel warned people there and in southern Lebanon to get out of the way of offensives against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups. In Lebanon, the U.N. peacekeeping force said its headquarters in Naqoura was hit again, with a peacekeeper struck by gunfire late Friday and in stable condition. It wasn’t clear who fired. It occurred a day after Israel’s military fired on the headquarters for a second straight day. Israel, which has warned peacekeepers to leave their positions, didn’t immediately respond to questions. Hunger warnings emerged again in northern Gaza as residents said they hadn't received aid since the beginning of the month. The U.N. World Food Program said no food aid had entered the north since Oct. 1. An estimated 400,000 people remain there. Israel’s military renewed its offensive in northern Gaza almost a week ago while escalating its air and ground campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid Israel's war with Hezbollah, a top U.N. official, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press he's concerned that Lebanon’s ports and airport might be taken out of service. More than 1 million people have been displaced. Israel’s military said Hezbollah fired more than 300 projectiles over Yom Kippur, the holiest and most solemn day on the Jewish calendar. Hezbollah claimed a series of rocket strikes on Israeli military positions and said fighters engaged an Israeli infantry unit attempting to enter Lebanese territory. Israel's military also said it killed 50 militants in Lebanon. Claims on either side couldn’t be verified. Israeli airstrikes on Saturday hit multiple areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Nine were killed in Maisra village in the northeast. Four were killed in an apartment building on the edge of Barja south of Beirut. Rayak and Tal Chiha hospitals in the Bekaa Valley were damaged. In Nabatieh, eight people were wounded. The total toll in Lebanon over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is now 2,255 killed, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. More than 1,400 people have been killed since mid-September. It isn't clear how many were fighters. 'We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,' the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, said Saturday while touring the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Some Gaza residents are trapped In northern Gaza, residents told the AP many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders. Those who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood. At least 20 bodies were recovered while others likely were under rubble, emergency service officials said. Elsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and wounded a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. An afternoon strike on a home killed at least four people, including a woman, said Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the emergency service. Israel’s military said it killed more than 20 militants in the Jabaliya area over the past day. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force 'and will continue to do so for a long time.' Israel has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Once again, some families moved south on foot, in donkey carts or crowded in vehicles that navigated piles of rubble. Others refused to go. 'It’s like the first days of the war,' said a Jabaliya resident, Ahmed Abu Goneim. 'The occupation is doing everything to uproot us. But we will not leave.' The 24-year-old said Israeli warplanes and drones struck many neighboring houses in the past week. He counted 15 relatives and neighbors, including four women and five children as young as 3, killed in neighboring homes. He said that there were dead in the streets. Hamza Sharif, who stays with his family in a school-turned-shelter in Jabaliya, described 'constant bombings day and night.' He said the shelter hasn't received aid since the beginning of the month and that families 'will run out of supplies very soon.' Food is running out The World Food Program said it was unclear how long the limited food supplies it distributed in northern Gaza earlier will last. The U.N.’s independent investigator on the right to food last month accused Israel of carrying out a 'starvation campaign' against Palestinians, which Israel has denied. Israel's offensive in Gaza started after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, when militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't specify between combatants and civilians. Gaza’s Health Ministry said that hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people killed over the past 24 hours. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo.

Asheville BBQ restaurant owners trying to recover from Helene	(NewsNation) — The owners of a popular Asheville, N.C. brewpub are counting the damage done to their building by Hurricane Helene but they're also counting their blessings. 'Seeing the community come together like it has ... been incredibly heartwarming,' said Bryan King, co-owner of 12 Bones Smokehouse and Brewing. 'There have just been so many folks that have reached out. People doing, just, selfless acts trying to do everything they can to help those around them and those in need. It’s been amazing to watch,' he added.

'I don’t even know. Walking through there … there’s mud in the attic. I think it’s still too early to say,' she said. The Kings have filled out Small Business Administration relief forms, as well as insurance claims. Friends have set up a GoFundMe account to help the restaurants’ staff.

Who is not allowed to vote in the 2024 presidential election?	(NEXSTAR) – The United States is just weeks away from a highly-anticipated presidential election, but not everyone will be able to exercise their right to vote on Nov. 5. Being at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen are general requirements for voting, but individual states have laws that prohibit voting for several reasons. Convicted felons In all jurisdictions except Maine, Vermont, and the nation's capital, people convicted of felony crimes lose the right to vote while incarcerated. In half the states, felony voting restrictions extend after incarceration, often including their time on probation or parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). In some states, convicted felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for certain crimes. In recent years there has been a general trend toward reinstating the right to vote at some point. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters FILE - An election official checks a voter's photo identification at an early voting polling site in Austin, Texas, Feb. 26, 2014. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) Inmates in the following states won't receive automatic restitution upon release, but will have to wait until completion of sentence (which may also include parole, probation, fines, fees and a post-sentencing waiting period or other required action): Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Delaware, Idaho, Florida, Kansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin. See the NCSL website for more details. Unregistered voters Unless you live in North Dakota, you'll need to be registered to vote before the election. Anyone who has lived in North Dakota for 30 days before the election can vote, according to the secretary of state. Voters do, however, have to bring a valid form of ID to the polls. About 20 states allow people to register on Election Day and then immediately cast a ballot. The remaining states require some sort of advance registration, with deadlines ranging from three to 30 days before an election. Many of the states with voter registration deadlines more than two weeks ahead of the election are located in the South. Mass voter challenges are on the rise: Here’s why Those without identification In roughly three-quarters of U.S. states you won't be allowed to vote if you don't have identification. Twenty-one states request photo identification, such as a driver's license or government-issued card, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Fifteen additional states accept non-photo identification, such as a utility bill or bank statement that lists a person's name and address. In some states, there are workarounds for people who forget their identification, such as signing an affidavit of identity or filling out a provisional ballot that will be counted if they come back with their ID or if election workers can verify their signature. How can Amazon Prime ban political ads on Thursday Night Football? States that don't require proof of identity use other means to verify voters, such as signatures or asking for home addresses. People voting absentee or by mail could face additional requirements, such as getting a witness to sign their absentee ballot envelope. Voters with mental disabilities While the rights of voters with disabilities are protected by federal law, several states have laws under which a judge can bar people deemed 'mentally incapacitated' from voting. Other states have laws prohibiting people under legal guardianship from voting. While someone under guardianship may not have the decision-making capacity to take care of one or more of their daily needs, it may not mean that they are unqualified to vote. Despite the Justice Department affirming the voting rights of people with disabilities earlier this year, it doesn't appear that there has been much enforcement from the Biden administration. Trump asks for military aircraft protection amid Iran threat: Reports Citizens of U.S. territories Residents of U.S. territories are not able to vote in the general presidential election unless they have official residency in a state or the District of Columbia.

Who is not allowed to vote in the 2024 presidential election?	(NEXSTAR) – The United States is just weeks away from a highly-anticipated presidential election, but not everyone will be able to exercise their right to vote on Nov. 5. Being at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen are general requirements for voting, but individual states have laws that prohibit voting for several reasons. Convicted felons In all jurisdictions except Maine, Vermont, and the nation's capital, people convicted of felony crimes lose the right to vote while incarcerated. In half the states, felony voting restrictions extend after incarceration, often including their time on probation or parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). In some states, convicted felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for certain crimes. In recent years there has been a general trend toward reinstating the right to vote at some point.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) Inmates in the following states won't receive automatic restitution upon release, but will have to wait until completion of sentence (which may also include parole, probation, fines, fees and a post-sentencing waiting period or other required action): Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Delaware, Idaho, Florida, Kansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin. See the NCSL website for more details. Unregistered voters Unless you live in North Dakota, you'll need to be registered to vote before the election. Anyone who has lived in North Dakota for 30 days before the election can vote, according to the secretary of state. Voters do, however, have to bring a valid form of ID to the polls. About 20 states allow people to register on Election Day and then immediately cast a ballot. The remaining states require some sort of advance registration, with deadlines ranging from three to 30 days before an election. Many of the states with voter registration deadlines more than two weeks ahead of the election are located in the South. Mass voter challenges are on the rise: Here’s why Those without identification In roughly three-quarters of U.S. states you won't be allowed to vote if you don't have identification. Twenty-one states request photo identification, such as a driver's license or government-issued card, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Fifteen additional states accept non-photo identification, such as a utility bill or bank statement that lists a person's name and address. In some states, there are workarounds for people who forget their identification, such as signing an affidavit of identity or filling out a provisional ballot that will be counted if they come back with their ID or if election workers can verify their signature. How can Amazon Prime ban political ads on Thursday Night Football? States that don't require proof of identity use other means to verify voters, such as signatures or asking for home addresses. People voting absentee or by mail could face additional requirements, such as getting a witness to sign their absentee ballot envelope. Voters with mental disabilities While the rights of voters with disabilities are protected by federal law, several states have laws under which a judge can bar people deemed 'mentally incapacitated' from voting. Other states have laws prohibiting people under legal guardianship from voting. While someone under guardianship may not have the decision-making capacity to take care of one or more of their daily needs, it may not mean that they are unqualified to vote. Despite the Justice Department affirming the voting rights of people with disabilities earlier this year, it doesn't appear that there has been much enforcement from the Biden administration.

Key disaster loan program 'quickly exhausting' funds after hurric...	Officials are warning a key federal program that provides disaster loans to businesses and homeowners is running critically low on funds in the aftermath of back-to-back hurricanes, increasing the pressure on Congress to return to Washington. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has roughly $50 million left for new disaster loans, and the agency says it expects funds to be depleted soon, potentially before Congress returns from recess next month, amid heightened demand in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Officials say the program needs about $1.6 billion. 'SBA staff is currently on the ground across the country working to support communities impacted by disasters,' SBA Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman said in a statement this week. But, she added, the agency is 'quickly exhausting current federal funding to make new offers for affordable recovery loans to homeowners, renters, small businesses, and non-profits.' 'Americans should not have to wait for critical assistance when they need it the most.' President Biden has also sounded the alarm on the matter, telling reporters Thursday that Congress 'should be coming back and moving on emergency needs immediately.' 'Congress should move as rapidly as they can, particularly on the most immediate need, which is small business,' he said. The latest call by Biden adds to the growing pressure Congress has faced to return from the campaign trail to approve additional disaster relief in response to the damage wrought by hurricanes Helene and Milton. Congress last month passed a temporary stopgap measure to keep federal funding from lapsing in October and to prevent a government shutdown. The bill did not include additional funding for the SBA, despite repeated requests from the administration. Also notably missing from the same measure was further funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Instead, negotiators said the deal allowed for the agency to use the fund’s fiscal 2025 resources faster for disaster response for the duration of the nearly three-month stopgap, allowing FEMA access to draw from a roughly $20 billion pot starting Oct. 1. While FEMA officials have said in recent days that it has sufficient resources to respond to hurricanes Milton and Helene while Congress is out of session in the short term, they also indicated to reporters that almost half of that money is already gone. The SBA has said it will continue to process disaster loan applications after the funds are expended, but additional funding from Congress will be needed to make further loan offers to borrowers and send out checks. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are pushing for Congress to cut its recess early ahead of its current Nov. 12 return date, as campaigns kick it into their final gear ahead of the critical fall elections. In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) earlier this week, a group of House Democrats said the disaster funding approved by Congress recently fell 'critically short' of what will be needed for the current fiscal year. 'The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must be equipped not only to respond to current disasters but also to adequately prepare for future events,' the letter read. The lawmakers also pressed for the SBA’s disaster relief loan program to 'be replenished as soon as possible to help business owners rebuild their enterprises and communities.' Johnson signaled after Helene that he had little interest in bringing lawmakers back to Washington, saying FEMA has enough funding to cover the period until Congress is back in session. The Hill has reached out to the Speaker’s office for comment. Even some Republicans are pushing the Speaker on the issue. 'Just got off the phone with @POTUS Biden. He is personally overseeing that FEMA does not create problems with the debris removal and is supportive of the 15 Billion in FEMA funds ONLY FOR Hurricane victims,' Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) wrote Thursday on social platform X. 'If Congress goes into a special session we can get it passed immediately. This needs to happen. @SpeakerJohnson call us back,' she said Thursday before adding in a subsequent post that she also talked to Johnson and that he 'is actively also working this issue.' Pressed on the call by Biden for an early return, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-N.Y.) office also said Friday that he is 'awaiting estimates from agencies working diligently on the ground.' Despite previous requests to bolster disaster aid funds, the Biden administration has not yet released a new emergency supplemental funding request in the aftermath of Helene and Milton. Asked earlier this week about how much time Congress has before the SBA or FEMA runs out of money, Biden told reporters that discussion on the matter is still ongoing, but he said that, 'in terms of the SBA, it's pretty right at the edge right now.' 'It's going to take several billion dollars,' Biden said, discussing overall emergency needs. 'It's not going to be a matter of just a little bit. But we're providing now to make sure people have the emergency relief they need.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/key-disaster-loan-program-quickly-exhausting-funds-after-hurricanes/	2024-10-12T05:55:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Funding-challenges_101124_AP_Mike-Stewart.png?w=900

Milton aftermath: 1.6M Floridians still without power	(NewsNation) — Emergency and utility crews are working to clear flooded roadways and restore power to the 1.6 million Florida homes and businesses still in the dark three days post-Milton. At least 10 storm-related deaths have been reported, according to the White House. NewsNation local affiliate WFLA reported that one of those killed was a Polk County employee who was helping with cleanup. Six deaths resulted from a tornado hitting the Spanish Lakes Country Club Village near Fort Pierce, while two others in Volusia County were killed by trees crashing into their homes, according to authorities. Florida family: Insurers hope we’ll walk away The area is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that hit Florida and other parts of the southeast just two weeks before Milton, a Category 3 at landfall. President Joe Biden spoke with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster Friday night to discuss the recovery efforts from Helene. He also spoke with Mayor Gene Brown of Bradenton, Florida, to discuss the ongoing rescue and response efforts in Florida following Milton, which made landfall near Sarasota in the central-west part of the state Wednesday night. President Joe Biden is expected to travel to Florida on Sunday to visit impacted areas. Power outages in Florida More than 1.6 million customers remained without power in Florida as of Saturday morning, down from an initial 3.3 million in the early morning hours of Thursday after the storm made landfall. The majority of outages are in the central-western part of the state where Milton made landfall. Vice President Kamala Harris shared on X that 50,000 workers are contributing to the power restoration. Harris also noted FEMA has delivered more than 1.2 million meals, and search-and-rescue teams have assisted in more than 4,200 rescues. Still, many expressed relief that Milton wasn’t worse. The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. Meteorologist threatened after debunking hurricane conspiracies 'To the people of Florida: I know recovery and rebuilding periods can be long and difficult. And that long after the press and cameras move on, you have to pick up the pieces. But I want you to know I will do everything in my power to help you put the pieces back together,' President Joe Biden posted to X Friday morning. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis acknowledged the storm was significant but said it 'was not the worst-case scenario.' While flying over some of the hard-hit areas, he said he noticed many recently-built homes fare well. 'We did not get the worst-case scenario, but we did get hit, and we are going to have to work to bounce back,' DeSantis said. The governor continued to encourage residents to 'exercise caution.' Hurricane Milton's destruction Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, the system knocked out power to more than 3 million customers initially, flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays’ baseball stadium, and toppled a construction crane. Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges, and flooding. Before Milton even made landfall, heavy rain, and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida. The National Weather Service reported almost 19 inches of rainfall in the St. Petersburg area. A storm surge of 8 to 10 feet was reported in Sarasota County. Milton rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm as it moved inland. LAKEWOOD PARK, FLORIDA- OCTOBER 10 Shane Ostrander looks through what remains of his home after a tornado spawned by Hurricane Milton destroyed his home in Lakewood Park, Florida on October 10, 2024. Ostrander and his wife Nichole Gaza had been sitting on their living room couch, with their dog, Atticus when their front door began to get suctioned. They ran back into their bedroom closet and almost immeidately, everything around them, their home was decimated. The closet remained in tact. (Photo by Kathleen Flynn for the Washington Post) In Washington, D.C., Biden called on Congress to move as fast as possible to deliver emergency funding to the Sunshine State. 'I think Speaker (Mike) Johnson is going to get the message that he’s got to step up, particularly for small businesses,' Biden told reporters in the Roosevelt Room Friday. How to use a generator after Hurricane Milton Officials warn of hurricane relief scams As relief efforts continue, the U.S. Department of Justice is alerting the public to a rise in scams aimed at exploiting victims of these disasters. According to the DOJ, scammers are quick to exploit weather disasters and the people affected by them. Officials also reminded people that if their property was damaged by both Helene and Milton, they would need to apply for disaster assistance twice, with separate applications for the damage from each storm. On Friday evening, Sarasota County Government shared that FEMA has asked for assistance 'correcting a rumor about automatic financial reimbursement for those who have been without power for 24 hours. Any individual seeking disaster assistance from FEMA must complete an application process.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/milton-aftermath-floridians-without-power/	2024-10-12T04:31:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177295651.jpg?w=900

Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case	DELPHI, Ind. (NewsNation) — The deaths of Indiana teens Libby German and Abby Williams shocked the country and changed their families and their small Midwest town forever. German, 14, and Williams, 13, ventured out on a walk along the Delphi Historic Trail on Feb. 13, 2017, but never returned home. Their disappearance sparked a community-wide search for the girls. Investigators discovered the girl's bodies the following day near the Monon High Bridge, just outside their hometown of Delphi, Indiana.

Despite his 2022 arrest, Allen had talked to police in 2017 and told them he had been on the bridge the day of the girls' disappearance. He denied meeting the teenagers and pleaded not guilty. Here’s a timeline retracing key moments of the Delphi killings case. Libby German and Abby Williams vanish Feb. 13, 2017: German and Williams set out for a walk along the Delphi Historic Trail, where they are last seen. 'They just got out of the car and walked down the trail to go to High Bridge,' German’s older sister said. 'We told each other we loved each other. And that was the last time I saw her.' Just after 2 p.m. local time, German posted a photo of the Monon High Bridge on Snapchat and one of Williams walking across the historic bridge. That post was the last correspondence from either of them. Hours passed, and nobody could get in contact with the girls. They were then reported missing. Feb. 14, 2017: Law enforcement and volunteers began a search for the girls, canvassing areas. Their bodies were found in a rugged area near a hiking trail one day after they vanished while walking on that trail near the Monon High Bridge. Feb. 15, 2017: Law enforcement confirmed that the two bodies discovered were those of German and Williams. State police released images discovered on German's phone to the public, saying they were believed to be of the suspected killer. Delphi killing suspect.

June 13, 2023: Allen’s defense team filed a motion to suppress certain evidence from the case. At the time, the motion was under seal, but the court revealed it involved ballistics. June 15, 2023: Allen appeared in court for what was supposed to be a bail hearing. Ultimately, the judge heard arguments over covering several issues, including a motion filed by Allen’s attorney to keep certain evidence from coming out at trial. Sebastian Rogers search: A timeline of the Tennessee teen’s disappearance Prosecutors stated that Allen confessed five or six times to the murders, but his attorneys said he couldn't be trusted due to his mental state. Along those lines, Allen’s attorneys also asked that he be moved from the Westville Correctional Facility to a county jail, citing a decline in the man’s physical and mental health. June 16, 2023: Allen's defense team claimed the suspect's mental and physical state was getting worse in isolation. Allen County Judge Frances Gull June 29, 2023: Allen County Judge Frances Gull unsealed 118 documents in the case against Allen. Allen allegedly told his wife and mother 'no less than five times' that he was responsible for killing German and Williams. The records also revealed that investigators believed a knife was used in the killings. Jan. 12, 2024: Allen's new defense team asked the state to transfer him to a new prison after the suspect claimed mistreatment at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility. The new attorneys claimed the mistreatment impacted their ability to represent him in court. Feb. 8, 2024: Gull denied the motion, asking for Allen to be moved from Wabash Valley Correctional Facility. Odinist cult killing theory unfolds Sept. 18, 2023: Baldwin and Rozzi announced a conspiracy-fueled alternative theory to the Delphi murders that not only didn’t involve their client but invoked a ritualistic murder seeped in the occult. What is Odinism, and is it connected to the Delphi murders? While the Carroll County Prosecutor’s Office deemed the Odinist cult killing theory 'unfounded' with 'absolutely no proof,' Baldwin and Rozzi pointed out that investigators spoke with key suspects whom the defense team believed were at the center of the cult theory. Sept. 26, 2024: McLeland responded to Allen’s defense team’s 136-page memorandum that laid out an alternative theory that linked the Delphi murders, calling the alternative theory 'a fanciful defense for social media to devour' that isn’t supported by evidence. Oct. 3, 2023: In a court filing, the defense team said it believed investigators reopened their investigation into the theory that German and Williams were killed in a ritualistic sacrifice. Sept. 4, 2024: Gull rules against allowing the Odinism defense at trial. Delphi crime scene photos, evidence leaked Oct. 5, 2023: Evidence related to German and Williams' deaths, including crime scene photos, were leaked online and distributed to YouTube and podcast content creators. Oct. 9, 2023: Mitch Westerman, a friend of one of Allen's attorneys, reportedly contacted Baldwin and admitted to being behind the leak, taking photos of the evidence and sharing those with a man who later shared them with another person from Texas who in turn sent them to various YouTube and podcast creators. The man Westerman initially shared the photos with killed himself after being questioned by police. What do we know about Delphi suspect Richard Allen? Oct. 19, 2023: Gull announced Baldwin and Rozzi were 'voluntarily withdrawing' from the case in response to the evidence leak from their office earlier in the month. The decision, which the judge called a 'very unexpected turn of events,' meant some parts of the pretrial process would return to square one as Allen awaited a new legal team. Oct. 26, 2023: Baldwin and Rozzi filed several motions with the Indiana Supreme Court, claiming they were removed from the murder case by Gull in the aftermath of the evidence leak.

Booking photo of Mitchell Westerman Jan 18, 2024: The Indiana Supreme Court reinstated Allen's original defense team after they were removed from his case last fall. Lebrato and Scremin later filed a motion to remove themselves from Allen's case. The justices also denied a motion to remove Gull from the case. Pretrial hearings Oct. 31, 2023: Gull, who’d earlier expressed skepticism at meeting the January date, pushed Allen’s trial back, setting a new date of October 2024.

Jan. 28, 2024: Allen's attorneys filed a new motion seeking to remove Gull from the case, arguing she should be replaced or recuse herself from the proceedings in favor of a different judge. Jan. 29, 2024: McLeland pushed the court to hold Baldwin and Rozzi in contempt, accusing them of mishandling evidence and making public statements about the case as the court weighed a gag order. Andrew Baldwin (L), Richard Allen (C), Bradley Rozzi (R) Feb 7, 2024: Allen's defense team called for the murder charges leveled against him to be thrown out, claiming that interview recordings with 'key suspects' were deleted in acts the attorneys call either negligent or intentional. Baldwin and Rozzi filed their motion to dismiss on the grounds of destruction of evidence key to their defense of Allen. A third attempt to have Special Judge Fran Gull thrown off the case was rejected the same day it was filed. March 11, 2024: Gull granted the defense team’s request to move up Allen's murder trial, scheduling court to begin on May 13. Gull blocked off May 13 through May 31 in her motion. March 18, 2024: The judge dismissed two counts of kidnapping, and Allen waived an initial hearing to dispute the amended charges, which include murder. April 25, 2024: Gull declares no cameras will be allowed in the courtroom for Allen's trial. April 30, 2024: Prosecutors asked the court to prevent the defense from presenting its 'Odinism' murder theory in court. The request applies to jury selection, opening arguments, presentation of evidence at trial and closing arguments. May 2, 2024: Gull found Allen's defense lawyers 'sloppy, negligent, and incompetent' but declined to hold the pair in contempt. May 7, 2024: Gull reset Allen's trial dates for the murders of German and Williams for Oct. 14 through Nov. 15 in Carroll County. June 19, 2024: Defense attorneys claim the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office lied about the circumstances surrounding the transportation of a Westville Correctional Facility inmate for a June 2023 hearing — and that Gull contradicted the sheriff’s office report about the matter. The defense wants Gulls to testify as a defense witness regarding the matter. Rachel Morin trial postponed until April 2025 Aug. 16, 2024: Gull denied a defense request to have Allen's case dismissed. Richard Allen trial Oct. 14, 2024: Jury selection is set to begin.

Do we have to regulate everything?': DeSantis on Milton crane cr...	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton sent a massive crane crashing into the side of a St. Petersburg building on Wednesday, raising concerns about state regulations ahead of natural disasters and whether the state should have mandated the crane be taken down ahead of the storm. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded to the crane crash Friday, saying more 'common sense' was needed. 'I think the question is, should there be more regulation, or should there just be more common sense?' DeSantis said. 'I think it just takes a little bit of common sense.' Are more hurricanes heading for Florida? Not at the moment Milton sends massive crane crashing A high rise construction crane broke apart and crashed into the building across the street during Hurricane Milton on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2024, in St. Petersburg, Fla.

(Tampa Bay Times via AP)ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA - OCTOBER 10: A crane sits on the street after crashing down into the building housing the Tampa Bay Times offices after the arrival of Hurricane Milton on October 10, 2024 in St. Petersburg, Florida. Milton, which comes just after the recent catastrophic Hurricane Helene, landed into Florida's Gulf Coast late Wednesday evening as a Category 3 storm causing extensive flooding and damage. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) The crane rammed into the side of a large office building Wednesday night, causing severe damage and partial collapse. Police said no one was inside the building during the crash, and caution tape was put up around the damaged area. Developer Red Apple Group confirmed that at least one crane cab in the upper section of the mast fell, and they were working with city officials to assess the situation. City officials blocked off several blocks until they could completely assess the damage and begin working to remove the toppled and twisted crane Thursday. Experts said most cranes are designed for winds of at least 100 mph, and those in places like Florida, where hurricanes are a greater hazard, often have a greater wind resistance. But there is only so much force a crane can handle. That’s why St. Petersburg Mayor Kenneth Welch warned anyone living near construction projects that use a crane to leave, and police made sure areas threatened were cleared. Tom Barth of Barth Crane Inspections in Goose Creek, South Carolina, told The Associated Press that cranes have to be both raised and removed carefully, explaining that it could take days or longer to remove them. That’s time that usually isn’t available once forecasters lock in on a potential path for a storm. Milton gas shortage: Where to find gas in Tampa Bay DeSantis: I don't buy it However, DeSantis said he 'doesn’t buy' that it would have taken that long to take down a crane, especially in preparation for a massive hurricane projected to hit the area. 'I don't buy this idea it takes weeks to mitigate,' DeSantis, a Republican, said. 'I mean, they say the debris takes six months to a year. And then we got 40,000 cubic yards of debris off the Pinellas beaches just by bringing all of our people. ... So, you know, things can be done.' The governor questioned the necessity of additional regulations, emphasizing that common sense and local practices often suffice. Guthrie agreed with DeSantis, saying local governments and construction workers must have contingency plans, as Florida's geography makes it prone to natural disasters. He stressed that the government shouldn't have to overstep by micromanaging everything, but rather, common sense should guide local decisions. 'Disasters are at the local level. At the end of the day, Pinellas County's got a plan. St Pete's got a plan. We need construction workers to have a plan, and you've got to have those contingencies,' Guthrie said. 'I mean, it's not like this snuck out from anywhere. I mean, we had strong seven to 10 days notice that things were heading in this direction.' 'To the governor's point, there's got to be a point where common sense comes into play. We cannot hold everybody's hand and do everything for them,' he said. 'That is not the function of government, whether it's local county or the state government or even the federal government. It's not their job to do that.' Both agree that swift action and local oversight are crucial.

Dog found tied to pole during Milton has new name, animal rescue ...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The dog that was found tied to a fence on a Florida highway during evacuations ahead of Hurricane Milton is rehabilitating at an animal rescue facility in Tallahassee, according to a representative from the Leon County Humane Society. The dog was initially spotted by a trooper with the Florida Highway Patrol on Wednesday, along a section of Interstate 75 near Tampa. Video taken by the trooper showed the dog, unable to move from the fence, standing in a pool of water that had already risen up to its belly. Milton recovery efforts underway in Florida The trooper approached the dog, who began barking in his direction. 'I don’t blame you,' the trooper responded. 'I don’t blame you. It’s OK, buddy, it’s OK.' The dog rescued by a trooper with the Florida Highway Patrol is safe and rehabilitated in Tallahassee, according to the Leon County Humane Society. (Florida Highway Patrol Tampa) After the dog was rescued, the Florida Highway Patrol urged Floridians not to abandon their pets during evacuations. 'Do NOT do this to your pets please,' the FHP wrote. The story made national headlines, sparking concern among pet-lovers over the well-being of the animal. In response, a representative from the Leon County Humane Society has since confirmed the dog is safe at its facility. 'We know that without the help with Florida Highway Patrol Troopers with Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles that this dog would not have made it through,' reads a message posted to the Leon County Humane Society’s Facebook page. 'We're grateful the Troopers understood he was a scared and abandoned dog and treated him so patiently and kind during the rescue.' How might Helene, Milton hurricanes affect the election? The facility also revealed the dog’s new name. 'His name is Trooper, because of how much he's been through and to honor those who saved him.' In the post, the Humane Society confirmed the dog was 'stressed and still decompressing' as of Thursday, and will likely not be completely comfortable for months. The organization, too, said it’s 'completely unacceptable' for a pet owner to abandon their animals. 'It was cruel, and it was thoughtless not only toward him, but toward the people who were trying their best to handle the incoming storm,' reads the Facebook post. Close Thank you for signing up!

Obama urges Black men to show up for Harris as he campaigns in cr...	PITTSBURGH (AP) — Former President Barack Obama gave a blistering critique of his White House successor Donald Trump and urged Black men to show up for Kamala Harris as he opened a swing-state tour for the Democratic ticket. At a campaign field office to thank volunteers, Obama said Thursday he wanted to 'speak some truths' after hearing reports on the ground that there was lower enthusiasm for Harris than there was for his own candidacy and that some Black men were thinking of sitting out the election. 'Part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,' Obama said. The former president said Trump’s penchant for putting people down was not real strength. 'You’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that’s a sign of strength, because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable,' Obama said. Trump responded in a post on his social media network Friday by ignoring Obama’s extended denunciation of him, suggesting the former president might secretly have his support, and by once again insulting Harris. 'Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men,' he wrote. 'I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn’t like the fact that Kamala is an extremely Low IQ Person!' Obama made the battleground state of Pennsylvania the first stop of his campaign tour with less than four weeks until Election Day and as voting is already underway. Speaking at a rally at the University of Pittsburgh, he painted Trump as out-of-touch and not the choice to lead the country to change, calling him a 'bumbling' billionaire 'who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.' He said Harris is 'a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a chance' and declared, 'Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been.' Obama, eight years out of power, has been one of the Democratic Party’s most reliable surrogates to galvanize voters. Until he was elected president in 2020, Joe Biden had also taken on that role for Democrats, but this year, since ending his reelection campaign and letting Harris ascend to the ticket, he’s yet to hit the trail. Obama, who received a roaring welcome from the crowd, described Trump’s all-caps posts on social media and his 'ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories. The two-hour speeches, word salad, just — it’s like Fidel Castro. Just on and on. Constant attempts to sell you stuff. Who does that?' Obama listed some of the products Trump has tried to sell during his third White House campaign, including $399 gold sneakers, a $100,000 watch and his 'God Bless the USA' Bible for $59.99. 'He wants you to buy the word of God: Donald Trump edition. Got his name right there next to Matthew and Luke,' Obama said, laughing. 'You could not make this stuff up.' The appearance by Obama, the nation’s first Black president, underscores the history-making nature of Harris' own political career. Harris, the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, would be the first woman to serve as president if elected next month. Obama's old campaign rallying cry, 'Yes, We Can,' was even refashioned for the event, with 'Yes, She Can' beaming on a screen over the crowd. Both Harris and Trump have been vying for support from Black Americans. A recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black male and female voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Black voters’ opinions of Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, according to the poll, but the former president believes his message on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make inroads into the Democrats’ traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men. Obama acknowledged that the last few years, starting with the pandemic, have been hard for Americans, with high prices and other stresses on working families. 'I get it, why people are looking to shake things up. I mean, I am the hopey-changey guy. So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better,' Obama said. 'What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania.' He mocked Trump’s answer in the debate that he would replace Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, with 'concepts of a plan,' and his running mate JD Vance’s recent comment that Trump worked to 'salvage' the law. 'Donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to tear it down. And by the way, he couldn’t even do that right.' Obama also referred to a new court filing in the federal election interference case against Trump that said Trump told an aide, 'So what?' after being told his vice president, Mike Pence, had been rushed to a safe location after a violent crowd of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 'If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?' he asked. Glenda Ellison, a 71-year-old retired schoolteacher and Democrat from Pittsburgh, said she is feeling 'a little nervous' about the election but 'prayerful that it’s going to turn out in our favor.' Ellison said she sees Obama as a party spokesperson with a large following who can hopefully sway voters that might be on the fence about voting for Harris. 'As a former president, and also as a Black president, I think that is something that might connect with the African American community, the fact that we do have our Black president supporting another Black candidate,' said Ellison, who is Black. Obama was among the key Democrats who were part of a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Biden, his former vice president, to drop out of the 2024 race. Obama and Harris have been friends for two decades since he ran for Senate in Illinois. She campaigned for him when he sought the presidency in 2008. Pennsylvania is a state Obama won in his 2008 and 2012 presidential races, but Trump won in 2016. Biden narrowly carried it in 2020 and the state is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested in this year’s race. Trump was in the eastern part of the state Wednesday for back-to-back rallies in Scranton and Reading. He also campaigned in western Pennsylvania over the weekend when he returned to Butler, where he was shot in July as he survived an assassination attempt. Obama’s appearance at the University of Pittsburgh was also aimed to bolster the reelection campaign of Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who is being challenged by Trump-endorsed Republican David McCormick. ___ This story has been updated to correct Butler's location to western not eastern Pennsylvania.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-obama-hits-campaign-trail-in-critical-pennsylvania-to-shore-up-support-for-harris/	2024-10-11T07:28:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670936d445f230.66111013.jpeg?w=900
How might Helene, Milton hurricanes affect the election?	(NewsNation) — Arguments over voter access are brewing as the November election approaches — particularly in storm-damaged Florida, which has 30 electoral votes. Nothing is certain as crews continue to survey the damage from Hurricane Milton. However, voting rights groups have gone to federal court seeking to reopen voter registration, which ended Monday. A federal judge shot down the request and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also refused to extend the deadline. How to help Helene and Milton survivors What happens now? Activist groups may try to appeal the denial, claiming back-to-back hurricanes may have caused thousands of voters to miss the deadline. Meanwhile, DeSantis said he’s prepared to issue an executive order that would allow supervisors to change voting sites in the wake of Hurricane Milton, but he hasn’t done so yet. The governor has issued a similar executive order in 10 of Florida’s hardest-hit counties in response to Hurricane Helene. It allows election leaders to make early voting changes and set up consolidated polling sites. It also softens restrictions on mail-in ballots and allows state employees to take paid administrative leave to serve as polling workers on election day. How could hurricane damage affect the 2024 election? Despite the widespread damage across Florida, analysts predict the state will remain widely Republican. The state is home to a reported 5.3 million active registered Republican voters — a million more than Democrats. North Carolina, still reeling from Hurricane Helene, is also an important swing state with 16 electoral votes. Many of the hardest-hit areas from the Category 4 hurricane were Republican-leaning, affecting 8% of eligible voters. Election leaders say they’re doing everything they can to ensure people will be able to cast their votes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/florida-election-hurricanes-milton-helene-voter-registration/	2024-10-11T05:37:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24284729461489.jpg?w=900
Milton recovery efforts underway in Florida as 2.4M without power	(NewsNation) — Crews resumed rescue and recovery efforts Friday morning in Florida, working around the clock to help people in the wake of Hurricane Milton. At least 10 storm-related deaths have been reported so far, according to the White House. NewsNation local affiliate WFLA reported that one of those killed was a Polk County employee who was helping with cleanup. As of 7 a.m. ET Friday, more than 2.4 million customers remained without power in Florida, according to poweroutage.us. Still, many expressed relief that Milton wasn’t worse. The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that while the storm 'was significant,' it 'was not the worst-case scenario.' He noted that as he flew over some of the hard-hit areas, he saw that many homes that were built in recent years fared well. 'I’ve seen a lot of grit, I’ve seen a lot of determination and I’m very confident that this area is going to bounce back very, very quickly,' DeSantis said.

Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said crews have been working hard through the morning to reach those in need of help. Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, the system knocked out power to more than 3 million customers, flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays' baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane. Officials in hard-hit counties have warned people to beware of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges and flooding. Before Milton even made landfall, heavy rain and tornadoes lashed parts of southern Florida. Just inland from Tampa, the flooding in Plant City was 'absolutely staggering,' according to City Manager Bill McDaniel. The National Weather Service said almost 19 inches of rain fell in the St. Petersburg area. A storm surge of 8 to 10 feet was reported in Sarasota County. Milton rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm as it moved over land. President Joe Biden called on Congress to move as fast as it could to get emergency funding to the Sunshine State. DeSantis pledged to send whatever resources he could into Pinellas County communities Friday. It's an area that was mostly spared during Milton but was hit hard by Hurricane Helene, resulting in 12 deaths two weeks prior. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the following ports are now open: Key West, Port Everglades, Port Miami and the Miami River. The following ports remain closed: St. Petersburg, Fort Myers, Fort of Palm Beach, Fort Pierce, Port Canaveral, Jacksonville and Fernandina.

Some Halloween special events won’t be offered and they won’t necessarily be fully functioning Friday, but the public is welcome back, the parks said in statements. As Milton came ashore as a major storm Wednesday, all three Orlando-based parks shut down, putting a damper on the vacations of tens of thousands of tourists, many of whom hunkered down in hotels. Disney World, Universal and SeaWorld were all closed for at least part of Wednesday and all of Thursday. Orlando International Airport, Florida’s busiest, resumed domestic arrivals Thursday and planned to resume departures Friday after mostly shutting down Wednesday. In Tampa, the animals were safe at popular tourist attractions ZooTampa and The Florida Aquarium, which have aimed to reopen Saturday. The 1,000 animals at the zoo will remain in their night houses and hurricane shelter locations while habitats are cleared of debris, a spokesperson said. The aquarium also confirmed its animals are 'doing well.' The zoo sustained some damage from the high winds and does not have power, and the spokesperson anticipates the debris cleanup and restoration, which is already underway, will take a few days. All conservation parks, nature preserves, trails, neighborhood/specialty parks and athletic complexes in Hillsborough County will be closed until further notice.

According to the DOJ, scammers are quick to exploit weather disasters and the people affected by them. Officials also reminded people that if their property was damaged by both Helene and Milton, they would need to apply for disaster assistance twice, with separate applications for the damage from each storm.

As Milton exits Florida, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor another system in the Atlantic, which is not expected to make landfall or come close to the U.S. According to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 a.m. Friday advisory, Tropical Storm Leslie was about 1,600 miles west-southwest of the Azores, a group of islands in the mid-Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. The storm is expected to turn northeast and veer away from the U.S. over the next few days.

Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today?	(NewsNation) — Presidential candidates are hitting the 2024 campaign trail ahead of the November election. The campaign season so far has been atypical. Former President Donald Trump suffered a graze wound to his ear during a July 13 assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where one attendee died and at least two others were injured. About a week later, President Joe Biden announced he no longer planned to accept the Democratic nomination and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the job. Harris then chose Minnesota Gov.

Biden suggests Trump 'get a life' after false hurricane claims	(The Hill) — President Joe Biden on Thursday said that former President Trump 'should get a life' amid false claims from Trump and his allies about the federal response to the recent hurricanes. 'Mr. President Trump, former President Trump, get a life man, help these people,' Biden said in remarks on Hurricane Milton from the White House. Biden was questioned if he has spoken to Trump about spreading misinformation and responded, 'Are you kidding me?' Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA’s plan for aid? The president said that the 'public will hold (Trump) accountable,' adding that the press will do so as well because 'you know the truth.' And, when questioned if he plans to speak with Trump directly, he replied an emphatic 'no.' Biden specially called out a claim from Trump that those impacted by the storm are only receiving $750 in government assistance. 'That $750 that they’re talking about, Mr. Trump and all those other people know that’s a lie to suggest that’s all they’re going to get. That’s bizarre. It’s bizarre,' the president said. 'You’ve got to stop this. I mean they’re being so damn un-American with how they’re talking about this stuff.' Biden has called for Trump and his allies, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to stop spreading misinformation in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and now Milton. He also gave two speeches from the White House on Wednesday to try to combat misinformation. Milton made landfall late Wednesday along Florida’s Gulf Coast. The deadly storm surge led to flooding and millions of Floridians experiencing power outages.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-trump-get-life-false-hurricane-claims/	2024-10-11T02:37:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24284661071030-e1728607621392.jpg?w=800
Tampa International Airport to reopen after Hurricane Milton	(NewsNation) — The Tampa International Airport in Tampa, Florida, will reopen Friday at 8 a.m. EDT after a three-day flight suspension due to Hurricane Milton, the airport announced. The state is beginning cleanup and recovery efforts after Milton, which made landfall Wednesday evening as a Category 3 storm. The airport said it is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and other airlines to aim for a Friday morning reopening.

Hurricane Milton strikes Florida, officials warn of hurricane rel...	RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) -- Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida Wednesday night, following the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene roughly two weeks prior, which resulted in over 200 deaths and extensive property damage. As relief efforts continue, the United States Department of Justice is alerting the public to a rise in scams aimed at exploiting victims of these disasters. Milton started its destruction in California Wednesday, Oct. 9 as a Category 3 storm but has since weakened to a Category 1 as it travels across Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Thursday morning, the storm has cut off power to more than 3 million people, spawned a number of tornadoes and killed four people. According to the Justice Department, scammers are quick to exploit weather disasters and the people affected by them. Milton live updates: At least 10 dead, 2.8M without power in Florida The Justice Department, including the NCDF, stands ready to prevent these bad actors from fraudulent activity. We are here to support victims of natural disasters during these difficult times together with our state, local and federal partners, and agencies. In an effort to assist the most vulnerable neighbors who are susceptible to these types of fraudulent schemes, we encourage you to be diligent in reporting suspicious activity on their behalf. U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Gathe Jr. for the Middle District of Louisiana, Executive Director of the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) According to the department, the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, scammers will often use the following kinds of scams to take advantage: Fraudulent charities soliciting donations for disaster victims that often imitate the names of charities linked to the disaster. Scammers impersonating government officials, offering disaster relief in exchange for personal information or money. Scammers promoting non-existent businesses or investment opportunities related to disaster recovery, such as rebuilding or flood-proofing. Price gouging for essential goods and services needed by disaster victims. Businesses using supply chain disruptions as a cover for collusion to overcharge customers. The department encourages people to exercise caution before giving money or personal information to someone on the phone, and reminds people of the following: Only scammers will insist that you pay for services by wire transfer, gift card, payment app, cryptocurrency or in cash. If they promise to help you qualify for relief for a fee, it is a scam. You should never sign your insurance check over to someone else. Make sure you research contractors and get estimates from more than one before signing a work contract. Get a written contract for repairs and read it carefully before signing. Jonathan McNamara with the American Red Cross emphasized to 8News that the organization will never request money or personal information through phone calls. As Florida grapples with the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, officials urge residents to stay informed and cautious, ensuring that their donations reach legitimate organizations working to aid those in need. If you do get a scam call like this, you can report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud by completing a Disaster Complaint Form or by calling 866-720-5721, which is a hotline staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/hurricane-milton-strikes-florida-officials-warn-of-hurricane-relief-scams/	2024-10-10T17:15:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hurricane-_1530463789233_47339741_ver1.0.jpg?w=900
Tampa sees 5x the usual October rainfall due to Hurricane Milton	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton's landfall as a Category 3 hurricane didn't just bring devastating storm surge and extremely dangerous wind speeds, it also left Tampa Bay soaked with historic rainfall. Tampa Bay faced a potential threat of catastrophic 15-foot storm surge, but this was averted when the hurricane swerved into Sarasota County near Siesta Key. How to help Helene and Milton survivors However, this meant that the counties north of Milton's eye were hit by heavy rainfall. St. Petersburg saw 15 to 18 inches of rainfall, while areas in and around Tampa saw 12 to 13 inches of rain. Even counties further inland saw historic levels of rain, well after the hurricane hit land. 'In fact, in some areas, it's about a once-in-a-500-year event, believe it or not,' said Jeff Berardelli, Max Defender 8 chief meteorologist. 'Very, very rare event in parts of our area.' In Tampa, Milton produced 12 inches of rain, more than five times the normal amount of rain for October. The normal amount for the entire month is usually 2.3 inches of rain. At times, people think of hurricanes as more of a threat when it comes to storm surge or winds, but with rain like this, Tampa Bay residents saw unprecedented flooding that struck their neighborhoods and homes, even outside the evacuation zones. Video: Hurricane Milton sucks water out of Tampa Bay 'We're talking a foot and a half of rainfall, and now that is what is leading to those lower-lying areas where you hear people say, 'Well we don't normally flood. We're not in an evacuation zone,'' Max Defender 8 Meteorologist Amanda Holly said. 'Well, when you get 18 inches of rain over a big area, yeah, you will see abnormally high water levels get into areas that don't normally flood.' With the heavy rainfall brought by hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton, 2024 has become the wettest year on record for the Tampa Bay area. After Milton, Tampa saw 77.11' inches of rain, more than 32.93 inches more than the normal yearly amount. 'Even if we don't get another drop of rain for the entire rest of the year, we will end the wettest year on record in Tampa,' Holly said. While the rains are out of our area, there is a fear of river flooding as they crest after the hurricane. The Anclote River, the Hillsborough River, the Little Manatee River, the Alafia River, and the Manatee River are all areas of concern. However, Tampa Bay will now experience some dry northern air that will reduce the humidity. 'It couldn't take the rain chance out completely, but I really think that outside of getting a quick little sprinkle, the day is going to feel comfortable,' Max Defender 8 meteorologist Leigh Spann said. 'And it's going to stick around with nice dry conditions all the way through the weekend.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/tampa-october-rainfall-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-10T16:59:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177054224-e1728604536853.jpg?w=800
TikToker Morgan Roos on riding out Milton: ‘It got dicey’	(NewsNation) — TikToker Morgan Roos updated her fans Thursday morning on what happened overnight as she rode out Hurricane Milton from her high-rise apartment on Tampa’s Riverwalk. 'It got dicey,' she said. 'I’m so grateful and so blessed to be OK.' Roos, a new Tampa resident, recounted spending the night in the hallway of her apartment building. 'I could hear on the upper floors a banging, like a window had popped. That was, like, getting my anxiety all high,' she said. At least 10 dead following Milton landfall in Florida 'Then at about 4:30 in the morning, I hear, like, this huge bang noise? And I can hear rushing water. And I hear, like, down the hallway, and I see water droplets. And I look down, and there’s like f------ water coming out of a light.' Roos said she then decided to go back inside her apartment, where the windows were intact, but water was everywhere. She also apologized for not taking video of the damage in real time. After getting back to sleep after 5 a.m., then waking up late Thursday morning, Roos reflected on sustaining a little water damage and losing her Wi-Fi connection for a while. 'You know like when you finally feel safe after a really stressful situation? Your body like kinda collapses? That’s how I felt,' she said. Floridian who rode out Milton ‘wouldn’t stay’ if he had do-over On Wednesday afternoon, as Milton approached the Florida Gulf Coast, Roos told 'NewsNation Now' she was having second thoughts about staying. 'I think I really, really, really underestimated this,' she said at the time.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/tiktoker-morgan-roos-milton/	2024-10-10T15:45:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/morgan.png?w=589
Are more hurricanes heading for Florida? Not at the moment	(NewsNation) — As Hurricane Milton exits Florida, the National Hurricane Center is continuing to monitor another system in the Atlantic, which is not expected to make landfall or come close to the U.S. According to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. Thursday advisory, Tropical Storm Leslie was about 1,710 miles west-southwest of the Azores, a group of islands in the mid-Atlantic. The storm is expected to turn north tonight and veer away from the U.S. over the next few days. Photos: First look at Siesta Key after Hurricane Milton 'Rapid weakening is forecast to continue during the next day or so, and Leslie is forecast to lose tropical characteristics in a few days,' the NHC said in its latest update. There have also been false rumors on social media of a 'Hurricane Nadine' heading toward Central Florida. Nadine is indeed the next name on the list of tropical storms for 2024, but as of right now, nothing has developed. Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA's plan for aid? 'I don't see anything that's coming our way anytime soon,' said Justin Mosley, a meteorologist at NewsNation affiliate Suncoast News Network. So far, there have been 13 named storms in the 2024 hurricane season, which lasts until the end of November. Two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene hit the Big Bend region of Florida as a Category 4 storm, killing more than 200 people and leaving a wake of destruction in its path. Now, at least 10 people are dead after Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night. More than 3 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida on Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/storms-heading-florida/	2024-10-10T15:30:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177012789.jpg?w=900
‘Gators, stingrays, snakes’: Floridians urged to avoid floodwater...	TAMPA, Fla. (NewsNation) — Florida officials are warning the public to avoid floodwaters caused by Hurricane Milton, saying a myriad of dangers are lurking in murky water. Frank Robb, an alligator expert and founder of the nonprofit group Environmental Education Awareness Research Support and Services (EEARSS), told NewsNation the dangers you face largely depend on where you live. 'If you're coastal, you have to worry about everything from stingrays to alligators, you know. If you're in South Florida, you gotta think about crocodiles, snakes — of course,' Robb said. 'It's definitely something to be aware of and keep on your mind.' Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment The worst storm surge appeared to be in Sarasota County, where it was 8 to 10 feet — lower than in the worst place during Helene. The storm also dumped up to 18 inches of rain in some areas. Robb recommends avoiding floodwaters at all costs but has advice for those who need to venture outside. 'Obviously, if it's not water you can see through, you probably shouldn't be wading through it,' he said. 'If you have to walk through it, carry a walking stick, something to put in front of you to feel where you're going.' Robb cautioned, however, that the most dangerous things dwelling in the depths of the dark water aren’t likely to be animals. 'You should be worried about microscopic organisms and bacteria. Those are the things to be really concerned about,' he said. 'Wildlife is going to be wildlife no matter what. The last thing they want to do is have an interaction with you. Again, it's the bacteria, pathogens and things of that nature that should really be on people's mind.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/floridians-urged-to-avoid-floodwaters/	2024-10-10T14:11:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177829552.jpg?w=900
Live: Trump visits Aurora after Venezuelan gang claims	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump held a rally in Aurora, Colorado, on Friday — a city his campaign called a 'war zone' in its announcement, claiming the city has seen an 'influx of violent Venezuelan prison gang members from Tren de Aragua.' His campaign issued a statement on Trump's proposal for a federal effort to remove gang members who are in the U.S. illegally, invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target members of cartel networks. Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman, a Republican, disputes that characterization and said concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been 'grossly exaggerated.' 'Former President Trump’s visit to Aurora is an opportunity to show him and the nation that Aurora is a considerably safe city — not a city overrun by Venezuelan gangs,' Coffman said in a social media post on Tuesday. Aurora police: Gang has not taken over apartment complex During last month's presidential debate, Trump cited Aurora as an example of the Biden administration's border policy. 'They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently,' Trump said. 'These are the people that (Harris) and Biden let into our country.' The former president's remarks came after a viral video began circulating in August showing armed men in the hallway of an Aurora apartment complex. The Aurora Police Department has said it has no evidence that the people in the video are involved with any gang and they haven't been able to link the individuals to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Coffman said the incidents were 'limited to several apartment complexes in this city of more than 400,000 residents.' Nevertheless, Aurora Police have acknowledged that 'components of Tren de Aragua' are operating in the area and have identified at least 10 known members. Those men face charges that include assault, burglary, kidnapping and attempted murder. Arrest warrants have been issued for the six armed men in the viral video, though only one has been taken into custody. They face felony charges of first-degree burglary and menacing. Trump says migrants who have committed murder have introduced ‘a lot of bad genes in our country’ In a statement to NewsNation affiliate FOX31, Colorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis pushed back on Trump's rhetoric and said the former president will find an 'incredible city with two straight years of rapidly declining crime' when he visits Aurora. 'As Coloradans, we are proud of Aurora, proud of Colorado, and proud of the United States of America,' he said. The Trump rally is set for 1 p.m. on Friday at the Gaylord Rockies Resort and Convention Center, near Denver International Airport.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-aurora-venezuelan-gang/	2024-10-10T12:20:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2175694409.jpg?w=900
14-year-old found floating on fence in Tampa floodwaters after Hu...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – A 14-year-old was rescued after Hurricane Milton's floodwaters trapped him on a floating piece of a fence in the middle of Tampa, Florida. Video published by the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office showed Sheriff Chad Chronister and a deputy finding the boy floating on a street in front of a small grocery store. How to help Helene and Milton survivors 'Stay right there,' the rescue crew told the boy as they spun their boat around to grab him. Speaking with Melissa Marino of NewsNation affiliate WFLA, Chronister explained that the boy had evacuated from Hurricane Milton and was staying at a friend's house. However, when the boy tried to walk back home after the storm, he underestimated how deep the water was and could not swim well enough to get through. 'It was literally out of a castaway movie, him laying on top of a fence, waving at us,' Chronister said. 'Out of breath, gasping for air as we pulled him up.' Once the boy was pulled out of the floodwater, he was helped to solid ground before continuing home safely. Over 135 rescued from Tampa assisted living facility amid Milton flood That particular neighborhood was not in an evacuation zone, Chronister acknowledged. Still, it suffered what he had referred to as 'unprecedented' flooding. Hillsborough County Fire Rescue reported that 350 911 calls were made between 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and 3:30 a.m. Thursday. However, it is not known exactly how many people have been rescued yet.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/hurricane-milton-tampa-floodwaters/	2024-10-10T12:10:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/HCSO-RESCUES-14-YEAR-OLD-BOY.00_00_00_12.Still001.jpg?w=640
Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment	(NewsNation) — Once an emergency is declared — like in the case of Hurricanes Milton and Helene — the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can unleash various types of aid. Much of what the agency does is give out money in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. That can include assistance to individuals affected by disasters, such as payments of $750 to pay for their immediate needs — like medicine or diapers — after a storm or earthquake hits. It can also mean additional money to rent an apartment because their home is destroyed or to pay for a storage unit. That $750, however, has been mischaracterized by several high-profile politicians, including former President Donald Trump. Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA’s plan for aid? He, and others, have claimed that the $750 payment is a loan and that is the only form of assistance FEMA is providing. The initial $750 is the first payment FEMA will make to storm survivors. They are also who eligible for other forms of assistance.

Tampa residents credit Native American legend for Helene, Milton ...	(NewsNation) — For more than a week, Hurricane Milton was forecasted to make direct landfall over the Tampa Bay area. Yet, in a last-minute wobble, the Category 3 storm veered away from the city Wednesday and spared locals from an anticipated massive storm surge. Instead, the hurricane made landfall in Siesta Key as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night. Now, Pinellas County residents are thanking a benevolent spirit they say guards them from storms and other hazards. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt.

The tribe lived in small villages between what is now Safety Harbor and the Gandy area, from 900 to the 1500s, but died out from disease and violence from Spanish settlers in the 17th century, according to Pinellas County’s website. In those villages, the tribe would build mounds made of layers of shells and sand. The mounds were used as temples, homes and burial grounds. The oldest remaining one is located near Old Tampa Bay. Some locals claim the tribe blessed the mounds for protection from hurricanes and other hazards, but we have yet to confirm the validity of their story. 'The Tocobaga tribe legend is big down here. People feel it keeps us safe,' Largo resident Denise Walenter-Just told NewsNation. Helene survivor says he had ‘guardian angel’ before rescue Locals praise Tocobaga for averting Milton Milton tracked to the south in the final hours and landed as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night in Siesta Key, about 70 miles south of Tampa. While it caused a lot of damage and water levels may continue to rise for days, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said it was not 'the worst-case scenario.' The deadly storm surge feared for Tampa appears not to have materialized, though the situation in the area was still a major emergency. The storm brought up to 18 inches of rain to spots in the Tampa and St. Petersburg areas. DeSantis said that the worst storm surge appeared to be in Sarasota County, where it was 8 to 10 feet — less than in the worst place during Helene. 'Everyone is thanking the Tocobaga for not getting a direct hit,' Walenter-Just said. Tampa City Councilman Bill Carlson said Thursday he and his neighbors were relieved when Milton took a last-minute turn away from their hometown. Carlson attributed the hurricane's southern wobble to the Native American spirit. 'Many people in the area believe there's a Native American spirit there that protects us from storms because it seems like every time a storm comes it either turns left or turns right,' Carlson said. The region didn’t escape the hurricane entirely. Carlson lives in a mandatory evacuation zone and spoke to NewsNation remotely from a hotel. Many people are still without power, and the city is asking residents not to venture out yet, cautioning about flooding and downed power lines. How to help Helene and Milton survivors Did Tocobaga legend cost lives? While locals thank the Tocobaga spirit, the legend has the potential to cause more harm than good in the Tampa Bay area. When Hurricane Helene dragged along Florida's western coast, residents refused to evacuate thinking the hit wouldn't do much damage to their area. However, local officials warned Floridians to evacuate ahead of the storm, saying Helene's storm surge could be deadly. It was. At least 12 people died in Pinellas County from the Category 4 storm. Helene hit the Tampa Bay area harder than any other hurricane in 103 years. While the property damage was mostly unavoidable, there didn’t have to be any deaths — the National Hurricane Center issued its first storm surge warning two days before Helene arrived, telling the barrier islands’ residents they should pack up and get out. Helene's devastation shocked locals. Walenter-Just said Pinellas County doesn't normally flood that bad before, so people don't evacuate, even though the news was stressing that Helene was going to be bad. 'People have had water before but four feet inside your home is just unimaginable,' she said. For Helene, most of Walenter-Just's neighbors and friends decided to stay put. She was also going to stay at her home just over the Indian Rocks Causeway Bridge but decided when Helene approached to retreat further inland to her daughter's place. For Milton, Walenter-Just boarded up her home and planned to stay with her daughter from the beginning. She wasn't taking any chances. United Cajun Navy deploys for 2nd time in 2 weeks for Milton Helene's devastation prevented additional casualties Seminole, Florida, resident Harry Berg rode out Hurricane Milton with his family instead of evacuating. He told NewsNation on Thursday morning that if he had to make that decision all over again, he wouldn't stay. 'I’ve never seen anything like this,' he said. After a very long night and lots of flooding, Berg concluded that he was grateful for Helene's initial impact. He explained that Helene gave the Tampa Bay area a 'little kiss' on its way by, leaving some destruction in its wake along the Pinellas County coastline. By doing so, it instilled a bit of fear within the locals. 'Everybody thinks that the Tampa Bay area is always going to be spared because of the Tocobago Indian lore,' he said. He said that because Helene hit just under two weeks ago, millions of people evacuated from the western coastline out of fear that what could happen with Milton would be worse than Helene. Berg ultimately believes the evacuations lowered Milton's casualty count.

Watch: Hurricane Milton sends massive crane crashing into office ...	(NewsNation) —A St. Petersburg, Florida, resident said he was 'terrified' the moment he heard a massive crane crash into a nearby building, fearing another would come down on him as fierce winds from Hurricane Milton pummeled the area Wednesday. The crane rammed into the side of a large office building Wednesday night, causing severe damage and partial collapse. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat Resident John Silling lives across from the building that was hit and told NewsNation he ran for cover after the crash. 'We heard a massive explosion. We heard glass shatter. We were pretty, pretty terrified,' he said. 'I ran into the stairwell of the building next to it in hopes that the other crane wouldn't come down,' he said. 'We kept looking out the window to see if the other one was coming.' Silling said he had gone through Hurricane Ian in 2022, but 'it was nothing compared to this.' The crane came down on a building previously occupied by the Tampa Bay Times newspaper. Police said no one was inside the building during the crash and caution tape was put up around the damaged area. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA's plan for aid?	(NewsNation) — Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) leaders say about $11 billion is available for Hurricane Milton response efforts. So far, those efforts include urban and Coast Guard search-and-rescue teams, millions of meals and about 5,000 tons of water, among other aid. The FEMA relief process generally requires states to conduct individual assessments and calculations of the damages and then submit that information to federal government. Post-Milton gas in Florida will be a challenge: GasBuddy founder What aid is available for Hurricane Milton recovery? As of Thursday, FEMA said it has enough to help the most immediate emergency needs of people affected by Hurricanes Milton and Helene. FEMA can also tap into other funds that would divert resources for some longer-term projects to immediate needs. The response includes about 1,200 federal search-and-rescue personnel, three Coast Guard swift water rescue teams, tens of billions of meals and several tons of water to help storm survivors. More than 8,000 federal personnel, including FEMA disaster survivor assistance teams, have been deployed to neighborhoods across affected states, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Nearly 300 emergency calls pending in Sarasota County after Milton What future plans are in store? President Joe Biden spoke overnight with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan for the latest storm updates. He also spoke over the phone with mayors of Orlando and Sarasota. The Army Corps of Engineers, health care groups and debris removal experts also traveled to affected areas to aid with recovery. Hundreds of ambulances will be made available to medical crews and 5,000 Florida National Guard members were placed on standby ahead of the storm, according to the Pentagon. Biden’s schedule remained relatively clear Thursday morning. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are expected to receive updates throughout the day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/fema-hurricane-milton-recovery/	2024-10-10T08:22:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175616737-1-1.jpg?w=900
Helene survivor says he had 'guardian angel' before rescue	GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (WJHL) - David Boutin was stuck in flood waters for six hours before being rescued when Hurricane Helene swept through the region. Tragically, one of the rescuers, Boone McCrary, lost his life while attempting to save Boutin. On Sept. 27, the Nolichucky River flooded into Boutin's home. He described seeing the water rise up his driveway. That's when he went outside to pull his van to safety. Then, he went back inside to retrieve his dog 'Buddy,' cell phone and wallet. 'When I went in the bedroom to get him [Buddy], it was ankle deep,' Boutin said. 'Within a minute, it was up to my waist. And I went outside the house to try to get to a ladder to get on the roof. And the river just took us, took Buddy from my arms. I just went pinning along trees. Every time I hold on to a tree, it'd break and I'd just go downriver even further.' Tennessee nurse and his dog died trying to save a man from floods driven by Hurricane Helene Boutin was stranded in floodwaters for six hours before rescuers reached him. 'I didn't think I was gonna get rescued,' Boutin said. 'I couldn't see where I was at. I didn't know. All I knew is hold on to trees. And if I went out to the middle of the river, I wouldn't have made it.' The following day, Boutin learned that Boone McCrary, a rescuer, had gone missing while trying to save him. McCrary's family knew he was out saving people when they heard his boat had hit a bridge and capsized. McCrary's mother, Debbie Fisher, heard he was being rescued, so she went to check at Bird's Bridge. 'They came up and I asked, 'are you going to have to carry Boone up?' So I thought maybe he was injured,' Fisher said. 'They said this was Boone. But I said, 'no, that's not my Boone.' And that's when the nightmare really started because I thought he was being rescued.' It was actually Boutin who was rescued, while McCrary's body was discovered days later. Boutin attended McCrary's funeral service to pay his respects. How to help Helene and Milton survivors 'It lifted a big weight off my shoulder, you know, walked up to his casket, put my hand on there and thanked him for risking his life for me,' Boutin said. Boutin said he is praying for McCrary's family and friends. 'I'm blessed,' Boutin said. 'He's my guardian angel. I wish it didn't go down how it did.'

McCrary's mother and sister said that's just how courageous he was. 'My brother lived life to the fullest,' Laura Harville, McCrary's sister, said. 'He always put himself last and put others first. And I think that if you were to look on social media, you can see that from what others have said. One of his friends that would come and hunt with him, made a story on Tik-Tok and it was true. He's just a good old boy. He'd give you the shirt off his back.' Fisher agrees. She said all of the devastation, plus losing her son, is very traumatizing. 'It did my heart good to see all the people that he had touched and changed their lives and how much love and support he had showed them and kindness,' Fisher said. 'It does my heart good, but I still would love to have Boone here with me. I woke up this morning, I decided it was going to be a better day because Boone would not be happy if I was just not together at all. I could see him saying to me Mom...' 'Don't embarrass me,' Harville added. 'Don't be crying and embarrassing me,' Fisher said. 'And he'd also tell me [he would] say, 'Mom, you better suck it up.'' Fisher recounted her liver transplant last year and how much her son was there for her during that time. Boone McCrary and his dog 'Moss' (Photo: Laura Harville) Both McCrary's mother and sister are grateful that Boutin is alive and was able to be rescued. 'His life is precious and I told him that we're happy that he made it out because he was in dire straits, too,' Fisher said. 'And I seen him rescued, and I'm thankful that he was saved. So Boone made these decisions, but I know without a doubt if he knew the outcome, he would make that decision again to help somebody.' 'No doubt, there's no doubt in my mind that he would do it,' Harville added. Harville said she is starting a non-profit in the memory of her brother called 'Boone's Brigade.' The aim will be to help others learn outdoor skills, like hunting, fishing and boating. Activities that Boone McCrary enjoyed. McCrary was also an emergency room nurse at Greeneville Community East Hospital. Harville and Fisher are thankful for all of the community's support. Fisher also believes it would be helpful if local law enforcement had a liaison to help families of missing people. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

His property on Little Indian Creek Road consisted of three houses on a compound that belonged to him, his brother and his father. All three houses no longer stand. Belongings are scattered around the property, and many were washed away in the river. Eight vehicles are a total loss. Boutin spent 10 years, building his own home. He also never found his dog, Buddy. 'For four years, he was my best friend,' Boutin said. 'And he was just ripped from my arms and I couldn't do [anything].' David Boutin and his dog 'Buddy' (Photo: David Boutin) Boutin sustained physical injuries from the night he was stuck in flood waters. 'I went to the hospital the next day because I was getting headaches real bad,' Boutin said. 'And they said I had a concussion. I had a bruised chest and I also had a respiratory infection from the river. Still right now, I got migraines that won't go away. No medical insurance, so I can't go back to the doctor and get a follow-up.' Boutin has also been grappling with the mental toll of the devastation. 'I have nightmares of that night,' Boutin said. 'It’s hard, especially when the migraines wake [me] up in the morning. With bad migraines, but I still go to work. I have to, it’s the only way I’m going to rebuild. I just have to keep going one day at a time.' Boutin expressed his desire to return to his property in some way, perhaps in a camper, houseboat or any kind of home. However, he's still not sure. 'I love this place. It means everything to me,' Boutin said. 'I did everything I could to make this place nice. And just within minutes, everything got torn away. A lot of years of work.' Boutin is currently staying at his son's house in Morristown. He has a donation page set up to help rebuild his life.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/helene-survivor-guardian-angel/	2024-10-10T07:40:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/David-2.png?w=745

Nearly 300 emergency calls pending in Sarasota County after Milto...	(NewsNation) — Nearly 300 emergency calls were pending Thursday morning in Sarasota County, Florida, as first responders prepared to begin search-and-rescue efforts in the hours after Hurricane Milton’s landfall. Strong winds whipped by police headquarters and the area’s emergency center as workers fielded hundreds of calls related to the Category 3 hurricane, Sarasota County Sheriff Kurt Hoffman said. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat 'I’ve lived here over 40 years and 30 years in law enforcement in this community,' Hoffman told NewsNation on 'Morning in America.' 'This is the first time I’ve seen a mass exodus during a storm like this. You could tell from our interstate being backed up and, frankly, our roads were vacant of any traffic early on before the storm.' The county sent teams out at about 3 a.m. to check the streets. The main roadways were clear as of Thursday morning, despite some downed trees and power lines throughout the area, he said. Hoffman spoke with NewsNation before sunrise. Once daylight comes, crews will begin door-to-door outreach and search-and-rescue efforts, he said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

The time for cleanup between Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton was limited. Officials moved fast to clear what they could, but it’s unclear how much damage may have been caused by the significant amount of debris that collected on nearby barrier islands, Hoffman said. 'Certainly, with Helene and with (Hurricane) Debby, the folks here on this coast are just very tired of hurricanes, for sure,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-florida-sarasota-county/	2024-10-10T06:20:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176987645.jpg?w=900

Dan' and who went viral on social media for refusing to evacuate his boat ahead of Hurricane Milton has survived the storm. NewsNation's Brian Entin went to check on him late Wednesday night after the storm had swept through. 'I'm fine,' he told Entin. Video: Wind tears roof off Tropicana Field, home of the Rays Lt. Dan, whose real name is Joseph Malinowski, went viral from videos posted by TikTok user Tampa Terrence, which gained a large following of people who were worried because he refused to evacuate the sailboat where he was living. Like the popular character from 'Forrest Gump' who refused to leave his boat during a massive storm, Tampa's Lt. Dan is missing a leg. 'I'm not going anywhere because the safest place to be is on a boat in a flood,' he said ahead of the storm. 'We learned that with Noah. Everyone who stayed on land drowned.

However, the man continued to refuse to evacuate hours before Hurricane Milton was supposed to make landfall. 'You're all robots,' Malinowski said. 'You're all sheep, following the masses.' At a Wednesday midday press conference, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said Tampa police rescued 'Lt. Dan' and took him to a shelter that morning. However, he made it back to his boat by afternoon. 'He is here,' Entin said. 'He is definitely on the boat. We can see him. He keeps popping his head out, and I just saw his hand.' Milton barreled into the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after plowing across Florida, pounding cities with ferocious winds and rain, and whipping up a barrage of tornadoes. It compounded the misery wrought by Helene while sparing Tampa a direct hit.

Video: Hurricane Milton sucks water out of Tampa Bay	(NewsNation) — Tampa Bay experienced a rare reverse storm surge as Hurricane Milton made landfall Wednesday evening, temporarily drawing water out of the bay and exposing parts of the bay floor that are typically submerged. Video taken by NewsNation's Brian Entin showed the seawater heavily receding by Bayshore Boulevard. 'All the water has run out of the bay,' Entin said. This phenomenon occurs when strong winds blow offshore, forcing water out of coastal bays, as explained by Peter Stempel, an associate professor in landscape architecture at Penn State, in a 2022 blog post. But, the effect is temporary. Video: Massive 28-foot wave captured inside Hurricane Milton The Florida Division of Emergency Management warned people not to walk on the exposed bay floor because the water would eventually rush back in, posing life-threatening risks. Due to how dark it was Wednesday night, it was not known how much the water receded. Milton made landfall as a powerful Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, Florida, at about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Meteorologists feared that if Milton had hit Pinellas County directly, it would bring a life-threatening storm surge of up to 12 feet to the area. However, storm surge warnings remained in effect for several parts of Florida Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/video-hurricane-milton-sucks-water-out-of-tampa-bay/	2024-10-10T00:46:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/bay.jpg?w=900
Video: Wind tears roof off Tropicana Field, home of the Rays	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton made landfall in Siesta Key, south of St. Petersburg late Wednesday, and while the city avoided some of the worst storm surges, the local Major League ballpark took some damage. City officials confirmed high wind gusts from Hurricane Milton tore multiple panels off the roof of Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays.The field was not in use as a storm shelter but functioned as a staging area for storm response crews, according to the Associated Press. It was not clear Wednesday night how much damage the interior of the building had suffered. The stadium opened in 1990 and initially cost $138 million. It was due to be replaced in time for the 2026 season with a $1.3 billion ballpark, according to AP. Additionally, the city confirmed a crane collapsed onto an office building near Central Avenue. No injuries have been reported due to either incident, according to city officials as of midnight. Officials urged the public to stay sheltered in place overnight and avoid both areas until further notice. According to WFLA Chief Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli, St. Pete saw peak wind gusts of 91 MPH, among the highest in the Tampa Bay area after Milton made landfall. Other areas seeing peak wind gusts include Sarasota Bradenton International Airport (102 MPH), Egmont Channel (105 MPH), and Clearwater Beach (90 MPH), according to Berardelli.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/video-wind-tears-roof-off-tropicana-field-home-of-the-rays/	2024-10-10T00:36:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hailey_img_2024-10-09_11-24-44.jpeg?w=589
Live Updates: Milton pummels Florida as Cat 1 Hurricane	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton has brought vast amounts of flooding, damage and debris to much of the Florida peninsula Thursday morning after it made landfall as a Category 3 Hurricane Wednesday evening. As of 11 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said a 'large area of life-threatening storm surge' was occurring along portions of the West-Central coast of the state and that heavy rainfall throughout Thursday would continue to bring the risk of 'catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding.' A couple hours later, Milton was downgraded to a Category 1 Hurricane as it continued to slam its way across the state.

Hurricanes’ potentially deadly legacy: Flesh-eating bacteria	(NewsNation) — The water that Hurricane Milton leaves behind may be just as deadly as the winds and storm surge, according to infectious disease experts. Flesh-eating bacteria is out there and looking for a way into your body. 'Within the waters, we find this vibrio ... it’s actually a bacteria. And bacteria can be ingested in the water,' said Dr. Norman Beatty, with the infectious diseases division at the University of Florida. 'Most of the time, what we see after a hurricane is we have volunteers or homeowners are out, and they are cleaning up the mess. They’re out in the storm surge waters. And that vibrio bacteria is penetrating through the skin. You step on a nail, slice your leg, you get an open wound and the bacteria gets in,' Beatty said. Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage Beatty told NewsNation’s 'Banfield' that flesh-eating bacteria took quite a toll two years ago after Hurricane Ian. 'There were 38 confirmed cases right after the storm, and at least 11 people died,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/hurricanes-legacy-flesh-eating-bacteria/	2024-10-09T21:48:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2174887918.jpg?w=900
Post-Milton gas in Florida will be a challenge: GasBuddy founder	(NewsNation) — A lot of gas stations in western Florida have run out of gas and getting them restocked once Hurricane Milton passes won’t happen overnight, said an expert who tracks gasoline prices nationwide. 'Almost a quarter of gas stations in Florida don’t have gasoline,' said Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at the gasoline analysis site GasBuddy. 'In Tampa … 63% of stations don’t have gasoline right now,' he told NewsNation’s 'CUOMO.' Once the storm passes, De Haan said it could be a few days, or it could be two or three weeks, before every gas station in western Florida can fill up. ‘Multiple fatalities’ at senior community after tornado outbreak in Florida: reports 'It’s not like these outages are going to just magically going to solve themselves. There are still a lot of complications from this storm.' He said that those complications involve the main gasoline gateway for most of the Gulf side of Florida, he said. 'A lot of it’s going to be contingent on the Port of Tampa and Port Manatee. Potentially, there could be damage. The Coast Guard’s going to have to do assessments to see if those ports can accept shipments of barges from Texas and Louisiana refineries,' said De Haan. Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage He added that, in the rest of the U.S., gas prices are beginning to stabilize following four years of downs and ups, starting with demand plunging during the COVID pandemic then surging in the first months of the Russia-Ukraine war. 'Now, a couple of years into this, we’ve seen a little bit of normalization happening. The U.S. is still producing a record level of crude oil. The U.S. is still the world’s largest energy producer, and that’s part of the reason why gas prices have gotten closer to what many Americans consider normal,' said De Haan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/post-milton-florida-gas-challenge-gasbuddy-founder/	2024-10-09T21:22:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176921951.jpg?w=900
Multiple fatalities' at senior community after tornado outbreak ...	Related video: St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office facility damaged by tornado FORT PIERCE, Fla. (WFLA) — Multiple people were killed at a senior community as Hurricane Milton spawned tornadoes in Florida, according to local reports. The fatalities occurred at the Spanish Lakes Country Club in Fort Pierce, the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office confirmed to NBC affiliate WPTV and ABC affiliate WPBF. However, it's unclear how many people were killed. Dozens of agencies, including the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, responded to the community where dozens of homes are being searched as search and rescue operations are currently underway. Flash flood warnings issued for coastal areas in Milton’s path 'We have dozens of homes in St. Lucie County that have been damaged, some catastrophic damage,' St. Lucie County spokesman Erick Gill told WPTV. 'We are working with the St. Lucie County Fire District ... National Guard, as well as units from the sheriff's office and even first responders from surrounding counties to help with search and rescue.' Gill said the goal is to help survivors and do damage assessment. TikToker ‘Lieutenant Dan’ says he’s riding out Milton on his boat 'We have three shelters that were already open, but we're looking at converting another school to a fourth shelter to take care of those who may have been displaced by the tornadoes that ripped through our area this afternoon,' Gill said. Gov. Ron DeSantis said there have been 116 tornado warnings with 19 confirmed touch downs. Kevin Guthrie, the director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said about 125 homes were destroyed statewide, mostly mobile homes in senior communities. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Siesta Key as a Category 3 storm around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/multiple-fatalities-at-senior-community-after-tornado-outbreak-in-florida-reports/	2024-10-09T20:27:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1889004791-e1709502647468_d84f8c.jpg?w=800
Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton could result in losses of up to $100 billion for the global insurance industry, creating a surge in 2025 reinsurance prices that could boost some insurance companies' shares, analysts said on Wednesday. The hurricane is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida late on Wednesday or early Thursday. It is potentially one of the most destructive to hit the region, which is recovering from Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago. Analysts at Jefferies estimated a mid-double-digit billion-dollar insured loss would follow a major hurricane impact in one of Florida's most heavily populated regions. ‘Not so confident in my decision’: Tampa woman to ride out Milton 'A 1-in-100-year event is estimated by some to result in $175 billion in losses for landfall in the Tampa region and $70 billion in losses in the Fort Myers region,' they wrote in a note, outlining an extreme scenario. Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics, told NewsNation that Milton could cause damage similar to that of Hurricane Katrina. 'Just for context, do you remember Hurricane Katrina, that was the 2005 Category 5 that hit Louisiana? That cost $160 billion in today's dollars, and that includes the property damage — both insured and uninsured.' Zandi said that the federal government will ultimately step in and help those impacted by the storm. 'The insured loss is ultimately covered by the federal government,' he said. 'So the federal government has been coming in and making everyone whole — ultimately whole. I mean, obviously, what the damage this creates is enormous to people, but the economic damage is made whole by the federal government.'

Milton has a ‘really bad feel to it,’ says Florida man riding out...	PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla., (NewsNation) — A Pinellas County man tells NewsNation that while he’s lived in Florida for many years, Hurricane Milton has a particularly ominous feeling about it. 'We're starting to get some of the outer bands,' said Harry Berg, a local resident and uncle of NewsNation meteorologist Max Tsaparis. 'This storm has got a really bad feel to it — and I've been here for many years.' Berg said his decision not to evacuate the area doesn’t mean he isn’t taking the storm seriously. But it’s part of 'being a Floridian.' Floridians told to shelter in place as Milton approaches 'You have to prepare for this. What we're getting ready to face is something that we've never seen before, the likes of this … to make a long story short, you just have to make sure you're repaired.' Berg said his primary concern at the moment is wind. He added that if conditions become too dangerous by Wednesday afternoon they will 'seek shelter.' 'We have hurricane-proof windows, we’re boarded up correctly, we have enough rations, we have generators, we have everything,' he said. The National Hurricane Center has predicted Milton will likely weaken, but remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/pinellas-county-man-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-09T13:44:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176991288.jpg?w=724
‘Not so confident in my decision’: Tampa woman to ride out Milton	TAMPA, Fla. (NewsNation) — Morgan Roos, a Tampa resident who has decided not to evacuate the area ahead of Hurricane Milton, tells NewsNation she is having second thoughts about staying. Roos, who has 650,000 followers on TikTok and nearly 10,000 on Instagram, said she’s only recently moved to the area from Colorado. 'I am directly on the riverfront,' Roos told NewsNation. 'I am standing in front of my windows right now, and I would say, maybe 200 feet away is the Hillsborough River. I was here during Helene. I decided to wait that one out, and I watched the water rise, but it only came up on the Riverwalk. And now I am not feeling so confident in my decision.' ‘You are going to die’: Tampa mayor warns against ignoring Milton evacuation orders Roos said she’s not currently looking for a shelter for a variety of reasons. 'Truthfully, no,' she said. 'And the reason I say no is because I've got two dogs with me; got my mom here. The only sense of community I have here in Florida are people who live in my building, and they're all hunkering in together. So we're going to pull resources and go that way.' Roos said while she believes the city is prepared and that Gov. Ron DeSantis has been doing a 'great job,' she’s concerned about how the community will fare following back-to-back crises with Helene and Milton. 'The thing that scares me the most is just the fact that Helene hit two weeks ago,' she said. 'When I've been driving like, up and down the residential neighborhoods, there's debris stacked like eight feet high. I know that the governor has been doing a great job ... but it does scare me.' Hurricane Milton: Where will zoo animals go? Despite not being a native Floridian, Roos thinks she’s as prepared as can be expected. 'I think I really, really, really underestimated this,' she said. 'But I have four cases of water. My neighbors told me they have a bunch of flashlights. I have food, I've got a propane tank. I did everything that the internet told me to do. I just didn't get a flashlight in time.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/morgan-roos-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-09T11:56:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-5.jpg?w=900

Milton evacuations spark traffic jams, fuel shortages	MIAMI (NewsNation) — As hundreds of thousands of Floridians flee the Gulf Coast, some are finding themselves in traffic backups and gas stations with empty fuel pumps. It’s estimated that nearly 25% of the state’s gas stations are out of fuel ahead of Hurricane Milton. Some of Florida's major highways, including Interstate 75 and Interstate Four have been seeing major backups and delays on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Florida Department of Transportation, in some instances, has opened up shoulder lanes of some of those major highways to try and speed up evacuations. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has assured people that his administration is working to bring emergency supplies into the state, with some fuel trucks even being escorted by law enforcement. The time to evacuate and get that fuel to people who need it is running out. LOOK: Tornado crosses Florida interstate as Hurricane Milton churns closer 'It's been, I would say, a tremendous task to get gas,' said Ralph Douglas, a resident of Ruskin, Florida. 'Because right now, if you drive from different areas, like during the course of the day, it was difficult because when you drive by, people don't have any gas.' Some hotels across the state are also filling up with evacuees. Booking.com says 98% of the hotels in Tallahassee are booked through next Wednesday. The mayor of Jacksonville said hotels in their downtown are full. Those who have been able to find a room say they were especially concerned about a life-threatening storm surge, the expected widespread power outages, and of course, this back-to-back hit from hurricanes.

Speaker Johnson to discuss Helene damage in North Carolina	(NewsNation) —Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is in Western North Carolina touring the damage done by Hurricane Helene. Johnson is expected to criticize the federal response to the disaster when he speaks in the Biltmore Village neighborhood of Asheville, one of the hardest-hit areas of the city. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved through the Southeast, but heavy rains and winds downed trees and brought massive flooding to towns in the Blue Ridge mountains. When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida? Many in the area remain without power or water more than a week after the storm, with smaller communities cut off thanks to damaged or washed-out roads. The damage to the region is extensive, with homes and businesses demolished and entire towns like Chimney Rock and Hot Springs virtually destroyed. Areas along the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers fared the worst, including the historic Biltmore Village, a popular tourist area located near the Biltmore Estate, which remains closed to visitors. Residents Jacqueline Twohig and Doug Frieders saw the river rising and got out just in time. Their neighbors were not so fortunate, and videos showed their condo floating down the flooded river. 'All of your memories, your whole life, everything you’ve built, just crashing in the blink of an eye,' Twohig said. 'Thinking, we could have been in there, like if I didn’t get up because I was feeling hot and going to turn on the fan, we could have been in there until it was too late. Just like the others were.' As Hurricane Milton heads toward the U.S., the coast is gearing up for another devastating storm, impacting recovery efforts for an area where people are still reeling from Helene. Volunteer groups have organized relief efforts, including the self-described 'Redneck Air Force' made up of volunteers who are mostly former military. Sheriff condemns ‘sightseers’ visiting Helene flood-torn areas Many of them were in special operations and are now using helicopters to deliver aid to people in need in remote areas. Some in the group have said they haven't seen enough federal help on the ground. Local officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have pushed back on what they have called misleading claims about the response to Helene, saying there are hundreds of people on the ground and millions of assistance already approved. Former Green Beret Adam Smith leads a team of hundreds and fears the Appalachian region will be forgotten after Milton hits. 'All the news interest is going to go to Florida and it’s going to disappear from this location,' he said. 'As soon as that happens, the people of Western North Carolina are going to be standing here holding the bag because we haven’t had federal assistance, because we haven’t had federal funding, because that money’s not moving.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/johnson-speak-helene-nc/	2024-10-09T10:36:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2174585773.jpg?w=900
Honda recalls about 1.7 million vehicles over steering issue	(WJET/WFXP) – Honda is recalling nearly 1.7 million vehicles in the U.S. over a steering issue that could result in a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Wednesday. The automobile company found that the assembly of the steering gearbox — which contains gears that help turn the vehicle's tires — may have been manufactured improperly, which could lead to excessive friction and difficulty steering. Warning signs include an unusual noise and/or a momentary 'sticky' feeling when turning the steering wheel while driving. Over 129K newer Ram trucks recalled over faulty turn signals The affected vehicles include: 2023-2025 Acura Integra 2024-2025 Acura Integra Type S 2022-2025 Honda Civic and Honda Civic Hatchback 2025 Honda Civic Hatchback Hybrid 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid 2023-2025 Honda Civic Type-R 2023-2025 CR-V 2025 Honda CR-V Fuel Cell EV 2023-2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid 2023-2025 Honda HR-V If your vehicle is affected by the recall, an authorized Honda dealer will replace the worm gear spring free of charge, and either 'redistribute or add grease' as needed. Owners will also receive a mailed notification expected to be sent out on Nov. 18.

Sheriff condemns 'sightseers' visiting Helene flood-torn areas	UNICOI, Tenn. (WJHL) — Unicoi County Sheriff Mike Hensley told NewsNation affiliate WJHL this week that visitors coming to the flood-torn county in Tennessee to sightsee have complicated recovery efforts and are beginning to endanger workers and themselves. 'I know everybody wants to look and I understand that,' he said. 'But we're doing work. We're still in the recovery process. We've got power lines down, gas lines, fiber optic cable. We got a multitude of utilities working.' Hensley said he was near Yancey County, North Carolina Tuesday morning, where he had to escort people to the state line who were not from the area and looking around to 'see what they could pick up.'

They [were] not related to anyone over there, more or less just looking around to see what they could pick up, and there was no criminal charges placed, but they did escort them to the state line.' Sheriff Hensley said he and his deputies are going to speak with people they see out and ask them to state their business to try to control the overwhelming amount of people entering the county for non-essential reasons. 'We're going to talk to these folks and see if they have relatives here in Unicoi County. If they have no business here, we're going to escort them on their way. We're not going to put up with looting and stealing of these flood victims, not for one second.' Hensley said one reason his office is trying to remove sightseers is because many different types of crews are hard at work restoring utilities and providing emergency services. He said many wires, poles, debris and more potentially dangerous items are still scattered around the flood area. 'If they don't have no business in these areas, not related, not help and not with any organization, they need to leave. And that's what I stand on up here.' Another reason is that it's causing unnecessary traffic, backing up already-narrowed roadways that are locals' only option right now.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/helene-flooding-sheriff-condemns-sightseers-tennessee/	2024-10-09T08:34:33-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-08-164619.png?w=900
Cruz leading Allred by 3 points in Texas Senate race: poll	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, holds a 3-point lead over his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, according to a new poll. The Florida Atlantic University (FAU) survey, conducted by Mainstreet Research, shows that among registered voters in the state, Cruz garners 46% support compared to Allred's 43%. About 11% of respondents also said they were undecided. When asked which candidate respondents would vote for if the election were held today, the incumbent maintained his 3-point lead over Allred, 47% to 44%, the data shows.

Hurricane Milton: Where will zoo animals go?	(NewsNation) — Florida residents aren’t the only ones bracing for Hurricane Milton — penguins, flamingos, rhinos and other Zoo animals across the must also find shelter to weather the storm. Ron Magill, director of communications for Zoo Miami, joined 'Morning in America' on Wednesday to explain how those decisions are made and which animals, if any, zoo staff may evacuate. Milton’s intensity has gone back and forth throughout the week. It’s expected to make landfall either Wednesday night or Thursday morning as a Category 5 hurricane, according to National Hurricane Center forecasts. When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida? 'I’m deeply worried,' Magill said. 'When you talk about Tampa Zoo, the Florida aquarium — these are places that are so exposed right now to this monstrous storm. Having lived through Andrew and Wilma here in Miami when we were devastated by those storms, I can only just imagine what’s going to happen up there.'

The storm’s high winds and surging water could put smaller animals who are usually in outdoor settings at the greatest risk. Aquariums also face potential challenges. The hurricane could disable tank filtration systems, which Magill called the 'life-support' for fish and other aquatic animals. 'A misconception people have about zoos and aquariums is that we evacuate animals (and) that we send them to another location,' Magill said. 'That rarely — if ever — happens. What we do in zoos and aquariums is we take the more susceptible animals like birds and smaller mammals and we will take them and put them in small sky kennels, like what you transport them in on an airplane, and then put those kennels in fortified buildings within the zoo property.' 'When you move animals, the stress you put on them sometimes is more dangerous than the storm itself,' Magill said. Live: Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall The animals won’t be left alone. All accredited zoos have a team that stays on the grounds 24/7, Magill said. Some attractions like Zoo Miami also have what’s called a lethal response team — a group that, armed with rifles, would sweep the park after the storm to make sure every animal is where it should be, Magill said. 'The No. 1 priority is safety for the public by ensuring that these animals are still secure and then afterwards, clearing a way to get to them to take care of them,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-where-zoo-animals-go/	2024-10-09T08:00:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/11/4535f8b9858e41fc90a7814df93853ce.jpg?w=900
Helene spurs IV fluid shortage. Milton could make it worse	(The Hill) -- Hospitals across the U.S. are feeling the impact of Hurricane Helene as experts warn of an imminent intravenous (IV) solution shortage due to the temporary shutdown of a facility in North Carolina. And Hurricane Milton’s approach could worsen the problem, with another key IV fluid manufacturing facility located along its potential path in Florida. Baxter International’s IV fluid manufacturing facility in Marion, North Carolina, supplied roughly 60 percent of the IV solution used by hospitals in the U.S. every day until Helene temporarily halted operations. Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall While what remained at Baxter’s facility has begun to be shipped out, production may not restart for another week or two. The company says its global plants are ramping up production in response. Just a week after Helene dissipated, hospitals say they’re already beginning to feel the strain of Baxter’s temporary halt in production. Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA), told The Hill that hospitals nationwide that rely on Baxter have been told to expect 40 percent of their normal shipments of IV solution. 'And that's all that will be available to them until the situation begins to improve,' she said. According to Foster, this means that hospitals will have to think conservatively in terms of how they use IV fluids, prioritizing certain patients who 'absolutely need' those solutions and utilizing alternative methods for others. She noted 17 different products were manufactured at the North Carolina plant, mostly different types of saline but also products like ringer’s lactate, which support patients’ bodily function. The AHA has called on the Biden administration to declare a shortage of IV solutions, both so that hospitals can prepare IV solutions in their own pharmacies and to signal to health care providers that they must conserve their supply. Concerns are culminating just as Milton is set to make landfall in Florida this week. B. Braun, another top IV solution manufacturer in the U.S., has a facility in Daytona Beach, Florida. Both federal officials and the company are well aware that the plant is within Milton’s expected path. A spokesperson for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) said it is coordinating with B. Braun 'to move their product out of the path of the storm and facilitate other activities that will mitigate potential impacts on future distribution.' B. Braun’s Daytona Beach facility was not affected by Hurricane Helene. It is closing its Florida manufacturing plant and distribution center Wednesday morning in anticipation of Milton, with plans to resume operations on Friday, Oct. 11. Alli Longenhagen, director of corporate communications at B. Braun, confirmed her company is working with ASPR to transfer its Florida inventory to a 'secure, temperature-controlled facility, north of Florida.' 'Once the storm passes, the product will return to the distribution center,' said Longenhagen. 'The Daytona Beach facility is a key part of our plan to help address the shutdown of Baxter’s IV solutions manufacturing facility in North Carolina,' Longenhagen added. 'In partnership with ASPR, we are taking immediate steps to increase production of critical IV fluids at our plant in Irvine, CA, and will resume this plan at Daytona Beach following Hurricane Milton’s departure.' Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., has called on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to further strengthen supply chains to prevent an IV fluid shortage. 'Natural disasters often have effects beyond the horrific destruction and loss of life throughout the southeastern part of our country,' Dingell said in a letter to HHS. 'This supply chain disruption is a grave reminder of the interconnection of our government and society — maintaining communication and cooperating through these adversities is the best solution to care for our communities.' According to a senior Biden administration official, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering potential options to address the issue, including temporary imports and expedited reviews. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) said in a statement Tuesday that it backed the plan for expedited importation from foreign plants. The ASHP had a meeting with the FDA and the White House to discuss the looming issue in which the organization said it called for 'temporary flexibility' on FDA requirements like inspections, limits on compounding and an extension on expiration dates for IV fluids and peritoneal dialysis solutions. In cases of IV solution shortage, hospitals have contingency plans in place, but Foster noted that the traditional course of action is usually to ask other hospitals to share their supplies. This plan doesn’t work when the supplier is out of commission. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'It's this taking out of the source that’s created the real challenge for hospitals and others regarding the use of these IV solutions right now,' said Foster. Another measure being considered to mitigate a shortage is to have other manufacturers ramp up production. ICU Medical, a major IV solutions manufacturer, said it was unaffected by Helene and continues to operate as normal. 'We are continuing to collaborate with government agencies while actively monitoring potential increases in demand for IV solutions and have already taken necessary steps to increase production to help meet market needs while continuing to support our existing customers,' it said in an emailed statement. The incoming respiratory viral season adds an additional layer of pressure on hospitals. Hospitalizations go up as flu, RSV and COVID spread, and ensuring that hospitalized patients remain sufficiently hydrated is a key part of treatment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-iv-fluid-shortage-milton-helene/	2024-10-09T07:02:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/IV_drip_AP-e1728479561815.jpg?w=800
Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton was reclassified a Category 4 storm Wednesday morning but remained two miles per hour of wind gust away from Category 5 status. Millions along the coast remain under evacuation orders, packing roads, draining gas stations and getting out of town before Milton's anticipated landfall Wednesday night. Milton threatens to deliver storm surges up to 15 feet on the Gulf Coast, catastrophic flooding and destructive winds. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged Florida residents in danger zones to leave ahead of Hurricane Milton’s arrival, especially since the National Hurricane Center said it could be one of the most destructive storms to ever hit the area. How Waffle House helps Southerners judge a storm's severity President Joe Biden on Tuesday noted the rapid intensification of the storm earlier this week when it went from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in a day. It was downgraded to a Category 4 early Tuesday before ramping back up to a Category 5 later in the afternoon. It is expected to be powerful when it makes landfall in Florida near the Tampa Bay area. 'Get out now while you can,' National Hurricane Center Director Dr. Michael Brennan said in a live update streamed by the organization. Brennan emphasized that you need to only travel tens of miles rather than hundreds to find safety, and that attempting to evacuate too late has led to deaths in previous hurricanes. The latest National Hurricane Center forecast has the storm crossing over the entire state of Florida and entering the Atlantic Ocean by Thursday evening. Tracking Hurricane Milton The hurricane was about 300 miles southwest of Tampa as of 7:30 a.m. ET Wednesday moving at 14 mph. With Milton, forecasters warned of a possible 10- to 15-foot storm surge in Tampa Bay. It is the highest surge ever predicted for that location and has led to evacuation orders for communities all along the coast. Communities hit hard by Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago have been working day and night to remove the debris from their homes before Milton makes landfall with the potential to turn wrecked furniture into projectiles. 'I went through Katrina, and that was mainly winds that destroyed everything. And everything's a projectile out here right now because everybody's house is in the front yard, and so all of this is going to be pretty much missiles coming through if it's the amount of wind that's going through with this hurricane coming in,' New Port Richey resident Scott Pepperman said. Milton remains on track to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in over a century, the National Weather Service in Tampa Bay said. The region has become home to more than 3 million people and is one of the most vulnerable metropolitan areas in the U.S. to storm surge. New Zillow feature: Climate risk data added to home listings DeSantis has warned Floridians that the hurricane could 'wobble,' meaning it could hit at any point whether it is north of Tampa, Tampa, or south of Tampa. 'Wherever it makes landfall, there’s going to be impacts far beyond what the cone actually shows,' DeSantis said. It reached an incredibly low pressure Tuesday night, which generally correlates with a storm’s strength. The lower a system’s pressure, the stronger the hurricane. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains. Why should you fill your bathtub before a hurricane?

Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills dozens and thre...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed and wounded dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday. Heavy fighting is underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces have carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year. The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, comes as Israel expands a weeklong ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran. Residents of Jabaliya, a refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle militants in the streets. 'It’s like hell. We can’t get out,' said Mohamed Awda, who lives with his parents and six siblings. He said there were three bodies in the street outside his home that could not be retrieved because of the fighting. 'The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,' he told The Associated Press by phone, speaking over the sound of explosions. Dozens have been killed and survivors fear displacement Gaza's Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. There are likely more bodies under rubble and in areas that can't be accessed, it said. An airstrike in Jabaliya early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Residents of Jabaliya fear Israel’s aim is to depopulate the north and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement. Israel has blocked all roads except for the main highway leading from Jabaliya to the south, according to residents. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it was evacuating seven schools that were being used as shelters and that only two of eight water wells in the camp are still functioning. 'We are concerned about the displacement to the south,' Ahmed Qamar, who lives in Jabaliya with his wife, children and parents, said in a text message. 'People here say clearly that they will die here in northern Gaza and and won’t go to southern Gaza.' Hospitals are under threat Fadel Naeem, the director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it had received dozens of wounded people and bodies from the north. 'We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable,' told AP in a text message. Israel’s offensive has gutted Gaza’s health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning. Naeem said three hospitals farther north — Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to 'prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts' and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions over the weekend, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps. The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They are still holding around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel warns Lebanon that it could end up like Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of all the captives. On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet the same fate as Gaza if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,' Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people. An Israeli strike killed four people and wounded another 10 at a hotel sheltering displaced people in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyeh on Wednesday, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms from Israeli jets before the strike. Plumes of smoke rose from the building after the explosion. In recent weeks Israel has waged a heavy air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. A series of strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. So far, ground operations appear to be focused on a narrow strip along the border, but Israel has warned people to evacuate dozens of cities and towns, many of them north of a buffer zone declared by the United Nations after the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Hezbollah's acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Tuesday that the group has replaced its slain commanders and was preventing Israeli ground forces from advancing. The militants have extended their rocket fire deeper into Israel, disrupting life but causing few casualties. The Israeli military said Wednesday that Hezbollah has fired more than 12,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since the start of the hostilities last year. Israel is meanwhile considering options for a strike on Iran that could potentially escalate the war on yet another front. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a wave of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for the killing of top militants from both groups. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

WATCH: Las Vegas bids farewell to the Tropicana with a spectacula...	LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The seconds ticked away early Wednesday morning until the husk of the Tropicana Las Vegas resort, deserted since its April 2024 closing date, would meet a final and spectacular end, bringing to a close the era of the 67-year-old structure once a bastion for visitors from across the country. The Las Vegas classic was set to come down in style with a seven-minute celebration involving 550 drones and 150 'pyrodrones' counting down to the controlled demolition of the resort originally erected in 1957. Phil Grucci, CEO and president of Fireworks by Grucci, previewed the celebration ahead of the demolition, revealing that the show will feature images of the Tropicana logo, the iconic 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign, and a tribute to the Athletics franchise, whose proposed $1.5 billion, 33,000-seat ballpark could open in the footprint of the former Tropicana in time for the 2028 season.

In July, Bally's, the company that controlled most of the site, entered into a merger agreement with its top stockholder, Standard General. A total of 917,400 square feet will be imploded with the use of nearly 2,200 pounds of explosives. The demolition sequence will begin with the implosion of the 23-story Paradise Tower and end with the implosion of the 23-story Club Tower. It’s expected both buildings will collapse within 22 seconds after the implosion button is pressed, according to the Bally’s Corporation news release. Tropicana Las Vegas opened in 1957.

Report names 'Immaculate Constellation' UAP program: Journalist	(NewsNation) — A leaked whistleblower report says the Pentagon is operating a secret UFO retrieval program called 'Immaculate Constellation,' according to independent journalist Michael Shellenberger. The report revealed for the first time the name of an alleged UAP program, stating that the executive branch has been managing UAP issues without congressional knowledge or oversight, possibly for decades. Shellenberger told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart he has been in touch with the whistleblower, whose exact role and other identifying details, including gender, he has withheld because they fear what could happen if they were publicly known. Earth’s temporary 2nd moon has arrived: What you need to know 'I don't think that they're faking it or that they're lying about their fear,' he said. 'This person discovered this material accidentally. This was not something they had expected to encounter.' That fear is why Shellenberger said the whistleblower did not share intelligence imagery showing UAPs. The unnamed whistleblower said the Department of Defense created 'Immaculate Constellation' in 2017 after a New York Times report revealed another program known as the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The whistleblower report cites evidence, including allegations about UAP sightings collected by the Pentagon and intelligence documenting firsthand encounters with UAPs or UFOs that are kept in a database used by the intelligence community. The report is also said to describe various UAPs in detail, including one where orbs surrounded an F-22 and forced it out of its patrol area and one where the crew of a Navy aircraft saw an orange-red sphere descend from a high altitude, after which they described a sense of unease and feeling as if they'd snapped out of a trance. Pentagon historically denies reports of UAP programs The Pentagon has long denied claims that there is any evidence to indicate any nonhuman, alien or extraterrestrial intelligence has visited Earth. In a May report, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) said reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) are the result of mistaken identification of drones, top-secret projects or other known aerial objects. AARO said longstanding claims that the Pentagon is secretly studying UAPs are a result of 'circular reporting' from a group of people who believe the rumor to be true despite a lack of evidence. Could a drug used in organ transplants slow aging? Rumors about the government and unidentified objects have existed since the end of World War II and the famed Roswell incident of 1947. Believers pointed to errors in the report and cast doubt on the validity of the claims. Skeptics, on the other hand, have said persistent rumors about government UFO programs are a result of government disinformation and social contagion like the 'Satanic Panic' of the 1980s. 'This new whistleblower is not part of that circular reporting,' Shellenberger said. 'I am confident of that. This person did not know the other individuals who verified the name of this program. It does not fit the theory of social contagion.' Those who have suggested we need to look more closely at UAPs include high-ranking officials like former Assistant Secretary of Defense Christopher Mellon and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, even if they stop short of saying UAPs are alien in nature. Recent UAP reports In 2023, former Air Force officer David Grusch reignited interest in UAPs by claiming a secret UAP retrieval program was being operated by the Pentagon without the public or Congress being aware. His statements sparked a congressional hearing on the subject and a bipartisan UAP Caucus formed in the House of Representatives, with lawmakers seeking to understand what programs exist and how the Pentagon would be funding alleged UAP efforts. How can I protect my social security number from hackers and scams? Others have since come forward with their own stories, including former military intelligence officer Luis Elizondo and retired Army Col. Karl Nell. Lawmakers from both parties have come forward to press the Defense Department for more transparency and have said the earlier hearing was not the last the public can expect to see on UAPs. 'No justification has been given for this level of secrecy,' Shellenberger said, noting that efforts to discredit those who have come forward to speak about UAPs have ruined people's lives. He also recommended whistleblowers approach journalists or congressional staffers, saying that protections for whistleblowers who go to AARO or the inspector generals for defense or intelligence are not adequate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/report-immaculate-constellation-uap-journalist/	2024-10-08T11:51:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/AARO-UAPS-sighting-Nexstar-4212023.png?w=900
Redneck Air Force' delivers aid to North Carolina mountains	(NewsNation) — In Swannanoa, North Carolina, a group calling themselves the 'Redneck Air Force' is helping deliver aid to mountain areas affected by Hurricane Helene. The home base for the group looks like a central command for disaster relief, but it’s all being run by volunteers, mostly retired special ops. They are choppering aid into the mountains, and volunteers with the group said they haven’t seen FEMA or federal help. Milton ‘could be the worst storm to hit Florida in over a century’: Biden After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene weakened as it traveled up the southeast. Western North Carolina was particularly hit hard by the storm, which dumped record amounts of rain on communities built in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains. The region surrounding Asheville, North Carolina, was virtually cut off, with hundreds of roads washed out or impassable and cell phone service down. More than a week after the storm hit, thousands are still without power or water with no firm timeline given for restoration. NewsNation’s Rich McHugh went up with the group, flying over the popular tourist destination of Chimney Rock, which has been almost completely devastated by Helene. Helicopters come into the volunteer group’s headquarters to load up with supplies and fly aid in to those still in the area. FEMA held a press conference on the disaster response, with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushing back against what the agency has characterized as misinformation about the response. Brother of missing Tennessee man still searching for answers Officials in the area have said it’s making it more difficult for the agency to help people. 'People that have been impacted are afraid to apply for the assistance, that they can then get a hotel room. If I can’t get them to apply, I can’t get them the assistance,' Criswell said. 'I've heard rumors that if you take our $750 and don't pay it back, we're going to take your home. Absolutely false.' But the men and women running the Redneck Air Force say they have found FEMA’s response lacking. '[It’s] incompetent, if we’re talking about, broadly speaking, limited-to-no personnel,' said Adam Smith, former Green Beret. 'Once they did get here, they put themselves in positions, obviously, to make connections, create rapport, but in the process, there’s not been much dedicated assistance or support. I’ve not seen one FEMA individual come through this location. I’ve not seen one FEMA truck in this town.' James Taylor, Luke Combs, Eric Church to take part in Helene relief concert Aaron Switzer, who was part of Air Force Special Operations before he retired, said FEMA is taking too long to get aid out. 'These guys are coming in trying to figure out what the problem is and who’s in charge while we’re solving the problems,' Switzer said. 'People don’t care what’s going to happen two weeks from now when they’re starving. They need food, they need water, they need warmth. They need somebody to give them a hug and say, what do you need? They don’t need a government official to say we’re here, and we’re going to fix this.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/redneck-air-force-aid-north-carolina/	2024-10-08T11:40:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175400595.jpg?w=900
How can I protect my social security number from hackers and scam...	(NewsNation) — It's important to keep your personal information under lock and key — evidenced by a recent hacking operation that compromised nearly three billion personal records, including social security numbers. The theft happened in April, according to a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A hacking group known as USDoD reportedly stole the records from National Public Data, which offers personal information to employers, private investigators and others who do background checks. Credit card rates hit historic highs as banks raise fees Regularly checking your credit for suspicious loans or payments can help identify fraudulent activity, but the best defense is a good offense. Here's how to stay proactive about protecting sensitive information and what to do if it's it's already been compromised. Protect your SSN before it’s compromised It’s best not to carry your social security card on you. Instead, keep it in a safe, secure place, and don’t give out your social security number freely. Regularly changing your passwords, setting unique, hard-to-guess passwords for different accounts, and using multi-factor authentication can also reduce the risk of hackers accessing your information. Even with those precautions in place, scammers may reach out pretending to be Social Security employees. The Social Security Administration will never: Threaten you with arrest or legal action because you don’t make an immediate payment Suspend your social security number Request personal information or payment to activate a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) or other benefit increase Pressure you to share personal information or take immediate action Ask you to pay with gift cards, prepaid debit cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash mail. Threaten to seize your bank account Offer to move your money Demand secrecy Message you directly on social media If you receive a suspicious call, text or email regarding your social security information, hang up and file a report if necessary. Which students were most affected by 2024 FAFSA glitch? What do I do if my SSN was stolen? There are several places to consider filing reports if someone has stolen your social security card or your number has been compromised. Filing a police report and keeping a copy of your records can help if problems arise after your SSN is compromised. You can visit IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877IDTHEFT (4338) to make a report with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and find information about recovery plans. You may also want to file a report with the Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov. The center receives and refers cybercrime complaints to law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Notifying one of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) freezing your credit and setting up fraud alert can further protect your credit. Whichever company you contact must notify the others. Finally, notifying the IRS can help prevent someone from using your social security number to file a tax return and try to get their hands on your refund.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/protect-my-social-security-number-hackers-scams/	2024-10-08T08:20:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/AP24079459358377-e1723750930822.jpg?w=800
San Antonio firefighters worried after Tren de Aragua arrests	(NewsNation) — The presence of Tren de Aragua gang members in San Antonio has raised alarms, especially among first responders who may be at risk while on the job. San Antonio Professional Firefighters Association President Joe Jones sent a memo warning first responders to 'keep your heads on a swivel and watch your six' for gang members, meaning to stay alert and watch their backs. Several gang members were arrested Saturday in San Antonio during a multiagency raid on an apartment complex. People involved with the Venezuelan gang have been illegally entering the United States and have been arrested for committing crimes in various parts of the country. Diddy accuser’s lawyer: Combs used oil, knife How are police, firefighters responding to Tren de Aragua presence? San Antonio Police Chief Bill McManus vowed to crack down on the gang’s presence in the south-central Texas city. The firefighters union said higher-ups in the department began urging caution as the gang's presence increased in certain parts of the city. Jones worried gang members may confuse firefighter and paramedic uniforms for police uniforms, potentially putting first responders at risk of attack. San Antonio firefighters are unarmed, and it's common for them to take a police escort when entering hostile environments that could lead to violence. There are currently no police escorts for firefighters in areas where there is a Tren de Aragua presence, but the San Antonio Professional Firefighters Association continues to push for better protective measures for their crews. Panera settles Charged Lemonade wrongful death lawsuit Tren de Aragua arrests in San Antonio San Antonio authorities on Saturday cracked down on the gang's presence at an apartment complex on the city's north side, arresting four confirmed gang members. It's been less than three weeks since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the gang a terrorist organization. The raid, which included local, state, and federal authorities, saw multiple Tren de Aragua members arrested after complaints alleging human trafficking, narcotics violations and violent threats against building staff were made at the apartment complex. According to police, 19 people were arrested: 16 Venezuelans and three U.S. citizens. Four were confirmed Tren de Aragua members and taken into custody by Homeland Security agents. Among those arrested, several of them had previously received deportation notices.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/san-antonio-firefighters-tren-de-aragua-arrests/	2024-10-08T05:18:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Gateway-hotel.png?w=900
Live: Milton downgraded to Category 4 hurricane ahead of landfall	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton was downgraded to a Category 4 storm Tuesday but still remains on track to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in over a century, the National Weather Service in Tampa Bay said. The region has become home to more than 3 million people and is one of the most vulnerable metropolitan areas in the U.S. to storm surge. 'Hurricane Milton is still a major hurricane,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an early morning press conference Tuesday. DeSantis warned Floridians that the hurricane could 'wobble,' meaning it could hit at any point whether it is north of Tampa, Tampa or south of Tampa. 'Wherever it makes landfall, there's going to be impacts far beyond what the cone actually shows,' DeSantis warned. LIVE: Hurricane Milton real-time wobble tracker Milton was downgraded early Tuesday, but forecasters said it still posed 'an extremely serious threat to Florida.' Milton had intensified quickly Monday, becoming a Category 5 storm at midday with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph before being downgraded. Almost the entirety of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane warning early Tuesday as the storm and its 155 mph winds crept toward the state at 12 mph, sucking energy from the Gulf of Mexico’s warm water. The strongest Atlantic hurricane on record is 1980’s Allen, which reached wind speeds of 190 mph as it moved through the Caribbean and Gulf before striking Texas and Mexico. Milton’s center could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region, which has not endured a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than a century. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains. 'Now is the time to execute your plan,' DeSantis said. He said that 'time is running out' for residents to finalize their emergency plans ahead of Hurricane Milton's landfall.

(AP Photo/Martin Zetina) Milton had rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane Monday and is forecast to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in 100 years with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph. Forecasters warn the area could see a storm surge up to 12 feet, prompting evacuations. The hurricane reached an incredibly low pressure Monday night, which generally correlates with a storm’s strength. The lower a system’s pressure, the stronger the hurricane. As of Monday afternoon, there were already traffic backups of people attempting to leave the Tampa area, leading authorities to institute emergency shoulder use, allowing vehicles to travel on the inside shoulder of the road. Northbound traffic on Interstate 75 was bumper to bumper for miles, moving at roughly 6 mph as Floridians and tourists alike tried to flee the state Monday. Flights out of Florida will stop Tuesday, with Tampa International Airport grounding trips at 9 a.m. and St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport closing after the last flight that day. The hurricane went from Category 1 to Category 5 in less than 24 hours, becoming only the second Category 5 hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1966. Forecast models currently show Milton making landfall Wednesday and remaining at hurricane strength as it moves across Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. The current track would avoid other states affected by Helene. Are hurricanes intensifying more rapidly than before? Preparing for Hurricane Milton President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for South Florida to allow federal resources to assist state and local efforts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged residents to execute preparedness plans, noting there was still time to get ready, but that any preparations have to be done quickly. He also detailed efforts being made to protect critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants, and he urged people to stock up on fuel ahead of the storm. In a Monday briefing with reporters, DeSantis called the hurricane 'ferocious' and emphasized the system’s rapid strengthening. 'At the strength it is now, this is a really, really strong storm. The effects of that, not just from the storm surge but from wind damage and debris, will be really, really significant,' DeSantis said. 'This is not a storm you want to take a risk on.' DeSantis also announced that 30,000 linemen were headed to Florida from all over the country to assist with cleanup and repairs after the storm. Less than an hour later, the U.S. National Hurricane Center issued storm surge warnings and hurricane warnings for almost all of Florida’s west coast. The hurricane center also issued storm surge watches on the U.S. East Coast, including much of Florida up to parts of South Carolina. 'If you are in an evacuation area, I beg you, I implore you to leave,' said Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie. 'Drowning deaths from storm surges are 100% preventable if you leave.' Residents have been urged to resupply disaster kits that may have been depleted during Helene, and officials urged those with special needs on Monday to sign up for the state registry as soon as possible. The governor said the state could expect several evacuation orders to be issued ahead of landfall, and that shelters would be open after evacuation orders were given. Officials also urged those with the means to do so to get on the road as soon as possible and to consider hotels in areas less likely to be hard hit, especially people who are reliant on power for medical devices. DeSantis noted that people do not have to evacuate hundreds of miles and that those on barrier islands and in low-lying areas may be able to go to a shelter in their own county. The state is preparing for the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017 when 7 million people were told to evacuate. Tolls have been suspended to aid in evacuation efforts and hotels have offered disaster rates, which also include accepting pets regardless of if a hotel is usually pet-friendly. Ahead of the storm, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced the team would be relocating to the New Orleans area for the week. DeSantis said the state would not be extending the deadline for voter registration because of the storm. Reconsidering where you live after Helene? You’re not alone Evacuation orders: Should I stay, or should I go? Treasure Island is a small beach community in Pinellas County, Florida, hit hard by Hurricane Helene's storm surge two weeks ago. The storm caused catastrophic damage, leaving behind mounds of sand and debris on sidewalks and front lawns. Now, the community is in the path of Hurricane Milton, and residents have been urged to evacuate ahead of the storm. This is in Treasure Island, Florida — right in the pathway of a potential direct hit from Hurricane #Milton. Look at how much debris is still left in neighborhoods from Helene. The state is trying to clean a lot of this up, but it seems near impossible to do in the next 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/13gwKfzWXN&mdash; Ryan Bass (@Ry_Bass) October 7, 2024 Florida's goal is to clean up as much of the Helene debris as possible before Milton makes landfall. One of the state's top fears for Milton is that it will kick back up the debris left behind by Helene and cause further damage to the community. However, due to the excessive debris, DeSantis has urged residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate now before it's too late. As of Tuesday morning, 11 counties along Florida's west coast were under evacuation orders, and 51 out of the state's 67 counties were under a state of emergency. Weather experts forecast the hurricane storm surge will reach anywhere from 8 to 12 feet in some places. To encourage residents to evacuate ahead of the storm, St. Petersburg's government said it would likely shut off northeast and southwest sewage plants, meaning 66% of the town would not be able to flush toilets or take showers for at least 24 hours. St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch warned that if the city takes a direct hit, the rebuilding of electric and water services could take a long time.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-ahead-landfall-florida/	2024-10-08T04:31:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24281671677886.jpg?w=900
Supreme Court will hear a challenge to ghost-gun regulation	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court will hear a challenge Tuesday to a Biden administration regulation on ghost guns, the difficult-to-trace weapons with an exponentially increased link to crime in recent years. The rule is focused on gun kits that are sold online and can be assembled into a functioning weapon in less than 30 minutes. The finished weapons don't have serial numbers, making them nearly impossible to trace. The regulation came after the number of ghost guns seized by police around the country soared, going from fewer than 4,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department data. Finalized after an executive action from President Joe Biden, the rule requires companies to treat the kits like other firearms by adding serial numbers, running background checks and verifying that buyers are 21 or older. The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to court documents. But manufacturers and gun-rights groups challenged the rule in court, arguing it's long been legal to sell gun parts to hobbyists and that most people who commit crimes use traditional guns. They say the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority. 'Congress is the body that gets to decide how to address any risks that might arise from a particular product,' a group of more than two dozen GOP-leaning states supporting the challengers wrote in court documents. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas agreed, striking down the rule in 2023. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld his decision. The administration, on the other hand, argues the law allows the government to regulate weapons that 'may readily be converted' to shoot. The 5th Circuit's decision would allow anyone to 'buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes — no background check, records, or serial number required. The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation’s communities,' Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration last year, allowing the regulation to go into effect by a 5-4 vote. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberal members to form the majority.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/supreme-court/ap-supreme-court-to-hear-challenge-to-ghost-gun-regulation/	2024-10-08T04:10:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670514b26c6c01.05613570.jpeg?w=900
Harris pressed on changing positions, economic plan in '60 Minute...	Vice President Harris was pressed on her changing policy positions and her expensive economic plan on '60 Minutes,' in what proved to be her toughest media interview since becoming the Democratic nominee. CBS News’s Bill Whitaker questioned Harris on a variety of issues, including Harris’s evolving stances on fracking, immigration and Medicare. At one point, Whitaker, citing the nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, estimated her plans could add more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit. Harris, in turn, argued that her plan would strengthen the economy, while former President Trump’s plan would weaken it. But Whitaker repeated the question, asking how such expensive proposals would be paid for. 'But we're dealing with the real world here,' he replied when she said she would make sure wealthy Americans pay their fair share in taxes. 'How are you gonna get this through Congress?' 'When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about because their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class, hard-working folk,' Harris replied. She disagreed when Whitaker said Congress has not indicated they would agree and pass such legislation. 'I am a devout public servant. You know that. I am also a capitalist. And I know the limitations of government,' Harris said. Whitaker also questioned her on several changing positions including once supporting a ban on fracking, looser immigration policies at the border and the concept of Medicare For All, which she stood by when running for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Whitaker asked if Harris thought that was one reason that Americans say they don’t know her. 'In the last four years I have been vice president of the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people,' Harris said. She added, 'Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common-sense solutions.' In past interviews, Harris has responded to similar questions by saying her 'values' have not changed on issues like fracking. Her previous opposition to fracking, which her campaign now says it no longer supports, will matter in a critical state like Pennsylvania, where fracking is an important industry. On the issue of immigration, Whitaker noted that President Biden’s recent crack down on asylum seekers has led to a decrease in illegal border crossings after those numbers quadrupled compared to the Trump administration. Whitaker then asked why the administration didn’t take those steps three years ago. The vice president responded that the first bill the Biden administration proposed to Congress was to fix the immigration system, but it was not taken up. Then she highlighted that Trump had a hand in tanking a border proposal negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this year. 'But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,' Harris replied when Whitaker continued to ask about why Biden didn’t step in to curb the influx of migrants sooner. Harris is on a media blitz this week, where on Tuesday she will appear on 'The View' and Howard Stern’s Sirius XM show. She has faced widespread criticism for not sitting for more tough interviews, in particular by Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio). In August, Harris was interviewed by CNN, alongside her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. She was interviewed by MSNBC last month. Trump declined CBS News’s offer to participate in the program’s traditional interviews it has with presidential candidates ahead of the election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-pressed-on-changing-positions-economic-plan-in-60-minutes-interview/	2024-10-08T02:32:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/HarrisKamala.jpg?w=900
When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida?	(NewsNation) — As Florida and much of the southeastern United States pick up the pieces left by Hurricane Helene, another massive storm is brewing in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Milton, now a Category 5 hurricane with estimated top wind speeds reaching 180 mph, is expected to make landfall on the Sunshine State sometime Wednesday. Milton rapidly strengthened from a Category 1 to a Category 5 hurricane in less than 24 hours, becoming only the second highest-strength hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1966. Forecasters warn the area could see a storm surge of up to 12 feet. When, where will Milton make landfall? The massive hurricane will make landfall midweek, with current models forecasting its arrival in the Tampa Bay area somewhere between Wednesday night and Thursday morning. It's expected to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in a century. Two days out of its arrival, Floridians and tourists alike are fleeing the area. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm Northbound traffic on Interstate 75 was bumper to bumper for miles, moving roughly 6 mph as Floridians and tourists alike tried to flee the state Monday. Flights out of Florida will stop Tuesday, with Tampa International Airport grounding trips at 9 a.m. and St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport closing after the last flight that day. Will Milton stay a Cat 5 hurricane? Forecast models currently show Milton remaining at hurricane strength as it moves east across Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That trajectory places much of Central Florida in the direct impact zone, though it avoids other states impacted by Helene, which has resulted in at least 230 deaths so far, with many still missing in the Appalachians. This satellite image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday, Oct. 7, 2024, shows Hurricane Milton. (NOAA via AP) Preparing for Hurricane Milton President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for South Florida to allow federal resources to assist state and local efforts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged residents to execute preparedness plans, noting that there is still time to get ready, but it has to be done quickly. He also detailed efforts being made to protect critical infrastructure such as water treatment plans and to stock up on fuel ahead of the storm. Reconsidering where you live after Helene? You’re not alone In a Monday briefing with reporters, DeSantis called the hurricane 'ferocious' and emphasized the system’s rapid strengthening. 'At the strength it is now, this is a really, really strong storm. The effects of that, not just from the storm surge but from wind damage and debris, will be really, really significant,' DeSantis said. 'This is not a storm you want to take a risk on.' Less than an hour later, the U.S. National Hurricane Center issued storm surge warnings and hurricane warnings for almost all of Florida’s west coast. The hurricane center also issued storm surge watches on the U.S. East Coast including much of Florida up to parts of South Carolina. 'If you are in an evacuation area, I beg you, I implore you to leave,' said Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie. 'Drowning deaths from storm surges are 100% preventable if you leave.' DeSantis noted that people do not have to evacuate hundreds of miles and that those on barrier islands and in low-lying areas may be able to go to a shelter in their own county. The state is preparing for the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017, when 7 million people were told to evacuate. Tolls have been suspended to aid in evacuation efforts, and hotels are offering disaster rates, which also include accepting pets regardless of whether a hotel is usually pet-friendly.

With new rule changes, are real estate agents still necessary?	(NewsNation) — New real estate commission rules are encouraging some to skip the agent altogether, finding the process more straightforward than they expected. Gabrielle Hillman, 30, and her roommate recently sold their Chicago condo without a real estate agent. 'It's definitely time-consuming — but all things considered — to save $30,000 we were happy to do it,' she said. Historically, agent fees have come from the seller’s proceeds, usually around 5 to 6% of the sale price, which gets split between the buyer's and seller's agents. But, due to recent changes in how commissions are advertised and paid, Hillman felt she had more flexibility to go it alone. Will homebuying costs change under real estate settlement? To determine the asking price, she researched condos in the neighborhood and figured out what a comparable unit had sold for. Instead of relying on an agent for marketing, Hillman paid a company $100 to get the condo on the multiple listing service (MLS) — a private database agents use to list homes for sale. When it was time to close, the 30-year-old hired a real estate attorney, a step she said was critical and more cost-efficient than working with an agent. 'The couple hundred that (attorneys) are doing this for is nothing compared to a couple thousand that you're paying an agent,' she said. Ultimately, Hillman agreed to pay a commission to the buyer's agent but she was able to negotiate a lower fee than the norm just a few months ago. All told, she said the condo sold in roughly three weeks: 'It was much easier, I would say, than expected.' The New York Times recently highlighted another woman who decided to sell her home without an agent via Facebook marketplace. Joanne Y. Cleaver, 66, estimated she saved $25,000 in real estate fees. Most people still use real estate agents As part of the $418 million settlement between home sellers and the National Association of Realtors (NAR), listings on the MLS will no longer advertise the buying agent’s commission upfront — a tweak meant to deter agents from steering clients away from lower-commission deals. It's one of several changes that will give Americans more negotiating power when it comes to agent fees and may push more consumers to forgo them entirely. Data suggests the sluggish housing market already has real estate agents fleeing the industry, but the trend could accelerate if commissions drop off. But that outcome is not a foregone conclusion and the do-it-yourself approach comes with risk, especially for those unfamiliar with the process. Amanda Pendleton, Zillow's home trends expert, thinks the recent market — characterized by elevated mortgage rates, low inventory and high prices — has made agents' expertise more important, not less. 'What we're seeing is that homes that are priced and marketed correctly are selling pretty quickly, in about 20 days or so, but homes that are not are lingering on the market for a couple of months,' she said. Last year, for sale by owner (FSBO) sales accounted for just 7% of home sales, an all-time low, according to the NAR. The real estate trade group found that the typical FSBO home sold for almost $100,000 less than those sold with an agent's help. Half of all homes for sale have sat for 60-plus days: Redfin 'A mistake could cost you tens of thousands of dollars, so having an expert by your side is critical if you want to net top dollar,' Pendleton said. On top of marketing and pricing advice, good agents help their clients through the entire process, using their local knowledge to negotiate better deals. According to a 2023 survey from Clever Real Estate, home sellers who used an agent were more satisfied with their experience than those who didn't. 'We don't expect that the settlement is going to dramatically change the way that people ultimately buy and sell homes,' Pendleton said. 'What it does do is it brings more transparency to the process and that's a really good thing for buyers and for sellers.' Are real estate lawyers a better option? The question is whether real estate agents are the best experts for the job. Real estate attorney Doug Miller doesn't think they are. 'There's no barrier to entry to become a Realtor, and as a result, you have a huge number of incompetent people out there doing this,' said Miller, who started Consumer Advocates in American Real Estate (CAARE), a nonprofit that educates consumers about the real estate industry. Instead, Miller said you're 'far better off' — in terms of price and quality — going to a lawyer who specializes in residential real estate. The Minnesota attorney has spent decades trying to make the residential real estate industry fairer for consumers and his ideas helped shape the antitrust lawsuits against the NAR that led to the recent changes. 'Attorneys can only represent one side of the transaction,' he said. 'We're trained in how to handle conflicts of interest, Realtors are not.' Marketing remains the biggest challenge Using sites like Zillow, sellers have gained some freedom to market their homes but Miller pointed out that FSBO listings are on a different section of the site that receives less traffic. Hillman and her roommate experienced that limitation firsthand. After initially listing the unit on Zillow, she said interest picked up only after they paid to get the unit on the MLS. 'The biggest obstacle to getting a house sold is marketing exposure, and the Realtors have created the multiple listing service by taking their client data and compiling it and creating this database and then limiting access to it to only other MLS members,' Miller said. He's hopeful the new rules will make it easier for sellers to go around agents and recommends going through a company, as Hillman did, to get listed on the MLS. Miller also emphasized the importance of taking good photos, something Hillman and her roommate paid to have done. Hillman plans to use the knowledge she's gained in future real estate transactions. 'I just bought another condo. When I eventually sell that condo, I will not use a Realtor to sell it,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/real-estate-agents-necessary/	2024-10-07T14:54:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/AP22272552094893-e1697564817258.jpg?w=800
Trump mass deportation plan embraced by some border sheriffs	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump plans to lean heavily on local law enforcement in his efforts to conduct mass deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally should he return to the White House. Speaking exclusively to NewsNation last week, Trump detailed why he would utilize the expertise of local authorities. 'They know them very well. They know their names. They know their middle names. They know everything about them,' Trump said of those who entered the country illegally. 'They know the good ones, the bad ones. They know everything about them, and they're going to get them, and they're going to get them out,' he added. Border town buying drones to deal with migrant emergencies Local law enforcement who spoke to NewsNation embraced the former president's plan. However, there are questions as to how it can be pulled off with limited resources. 'It will be a very big and monumental task to cooperate with the federal government and to ensure our community that we aren't just going rounding up persons of color and deporting them,' Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County, California, told NewsNation. 'These are criminals that we are arresting for victimizing us, and we are making sure they go back to the country where they belong,' Bianco added. Sheriff Mark Dannels of Cochise County, Arizona, told NewsNation that collaboration with the federal government is necessary to ensure a successful operation. Did migrants from Hamas cross into US after Oct. 7? 'We need some kind of court documents for the federal government,' Dannels said. 'Say, 'Hey, this person is possibly in your county. Can you find them?' 'And I don't know everybody in my county, but I guarantee you those that come, whether it's on a traffic stop or speed or traffic violation, we will encounter any other person has wanted this country. Time is our friend. Time is their enemy.' Last week, Trump exclusively told NewsNation he would revoke the Temporary Protected Status for Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, and ensure their return to Haiti.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/trump-local-law-enforcement-mass-deportation/	2024-10-07T12:35:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2167168063.jpg?w=900
Live Wobble Tracker: Map shows real-time movements of Hurricane M...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton, which reached Category 5 strength Monday, is heading right for Florida's west coast, with a potential landfall near or at Tampa Bay. The National Hurricane Center predicted that it could possibly weaken to a Category 3 before making landfall, but where it makes landfall could produce drastic differences in how the bay is hit by storm surge. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm Nexstar's Tampa-based meteorologists at WFLA track 'wobbles,' or small movements, on the system’s path. Those wobbles determine where the hurricane is headed and how much damage Floridians can expect. 'If it hits St. Pete Beach, there's 15 feet of water in the Bay,' said Jeff Berardelli, Max Defender 8 chief meteorologist. 'If it hits Longboat Key, 15, 20 miles south of there, there's not much of any water in the bay.' As Milton continues moving forward, there will likely still be changes in its path that will affect where it is headed. 'You're going to have to watch the wobble tracker up until 20 miles off shore,' Berardelli said. While the movements may seem negligible at first glance, these wobbles make a big difference when they compound into a change in the storm’s path. Mandatory evacuations begin in Tampa Bay ahead of Milton This was the case when Max Defender 8 first launched the wobble tracker for Hurricane Ian, a Category 5 hurricane that was originally expected to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay but 'wobbled' further south to its landfall in Charlotte County, Florida. Since then, the tracker has been a major asset in other major hurricanes like Helene and, now, Milton. The wobble tracker watches the motion of hurricanes and tropical storms by using a combination of data from satellites, radar, the forecast trajectory, and the previous path the storm is on, to indicate how the path is changing in real time. Are hurricanes intensifying more rapidly than ever before? The WFLA Wobble Tracker will remain actively streaming 24/7 until Milton makes landfall. Be prepared with the 2024 Hurricane Guide and stay ahead of tropical development with the Tracking the Tropics newsletter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/wobble-tracker-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-07T10:57:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-15.jpg?w=900
Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire rockets in...	Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country’s south killed at least 10 firefighters. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its ally Hamas, fired new barrages despite its recent losses. Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza. The Israeli military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure. The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants’ resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population. Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week. ___ Here is the latest: Nearly 900 Americans and their families have left Lebanon on flights, officials say WASHINGTON — The State Department says that nearly 900 American citizens, green card holders and their families have now left Lebanon on U.S.-contracted flights since late September. Another 150 Americans, legal permanent residents and immediate family left Beirut on Monday on a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, department spokesman Matthew Miller said. The U.S. has so far organized eight flights — most to Istanbul but at least one to Frankfurt, Germany — since fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified at the end of last month. Each of those flights, which cost $283 per person, has had a capacity of 300 passengers for a total of 2,400 seats, meaning that fewer than half of the available seats have been occupied. Miller said about 8,500 Americans citizens, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals, have reached out to the U.S. embassy in Beirut for information about how to leave the country. Relatives of hostages and those killed in the Oct. 7 attack gather for a service in Tel Aviv TEL AVIV, Israel — Hundreds of relatives of hostages and people killed in the Oct. 7 attack have gathered for a memorial service in a central Tel Aviv park. The gathering is one of two major memorial services marking the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack Monday. Families of victims, angry over the government’s failure to protect them on Oct. 7 or to bring home dozens of hostages still held in Gaza, decided to hold their own ceremony, which was broadcast live on major Israeli TV stations. The government planned a second ceremony later Monday evening. That ceremony was pre-recorded without an audience — apparently out of concern that it could be disrupted. Tens of thousands of people had been expected to join the grieving families in Tel Aviv. But the event was scaled back and limited to about 3,200 people because of threats of missile fire. Shortly before it began, sirens warned of an incoming missile from Yemen, forcing people at the site to lie face down on the ground until it was intercepted. The ceremony included performances by Israeli singers, emotional testimonies from survivors and a moment of silence where the crowd stood at attention. As the artists performed, many in the crowd sobbed or hugged one another. The remains of several destroyed cars of victims of the Hamas attack stood at the front of the stage. The US and Israeli defense ministers are having regular discussions, Pentagon says WASHINGTON — At the Pentagon on Monday, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is having regular discussions with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. He said the conversations include what Israel’s next steps will be. Noting that Gallant will be in the Pentagon to meet with Austin this week, he said the visit 'provides the opportunity for ongoing discussions in more depth.' Austin, he said, will also continue to stress the importance of talking civilian safety into account. Asked if the U.S. has gotten assurances from the Israelis that they will give the Biden administration a heads up as they conduct major operations, Ryder said the U.S. has been clear that 'it’s helpful to be able to have awareness about activities in the region for several reasons. One, to ensure that we can protect Americans and U.S. forces throughout the region in terms of potential second, third order effects. But then also as we work to support the defense of Israel.' Ryder would not comment on what the U.S. may or may not do if Israel strikes nuclear or other key targets in Iran. He said Austin agrees with President Joe Biden in opposition to strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran. He said the U.S. continues to work to prevent the conflict from expanding into a wider regional war. But he stressed that the U.S. supports Israel’s efforts to defend itself against Hamas, through operations in Gaza, and against Hezbollah, through strikes in Lebanon. Israeli military warns people to stay off Lebanon's coast ahead of operations BEIRUT — The Israeli military says it will soon launch operations on Lebanon’s southern coast, telling residents to stay off beaches and the sea. In a statement late Monday, the Israeli army told fishermen and people using any kinds of boats not to sail along an area up to 40 kilometers (22 miles) north of the Israeli border. It also said people should not be on the beaches along the Mediterranean coast from the Israeli border all the way north of the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon. The army warned that people who go to the coast or use boats will be putting their lives in danger. Hundreds gather in Prague to remember victims of the attack PRAGUE — Hundreds of people with Israeli flags gathered at the Old Town Square at the heart of the Czech capital to honor the victims of Hamas’ attack against Israel one year ago. 'On this day, we don’t just mourn, but we’re also aware that it’s necessary to do everything to give such attacks no chance to happen again,' Petr Papousek, the head of the Federation of Jewish Communities in the Czech Republic, said in his address. 'Israel will always strive for the world without violence in which people live without fear of terror,' Papousek said. He said that their gathering 'reminds us that hope is stronger than fear and love is stronger that hate.' French President Macron meets with the families of hostages and victims PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron held meetings Monday with the families of two French nationals who are being held hostage in the Gaza Strip and families of victims of the Oct.7 attacks living in France, Macron’s office said. Macron said France will do 'everything possible' to push for a cease-fire and an agreement that would allow the release of Ohad Yahalomi and Ofer Kalderon, the French hostages, as a priority, the statement said. Macron expressed 'the nation’s compassion' toward those affected by the Oct. 7 attacks and told the families meeting at the Elysee presidential palace that France will stand by their side and continue to 'fight tirelessly' against the rise of antisemitism. A second flight leaves Beirut to take Brazilians home RIO DE JANEIRO — The second repatriation flight organized by the Brazilian government to assist its nationals left Beirut on Monday, according to a statement from the Brazilian air force. The plane carrying 227 Brazilians, including 49 children, will stop for fuel in Lisbon before heading to Sao Paulo’s Guarulhos airport, where it is due to arrive Tuesday. The plane took Lebanon medical and hospital supplies donated by Brazil, Brazil’s foreign ministry said Monday, adding that more will follow in future flights. The first repatriation flight landed in Sao Paulo on Sunday. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was on site to greet those fleeing the violence. About 21,000 Brazilians live in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon. In a separate statement, Brazil's foreign ministry called 'for the immediate release of all hostages and for negotiations that lead to a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.' US President Biden and the first lady mark the anniversary at the White House WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden hosted a somber memorial ceremony at the White House Monday to mark the one-year anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The Bidens looked on as Rabbi Aaron Alexander of Washington’s Adas Israel Congregation recited the Jewish remembrance prayer for the more than 1,200 people, including dozens of Americans, killed that day, listing the towns, villages and festival site that were the scenes of the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The president then lit a lone memorial candle placed on a small table at the center of the Blue Room before they observed a moment of silence. Earlier in the day, Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the White House said. Rocket fire from Lebanon targets Israel on a tense day TEL AVIV, Israel — Some 175 rockets were launched from Lebanon on northern Israel on Monday, injuring a woman and causing heavy damage on a tense day marking a year since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 raid, the Israeli military said. Seven other people were injured, one severely, when volleys of rockets hit the cities of Haifa and Tiberias late on Sunday, Israel’s rescue service said. Police said the rocket fire on Monday caused direct hits on highways and several homes. Hezbollah said that it carried out several rocket attacks on Monday including a 'large salvo' on areas north of Haifa, and on the northern Israeli city of Karmiel and the town of Kfar Vradim. It also said it fired rockets on the edge of the Lebanese village of Maroun El-Ras, where Israeli troops took positions inside a public garden. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it conducted an extensive aerial operation in Lebanon on Monday, striking over 120 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon within an hour. It said the targets included sites that belong to the militant group’s Radwan Forces, missiles and rockets force, and an intelligence division. Israeli military intercepts a ballistic missile from Yemen TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said it intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen that triggered sirens across central Israel for the second time on Monday. There were no reports of injuries. The sirens came as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Oc. 7 Hamas attack. Earlier on Monday, rockets fired from Gaza set off sirens in Tel Aviv and several adjacent cities. Vandals deface mural in Italy depicting survivor of Oct. 7 MILAN — The Antisemitism Observatory in Milan said the vandalism of a mural depicting a survivor of last year’s Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 people in Israel is an example of rising and 'overpowering' antisemitism in Italy. Researcher Stefano Gatti said the number of antisemitic incidents has risen to about 90 a week in the last year, from about 30 a week before. He said antisemitism has moved from the internet to the real world, and has become more 'socially acceptable' as a protest against Israel’s assault in Gaza. They include graffiti, insults, acts of intimidation and aggression, that so far have not translated into cases of bodily harm. The mural vandalized on Monday by AleXsandro Palombo depicted a survivor, Vlada Patapov, escaping the Hamas attack. Vandals erased the figure’s head and legs from the mural near Milan’s state university. Political feuds divide Congress over how closely to stand by Israel WASHINGTON — There were some bipartisan efforts in the U.S. Congress to commemorate the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, but the anniversary also touched on political feuds raging over how closely the U.S. should stand by Israel. Republicans have pushed steadfast support for Israel even amid its devastating campaign into Gaza. Earlier this year, they heartily welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Capitol for a speech. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday called for the U.S. to 'recommit to stand with Israel in its righteous fight.' He also said that the Hamas attack that triggered the war a year ago had drawn antisemitism 'out of the shadows' against Jewish communities around the world. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, was expected to speak later Monday at an event for the Republican Jewish Coalition. Democrats, meanwhile, marked the day with statements of condolence for the victims of the Oct. 7 attack, but were divided in their continued support for Israeli aggressions. The left-wing of the party has become increasingly critical of Israel’s retaliatory attack that left Gaza in ruins and killed over 41,000 people. 'Instead of securing the release of the hostages, however, Prime Minister Netanyahu has unleashed unthinkable violence on innocent civilians in Gaza,' said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Ma., in a statement. 'More than a million Palestinians are facing starvation. We see videos of dead children held in the arms of their parents. Violence is escalating throughout the region, including most recently in Lebanon, threatening even more human suffering.' US Treasury sanctions 3 people for helping bankroll Hamas WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury on Monday sanctioned three people in Europe, a charity group and a bank in Gaza, all accused of helping to bankroll militant group Hamas. Treasury says Hamas and its affiliates raise funds through sham charities and as of this year, the militant Palestinian group may have received as much as $10 million a month through such donations. Included in the sanctions: Mohammad Hannoun, an Italy-based Hamas member and his Charity Association of Solidarity with the Palestinian People; Majed al-Zeer, a senior Hamas representative in Germany and Adel Doughman, who is in charge of Hamas activity in Austria. Additionally, Al-Intaj, an unlicensed Hamas-run bank in Gaza was sanctioned for allegedly providing services to Hamas. 'As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Israeli defense minister will hold talks in Washington WASHINGTON -- Israel’s defense minister is to travel to Washington this week for talks at the Pentagon. The visit by Yoav Gallant comes at a sensitive time in the yearlong Mideast conflict. Israel has vowed to attack Iran following an intense Iranian missile barrage last week. Such an attack could rattle international oil markets and potentially draw in American forces in the region. Israel has also been expanding a ground offensive against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. The Pentagon’s spokesman, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, announced the visit on the platform X, saying that Gallant and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would discuss 'ongoing Middle East security developments.' Gallant’s office confirmed the scheduled visit but gave no further details. A Lebanese mountain village mourns the dead in an airstrike QMATIYEH, Lebanon — A village in the mountains southeast of Beirut was in shock after an Israeli airstrike demolished a residential building and partly destroyed another, killing seven people, including three children. Hadi Zahwe, a resident of the area, told reporters that the strike on Sunday was 'terrifying.' 'There were children killed, there were children’s body parts,' he said. 'This enemy is targeting civilian women and children.' Israel has carried out a widening aerial bombardment of many parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs over the past two weeks, targeting what it said were Hezbollah militants and weapons. It was not clear what the intended target was in Sunday’s strike, which was the first one to hit the area. Mahmoud Nasr Eldin, the town’s deputy mayor, said the village contains 'no security or military centers.' ''There’s nothing in Qmatiyeh that they’re looking for — it’s a safe area,' he said. 'We welcomed around 15,000 internally displaced people. They are our people, they ran away from their villages and came to get protection here.' A 12-year-old Palestinian boy is fatally shot in the West Bank RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israeli troops shot and killed a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in the central West Bank Monday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The boy, Hatem Ghaith, was fatally shot in the stomach at the Qalandiya refugee camp, the ministry said. Commenting on the shooting, the Israeli army said its forces opened fire at rioters who were hurling rocks at troops operating in the area. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian new agency, the shooting occurred during an Israeli military raid on the camp. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago, violence has surged in the occupied West Bank, where over 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the Health Ministry. Netanyahu says Israel is waging a 'war of resurrection' JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel was fighting a 'war of resurrection' and would continue until achieving its goals, as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack. 'This is the war of our existence — the ‘war of resurrection’. This is what I would like to officially call the war,' Netanyahu said during a Cabinet meeting. His comment provoked a response from a group representing the families of the hostages held in Gaza, who said they wished to 'remind the prime minister that there is and will be no resurrection without the return of all the hostages.' In a statement earlier, Netanyahu vowed that Israel would keep fighting until the 'living and dead' hostages were returned, Hamas is overthrown in Gaza and residents of the country’s north and south could go back to their homes. 'Since that black day, we are under attack on seven fronts,' Netanyahu said, referring to Oct. 7, 2023. He said counterattacking Iranian-backed groups 'is a necessary condition for securing our future.' French foreign minister on a visit to Israel pleads for a cease-fire PARIS — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot on Monday pleaded in favor of a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, saying that France and its partners were 'ready to work collectively for de-escalation and peace in the region.' 'After a year of war, the time for diplomacy has come,' Barrot said in Jerusalem. He earlier took part in a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, where about 1,200 people were killed and some 250 were taken hostage in Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023. He said he had held multiple meetings while touring the region in recent days, including in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan. Barrot reiterated France’s commitment to Israel’s security as 'unwavering,' but said 'force alone cannot guarantee Israel’s security.' Barrot said that a two-state solution is 'the only one that guarantees a just and lasting peace.' Barrot’s comments came two days after French President Emmanuel Macron called for 'a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,' drawing strong criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Both leaders spoke over the phone on Sunday. Macron’s office said the French leader told Netanyahu that arms deliveries, the prolongation of the war in Gaza and its extension to Lebanon will not produce security for either Israelis or others living in the region. 'We must be consistent,' Barrot said on Monday. 'We cannot ask for a cease-fire while arming the belligerents.' Barrot announced that France will hold in a few days an international conference in support of Lebanon's army and to help strengthen its institutions. Swedish, Czech prime ministers condemn Hamas' attack a year ago STOCKHOLM — Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Monday that Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago was 'the worst mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust was committed.' Kristersson said the attack also 'led to an escalated conflict in the Middle East that is still ongoing, with tens of thousands of civilian casualties and enormous suffering.' Kristersson called for a cease-fire and the release of hostages, a de-escalation in the region and an increased humanitarian access. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala reiterated his country’s support for Israel on the anniversary of the attack by Hamas. 'A few days ago, Israel was attacked again by Iran. Again, unfortunately, anti-Semitism in various forms is also on the rise,' Fiala wrote on X. 'Tensions in the Middle East bring suffering to many people. However, terrorist organizations will not bring peace and a dignified life to people there. Israel defends its existence, it is repeatedly attacked and must have the right to defend itself. Therefore, on the day of this tragic anniversary, I repeat: The Czech Republic stands by Israel!' Erdogan condemns Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack to condemn Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Today, I remember with sorrow the tens of thousands of people that the murderous Israeli government has massacred since Oct. 7,' Erdogan said in a message posted on X. 'I convey my most heartfelt condolences to my brothers from Gaza, Palestine, and Lebanon.' An outspoken critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza and more recently the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Erdogan said: 'Israel’s long-standing policy of genocide, occupation, and invasion must finally come to an end.' He has praised Hamas previously as a 'liberation group.' Erdogan on Monday made no mention of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, in which the militants killed about 1,200 people and dragged some 250 hostages back to Gaza. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and displaced most of the territory’s 2.3 million population. 'Israel will sooner or later pay the price for this genocide, which it has been implementing for a year and which is still continuing,' Erdogan wrote. 'Just as Hitler was stopped by a joint alliance of humanity, (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and his killer network will be stopped in the same way.' Pope Francis refers to the ‘fuse of hatred’ lit a year ago ROME — The Vatican marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel by taking up a collection for the people of Gaza and publishing a letter form Pope Francis to Catholics in the region expressing his solidarity. Francis made no mention of Israel, Hamas or hostages in the letter dated Oct. 7 and addressed to Catholics in the Middle East, especially in Gaza. He referred to the 'fuse of hatred' being lit one year ago, and the spiral of violence that had ensued, in insisting that what is needed is dialogue and peace. After some comments that upset Israel early on in the conflict, Francis has usually tried to strike an even tone, often referring to Palestinians and Israel in his frequent appeals for peace. But he recently suggested Israel was using disproportionate and 'immoral' force in Lebanon and Gaza. And on the Oct. 7 anniversary, Francis spoke in general terms to people of all religious confessions in the region, thanking Christians for staying in their historic lands and directing himself in a particular way to the people of Gaza. 'I am close to you, I am with you. I am with you, the people of Gaza, long embattled and in dire straits. You are in my thoughts and prayers daily,' he wrote. Francis said he was particularly close to those who have been forced to flee their homes to find refuge from bombing; to the mothers weeping over their dead children and those 'who are afraid to look up for fear of fire raining down from the skies.' Francis has called for a day of fasting and prayer on Monday, and his chief almsgiver announced he was taking up a collection from participants in Francis’ big meeting of bishops at the Vatican this week. He urged donors to be particularly generous, saying the proceeds of the fundraising drive would go straight to the Catholic parish in Gaza, where Francis calls every day. At least 10 Lebanese firefighters killed in the country's south BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country’s south killed at least 10 firefighters on Monday. It said more people were buried under the rubble and the death toll may rise. The ministry said the firefighters were in a municipality building in the town of Baraachit that was hit as they prepared to embark on a rescue mission. Biden and Harris condemn Hamas on the attack anniversary and call for a cease-fire WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris condemned Hamas on the anniversary of the militant group’s attack on Israel, while reiterating their administration’s commitment to cementing cease-fire deals to end fighting in Gaza and Lebanon. 'On this solemn anniversary, let us bear witness to the unspeakable brutality of the October 7th attacks but also to the beauty of the lives that were stolen that day,' Biden said in a statement. The president said that he thinks every day of the more than 100 hostages still in captivity and their families. He vowed that his administration 'will never give up until we bring all of the remaining hostages home safely.' Biden added that 'history will also remember October 7th as a dark day for the Palestinian people because of the conflict that Hamas unleashed that day.' Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. 'It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people,' Harris said. 'And I will always fight for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination.' Israeli military warns dozens of towns in southern Lebanon to evacuate BEIRUT — The Israeli military Monday warned people in over a dozen towns and villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate, including the coastal town where the U.N. peacekeeping mission is headquartered. Israeli evacuation warnings in recent days have expanded to include a provincial capital, as troops continue their ground incursion backed by intense airstrikes. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, is headquartered in Naqoura, not far from the coastal city of Tyre. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee in a post on X told residents to immediately flee north. 'You are not allowed to head southward,' the statement read. 'Any movement to the south puts your lives at risk.' Lebanon’s cash-strapped government estimates that some 1.2 million people have been displaced in the fighting and it's struggling to support them. Israel says its aim is to weaken Hezbollah to allow its displaced residents to move back to northern Israel. Hezbollah maintains that it will stop firing rockets at Israel when there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, in solidarity with its ally Hamas. Israeli military orders an evacuation in southern Gaza after Hamas' rocket attack JERUSALEM — The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate areas near the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip after Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv. The military had also ordered an evacuation of the areas east of Khan Younis earlier in the war when it sent ground troops into the territory’s second largest city. The latest orders on Monday came after a barrage of five rockets triggered air raid sirens in central Israel, lightly wounded two women and caused minor damage. The military said the rockets were fired from the area of Khan Younis. Hamas claimed the attack, which came as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza that triggered the war. On Sunday, the military reiterated warnings for the entire population of northern Gaza to flee south. Those warnings date back to the early weeks of the war, when Israeli forces sealed off the north and launched heavy operations there. A year of war has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas, but its fighters have repeatedly regrouped in areas where Israel has carried out large operations. Netanyahu addresses an Oct. 7 memorial JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel 'arose as a nation as lions' following the Oct. 7 attack a year ago. 'We remember our fallen, our hostages — whom we are committed to return — our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,' Netanyahu said at a memorial commemorating the anniversary of the attack. He visited the memorial in Jerusalem for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in the Hamas-led attack and the war it ignited. He spoke alongside the mayor of Jerusalem as the two held a small tribute at an event that appeared closed to the public. Netanyahu has faced heavy criticism for security lapses that allowed the attack to unfold and mass protests over his failure to return some 100 hostages still held in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. The attack one year ago killed some 1,200 people across southern Israel, mostly civilians. Palestinian militants dragged some 250 hostages back to Gaza. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and displaced most of the territory’s 2.3 million population. Nearly 700 Americans have left Lebanon WASHINGTON — The State Department says nearly 700 American citizens, green card holders and family members have now left Lebanon aboard U.S.-contracted planes since late September. The department said Monday that about 90 passengers — less than a third of the planes 300-person capacity — departed Beirut for Istanbul, Turkey, on Sunday on the latest flight. Hundreds of other Americans have left Lebanon aboard regularly scheduled commercial flights since fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified. The department said it has made more than 2,900 seats available for Americans on those flights. Jordan's foreign minister criticizes Israel's war with Hezbollah BEIRUT — Jordan’s top diplomat on Monday slammed Israel’s war with the militant Hezbollah group in Lebanon, saying it is pushing the Middle East into the 'abyss of full-scale regional war.' 'We are facing a disaster and a dangerous escalation that threatens the region,' Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. 'Israel bears responsibility of this aggression, the escalation in the region, and any new escalation that the region faces.' He spoke in a news conference following a meeting with Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati in Beirut. Safadi said that Jordan backs the Lebanese government’s initiative to elect a new president and commitment to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended Israel’s last war with Hezbollah in 2006, and that would keep southern Lebanon exclusively under the control of the Lebanese military and U.N. peacekeepers. He added that Jordan, like Lebanon, backed an initiative by the United States and France for a three-week cease-fire in Lebanon. Meanwhile, as the region braces for an Israeli retaliation for Iran's missile attack, Safadi said Jordan rejects either country using its airspace in their tit-for-tat hostitilies. 'We will not a battlefield for anyone,' he said. 'We made this message clear to Iran and to Israel as well.' Australian prime minister attends a vigil in Melbourne MELBOURNE, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil commemorating the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and walked in Melbourne with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Albanese was not expected to speak at the vigil, attended by thousands. In a statement, he said the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas’ actions. 'Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day -- and as a nation we say never again,' he said. 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He acknowledged the 'devastating' loss of civilian lives since Oct. 7. Hundreds of people gathered Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict amid a heavy police presence. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia’s cities on Sunday. Meanwhile, the first of two repatriation flights organized by the Australian government to transport Australians from Lebanon touched down in Sydney on Monday evening with nearly 350 people on board. Kibbutz Be'eri commemorates the Oct. 7 attack KIBBUTZ BE’ERI, Israel — Members of Kibbutz Be’eri, one of the hardest-hit communities during the Oct. 7 attack, gathered amid the burned ruins of their homes and demanded an immediate return of the hostages during a memorial and rally on Monday. More than 95 people were killed there and 30 were taken hostage on Oct. 7, according to the community’s spokesperson. Some of the women and children from the kibbutz were released in a cease-fire deal in November, but 10 hostages from Be’eri remain in captivity. Israel believes most of them are no longer alive. On Monday, the community marched silently through the streets of the kibbutz bearing signs of the hostages before gathering for a rally, unfurling a massive flag with the words 'Be’eri cannot heal until everyone is home.' Ella Ben-Ami, whose father Ohad Ben-Ami was kidnapped from Be’eri, addressed the crowd and demanded the government of Israel bring her father home. She said she continues to take solace from the video of his kidnapping, when he stands tall and proud, as if he knew he was being filmed, to broadcast a message to his family that he would be OK. Many people at Be’eri were dreading the anniversary, which felt like an 'impossible' amount of time, she said. 'But then I stop for a moment I think that my father woke up today to count a year in captivity, a year!' she said. Meloni visits the Rome synagogue ROME — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel’s right to defend itself. Meloni also denounced the 'latent and rampant antisemitism' that has arisen in the year since the Hamas attacks, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy over the weekend, some of which turned violent. While asserting Israel’s lights to live safely within its borders, she insisted that it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been 'victims twice over: first of Hamas’ cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.' As the current president of the Group of Seven, Italy will continue to work for an immediate cease-fire, 'the release of Israeli hostages and the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border through the full implementation of U.N. resolutions,' Meloni said. Since coming to office in 2022, Meloni has taken several initiatives to show her strong support for Italy’s Jewish community and Israel. Her Brothers of Italy party has roots in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, or MSI, which was founded in 1946 by sympathizers of Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Hamas fires rockets from Gaza, setting off sirens in central Tel Aviv TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Monday that projectiles fired from Gaza set off sirens in central Tel Aviv, as Israel marks a year to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury. The sirens came as Israelis were marking the anniversary to the deadliest attack in their country’s history. That attack one year ago began with a volley of rockets from Gaza. Israeli strikes hit locations used by Hamas-run police in central Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes hit two makeshift points used by Hamas-run police at a hospital in central Gaza, wounding a journalist. There were no police present at the sites when they were hit early Monday. Ali al-Attar, a journalist working for Al Jazeera, was hit by shrapnel while he was inside a tent used by reporters nearby, according to an Associated Press journalist. Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, operated a police force numbering in the tens of thousands before the war. They have adopted a low profile after being repeatedly targeted by Israeli strikes but still maintain control on the ground in Gaza. Lebanon's Hezbollah group pledges to keep fighting Israel BEIRUT — The Lebanese Hezbollah militant group on Monday reaffirmed its commitment to support Hamas by fighting Israel along Lebanon's southern border. The statement came a year after its allies from the Palestinian Hamas group staged a surprise attack into southern Israel, setting off the war, and amid ongoing intense Israeli airstrikes and a ground incursion into Lebanon. Hezbollah maintains that it will stop its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and although its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed. Large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon have been targeted in Israeli airstrikes. 'We are confident, God willing, in the ability of our resistance to repel the aggression, and in our great and resistant people to be patient, steadfast, and endure until this calamity is removed,' Hezbollah said. The Lebanese government estimates that some 1.2 million people in Lebanon have been displaced, mostly during the escalations less than a month ago. Hezbollah also praised Iran and other Tehran-backed groups in the region, notably Yemen's Houthis and Iraqi Shiite militias for their attacks on Israel. Families gather across southern Israel to mark anniversary of Oct 7 attack BE’ERI, Israel — Across southern Israel on Monday, families gathered in spots where their loved ones were killed during Hamas’ attack, marking a year since the assault that sparked the war in Gaza. They crowded into roadside bomb shelters that became death traps when people seeking shelter from Hamas rockets and militants were sprayed with bullets or struck by grenades. People were also visiting spots on the side of a main road marked with memorials. In Kibbutz Be’eri, one of the hardest-hit communities struck in Hamas’ attack, where roughly 100 residents were killed and 30 kidnapped on Oct. 7, hundreds marched silently holding signs bearing photos of people still being held captive in Gaza. They held a rally in front of homes destroyed in the attack. French President Macron says pain of Oct 7 ‘as vivid as it was a year ago’ PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media on Monday to mark the one-year anniversary since Hamas’ attack on Israel. 'The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,' Macron said on X. 'We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts.' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot was in Israel for the anniversary and attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival where hundreds were killed in Hamas’ attack. Barrot, talking to the families of victims, pledged France’s support in the face of 'the worst anti-Semitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.' 'The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,' he said. 'France mourns alongside Israel our 48 compatriots victims of barbarism.' Barrot, who is expected to speak with his counterpart Israel Katz later Monday, said that Macron will also meet in Paris with family members of Israelis held hostage today. Japan expresses condolences on anniversary of Hamas attack TOKYO — Japan has expressed its condolences to families of victims on the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and demanded the immediate release of hostages. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Monday that Japan is seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip amid continued fighting, the large number of civilian casualties and the ongoing security threats to both Israeli and Palestinian people. 'Japan continues to urge all parties including Israel to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, and strongly urges them to steadily work toward realization of a cease-fire,' Hayashi said. He added that Japan strongly supports mediation efforts by the United States, Egypt and Qatar in achieving negotiations for the release of the hostages and a cease-fire. Group representing families of hostages announces death of a captive TEL AVIV, Israel — A group representing the families of Israeli hostages announced on Monday the death of a captive whose body is still being held in Gaza. The Hostages and Families Forum said Idan Shtivi, 28, was captured from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7. He was thought to have been taken alive. Israeli media reported that he was killed that day and his body was taken into Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Shtivi’s death became apparent, but in previous such announcements, the Israeli military has discovered evidence indicating a hostage’s death. The announcement of Shtivi’s death comes as Israelis are marking one year since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, where militants killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others. About 100 remain in captivity, although more than a third of those are said to be dead. Hundreds gather at Nova music festival site to remember Oct 7 victims RE’IM, Israel — Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault. Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch. 'We can’t understand how a year has passed,' said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. 'It’s the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,' he said. Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden’s last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed. The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman’s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away. 20 Indonesians who were evacuated from Lebanon arrive in Jakarta JAKARTA, Indonesia — Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said. President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow. 'I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,' Widodo said last week. Indonesia’s Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said. Australian PM Albanese condemns Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago. Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack. Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have 'felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day — and as a nation we say never again.' 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He added that 'every innocent life matters' and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was 'a devastating tragedy.' 'Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,' Albanese said. New Israeli strikes hit Beirut suburbs as Hezbollah claims blasts in Israel's Haifa BEIRUT — A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people. Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel’s military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and 'fallen projectiles' were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/ap-middle-east-latest-palestinian-militants-in-gaza-fire-4-rockets-into-israel-as-mourners-mark-oct-7/	2024-10-07T10:44:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67041e9c292c79.26109211.jpeg?w=900
Reconsidering where you live after Helene? You're not alone	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene's devastation has nearly a third of young adults reconsidering where they want to live in the future, according to a new survey conducted by Redfin. 'Americans are beginning to realize that nowhere is truly immune to the impacts of climate change, and we're starting to see that impact where people want to live, even people who haven't experienced a catastrophic weather event firsthand,' Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather said. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm Helene's damage along Florida's Gulf Coast to the unexpected devastation in Asheville, North Carolina, has Americans ages 18 to 34 rethinking where they want to live. In addition to possible weather catastrophes, 23% of respondents fear the overall insurance premiums for their areas will go up after Helene and that it will be hard to get insurance to cover storm-related damages. However, nearly half of all respondents said the news and hurricane damage has not impacted the way they think about their housing situation, the report said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/reconsidering-live-helene/	2024-10-07T10:34:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176842434.jpg?w=900
Are hurricanes intensifying more rapidly than ever before?	(NEXSTAR) – Hurricane Milton intensified from a Category 1 to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale over the course of Monday morning as it progressed toward Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was also expected to bring heavy rainfall and storm surges to parts of Florida before weakening and making landfall. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm People living in the Gulf area’s most frequent hurricane paths, meanwhile, are no stranger to storms. But the rapid intensification of these storms? That might be relatively new. Rapid intensification is defined by the National Hurricane Center as an increase of at least 30 knots (about 35 mph) in maximum sustained winds within a 24-hour period, which can mean a jump of two categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale. As it currently stands, rapid intensification has been observed in about 80% of all major hurricanes in the North Atlantic 'and nearly all category four and five hurricanes,' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said earlier this year. Scientists have also found evidence to suggest that storms are more frequently experiencing rapid intensification when compared to cyclones in years past, but it’s unclear if all of those instances can be attributed to climate change, or if 'natural variables' can account for some, according to an October 2024 report from the Congressional Research Service. Researchers, however, have indeed observed an increase in rapidly intensifying storms in global basins, as well as a significant spike in rapid intensification happening just offshore, rather than out in the open ocean. Residents board up a sea shell store ahead of Hurricane Milton's expected landfall in the middle of this week in Treasure Island, Florida on October 7, 2024. (Photo by Bryan R. Smith/AFP via Getty Images) The NOAA points to our warming planet as a major factor. Rising ocean temperatures (both on the surface and below) as well as humid air — which often accompanies warmer water — are two of the main conditions that encourage cyclone development, the agency says. Such rapidly intensifying storms will only become 'more likely' in the future, according to the Congressional report. 'According to NOAA, scientists have medium to high confidence that tropical cyclone intensities globally will likely increase on average under a [2 degrees Celsius] of global surface temperature increase, and that the global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach very intense levels (Category 4 and 5) will also likely increase over the 21st century,' the report states. Mandatory evacuations begin in Tampa Bay ahead of Milton 'Scientists also project these changes for the Atlantic basin, specifically,' the author added. An increase in rapidly intensifying cyclones, too, is especially problematic for those in the paths of the forecasted storms. Rapid intensification is hard to predict, meaning residents in the target areas not be fully aware of the intensity of a hurricane — and perhaps not prepared to evacuate — until it’s too late. How climate change is intensifying storms like Hurricane Helene Milton is expected to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday, albeit as a weaker Category 3 hurricane, Nexstar's WFLA reported Monday. Still, officials are urging residents of some parts to prepare and evacuate before it’s too late to do so. 'This is the real deal here with Milton,' Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said, the Associated Press reported. 'If you want to take on Mother Nature, she wins 100% of the time.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricanes-intensifying-weather/	2024-10-07T09:44:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/HurricaneMiltonGettyImages-2176495337-e1728319044683.jpg?w=800

Border town buying drones to deal with migrant emergencies	SUNLAND PARK, N.M. (Border Report) – The City of Sunland Park is acquiring drones so its fire and police departments can more effectively rescue stranded migrants and hikers on Mount Cristo Rey and individuals struggling in the Rio Grande. The drones also will help police ensure children at public schools are safe whenever incursions by groups of people are reported – as has often happened in this border community during migrant surges in the past few years. Border Report Live: How the border shapes US politics, Mexico relations 'We get a lot of people, obviously immigrants coming across NM 273 (McNutt Road) trying to either run or hide, and if they do they go toward the river, toward areas that are vegetated. It’s very difficult for us to have line-of-sight,' said City Manager Mario Juarez-Infante. 'And sometimes they try to assimilate with the schools, so that’s the advantage of having the drones.' Juarez-Infante expects the drones will be primarily used to save lives and to ensure that children are safe inside their campus. The city is spending an initial $6,000 on three drones and plans to deploy them before the end of the year. Volunteers want sheriff to pick up human remains found in desert He said real-time information would be shared with federal agencies such as the U.S. Border Patrol during public safety emergencies. This graphic shows how Sunland Park, N.M., police plan to integrate drones and collaboration with state and federal agencies into its public safety strategy. The Sunland Park Fire Department has developed a close relationship with the Border Patrol while assisting migrants who slide off the mountain, fall over the border wall or nearly drown in the Rio Grande. Man awaiting smuggling trial allegedly arrested with new group of migrants A total of 176 migrants have died in the past 12 months in the El Paso Sector of the Border Patrol that runs from Hudspeth County, Texas, to the New Mexico-Arizona state line.

Frontlines with Robert Sherman: Oct. 7 — One Year Later	NewsNation National Correspondent Robert Sherman has found himself on the frontlines of some of the world’s biggest stories: from Ukraine to Israel and across the United States. He shares what he’s seeing on the ground. Subscribe to his newsletter: Frontlines with Robert Sherman here. This morning I am writing to you from Kibbutz Nir Oz. I am sitting on the lawn of a courtyard separating half a dozen homes. The birds are scenically chirping as small wildlife critters hop around. If you close your eyes and take it all in, it’s a small slice of serenity. But then you open your eyes and reality sets in. There is a home right in front of me scorched from the inside as its melted metal awning droops down. There are spray paint markings on the front of the house left behind by the search-and-rescue crews to signify bodies were found inside. Down the road, there is a memorial taking place for those killed and taken hostage, the chorus of mourners at times drowned out by what one local referred to as 'the symphony of war.' That would be the sound of jets, artillery and machines guns rattling nearby. How to register to vote Kibbutz Nir Oz before the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack was a community of less than 400 people. About a quarter of the population there was killed or taken hostage that day. Twenty-nine are still being held in Gaza. You may recall from the early days of the war one of the few pieces of good news Israel received: a pair of elderly hostages were released in October. One of them was Yocheved Lifshitz, who was taken from Nir Oz by bike and held in Hamas’ tunnels, which she described as being like a 'spider web.' She returned to Israel that day. Her husband, Oded, is still in Gaza. We spoke with their grandson Monday on 'Morning in America.' You can watch that interview here. There is palpable pain on the ground here. Families are broken. Closure has not been attained. As I wrote previously, the feeling here is that one year has passed since Oct. 7, but Oct. 8 has not yet arrived. We’ll be sharing the stories of those caught right in the middle of Oct. 7 throughout the day on NewsNation. Additionally, one year later, there is still a big question many are asking: How could this have possibly happened? Especially considering mere weeks ago Israeli intelligence pulled off an astonishing feat as they detonated Hezbollah pagers across Lebanon that injured and exposed their members. Yet one year ago, Hamas was able to overwhelm Israel’s air defense systems and enter the country on bikes, trucks and homemade gliders. How could they not see it coming and, perhaps more pointedly, is Israel ready for the next attempt? We spoke with a former member of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal intelligence agency, who thinks Israel is susceptible to the mistakes of the past. Close Thank you for signing up!

When the sirens first went off, retired Gen. Noam Tibon hopped in his car and drove south with one mission in mind: to save his family. Those are just some of the stories we’ll be sharing with you on NewsNation throughout the day. My biggest takeaway is this: I arrived in Israel back on Oct. 8, 2023. I remember the fear on the ground. The uncertainty that was ever-present. No one knew what the world would look like one year later. Today, there's been a year of fighting. There are multiple fronts open. There's an impending response to Iran's missile attack this week. And despite all we've seen and witnessed over the last year, I have no idea what the future holds or the coming days will bring. But I'm far from alone on that one.

Diddy's mom: 'My son is not the monster they have painted him to ...	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ mother, Janice Smalls Combs, condemned the allegations against her son, likening the investigation to a 'public lynching' rooted in 'lies' for 'financial gain.' The business mogul wields significant wealth and power in the entertainment industry. He faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. Smalls Combs acknowledged a video showing her son assaulting his former girlfriend in a hotel in 2016. Combs admitted to the assault in May, calling his actions 'inexcusable.' Florida doctor faces murder charges after running pill mill: Police 'It is important to recognize that none of us, regardless of our status, are immune to fear or mistakes,' Smalls Combs said. 'Not being entirely straightforward about one issue does not mean my son is guilty of the repulsive allegations and the grave charges leveled against him.' In November 2023, Combs’ former girlfriend and fellow musician Cassandra 'Cassie' Ventura filed a lawsuit alleging Combs physically and sexually abused her for years during their relationship. They settled the suit the next day, directing further scrutiny at Combs and a series of additional lawsuits in the months that followed. Smalls Combs said she believes the allegations against her son are cash-grabs based on lies. 'These individuals saw how quickly my son’s civil legal team settled his ex-girlfriend’s lawsuit, so they believe they can receive a quick payday by falsely accusing my son,' she said. Prosecutors allege Combs used the resources of his music empire to create 'a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.' Read Smalls Combs’ full statement below: 'I come to you today as a mother that is devastated and profoundly saddened by the allegations made against my son, Sean Combs. It is heartbreaking to see my son judged not for the truth, but for a narrative created out of lies. To bear witness (to) what seems to be like a public lynching of my son before he has had the opportunity to prove his innocence is a pain too unbearable to put into words. Like every human being, my son deserves to have his day in court, to finally share his side, and to prove his innocence. I am not here to portray my son as a perfect person because he is not. My son may not have been entirely truthful about certain things, such as denying he has ever gotten violent with an ex-girlfriend when the hotel’s surveillance showed otherwise. Sometimes, the truth and a lie become so closely intertwined that it becomes terrifying to admit one part of the story, especially when that truth is outside the norm or is too complicated to be believed. This is why I believe by son’s civil legal team opted to settle the ex-girlfriend’s lawsuit instead of contesting it until the end, resulting in a ricochet effect as the federal government used this decision against my son by interpreting it as an admission of guilt. It is important to recognize that none of us, regardless of our status, are immune to fear or mistakes. Not being entirely straightforward about one issue does not mean my son is guilty of the repulsive allegations and the grave charges leveled against him. Many individuals who were wrongfully convicted and later exonerated had their freedom taken from them not because they were guilty of the crimes they were accused of, but because they didn’t fit the image of what this society considers to be a ‘good person.’ History has showed us how individuals can be wrongfully convicted due to their past actions or mistakes. Watching the world make jokes and laugh at my son’s life crumbling before our eyes is something I can never forget. It is truly agonizing to watch the world turn against my son so quickly and easily over lies and misconceptions, without ever hearing his side or affording him the opportunity to present his side. These lies thrown at him are motivated by financial gain, and not justice. These individuals saw how quickly my son’s civil legal team settled his ex-girlfriend’s lawsuit, so they believe they can receive a quick payday by falsely accusing my son. False allegations of sexual assault thwart true victims of sexual violence from getting the justice they deserve. To make matters worse, the federal government is now using these lies to prosecute my son. This injustice has been unbearable for our family. The worst part of this ordeal is watching my beloved son be stripped of his dignity, not for what he did, but for what people choose to believe about him. I ask his supporters, fans, colleagues, friends, and the public, to not judge him before you’ve had the chance to hear his side. I beg you to think about those who have been wrongfully persecuted, to remember that not everyone who has made mistakes in life deserves to have their entire existence judged by a single action or a few mistakes. My son is not the monster they have painted him to be, and he deserves the chance to tell his side. I can only pray that I am alive to see him speak his truth and be vindicated.'

Live: Milton upgraded to Category 4 storm, DeSantis gives update	(NewsNation) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday is expected to give an update on preparations for Hurricane Milton, which is likely to make landfall Wednesday near the Tampa Bay area. Milton rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane Monday with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph after developing in the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters warn the area could see a storm surge up to 12 feet, leading the way for possible evacuations. Milton comes on the heels of Hurricane Helene, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane before weakening over land. While Helene decreased in intensity as it traversed the Southeast, the storm still brought major devastation to several states, with western North Carolina still largely cut off due to storm damage. More Americans than ever rely on government help: Report Forecast models currently show Milton making landfall Wednesday and remaining at hurricane strength as it moves across Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. The current track would avoid other states affected by Helene, which has resulted in at least 230 deaths so far with many still missing in the Appalachians. A tropical storm watch was in effect for Florida’s Gulf Coast from Flamingo to south of Chokoloskee and from north of the mouth of the Suwanee River to Indian Pass, and for the Florida Keys, including Florida Bay. DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be seen where exactly Milton will strike, it’s clear the state is going to be hit hard. 'You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,' DeSantis said. 'If you’re on that west coast of Florida, barrier islands, just assume you’ll be asked to leave.' The state is preparing for the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017, when 7 million people were told to evacuate. Milton also makes the first time there have been three hurricanes happening simultaneously in the Atlantic, though Hurricanes Leslie and Kirk are not currently expected to make landfall. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-desantis-update-milton/	2024-10-07T06:24:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-2161724853.jpg?w=900
Dolly Parton, Walmart announce millions in donations to Helene vi...	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — Dolly Parton announced significant donations to flood relief at a Friday event in Newport, Tennessee. The music icon, speaking at a Walmart, said she was making a $1 million donation to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing immediate assistance to Hurricane Helene flood victims. Parton's Dollywood Foundation and her businesses in East Tennessee — Dollywood Parks &amp; Resorts, Dolly Parton’s Stampede and Pirates Voyage Dinner &amp; Show — matched her donation, bringing the total contributions to $2 million. 'We wish that we were all together for another reason, but we all have seen the devastation. I mean, who knew in our little part of the country here, where I was born, raised just right down the road, that we would have this kind of devastation?' Parton asked. How you can help after Helene 'And I look around and I think 'These are my mountains, these are my valleys. These are my people and this is my home.'' Eugene Naughton, the president of the Dollywood Company, spoke just before Parton, reflecting on the 2016 fires in Sevier County, and how they proved how resilient the community is. 'Just one week ago, thousands of lives again were impacted across East Tennessee, Western North Carolina and points beyond, and while in Sevier County we were spared the major damage, the lessons we learned from the Smoky Mountain wildfire, those of resilience, those of determination, and those of love for others, led us to reach out to our neighbors to determine how we could help following the recent flooding,' Naughton said. During the event, Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner announced the company, including Sam’s Club and the Walmart Foundation, would also be donating a total of $10 million to hurricane relief efforts across the affected states. Part of the money will be going to the East Tennessee Foundation. Furner said his family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, in 1979, and he had watched as Walmart expanded into Appalachia and East Tennessee. Close Thank you for signing up!

Not until the media leaves, but until we recover, and that's what's going to happen here, we're going to recover,' said Furner. Dollywood had already worked with its sponsorship partner Coca-Cola to donate a semi-truck full of water for distribution in Cocke County. Dollywood has also donated 60,000 reusable masks, 30,000 disposable protective garments and 2.5 million disposable masks to be used for cleanup efforts across East Tennessee. In conjunction with the donation centers established by the city of Pigeon Forge, Dollywood will become a donation drop-off location for those wishing to donate cleanup items and necessities. Dolly Parton announces donations to Helene relief at an event in Tennessee on Friday. (WATE) Wrapping up the event, Parton answered a few questions, including one asking what she would say to those who have lost everything. 'I know it's easy for us to say, 'Oh, things are going to get better' when things are still really bad. All we can say is that 'We are with you, we love you. We hope that things get better real soon and we're going to do our part to try to make that possible,'' she said. Fact-checking scam claims about Hurricane Helene Parton is well known for her philanthropy work throughout the region, especially in times of disaster. In 2021, Parton donated a portion of ticket sales from Dollywood and her many dinner shows to help those affected by flooding in Middle Tennessee. Parton was also involved with the Dollywood Foundation’s My People Fund, which gave $1,000 to Sevier County families whose homes were uninhabitable or destroyed by the 2016 Sevier County wildfires. In total, more than $9 million was raised during a star-studded telethon, allowing Parton to surprise the families being helped through the fund with a final $5,000 check. On Thursday, reports emerged that another country star from East Tennessee, Morgan Wallen, had reached out to Governor Bill Lee to offer assistance to victims of flooding. Earlier in the week, Red Cross officials confirmed that Wallen’s foundation had donated half a million dollars toward the relief efforts after Hurricane Helene.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/dolly-parton-helene/	2024-10-07T06:17:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-2024-10-04T145923.612-e1728072268435.jpg?w=800
US braces for protests 1 year after Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel	(NewsNation) — Cities throughout the United States are bracing for protests on the first anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. Monday marks one year since Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out an attack in which 1,200 people in Israel were killed and around 250 taken hostage. Some events began over the weekend and additional protests and rallies are expected Monday. Former Hamas hostage urges release of Israelis still held captive Oct. 7 commemorative events Several thousand people could attend a rally in Washington, D.C., that a Christian nonprofit organized in support of Israel. Leaders at Columbia University also issued a notice to students Monday, saying the campus could be the site of major gatherings for the anniversary. The university campus has been home to several pro-Palestinian protests over the past few months. School staff said extra security will be on hand Monday and students may notice more dividers and barricades. Some events began over the weekend, including thousands who marched through downtown Washington and gathered near the White House to show solidarity with Palestine. Crowds also gathered near Times Square in New York City, where some people waved Palestinian and Lebanese flags. Others protested against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The group If Not Now has called for an end to U.S. support for Israel and plans to host events in cities including Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago to honor lives lost during the war. Antisemitic incidents reach fever pitch Meanwhile, antisemitic incidents in the United States have reached an all-time, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The group recorded more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S., including bomb threats against synagogues, assaults against Jewish students on school campuses and online harassment. That’s the most incidents ever recorded in a single year since the ADL began tracking that data in 1979. This year’s numbers are three times higher compared to the same period last year. Abigail Edan’s aunt says ‘we need a deal’ on Oct. 7 anniversary Many of those incidents have involved verbal or written harassment, but some included vandalism and physical attacks, according to the ADL. 'The attacks by Hamas, by Hezbollah and the Houthis and the direct onslaught by the largest patron of antisemitic terrorism, Iran, have sparked a fire here in the U.S. and throughout the world,' the ADL wrote in a post commemorating the anniversary. 'While antisemitic incidents had already been on the rise, these attacks threw fuel onto the fire.' Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, threats to the status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed thousands, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/october-7-israel-hamas-anniversary-protests/	2024-10-07T04:51:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24160483884903.jpg?w=900
Israelis remember Oct. 7 attacks one year later	(NewsNation) — It's been one year since Hamas militants launched a surprise cross-border attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Israelis marked the somber occasion Monday and are still pressing for the release of the around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. As Israelis mourned the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel. Abigail Edan’s aunt says ‘we need a deal’ on Oct. 7 anniversary Now, tensions in the Middle East continue to brew as fighting between Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran wages on. The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants’ resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population. As fears of a wider regional war grow across the Middle East, about 20 Hezbollah rockets rained down on northern Israel overnight, injuring at least nine people. These attacks followed a bombardment on Hezbollah targets just outside Beirut in Lebanon.

Moments of silence, prayers and sunrise memorials around the world have honored those killed during the Hamas attacks. New film documents Oct. 7 attacks after first anniversary At Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community of about 400 people lived not far from the Israel-Gaza border. One year ago from Monday, about a quarter of the kibbutz's residents were killed or taken hostage. Today, the scars of those attacks are still evident. 'One year ago, there were 400 people here, and now, it's totally empty,' Dani Lifshitz, the grandson of two Israelis taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, told NewsNation. He continued, 'We didn't move one day. This place, we feel we are on Oct. 7, 2023. A year didn't pass for us.' Since the attacks, Lifshitz grandmother was returned to Israel. However, his grandfather remains in Hamas' captivity. 'This was a heaven, and now this is hell,' Lifshitz said. Benjamin Netanyahu reflects on Oct. 7 anniversary Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel 'arose as a nation as lions' following the Oct. 7 attack a year ago. 'We remember our fallen, our hostages — whom we are committed to return — our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,' Netanyahu said at a memorial commemorating the anniversary of the attack. He visited the memorial in Jerusalem for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in the attack. He spoke alongside the mayor of Jerusalem as the two held a small tribute at an event that appeared closed to the public. Netanyahu has faced heavy criticism for security lapses that allowed the attack to unfold and mass protests over his failure to return remaining hostages.

Supreme Court taking the bench with ghost guns, a capital case an...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is taking the bench again on Monday, ready to hear cases on ghost guns, a death sentence and transgender rights. The docket doesn’t have quite as many blockbuster cases as it did last term, when its rulings included an opinion granting broad immunity to former President Donald Trump. Still, it’s possible that the conservative-majority court could yet be asked to intervene in election disputes after the ballots are cast in November. The justices also stayed relatively busy during their summer break. The orders they issued on emergency appeals included a refusal to restore President Joe Biden’s student loan plan and a partial approval of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship to vote. The new term also opens against the backdrop of low public trust in the Supreme Court, and continued debate about whether their newly adopted code of ethics should have an enforcement mechanism. Here’s a look at some of the cases coming up: Ghost gun regulations The justices will hear a case Tuesday on regulations for ghost guns, privately made weapons that are hard for police to track because they don't have a serial number. The number of the firearms found at crime scenes has soared in recent years, from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2021, according to Justice Department data. The numbers have been declining in multiple cities since the Biden administration began requiring background checks and age verification for ghost gun kits that can be bought online. But manufacturers and gun rights groups argue that the administration overstepped and the rule should be overturned. Doubts about a death sentence In the decades since Richard Glossip was sentenced to die over a 1997 murder-for-hire scheme, the case has become a rare one where prosecutors are conceding mistakes. Oklahoma’s Republican attorney general has joined with Glossip in seeking to overturn his murder conviction and death sentence. Despite those doubts, an Oklahoma appeals court has upheld Glossip’s conviction, and the state’s pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency. The court will hear arguments in his case on Wednesday. Transgender rights Perhaps the court's most closely watched case so far this year is a fight over transgender rights. The case over state bans on gender-affirming care comes as Republican-led states enact a variety of restrictions, including school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people, though Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students. The justices will weigh a Tennessee law that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. The case does not yet have a hearing date, but will likely be argued in December.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/supreme-court/ap-supreme-court-taking-the-bench-with-ghost-guns-a-capital-case-and-transgender-rights-on-the-docket/	2024-10-07T04:06:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6703c0c4b66fa3.06856219.jpeg?w=900
New analysis suggests national debt could increase under Harris, ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris' and Donald Trump's economic plans. The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. That's even though the vice president's campaign insists her proposed investments in the middle class and housing would be fully offset by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Her campaign policy guide states that Harris is 'committed to fiscal responsibility — making investments that will support our economy, while paying for them and reducing the deficit at the same time.' The same analysis says former President Trump's ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. That's even though he suggests growth would be so strong under his watch that no one would need to worry about deficits. The 34-page report released by the fiscal watchdog group puts a spotlight on the issue of government borrowing that will confront the winner of November's election. Total federal debt held by the public now tops $28 billion and is expected to keep climbing as revenues can't keep up with the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The analysis noted that the expense of servicing that debt in dollar terms has 'eclipsed the cost of defending our nation or providing health care to elderly Americans.' Drawing on the candidates' speeches, campaign documents and social media posts, the analysis warns bluntly: 'Debt would continue to grow faster than the economy under either candidates’ plans and in most scenarios would grow faster and higher than under current law.' Neither candidate has meaningfully stressed budget deficit reduction in their pitch to voters. But multiple analyses show a clear difference of Harris being much more fiscally responsible than Trump. Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the top economist in the Obama White House, estimated in an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal that Harris' plans could cut deficits by $1.5 trillion or raise them by $1.5 trillion. Meanwhile, his estimates show that Trump's plans would increase deficits by $5 trillion, though that figure does not include his plans to charge no taxes on overtime pay and scrap the limit on deductions of state and local taxes. There are other estimates by The Budget Lab at Yale and the Penn Wharton Budget Model that also show Harris would be better at keeping the deficit in check. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis estimates that Harris' policy ideas could add $3.5 trillion to the national debt through 2035. That conclusion depends on its treatment of how much various programs could cost. It forecasts that Harris would implement $4.6 trillion in tax reductions, including extensions of some of the expiring 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed into law and tax breaks for parents and no taxes on tipped income for hospitality workers. Roughly $4 trillion in higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy would be insufficient to cover the total cost of her agenda and the additional interest on the debt that it could generate. Still, the analysis notes that its numbers depend on various interpretations of what Harris has said. It's possible that Harris' agenda would add nothing to baseline deficits, but the report also said it might plausibly add as much as $8.1 trillion in debt in what appears to be a worse-case scenario. By contrast, Trump's ideas would likely add another $7.5 trillion to the debt. His $2.7 trillion in tariff revenues would be unable to cover $9.2 trillion in tax cuts and additional expenditures such as $350 billion to secure the border and deport unauthorized immigrants. But the analysis includes other possibilities that show far higher deficits under Trump. If his tariffs raised less money and there were higher costs for his mass deportations and tax breaks, the national debt could jump by $15.2 trillion. On the other hand, if the tariffs raised $4.3 trillion and there were no costs tied to deportations, Trump's plans could only increase the debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-new-analysis-suggests-national-debt-could-increase-under-harris-but-it-would-surge-under-trump/	2024-10-06T21:06:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67035f83d17090.55349456.jpeg?w=900
Abigail Edan's aunt says 'we need a deal' on Oct. 7 anniversary	(NewsNation) —The great aunt of Abigail Edan, a 4-year-old American girl who was held hostage in Gaza for several weeks at the start of the war, joins 'NewsNation Prime' on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks to call for peace. Liz Naftali said a cease-fire is necessary and nothing good will come of continued violence. 'I really just say to everybody, and I say this to the Palestinian people, and I say this to the Israelis, and for the world to understand there is no good that will keep coming from this fighting,' Naftali said. 'Diplomacy now is what we need. And we need a deal.' Israel-Hamas war will affect generations: Humanitarian worker She addressed the remaining hostages and their families directly, assuring 'there is love from so many places in this world, and so many people are fighting for their freedom.' She said those working to free hostages include President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump and other major political figures. 'I'm not a diplomat, I'm not a politician, but I've been doing this now for a year, and what I know is that until these people come home, and until the people in Gaza are able to receive the dignity and security they need this region and these families, families cannot move forward,' Naftali said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/oct-7-anniversary-abigail-edan-hostage-aunt/	2024-10-06T18:55:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/230632CA1ED7487C875D7EA79D27254D.jpg?w=603
New film documents Oct. 7 attacks after first anniversary	(NewsNation) — A French-Israeli filmmaker says the international response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, particularly pro-Palestinian demonstrations at American universities, compelled him to create a documentary about the conflict. Pierre Rehov, speaking from Ashdod, Israel, said he was disturbed by reactions that seemed to excuse the attack. 'I was expecting all cities in the world, all people, everybody in the streets of Washington and Paris with T-shirts saying 'I'm Israel,'' Rehov said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' 'It was exactly the opposite.' Rehov said he began working on the documentary, titled 'Pogroms,' after United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made comments that Rehov felt inappropriately connected Hamas' actions to the Palestinian situation. Israel-Hamas war will affect generations: Humanitarian worker The filmmaker experienced the attack firsthand, awakening to air raid sirens at 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 7. He recalled receiving a warning from a friend to lock his doors and windows because 'Palestinians are invading Israel.' Rehov said he was unable to reach his wife, who was staying closer to the Gaza border, for two hours. The documentary aims to explain the political and historical background of the conflict, Rehov said. About 100 hostages remain in Hamas custody one year after the attack. What to know: The Israel-Hamas war Protests have been taking place across the world since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war which erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed thousands, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The Plot to Kill Trump: Back to Butler American officials and Israeli leaders are striving to discourage Iran and other neighboring countries from further escalating tensions in the region. However, the Palestinian issue is a powder keg among the Arab populace who believe that the Palestinians have been denied the promised two-state solution outlined in the Oslo Accords decades ago. Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, threats to the status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners. On the Israeli side, there’s immense anger and a strong push to bring the remaining hostages back, a goal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is committed to achieving through this military offensive.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/oct-7-attacks-documentary-movie/	2024-10-06T18:06:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/45B826CBE97C63A2FAD7614F1C1A5DF0.jpg?w=900
Did migrants from Hamas cross into US after Oct. 7?	(NewsNation) — Just weeks after the deadly Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza, border patrol agents were warned of related actors attempting cross into the United States. According to a memo to U.S. border patrol agents obtained by NewsNation, potential foreign terrorist fighters engaged in the Israel-Hamas conflict and with potential ties to Hamas or Hezbollah could be entering the United States via the southern border. The document, circulated among CBP agents and shared by the San Diego Customs and Border Protection office, specifically mentions Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Hezbollah. At the time of the memo, federal agents on the border were already overwhelmed by record numbers of migrants crossing into the U.S. FEMA says no disaster relief money was spent on migrant aid Nearly one year later, more than 460 individuals on the terror 'watch list' have been apprehended by border patrol and field operations agents. In February, an Afghan migrant on the list was arrested after spending nearly a year in the U.S. During his time in the states, he was twice released back into the country. In June, eight Tajik nationals were arrested for potential ties to ISIS. At least three of these individuals on the terror watch list entered the country legally through the CBP One App — and were later released. In August, three Palestinian Nationals and one Turkish national entered the U.S. illegally and were found to have terrorist ties. Explainer: How immigrants end up on ICE’s non-detained docket On Friday, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a joint statement saying that Oct. 7, 2024, could serve as the backdrop for violent extremists in the U.S. and globally. The agencies also say the threat is not only from organized foreign terrorist groups, but from individuals. They say that online messaging highlighting the October 7 anniversary could inspire people to act alone, attacking with little or no warning. In a separate notice, the FBI said that 'it is essential to be watchful for threats against Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities and institutions and to immediately contact law enforcement to report any suspicious activity.'

Israel-Hamas war will affect generations: Humanitarian worker	(NewsNation) — Palestinians in Gaza are facing severe shortages of basic necessities and 'nightmarish' conditions as Israel's military campaign enters its twelfth month, a humanitarian worker said Sunday on NewsNation's 'Morning in America.' 'We've reached the point where we need everything,' said Bushra Khalidi, humanitarian policy lead at Oxfam, speaking from the West Bank. She described a dire situation where Gaza residents lack access to clean water, medical supplies and adequate nutrition. According to Khalidi, Gazans have access to only 4.74 liters of water per day, three times less than the minimum requirement. The conflict has also created approximately 25,000 child amputees, who now struggle to evacuate during ongoing military operations. 'People that have amputations now because of the war and those traumatic injuries, they can't flee, they can't go anywhere. They're just waiting for their fate,' Khalidi said. Israel intensifies bombardment of Gaza and southern Lebanon ahead of Oct. 7 anniversary Restrictions on aid deliveries have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Khalidi said that aid workers in Gaza haven't had access to fresh fruits, vegetables, or meat for weeks or months. Medical facilities are running short on essential supplies, including gauze and anesthetics needed for surgeries. The conflict has also disrupted education, with children out of school for the entire year. Khalidi warned of long-term traumatic impacts that will affect 'generations of children.' Palestinian health authorities estimate the death toll in Gaza has reached 41,800, with 90,000 wounded since Israel's offensive began following Hamas's October 7th attack. The exact numbers remain difficult to verify due to widespread destruction and limited access to aid organizations. Khalidi, who said her own home in Jerusalem's Old City was forcibly entered by settlers in June, called for an immediate cease-fire to allow humanitarian organizations to conduct proper needs assessments and begin addressing the crisis. 'It's going to take only years just to remove the rubble out of Gaza,' she said. 'So imagine rehabilitating an entire civilian population.'

Couple reunited after volunteer rescue pilot threatened with arre...	LAKE LURE, N.C. (WJZY) — For a split second, it sounded like thunder. Mike and Susan Coffey were sitting in silence, trying to figure out what was happening outside their Lake Lure home as the winds and rain from Hurricane Helene hammered the North Carolina mountains. The Coffeys and their cat were the only two living beings inside their mountainside home that sits along the Broad River. In the next split-second, they both knew the sounds below them weren't coming from the heavens. They didn't know it then, but they were hearing millions of gallons of flood waters, raining down hell along the river's path through Lake Lure. 'We started to hear a lot of noise,' Susan said, recounting the moment to Nexstar's WJZY. 'Rumbling. Rumbling – wasn't thunder. What's this weird rumbling?' SC pilot flying volunteer supply and rescue missions ordered out of Lake Lure under arrest threat 'Trees, falling rocks… so it got a little bit frightening at that point,' Mike said. 'We said we'd better get to higher ground, just in case. So, we grabbed the cat, a couple bottles of water, a bag of chips; like we were really thinking. And got in our cars and drove up the driveway, which was probably 30 feet higher and parked in the cul-de-sac and parked our cars against the mountainside.' From some 80 feet above the river, the Coffeys watched the earth that held their mountainside home disappear as everything they had washed away with the raging flood waters below. The Seidhoms photographed this cliff where the Coffey home once stood in the town of Lake Lure. This is the area where Jordan and Landon Seidhom landed their helicopter on Sept. 29, 2024, after spotting Susan Coffey waving for help near the cliff's edge. (Credit: Jordan and Landon Seidhom) 'We watched our house go,' Mike told WJZY's Chief Investigator Jody Barr in an interview on Oct. 3. 'The cliff just dropped that whole side of the road, the cliff just dropped off. All of the trees and dirt and everything else just started collapsing. We saw the house next to us where its back deck went over and it was hanging for a while. About 2 hours later, that house went.' 'Another house down the street from us, so we just kind of watched that whole area slide down and into the river.' The Coffeys thought they — and the strip of asphalt left beneath their cars — might go next. They could see the flood waters chipping away at the mountainside. Within a few yards of eroding the rest of the road and the cul-de-sac out from under them, it all just stopped. The couple spent Thursday night in their car. There was no need to ask how much they slept that night since one could imagine it likely wasn't much. This is the cliff where the Coffey home once stood. It's also the spot where volunteer pilot Jordan Seidhom landed his helicopter on Sept. 29, 2024, and rescued Susan Coffey before he was forced out of Lake Lure by threat of arrest from Lake Lure Asst. Fire Chief Chris Melton. (Credit: Jordan Seidhom) Once the storm passed, the Friday morning sun revealed a new world. Very little of the life they built on that mountainside was there. The couple knew they were in trouble. The food and water they had inside the house were somewhere downriver. 'Luckily, the house next door was under construction so they had left some equipment and there was a pickup truck that was parked there. I saw a cooler in the back in the cab and so I opened it up, and there was water and a thing of cranberry juice and some Mountain Dew that he wouldn’t drink,' Susan Coffey joked as she turned to her husband during Thursday's video call. 'There was some beer like, well, that would be dehydrating. I don't want that, but if we're desperate, well, we'll take it. So, it just gave us a lifeline for another day that we knew we had some water to have so that was just such a blessing. It was a relief to find that.' But it didn't last. 'Friday night, we had no water,' Susan said. 'We had potato chips, which were also dehydrating and that was a great pick. But by the next morning, we were starting to get worried again about what we would have to be able to drink.' This aerial photograph taken on Oct. 3, 2024, by volunteer helicopter pilot Jordan Seidhom shows the cul-de-sac where Susan and Mike Coffey sat in their vehicle after the home was washed away in Hurricane Helene's flood waters. The black SUV is still parked there, days after the storm, and the road leading up to the cul-de-sac no longer exists. Friday night was another night spent in their car. Luckily, Susan said, they had filled their car with gas and could charge their phones. The problem was that cell service in the storm's path was impossible to reach. 'We did find some cell service, and called a friend to let them know so they could call emergency services and let them know our location,' Susan recalled. 'We started to see helicopters go over. So, every time we heard a copter, we'd just run out and start waving. There was a big pile of rocks at the house next door. So, we did a big S.O.S. sign in the cul-de-sac with the rocks and just [tried] at the moment to stay positive and not worry too much.' The pair had a bit of hope on Saturday when they said two Lake Lure Fire Department personnel hiked in from across the mountain to tell the Coffeys they'd be rescued by a helicopter. A chopper — the couple said it appeared to be the National Guard — came back later that day, but couldn't get to them. 'It was too big, and it just had no place, safe place to land. So, then they said they'd have to airlift us out and we just didn't know when that would be,' Susan said. 'So they gave us some hope there, right? So we thought we were going to get out Saturday and then, you know, just kept watching helicopters fly overhead a lot,' Mike told WJZY. 'Every time we heard a 'copter, we would run out there: 'Is this it? Is this it?' No, go back to the car,' Susan said. 'So, yeah, we were ... we were alert, just always – the adrenaline is just so high, you're just so on alert. We were told you don't miss it, you don't want to miss it. But then when it started to get dark, and we realized they were not going to do helicopter rescues in the dark. So, we had another night there.' Emergency crew looked 'very, very annoyed' 'I don't think we ever ran out of hope. We had each other, and that was the main thing,' Mike Coffey said when asked if they started to believe help wouldn't come by the third day after multiple helicopters had flown over without stopping. 'Sometimes you get a little scared and then you just stay in the moment and not worry too much. And we knew that people knew where we were, so worst case, we were going to swim ourselves, try and cross the river ourselves,' Susan said. 'We knew we could survive so long without food or water, we'll be okay. Like I said, we had the Mountain Dew as backup,' she joked. Not long after the sun rose Sunday morning, they heard the sweet sound of chopper blades ripping through the air. This is the small, black helicopter Susan and Mike Coffey waved down on Sunday, Sept. 29, 2024, after spending nearly three days on an eroded mountainside in Lake Lure, N.C. after floodwaters from Hurricane Helene washed their home into the river 50 feet below. (Credit: Jordan Seidhom) 'And then we saw this small black helicopter fly and we were waving at it and it stopped,' Susan said, 'It circled over us. And so, I thought, oh, maybe the National Guard sent a smaller helicopter to get us because they knew their big ones were just weren't good for that area.' But, it wasn't a government worker coming to their aid, it was Jordan Seidhom, the owner of a scrap steel recycling business in Pageland, South Carolina. He's also a pilot, former head of the Chesterfield County drug unit, reserve law enforcement officer, and volunteer firefighter — among other jobs. He decided the day after the storm to use his own helicopter on his own dime to answer the cries for help he read on social media within hours of the storm passing. Susan and Mike Coffey were stranded on a mountainside near Lake Lure, N.C. after flood waters washed their homes away on Sept. 27, 2024. The couple was stranded for days without food and water until volunteer helicopter pilot Jordan Seidhom spotted them waving for help and turned around to rescue them. (Credit: Jordan and Landon Seidhom) Seidhom and his 1,400 flight hours decided to load his son, a junior in high school and a volunteer fireman in Pageland, into their chopper to fly into the disaster zone to deliver food and water. Along the way on Saturday, they happened to pluck four people off a mountainside. Seidhom, a veteran pilot, said there were no flight restrictions anywhere near Lake Lure when he decided to fly there on Saturday and Sunday. The Federal Aviation Administration issues flight restrictions and post those to digital flight-mapping software accessible to pilots all across the country. Then on Sunday, the Seidhoms spotted Susan Coffey frantically waving for help. 'So when this helicopter actually landed just at the very end of the driveway where it had fallen off, they're able to land it at the very end of the driveway, a little bit on the road, we were just amazed,' Susan said, initially thinking it would be another failed mission to save them. Seidhom landed his helicopter near the edge of the cliff and hopped out to speak with the Coffeys. Because he didn't want to place too much weight on the unstable ground, Seidhom said he told the Coffeys he'd take them one by one to a nearby command post he spotted about three minutes away. The sun highlighted Susan Coffey's red covering as she rode alongside volunteer rescue pilot, Jordan Seidhom, as he flew her to rescue crews on Sunday, Sept. 29, 2024. Minutes later, Seidhom said he was threatened with arrest if he didn't leave the area. (Source: Jordan and Landon Seidhom) Seidhom loaded Susan into the helicopter and asked his son to stay with Mike as he delivered the couple to safety. Seidhom lifted off and flew Mrs. Coffey to the Lake Lure Fire Department post just downriver. 'He found a safe place to land, on a street that was in front of a bunch of some firemen, policemen, and some National Guardsmen. So we land, and I get out of the helicopter, and I go towards them,' Susan said, 'And they're just standing there looking very mad and very annoyed. And said, 'Who are you?' And I didn't realize [Seidhom] had just taken it upon himself, followed his heart to come help rescue people. And communication is so down, it's hard to know who to let know that he has this free airspace, that he can go do this.' Seidhom was explaining who he was to the first responders, and said he was first greeted by two leaders of a fire department out of Michigan. Those men, Seidhom said, were welcoming and gave him radio frequencies to communicate with them and began setting up a landing zone so he could continue delivering people to the post. But, Seidhom told WJZY that Lake Lure Fire and Emergency Management Asst. Chief Chris Melton jumped into the mix, ordering him out of the area and threatened to have him arrested if he didn't go. Mike Coffey comforts his wife, Susan, as the pair describe finding one another hours after she was rescued by a volunteer chopper pilot, but her husband was left stranded after Lake Lure Fire Asst. Chief Chris Melton ordered the pilot to leave under threat of arrest on Sept. 29, 2024. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) Susan Coffey witnessed some of the exchange: '[Seidhom] was telling them who he was and what he was doing, and they just were not happy. They weren't happy about it. And [Melton] said, this is our mission, this is our operation, we can't just have you flying in and out. Jordan was telling them, 'Well, I can't just leave her husband, I don't want to separate a family. So, if you just let me go back and get her husband and then I'll bring him here, then I'll take my son. Then we'll go,'' she recalled. 'I thought, that's reasonable, it saves the National Guard a trip,' Susan said. 'You know, one less person they have to save.' She didn't hear and didn't know that Melton had threatened Seidhom with arrest if he didn't leave. 'I'm going back and get my copilot,' Seidhom recalled telling Melton, 'He said, 'If you turn around and go back up the mountain, you're going to be arrested.' I said, 'Well, sir, I'm going to get my copilot. I don't know what to tell you.' And he said, 'I'm letting you know,'' Seidhom said. Volunteer helicopter pilot Jordan Seidhom regrets he didn't force Lake Lure Asst. Fire Chief Chris Melton to arrest him in the middle of his volunteer rescue mission of Mike and Susan Coffey on Sept. 29, 2024. Seidhom said if he had not had his son with him, he would have carried out saving the Coffeys and suffered whatever consequence Melton imposed on him. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) 'At that point, he waved for two law enforcement officers to come over and told me that, again, if I go back up the mountain, I will be arrested,' Seidhom said, 'There was a conversation before I left again, just trying to de-escalate the situation and speak with him and say, 'Hey, you know, I'm right here. I've already brought one person down and I'm willing to help. Can I please go back and get this other victim?' And his response was just, 'you need to leave the area.'' 'And he just would not allow me to do it,' Seidhom recalled. 'As I was actually leaving to go back to get my son, the original chief or captain (Michigan crew) that I spoke to his crew and himself, they came back over and said, 'Hey, man, we can't tell you to go get the victim. We can't even ask you to go get the victim, but we can tell you if you come back with the victim, we'll have you a designated landing spot and we'll make sure they don't come over here.'' Believing Melton was intent on having him hauled off to jail, Seidhom decided to get his son out of there and regroup another day. When Seidhom lifted off from the command post, he went back to the mountainside to get his son and informed Mr. Coffey he would not be able to save him. Jordan Seidhom said as soon as he left Lake Lure, N.C. on Sept. 29, 2024, he started researching to find out who Asst. Chief Chris Melton was. Seidhom said he found Melton's contact page on the town's website and confirmed Melton's identity from a photograph posted there and on social media. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) 'When I got to the door, he said, 'I am so sorry, but I'm told if I bring you back that I'm going to be arrested and I can't take you back with me. And in fact, I was told I couldn't come get my co-pilot, my son, and I just told him I'm not going to leave my son here,'' Mike Coffey recalled of the conversation with the pilot from Pageland. 'He said, 'I am so sorry. I don't know what to tell you, but I need to take my son and we're going to leave.' ''They've told me they're aware of where you are and you will be rescued,' and he took off,' Coffey recounted. 'He takes off, I had no idea where my wife was. I couldn't comprehend what was going on. Like, how did this make sense?' Mr. Coffey told WJZY. 'And when, if ever, I was going to be reunited with her, how long it would take for some other rescue crew to get back to me. So that was the most stressful part of the whole experience. I can watch my house go. I can watch our neighbors’ houses go. 'We were together, right? And we knew each other was safe. And when he left, that, that thought right just kind of disappeared, like okay, I don't know what's going to happen from here.' Mike decided to act. He took their cat carrier and his computer bag down the side of the cliff and spotted a rescue crew across the river. 'I was waving them down and I was able to get down the banks to our side of the river where I could at least yell and communicate across the river, saying, 'Do you have my wife? Do you know where my wife is?' And they were giving me the thumbs up,' Mike said. Instead of the three-minute chopper ride to safety, Mike Coffey was now faced with having to cross the raging river, full of storm debris, mud, and who knows what else. It was a rescue effort that would take the next hour of his life. This still frame taken from a video Jordan Seidhom recorded on Oct. 3, 2024, shows the exact spot in the river where Mike Coffey was roped to safety on Sept. 29, 2024. Coffey said the river was flowing heavily and littered with storm debris on Sunday when he was rescued. (Credit: Jordan Seidhom) 'This was a crew out of Michigan, and they were great. There were, I think, three of them and a guy from Chimney Rock who swam, one of them swam across the river with a rope. And the very first thing he said to me was, 'Are you okay? Are you Mike Coffey? We've got your wife, so she's safe.'' Coffey said one of the rescuers took his cat carrier and another got his computer bag and through a series of ropes, the group crossed the river. 'Those guys also, they came down from Michigan. They don't know us from anybody. They were willing to put their lives on the line. They're also heroes in that story,' Coffey said. Once across, Coffey was loaded into a shuttle bus and taken to a nearby shelter. It would take a few hours before the Coffeys found one another again. Susan Coffey was still waiting at the command post, watching shuttle buses pass. One eventually stopped. 'When the bus came back to get me and then I see the doors open and Mike's head sticks out, oh, my God. I was so relieved that he was picked up and that we were back together,' Susan said, 'It's one of those things; we met in the parking lot. We're hugging and crying, just so relieved to have found each other again.' Seidhom still regrets not finishing the job on that mountainside that day. 'I'm sorry, if I had to do it over again, I would have stopped and I would have rescued as many people until they decided they were going to arrest me,' Seidhom told WJZY the day after the threat. Jordan Seidhom holds his phone out as he plays a voicemail from a family member pleading for help to rescue her parents stranded on a mountaintop somewhere in the disaster zone in the North Carolina mountains. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) 'He got my wife and at his own cost, at a risk to himself,' Mike Coffey told WJZY. 'He was the one person who actually stopped to help just because he could. I mean, he got in his helicopter and flew up there just because he knew he could make a difference to someone, and he did. He’s a hero.' 'I'm sure everyone's stressed in that scenario, but he was following his heart and doing the right thing,' Mike said. 'And maybe there were rules that somebody would like to impose order on the chaos, but the bottom line is getting those people out of there. And even if I had never been rescued, knowing that she was safe because he did what he did would have been enough. So, thank you, Jordan. Thank you.' Melton won't speak with WJZY, but makes appearance WJZY spent nearly four days waiting for Assistant Fire Chief Melton to respond to multiple attempts to request an interview with him, hoping to hear his side and his reasons for ordering Seidhom out of Lake Lure — and whether he would have carried out his threat to have the volunteer pilot arrested in the middle of an active rescue mission. Lake Lure Asst. Fire Chief Chris Melton did not respond to any messages sent to him by WJZY's Chief Investigator Jody Barr in the days leading up to our reporting. Although he wasn't available, this still image from a video interview between Barr and Lake Lure Town Manager Olivia Stewman shows a man who appears to be Melton opening Stewman's door during the interview and an unidentified woman off camera waving him out. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) But Melton never responded, even after the town's media contact, Laura Krejci, responded to a Facebook message confirming Melton received WJZY's request to speak with him a few days earlier. Still, knowing Melton was likely actively involved in the efforts there and knowing communication lines were potentially unavailable, WJZY did not publish Melton's identity. By Thursday, WJZY was ready to publish this follow-up report and informed the town a final request to speak with Melton before publishing had been made. Krejci responded, telling WJZY she would make Lake Lure Town Manager Olivia Stewman available for an interview. On Thursday, just past 2:30 p.m., Stewman and Barr met via video conference for an interview. Chris Melton has still not responded to any of WJZY's messages. Although he was not available to interview, a man who appeared to be Melton opened the door to the room where Stewman was participating in the interview. An unidentified person off camera frantically waved to the man to leave. The man's face is visible in the background of the video conference video recording. Here's a partial transcript of the interview of the exchange between WJZY's Barr and Lake Lure's Stewman: BARR: 'What happened in that incident?' STEWMAN: 'The personal aircraft that landed was not only unauthorized but also, they provided no notification that they were coming. And that did pose a potential risk to ongoing operations with search and rescue. And then, you know, also just wasn't safe for them to be there as regular citizens, especially since we didn't know who they were or what they were doing there. We had multiple national, local and state resources. That includes the National Guard, NCHART (North Carolina Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team), SCHART, we had the Coast Guard, state troopers, and then there may have been more, as well. So, they were completing their operations. And you know, in order to do that there, they were not authorizing private aircraft at that time. Any aircraft that would have – that should have gone through there should have gone through incident command as well. I just wanted to note that.' BARR: 'The FAA website shows that there was no flight restriction in the area at that time. Do you agree with that?' STEWMAN: 'I'm not sure of that. I'm sorry. But it was FAA’s ultimate call to not allow that – not to allow private aircraft into that area.' BARR: 'In the days after the storm, through that Sunday morning, there was no restricted airspace in Lake Lure. The FAA did impose a temporary flight restriction after this encounter between Mr. Seidhom and the assistant fire chief, Melton. You all still contend today that no one should have been in that area trying to save these people who had been stranded for two days, headed into day two, next to day three?' NOTE: Within 30 minutes of Jordan Seidhom, the FAA issued a Temporary Flight Restriction for the area near Lake Lure. The FAA confirmed in an Oct. 3, 2024, email to Barr that no TFR was issued anywhere in the NC disaster zone before. STEWMAN: 'Correct. If anything, they should have at least notified Incident Command who would have authorized them or not authorized them to be in that area.' BARR: 'Do you know whether Mr. Seidhom spoke with the people in charge at the Rutherford Airport? The airport did not have power at the time, but the airport told Mr. Seidhom if he was going to conduct volunteer search and rescue operations, those were the only aircraft they were fueling and they sold Mr. Seidhom fuel to go in and sold him fuel to come back under that condition?' STEWMAN: 'I’m unaware of that.' BARR: 'Unaware of that?' STEWMAN: 'Yep.' BARR: 'Would that not be an effort to coordinate and communicate?' STEWMAN: 'If that was coordinated, then it was not relayed to us. I will say that.' BARR: 'Was there a way to relay that to you all with the communications in the shape they were in at that time?' STEWMAN: 'Communications have been tough. I know you're aware of that. Rutherford County EM (Emergency Management) has been communicating with us as best they can through radios at that time, we were still struggling more with the service, but they were communicating with radio. So, you know, we didn't get anything over the radio that I'm aware of that indicated that.' BARR: 'If someone were to fly into an airport, communicate with the people in charge, was sold fuel under the condition that he was there to do volunteer a search and rescue, and then he proceeded to land where he saw what he believed to be a command center and talk to people in charge there, would that not yet be another attempt to coordinate and communicate with the with the rescue efforts on the ground to let them know why he's there and what he was doing?' STEWMAN: 'Again, that should have gone through the chain of command at incident command.' BARR: 'Was that published anywhere? If someone were looking for incident command, where would they have found that information?' STEWMAN: 'I’m unaware of that.' BARR: 'Do you think that your people on the ground in Lake Lure did what they should have done when they handled this flooding victim that was delivered to them in the encounter between Assistant Chief Melton and this private pilot?' STEWMAN: 'Yes, sir. They were doing what they were supposed to do at that time. And, you know, I can't speak highly enough of Mr. Melton and all of our emergency personnel that's here right now. They've been out here for days on end, putting their lives on the line to save people. And, you know, they were doing their job.' BARR: 'Less than 24 hours later, private pilots were being asked to return to that area to do what Mr. Seidhom was doing at that time. Do you see how the public may look at that and go, well, that's a little perplexing? Just before he was severely endangering rescue efforts and then, you know, less than a day later, they're being begged to come back and help?' STEWMAN: 'Well, I can only imagine that they went through the correct chain of command to be authorized to come here.' BARR: 'What was the danger posed in what Mr. Seidhom did, the specific danger that day?' STEWMAN: 'Well, it interrupted operations of the people who were there from national, state, and local resources, one. And two, downtown Chimney Rock is in disarray right now. For someone who's not trained, not adequately, adequately trained in emergency operations, you know, especially at that time, they should not have been in that location.' BARR: 'Well, just some hours later, he was back in the area and the county welcomed him in to do exactly what he did just the day before. Do you think his training was significantly improved overnight?' STEWMAN: 'I think that it's not that we're turning away help or volunteerism at all. Once again, we just need to go through the right steps to do that. So we're aware, the state is aware, the county is aware, and the Town of Lake Lure, and the Village of Chimney Rock is aware of what's going on. That was not the case initially.' [ZOOM QUALITY BREAKS UP] BARR: 'Lake Lure’s position here is that because Mr. Seidhom did not go through whatever unpublished channel he was supposed to go through, that he should have maybe guessed the right way to do this, even though that right way to do this was nowhere to be found at that time?' STEWMAN: 'Again, we were listening to the FAA's direction, and at that time, that is what we were told, that there was no personnel or aircraft unless they went through the correct steps. And we are not aware that this individual did that.' BARR: 'Does the town understand that the way the FAA communicates with pilots is through restricting airspace and publishing that on the FAA website?' STEWMAN: 'I'm not sure, sir.' BARR: 'And there was no TFR until the encounter between your assistant fire chief and Mr. Seidhom.' STEWMAN: 'Okay.' BARR: 'The final question I have, the town of Lake Lure has no regrets about how Mr. or Mrs. Coffey were treated that day when a pilot showed up to help save their lives on the side of that mountain in Lake Lure?' STEWMAN: 'No, I want to reiterate again that our personnel, our public safety personnel, were doing what they were instructed to do at that time. They were doing their jobs, trying to save lives and they have been out there doing that since – I mean, they're doing that all the time. But, you know, out in this condition is worse than usual. And they're continuing to do that. We support them fully and we're going to continue to support them.' STEWMAN: 'We really just need some support, compassion, understanding and patience. That's really what we need from people right now, especially in this tough situation. You know, this is making it worse and, you know, we're just asking that people have some compassion and consideration.' BARR: 'Are you all welcoming those private helicopter pilots who have delivered food and water and medical supplies and are helping rescue human lives from the mountains around Lake Lure? You guys welcoming them now?' STEWMAN: 'That would need to go through the Rutherford County Emergency Management or the state Emergency Management.' BARR: 'I'm asking you as an official, the leader of Lake Lure, North Carolina, are you now welcoming those private helicopters in your community?' STEWMAN: 'Yes. If they go through the necessary channels.' Despite rumors published to social media channels on Friday, Asst. Chief Chris Melton was not terminated by the Town of Lake Lure. In a follow-up text after the interview, Barr asked whether the rumors were true and Stewman replied that Melton is still employed with the town.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/north-carolina-volunteer-rescue-pilot-helene/	2024-10-06T14:15:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/COFFEY-IN-CHOPPER-TIGHT-e1728221868441.jpg?w=800
Denver's marijuana industry records first recession since legaliz...	(NewsNation) — For the first time in Colorado's 11 years of recreational marijuana legalization, Denver's marijuana sales and revenue are consistently dropping. City data shows the descent began in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the first drop recorded in 2021. Compared to 2020's all-time high medical and retail sales of $715 million, the first seven months of 2024 have raked in a measly $180 million. Is the stock market in an AI bubble? Revenue goes hand in hand with these numbers. Since 2021's peak revenue of $72.9 million, profit has been consistently harder to come by. 2022 raked in $56.2 million, while 2023 recorded only $48.5 million. Shannon Donnelly, an adjunct professor of cannabis at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, told NewsNation local affiliate KDVR that Denver's dispensaries must now accommodate in-state purchases rather than traveler traffic. 'It’s no longer you can just make a dispensary and become rich,' Donnelley said. 'You have to have something that differentiates yourself.' Another Denver Department of Excise and Licenses spokesperson told KDVR that, since the pandemic, Colorado consumers might be budgeting more — and marijuana is no longer making the cut. IRS to crack down on winning gamblers Eric Escudero, spokesperson for the Denver Department of Excise and Licenses, echoed Donnelley's statement about supply and demand in an interview with Scripps News. 'Because legalization has spread across the United States, less people are coming to Denver to consume and purchase marijuana,' said Escudero. '[Businesses are] going to have to adapt.' According to DISA Global Solutions, which helps businesses with drug testing needs, marijuana is legal on some level in a vast majority of the states, with 25 boasting a 'fully legal' status.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/denver-marijuana-recession/	2024-10-06T13:52:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/66328749eee987.65967460.jpeg?w=900

Former Hamas hostage urges release of Israelis still held captive	(NewsNation) — Former Hamas hostage Aviva Siegel has urged all remaining Israeli hostages to be released on the eve of the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks. Siegel was released from captivity but her husband Keith remains in captivity. According to The New York Times, three other Israeli-Americans are still being held by Hamas. There are still 101 Israelis in captivity. Siegel was among them before being released in November. 'It's very, very difficult for all of us,' Siegel said of the anniversary. 'We really just can't believe that a year's passed and Keith and the hostages are still thrown on a faulty, dirty mattress underneath the ground and can hardly breathe.' A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Lebanon Siegel was released during the brief ceasefire in November, but peace seems a distant reality seven months on. 'I just can't believe it that Keith and the other hostages are still in Gaza, thrown underneath the ground with no human rights,' she added. On Friday, the FBI and DHS warned of the threat of violence on Oct. 7 in a statement. An Israeli airstrike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip killed at least 19 people on Sunday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/former-hamas-hostage-urges-release-israelis-captive/	2024-10-06T09:37:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e01dcf724fd8.06263600.jpeg?w=900
Tropical Storm Milton expected to become hurricane on Sunday: NHC	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Tropical Storm Milton is expected to become a hurricane on Sunday, and a major hurricane by midweek, according to the National Hurricane Center. In an 11 a.m. update, the NHC said their NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 'finds a stronger Milton.' It has current maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and is moving east at 5 mph. Tampa prepares for more severe weather this weekend The storm is located roughly 835 miles west-southwest of Tampa. Milton is forecasted to reach Category 3 major hurricane strength with 115 mph winds as it heads toward Florida’s Gulf Coast. The storm is expected to weaken to a Category 2 before making landfall midweek. WFLA The risk for life-threatening impacts continues to increase for parts of Florida's west coast, as the storm-force winds are extending outward up to 35 miles from the center. Hurricane and storm surge watches for Florida are likely to be made later on Sunday, the NHC said. A tropical storm watch is currently in effect for Mexico's Celestun to Cancun. WFLA’s Chief Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli said heavy downpours will begin Sunday as the first wave of moisture reaches Florida’s coast. TIMELINE: When a tropical threat could impact the Tampa Bay area 'Given that the ground is saturated after one of the rainiest wet seasons on record, any downpours will lead to flooding,' Berardelli said. WFLA Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be seen just where Milton will strike, it's clear that Florida is going to be hit hard. 'You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,' the governor said. 'Know your evacuation zone — there will be mandatory and voluntary evacuations.' Florida officials tell residents to 'get a plan' ahead of Milton 'I highly encourage you to evacuate' if you're in an evacuation zone, said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. 'We are preparing ... for the largest evacuation that we have seen, most likely since 2017, Hurricane Irma.' DeSantis said as many as 4,000 National Guard troops are helping the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the Florida Department of Transportation to remove debris ahead of the next storm, and he declared a state of emergency in 35 counties. He said Floridians should prepare for more power outages and disruption. 'All available state assets ... are being marshaled to help remove debris,' DeSantis said. 'We're going 24-7 ... it's all hands on deck.' FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said her agency is preparing for Milton and working with Florida 'to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall.' Hurricane Kirk and Hurricane Leslie The Atlantic hurricane season has become more active as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast continue to search for people unaccounted for in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which left a huge trail of death and catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains. Out in the Eastern Atlantic, Hurricanes Kirk and Leslie continue to strengthen, heading north in the open waters. Kirk continues to accelerate northeastward, bringing life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. While Leslie is slightly stronger Sunday morning, the hurricane is expected to gradually weaken over the next few days.

Harris, Walz to do several high-profile interviews this week	(NewsNation) — Often criticized for avoiding journalists since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris will be on TV, radio and online this week as she sits down for several high-profile interviews. The multi-media blitz begins Sunday with the release of Harris’ conversation with Alex Cooper on her podcast 'Call Her Daddy.' The Harris campaign said the show boasts a following of more than 2.4 million on Instagram and more than 3.9 million on TikTok. A senior Harris campaign official tells NewsNation that the conversation focuses on reproductive freedom, abortion access and other issues critical to women. Hillary Clinton: Misinformation targeting Harris will ramp up Harris will appear Monday night on '60 Minutes.' The interview with CBS Correspondent Bill Whitaker was conducted on Saturday. Harris will have a very busy Tuesday in New York, as she will be on ABC’s 'The View,' Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show and 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.' She then heads west for appearances in Las Vegas, including a Thursday town hall produced by Univision. Harris concludes the week with a visit to Arizona, where early voting is already underway. 5 takeaways from Harris’s MSNBC interview with Stephanie Ruhle Vice presidential nominee Tim Walz will also face the cameras, starting with a Sunday appearance on 'Fox News Sunday' – his first Sunday interview show appearance since becoming Harris’ running mate. He then makes his late-night talk show debut Monday in Los Angeles on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live.' Walz also sat for a '60 Minutes' interview, which will air on Monday. Walz is scheduled to conduct interviews with local reporters during stops in Nevada and Arizona on Tuesday and Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-walz-high-profile-interviews/	2024-10-06T08:34:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66c8ce8b7b2bf6.61731068.jpeg?w=900
The Plot to Kill Trump: Back to Butler	Watch Part 1 of the special report: The Plot to Kill Trump: What we know and what comes next (NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, three months after surviving an assassination attempt. 'Exactly 12 weeks ago, this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me,' Trump told the crowd at the Butler fairgrounds, where he was joined for the first time at a rally by Elon Musk. Security was noticeably heightened for Trump's return visit, with snipers positioned around the perimeter and increased local, state and federal law enforcement presence. A Senate investigation has revealed significant security failures leading up to the attempt. The Secret Service, which recently saw its director step down, acknowledged it failed to properly secure the perimeter and couldn't even determine who was in charge of various security assignments. This special report, 'The Plot to Kill Trump: Back to Butler,' explores the investigation, law enforcement failures and what went wrong. You can watch the full report in the player above. Trump Florida assassination attempt suspect: What we know Trump returns to Butler, Penn., with Musk in tow Musk joined Trump at his rally Saturday in Butler, the Pennsylvania city where the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt earlier this year. He took the stage on Saturday to praise the GOP presidential nominee and slam Democrats he claimed 'want to take away your right to vote, effectively.' 'The true test of someone’s character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who couldn’t climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot,' Musk said, swiping at President Biden. Before Trump’s entrance, his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, referred to the attempted assassination, joining in on the Democratic blame game. 'Even after that terrible assassination attempt that took one man’s life and nearly took many others, they continue to use dangerous, inflammatory rhetoric,' Vance said. 'The media has continued to call Donald Trump, the guy who actually won his primary, a threat to Democracy.' Trump began his rally with a moment of silence for the firefighter who was killed during the attack. Speaking at the same location, Trump said time stopped on July 13 and called the shooter an 'evil villain.' FBI investigating 'assassination' attempt on Trump Supporters: Butler rally was 'exciting,' not 'scary' Rallygoers Heather Hertig and Shelly Nadler attended both former President Donald Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania, rallies. Rather than be scared upon return to the small city where shots rang out, the pair told NewsNation's Brian Entin that Saturday's event felt like 'camaraderie.' 'You feel like a part of it. Now, instead of just coming to see Trump talk, it's more of an emotional, like you're a part of things ... It's not just an election. It's about togetherness,' Hertig told NewsNation. 'I felt like I needed to have some closure, because it was just so surreal when we were here the last time, and it was so traumatic,' Nadler added. Trump shooting: What was Thomas Matthew Crooks' motive? Why don't we know more about Thomas Crooks? Twelve weeks after the first attempt on Trump's life at a Pennsylvania rally, little is known about his shooter's motive and background. Local authorities spotted the accused shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, multiple times before he opened fire, including with a range finder at 5:38 p.m. Despite alerts to command, effective action wasn't taken before Crooks fired from the roof of a nearby building at 6:12 p.m. 'This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service,' said Ronald Rowe, the agency's acting director. 'It's important that we hold ourselves accountable.' Three months after the shooting, investigators have released little information about Crooks or his motives. While they know he planned the attack through internet searches and practice at a gun range, no manifesto or explanation has emerged. NewsNation's Sean Noone, Anna Kutz, Damita Menezes and The Hill contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/the-plot-to-kill-trump-back-to-butler/	2024-10-05T20:46:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-1.jpg?w=900
Death toll from Hurricane Helene rises to 227 as grim task of rec...	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — The death toll from Hurricane Helene inched up to 227 on Saturday as the grim task of recovering bodies continued more than a week after the monster storm ravaged the Southeast and killed people in six states. Helene came ashore Sept. 26 as a Category 4 hurricane and carved a wide swath of destruction as it moved northward from Florida, washing away homes, destroying roads and knocking out electricity and cellphone service for millions. The number of deaths stood at 225 on Friday; two more were recorded in South Carolina the following day. It was still unclear how many people were unaccounted for or missing, and the toll could rise even higher. Helene is the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. About half the victims were in North Carolina, while dozens more were killed in Georgia and South Carolina. The city of Asheville, in the western mountains of North Carolina, was particularly battered. A week later workers used brooms and heavy machinery to clean mud and dirt outside of New Belgium Brewing Company, which lies next to the French Broad River and is among thousands of city businesses and households affected. So far North Carolinians have received more than $27 million in individual assistance approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said MaryAnn Tierney, a regional administrator for the agency. More than 83,000 people have registered for individual assistance, according to the office of Gov. Roy Cooper. In Buncombe County, where Asheville is located, FEMA-approved assistance has surpassed $12 million for survivors, Tierney said Saturday during a news briefing. 'This is critical assistance that will help people with their immediate needs, as well as displacement assistance that helps them if they can’t stay in their home,' she said. She encouraged residents impacted by the storm to register for disaster assistance. 'It is the first step in the recovery process,' she said. 'We can provide immediate relief in terms of serious needs assistance to replace food, water, medicines, other life safety, critical items, as well as displacement assistance if you cannot stay in your home.' Helene’s raging floodwaters shocked mountain towns hundreds of miles inland and far from where the storm made landfall on Florida’s Gulf Coast, including in the Tennessee mountains that Dolly Parton calls home. The country music star has announced a $1 million donation to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing immediate assistance to Hurricane Helene flood victims. In addition, her East Tennessee businesses as well as the Dollywood Foundation are combining efforts, pledging to match her donation to Mountain Ways with a $1 million contribution. Parton said she feels a close connection to the storm victims because so many of them 'grew up in the mountains just like I did.' 'I can’t stand to see anyone hurting, so I wanted to do what I could to help after these terrible floods,' she said. 'I hope we can all be a little bit of light in the world for our friends, our neighbors — even strangers — during this dark time they are experiencing.' Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said the company, including Sam’s Club and the Walmart Foundation, would increase its commitment and donate a total of $10 million to hurricane relief efforts. In Newport, an eastern Tennessee town of about 7,000, residents continued cleaning up Saturday from the destruction caused by Helene's floodwaters. Mud still clung to the basement walls of one Main Street funeral home. The ground-floor chapel of another nearby was being dried out, a painting of Jesus still hanging on the wall in an otherwise barren room. Newport City Hall and its police department also took on water from the swollen Pigeon River. Some of the modest, one-story homes along its banks were destroyed, their walls crumbled and rooms exposed. Farther east in unincorporated Del Rio, along a bend in the French Broad River, residents and volunteers toiled to clean up. The smell of wood hung in the air as people used chainsaws to cut through downed trees, and Bobcats beeped as they moved mangled sheet metal and other debris. Many homes sustained damage, including one that slid off its foundation. ___ Associated Press journalists Jeff Roberson in Newport, Tennessee; Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa; and Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia, contributed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-death-toll-from-hurricane-helene-rises-to-227-as-grim-task-of-recovering-bodies-continues/	2024-10-05T18:31:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6701e9c894d259.76809491.jpeg?w=900

Harris visits North Carolina to survey Helene's aftermath one day...	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris visited North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene, arriving there one day after a stop in the state by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster. The vice president was greeted at the airport by Gov. Roy Cooper among others, and quickly headed into a briefing with emergency response officials about the recovery effort. Earlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed. The two have been vocal and visible about the government's willingness to help, and the administration's efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage. In a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund 'has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year.' He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program. More than 200 people have died. It's the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change. But in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states. Trump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn't doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene's aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it 'one of the great scams of all time.' During a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Thursday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal response and cited 'lousy treatment to North Carolina in particular.' In fact, Cooper said this week that more than 50,000 people have registered for FEMA assistance and about $6 million has been paid out. Biden has suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is withholding money for disaster relief needs. Harris’ visits present an additional political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She’s trying to step into a role for which Biden is well known — showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy — in the closing stretch of her White House campaign. Until this week, she had not visited the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice president. That duty was reserved for Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and more. Harris said this week that she wanted to 'personally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary.' She expressed admiration for how 'people are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.' She said that shows 'the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,' an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail. 'We are here for the long haul,' she said. ___ Associated Press writers Makiya Seminera in Boone, North Carolina, and Meg Kinnard in Fayetteville, North Carolina, contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that North Carolina Gov.

How the Butler shooting changed Donald Trump's campaign	NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump was onstage at a rally on Long Island last month, talking about taxes, when he appeared momentarily spooked by something he had spotted over his shoulder. 'I thought this was a wise guy coming up,' he explained, joking that he was getting his elbow ready to fight back. 'You know I got a little bit of a yip problem here, right?' he added to laughs, using a term familiar to golf aficionados to describe a phenomenon once blamed on performance anxiety where players suddenly lose the ability to make easy shots. 'I was all ready to start duking it out.' It was a fleeting moment passed off as a joke. But as he returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday for a rally at the site where a gunman opened fire in July, grazing his ear with a bullet, the scare underscores the lasting fallout for the candidate and his campaign even as much of the national attention has shifted to other crises. Beyond the two attempts on his life in as many months, the former president and GOP nominee faces ongoing death threats from Iran, which has also been blamed for hacking top campaign officials and allies, exacerbating anxieties already heightened by a stepped-up security apparatus and new restrictions on how he can campaign. Trump's allies insist he was not fundamentally changed by the gunman who fired from an unsecured roof at the rally in July or the would-be assailant in September who shoved a rifle barrel through the fence at his West Palm Beach golf course. The picture of Trump standing, with blood streaked across his face, as he raised his fist and shouted 'Fight!' has become the indelible image of the campaign. 'When you almost lose your life, it stays with you. It stays with him,' said Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a close Trump ally. 'But that doesn’t change his resolve. His resolve is just as strong as it ever has been.' Threats have reshaped how he campaigns Trump staffers are on edge. There have been death threats directed at his aides, and his team isn't as able to quickly organize the mass rallies that have always been the signature of his campaigns. Armed security officers now stand guard at the campaign’s Florida headquarters, and staff have been told to remain vigilant and alert. Events have been canceled and moved around because the U.S. Secret Service lacked the resources to safely secure them. Even with the use of glass barricades to protect Trump onstage, there are concerns about holding additional rallies outdoors due to fears about drones. Trump has accused President Joe Biden's administration of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds. 'They couldn't give me any help. And I'm so angry about it because what they're doing is interfering in the election,' he said in a recent Fox News interview. U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Trump 'is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection' and that 'our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times.' Biden expressed concern for Trump after both assassination attempts, saying in September, 'Thank God the president is OK.' Trump also now travels with a larger security footprint, with new traffic restrictions outside his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and a line of dump trucks and big guns on display outside Trump Tower in New York when he’s staying there. As reporters filed into his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a press conference this summer, guests — including a little girl wearing a red, white and blue bathing suit — were forced to exit their cars and go through airport-style metal detectors as their vehicles were searched for bombs. Trump’s campaign last week was briefed on continued threats from Iran in presumed retaliation for his administration's killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target. Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to 'weaponize' the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded. The cyberattacks have forced some staff to change their email addresses and others to be wary of communicating online. Trump already faced unprecedented legal jeopardy for a presidential candidate, with four criminal indictments — one resulting in a felony conviction with sentencing delayed until after the election, one case dismissed, and two pending — along with civil lawsuits that carry hundreds of millions of dollars in potential penalties. 'I think that from our perspective, just from the campaign standpoint, operationally, if there’s one group of people that can handle something like this thrown in their lap, it’s the team that Donald Trump assembled to run this campaign, just based on everything we’ve had to deal with, whether it’s lawsuits to keep him off the ballot, to indictments, to assassination attempts,' Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said. Trump talks of divine intervention As for Trump, he speaks more often publicly of divine intervention, musing that God saved him in order to save the country. He also often says that assailants only go after consequential presidents. 'Obviously, when you come within a half an inch of a very different outcome, that’s going to impact you,' said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, another ally who said she spoke to Trump the morning after the Butler shooting. 'Of course, those moments really make you consider a higher power, why you are so committed to helping save this country,' she said. 'I think it has further empowered and energized President Trump.' Trump was recently asked by NewsNation if he's concerned about his safety ahead of his return to Butler. 'Well, I'm always worried,' he responded. 'I’m going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do,' he said. 'And I said that, when I was shot, I said, we’re coming back. We’re going to come back. And I’m fulfilling a promise; I’m fulfilling really an obligation.' His most loyal supporters at his rallies, including the one on Long Island where he joked about the 'yips,' haven't been dissuaded from seeing him in person. 'I know some people are scared to come, but I’m not,' said Eileen Deighan, 63, a nurse from nearby Yonkers, New York, who said she was inspired by Trump’s decision to keep on campaigning given the threats. 'The fact that he didn’t give up, he’s willing to fight for our country, how could you not support that?’ she asked. 'That will that he has — doesn’t give up. It’s very contagious.' Trump told his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday that he would continue fighting 'no matter what obstacles and dangers are thrown on our path.' But he had another point to make. 'I tell you what, I had a good life before I did this,' he said. 'Nobody was shooting at me. I had a hell of a life.' ___ Associated Press writer Scott Bauer contributed to this report from Waunakee, Wisconsin.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-assassination-attempts-and-new-threats-have-reshaped-how-donald-trump-campaigns/	2024-10-05T12:42:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670197aa2071d3.09082699.jpeg?w=900
Where the Harris-Trump race stands 1 month out from Election Day	Vice President Harris and former President Trump have one month to convince voters to side with them in what appears likely to be one of the tightest presidential races in American history. Harris enters the homestretch as the slight favorite, with The Hill/Decision Desk HQ model giving her a 54 percent chance of winning the presidency. Republicans are bigger favorites to win the Senate, at 71 percent. The House battle is as close as the race for the White House, with Republicans having a 56 percent chance, according to the model, of holding on to their majority. With no more debates scheduled between the adversaries, it’s not entirely clear what could further shift the numbers, which have remained roughly the same for weeks. 'If you look at the way this presidential campaign has been thus far, the only thing that’s predictable is how unpredictable it’s been,' Republican strategist Nicole Schlinger said. The past four months alone have included one of the most consequential presidential debates ever, two assassination attempts on one of the candidates and an incumbent president ending a reelection bid later in the cycle than any point in modern history. Harris taking over for President Biden as the Democratic candidate spurred new energy for the party after Biden’s chances of reelection seemed to be plummeting. She enjoyed a remarkable rise in favorability after being underwater for a couple years. But after her improvements began to level off, the polls have remained largely static. Harris has maintained a slight lead in the national average and a smaller lead in most of the seven key battleground states. But almost all polls from major polling institutions of those states have shown a candidate ahead by a couple points at most, within the margin of error. Some have predicted this election could end up one of the closest in U.S. history. 'I think the race is where I expected it would be, which is really, really close,' Democratic strategist Jared Leopold said. 'It’s going to come down to the last month and who can execute and get done what they need to get done in a couple swing states.' While some voters have already cast their ballots with early voting in a few states getting underway, much can still happen in the next four weeks to shake up the race, especially given how long a week can be in the current news cycle. Just in the past 10 days, a major hurricane struck the Southeastern United States and a significant escalation has broken out in the Middle East after Israel killed the head of the militant group Hezbollah and Iran responded with firing missiles at Israel. In such a hyper-polarized atmosphere, each event has become politicized. And October has been known to throw in a last-minute surprise right before Election Day. The two most recent presidential election cycles, in 2016 and 2020, saw the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which Trump bragged about groping women; the reopening of the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server; and the reports about Hunter Biden’s laptop. A surprise in 2024 could include a growing conflagration in the Middle East, another natural disaster causing havoc or the unexpected release of audio or video of a candidate speaking. With two assassination attempts already having happened, more political violence seems not outside the realm of possibility. Still, strategists questioned how much another surprise would redefine the race given the intense partisanship and how much the country has already experienced this cycle. Schlinger noted that an October surprise initially had meant one side having opposition research about the other side and releasing it at the last minute to get the most attention, pointing to revelations of George W. Bush’s drunk driving arrest in the 2000 election from decades earlier. But she said for the most part 'folks are likely to know what they need to know' to make a decision, hence the small movement of the polls. 'It’s not a matter of when it gets this close,' she said. 'I think it’s a matter of what the American people have seen and lived through over the last 12 months in terms of surprises.' But others noted that it doesn’t mean even a marginal change could be critical in such a tight race. 'We're fighting for inches on the map, so every little thing is magnified when you're talking about these states,' said Republican strategist Ford O’Connell, referring to the main swing states. O’Connell said if a state like Arizona or Wisconsin is being decided by just 10,000 votes, that may require a difference of five votes per precinct. Trump carried the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by tens of thousands of votes in 2016, and Biden won them in 2020 by only a bit more. 'I don't think you're going to have this monstrous thing that's going to shove it one way or the other, but I do think you could have a series of events that together finally says to somebody who doesn't traditionally vote, screw it, I'm pulling the lever for Trump or Harris,' O’Connell said. For now, both sides are projecting optimism about their prospects. Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a call with reporters marking a month to Election Day that the enthusiasm behind Harris is 'palpable.' But he said Democrats know that the election will 'come down to the margins.' He said the party has been on the ground well before this year to get its message out to voters. 'We’re not taking any vote for granted as we fight against Donald Trump, JD Vance and their dangerous Project 2025 agenda,' Harrison said. O’Connell noted Trump’s past elections outperforming expectations, which should have him feeling 'pretty good' given that the polling is tighter now than it was in 2016 or 2020. He pointed to under-the-surface developments that should also give Trump reason for hope. He said if the recovery from Hurricane Helene is underwhelming as the death toll continues to rise, that could be critical in battleground states that the storm hit like Georgia and North Carolina. He said the poll from the Arab American Institute showing Trump leading among Arab American voters is notable especially because Democrats have traditionally had a 2-to-1 advantage among that group. 'So when you take those two things, I mean if this port [strike] had gone on beyond the week, that would have politically been the best thing Donald Trump could hope for,' O’Connell said, referencing the strike port workers were on before reaching a deal and returning to work Friday. Democrats and Republicans agreed that the result could ultimately come to turnout and motivation. 'It's either a turnout game or a persuasion game at this point, and I think this election is both, and you have to do both,' Leopold said. 'You have to both turn people out and persuade people.' Schlinger emphasized that campaigns do not want to leave votes on the table that they didn’t get because of a lack of infrastructure. 'This is where a grassroots ground game makes all the difference,' she said. 'Where you're knocking on doors, you're making phone calls, you're identifying people, and you're making sure that the right people you identify turn out and you don't mistakenly turn out your opponent.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/where-the-harris-trump-race-stands-1-month-out-from-election-day/	2024-10-05T10:18:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/One-month-left_100524_Illustration_Courtney-JonesMark-Schiefelbein-and-Seth-WenigAPand-Adobe-Stock.png?w=900
Israel expands its bombardment in Lebanon as thousands flee widen...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon on Saturday, hitting Beirut’s southern suburbs with a dozen airstrikes and striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. Israel's attack on the Beddawi camp near Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli killed an official with Hamas’ military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. Israel’s military said it killed two senior officials with Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks. Israel has killed several Hamas officials there since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. At least 1,400 Lebanese, also including civilians and paramedics, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from homes in less than two weeks. Plumes of smoke dominated the skyline over Beirut’s densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah commanders and military equipment and aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 250 Hezbollah fighters. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister did not name the countries putting forward initiatives, saying they include regional states and some outside the Middle East. Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary. Fleeing Lebanon on foot Israel’s military on Saturday said about 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Most were intercepted, but several fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured. At least six people in Lebanon were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency. Nearly 375,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee. Associated Press journalists saw hundreds continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot, crunching over the rubble after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading to it on Thursday. Much of Hezbollah’s weaponry is believed to come from Iran through Syria. 'We were on the road for two days,' said Issa Hilal, one of many Syrian refugees in Lebanon who are now heading back. 'The roads were very crowded … it was very difficult. We almost died getting here.' Some children whimpered or cried. Other displaced families now shelter alongside Beirut’s famous seaside Corniche, their wind-flapped tents just steps from luxury homes. 'We don’t care if we die, but we don’t want to die at the hands of Netanyahu,' said Om Ali Mcheik. The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads and weapons storage facilities. It said troops dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. More evacuation orders in Gaza Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the Health Ministry there, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Almost 90% of Gaza’s residents are now displaced, amid widespread destruction. Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza on Saturday killed at least nine people. One in the northern town of Beit Hanoun killed at least five, including two children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four, Awda hospital said. Israel's military did not have any immediate comment but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. An Israeli airstrike killed two children in Gaza City’s Zaytoun neighborhood, according to the civil defense first responders’ group that operates under the Hamas-run government. Israel's military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza that was at the heart of obstacles to a cease-fire deal. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, a coastal area it has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are in those areas. Israeli forces have often returned to areas in Gaza to target Hamas fighters as they regroup. ___ Mroue and El Deeb reported from Beirut, Lebanon. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-strikes-lebanon-hitting-beirut-suburbs-and-the-north/	2024-10-05T09:09:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6701654262e3e0.98215737.jpeg?w=900
Republicans seek to tie Democrats in crucial New York House races...	Republicans are trying to tie New York Democrats to New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the wake of his indictment on federal corruption charges, hoping the association will be a liability for those running in tight Empire State races that could determine control of the chamber next year. The effort — which has spanned top GOP lawmakers, Republican candidates and the House GOP’s campaign arm — has sought to link New York Democrats to the 'cult of corruption' surrounding Adams, who is facing five counts including bribery, wire fraud and solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national. He has pleaded not guilty. Republicans are also attempting to connect Democrats to the crime and migrant crisis in the Big Apple, two politically charged matters that Adams has come under fire for. Strategists on both sides of the aisle have expressed skepticism that the messaging blitz will sway voters in the battleground districts that make up New York City suburbs. But Republicans are, nonetheless, moving ahead with their full court press. Rep. Elise Stefanik, the chair of the House GOP conference and the highest-ranking New York Republican in Congress, wrote in a statement hours after the Adams indictment that 'New York Democrats will pay the price for this corruption and incompetence in November and Republicans will sweep this November.' The House GOP’s campaign arm echoed that sentiment. 'As extreme New York Democrats try to distance themselves from the NYC Mayor like rats fleeing a sinking ship, we are ready to remind voters what exactly he and his policies did to America's largest city,' National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Savannah Viar said in a statement. The push has percolated to the candidate level, too. Alison Esposito, who is taking on Rep. Pat Ryan (D) in New York’s 18th Congressional District, which covers the northern suburbs of New York City, penned a Washington Reporter op-ed this week that tried to connect Ryan to Adams’s tenure. 'Like Adams, my opponent, Pat Ryan, supports the same liberal policies that have caused chaos in New York,' she wrote, later adding, 'At the end of the day, Ryan and Adams represent the same repressive and dangerous policies that are the worst of our government and New Yorkers deserve better.' Ryan has not called on Adams to resign. In a statement to The Hill, the congressman said, 'My sole focus is delivering for the Hudson Valley.' In New York’s 3rd Congressional District, Rep. Tom Suozzi (D) is taking heat from his GOP challenger, Mike LiPetri. Adams in 2021 had publicly floated asking Suozzi to serve as deputy mayor, a prospect the congressman declined. LiPetri, a former New York state assemblyman, told the New York Post last month that Suozzi’s 'old buddy Eric Adams is going down in an alleged bribery scandal.' 'No wonder the duo considered working together in City Hall,' he added. 'We deserve better than these career politicians who only look out for themselves — it’s time for a fresh start.' Suozzi declined to comment to the Post and has stopped short of calling on Adams to resign. Federal prosecutors unsealed a five-count indictment against Adams on Sept. 26, accusing him of accepting travel and gifts from those in the Turkish government, soliciting campaign contributions from Turkish businessmen, taking in straw donations and engaging in bribery in connection to Turkish individuals. The charges followed a lengthy investigation into Adams that had been ongoing since 2021, when he was serving as Brooklyn borough president. The mayor has remained defiant in the wake of the indictment, pleading not guilty and insisting that he will remain in office amid increasing pressure. Prosecutors this week warned that more charges could be on the way. While many House Democrats are urging the public to respect the legal process, some competing in the closest races in New York are calling on him to resign. That group includes the Democrats taking on Republican Reps. Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.), Mike Lawler (N.Y.), Marc Molinaro (N.Y.) and Nick LaLota (N.Y.), whose races are considered to be among the most competitive this cycle. 'Upstate New York is facing serious issues, and the last thing we need is more corrupt downstate politicians compounding the problems, exporting their chaos, and abusing the public’s trust,' Josh Riley, who is challenging Molinaro, said in a statement. 'Eric Adams should immediately resign.' Molinaro dismissed the calls for resignation as political in nature. 'Josh Riley is a phony,' Molinaro told The Hill in an interview. 'He is absolutely happy to surround himself with the same people that have created this culture of corruption, and then when politically necessary, feign some sort of opposition or concern.' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), for his part, brushed aside any prospect of the Adams indictment negatively affecting downballot Democrats, saying the races would be decided on local issues. 'We have incredible candidates who are running all across the state of New York and beyond, who are running their own races,' he said in an interview with MSNBC. And former New York lawmakers from both sides of the aisle were skeptical that the GOP strategy would be potent enough to influence New York contests. Former Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) — a 16-year veteran of the House who served as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) for two cycles — said the headlines regarding Adams are not helpful for Democrats, but he predicted that they will not be too damaging for those campaigns. 'First, because Election Day is still over a month away. And second, because these days there’s nothing earth-shattering about scandals of this nature … and that is particularly true in areas around New York City,' Israel told The Hill in an interview. Israel said he would advise candidates to determine, based on their districts, how to proceed — which many are doing now — noting that it is 'perfectly understandable' for Democrats in battlegrounds to distance themselves from the mayor. 'In an extremely tight race where the margin could be several 100 votes, you don’t want to leave a single vote on the table. And you don’t want extraneous controversies to dissuade any single voter from supporting,' Israel said. 'So they have to be taken seriously, the headlines have to be taken seriously. But they don’t rise to an existential threat to any campaign.' Democratic sources have also been quick to note that Adams, who was elected mayor in 2021, is not on the ballot this year and that several Republican candidates are facing scandals of their own. The New York Times recently reported that D’Esposito put his lover and fiancée’s daughter on his House payroll. He denied any wrongdoing. The paper also uncovered a photo of Lawler wearing blackface while dressed as Michael Jackson in 2006, which he has apologized for. Additionally, one Democratic operative working on a New York House race argued that the GOP criticism is hypocritical because many are supporting former President Trump’s quest for the White House, despite his quartet of indictments. 'The problem for Republicans is that they can’t align on which flavor of bulls‑‑‑ to spew. Half of them are screaming lawfare, half of them have magically come to the conclusion that an indictment is now a disqualifying offense,' the operative said. Former Rep. John Faso (R), who represented parts of the Hudson Valley from 2017 through 2019, said the indictment is 'certainly not a plus for Democrats.' But, he added, 'I think the major issues are immigration, crime and inflation and among Jewish New Yorkers, I think the failure of Democrats to truly support Israel in its time of need are more significant factors.' Republicans tying Democrats to Adams, to be sure, is a strategy that predates the September indictment, as the mayor for months has faced scrutiny for his handling of crime and the migrant crisis in the city. In December, The New York Times issued a poll that found Adams's approval rating had sunk to 28 percent, which was the lowest for any Big Apple mayor since 1996. The day before news of Adams’s indictment broke, for example, the NRCC started running an ad associating Democratic New York state Sen. John Mannion — who is running against incumbent Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.) — with Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul (D). 'John Mannion, he’s with them, not us,' the ad reads, showing a photo of the Democratic candidate beside Adams and Hochul. But now, with the indictment in tow and more charges potentially on the way, New York Republicans are re-upping their criticism of Adams and House Democrats, hoping that the messaging blitz helps put the GOP over the edge in the tight race for the lower chamber. 'Single-party rule in New York has produced a culture of corruption which, sadly, far too many Democrats accept,' Molinaro said. 'Now we have yet one more example of that and it’s gonna come back to bite them. As well it should.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-seek-to-tie-democrats-in-crucial-new-york-house-races-to-eric-adams/	2024-10-05T08:35:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/adamseric_100224upi02_w.jpg?w=900
North Carolina mom explains how her family escaped Helene	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene has devastated lives and families across the southeast, and while Stephanie Zara and her family lost their home it could have been worse. Hundreds of people are still missing as hopes of finding them dwindle. More than 200 people have been killed since Helene made landfall in Florida over a week ago. Like much of western Carolina, Swannanoa was hit hard by Helene and caused much damage to the Zara family home. 'We were in complete panic,' Zara told 'Morning in America.' 'So I was able to get a distress call out to 911 when the water started rushing in. When I got through, they were telling me they were overwhelmed with calls, and they just told me to get to high ground.' FEMA has faced criticism and praise during Helene. Here’s what it does — and doesn’t do Once realizing their attic was no longer a safe place, the Zaras had to swim through their home to get on the roof. It was there they waited until a neighbor came through on a kayak to save them. 'It was by a complete miracle,' Zara said of their survival.

Helene victims face grim task of rebuilding without flood insuran...	A week after Hurricane Helene overwhelmed the Southeastern U.S., homeowners hit the hardest are grappling with how they could possibly pay for the flood damage from one of the deadliest storms to hit the mainland in recent history. The Category 4 storm that first struck Florida’s Gulf Coast on September 26 has dumped trillions of gallons of water across several states, leaving a catastrophic trail of destruction that spans hundreds of miles inland. More than 200 people have died in what is now the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina, according to statistics from the National Hurricane Center. Western North Carolina and the Asheville area were hit especially hard, with flooding that wiped out buildings, roads, utilities and land in a way that nobody expected, let alone prepared for. Inland areas in parts of Georgia and Tennessee were also washed out. The Oak Forest neighborhood in south Asheville lives up to its name, with trees towering over 1960s era ranch-style houses on large lots. But on Sept. 27, as Helene’s remnants swept through western north Carolina, many of those trees came crashing down, sometimes landing on houses. Julianne Johnson said she was coming upstairs from the basement to help her 5-year-old son pick out clothes that day when her husband began to yell that a giant oak was falling diagonally across the yard. The tree mostly missed the house, but still crumpled part of a metal porch and damaged the roof. Then, Johnson said, her basement flooded. On Friday, there was a blue tarp being held on the roof with a brick. Sodden carpet that the family torn out lay on the side of the house, waiting to go to the landfill. With no cell phone service or internet access, Johnson said she couldn't file a home insurance claim until four days after the storm. 'It took me a while to make that call,' she said. 'I don’t have an adjuster yet.' Roof and tree damage are likely to be covered by the average home insurance policy. But Johnson, like many homeowners, doesn't have flood insurance and she’s not certain how she’ll pay for that part of the damage. Those recovering from the storm may be surprised to learn flood damage is a completely separate thing. Insurance professionals and experts have long warned that home insurance typically does not cover flood damage to the home, even as they espouse that flooding can happen anywhere that rains. That’s because flooding isn’t just sea water seeping into the land – it’s also water from banks, as well as mudflow and torrential rains. But most private insurance companies don't carry flood insurance, leaving the National Flood Insurance Program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the primary provider for that coverage for residential homes. Congress created the federal flood insurance program more than 50 years ago when many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas. North Carolina has 129,933 such policies in force, according to FEMA’s latest data, though most of that protection will likely be concentrated on the coast rather than in the Blue Ridge Mountains area where Helene caused the most damage. Florida, in comparison, has about 1.7 million flood policies in place statewide. Charlotte Hicks, a flood insurance expert in North Carolina who has led flood risk training and educational outreach for the state's Department of Insurance, said the reality is that many Helene survivors will never be made whole. Without flood insurance, some people may be able to rebuild with the help of charities but most others will be left to fend for themselves. 'There will absolutely be people who will be financially devasted by this event,' Hicks said. 'It’s heartbreaking.' Some may go into foreclosure or bankruptcy. Entire neighborhoods will likely never be rebuilt. There’s been water damage across the board, Hicks said, and for some, mudslides have even taken the land upon which their house once stood. Meanwhile, Helene is turning out to be a fairly manageable disaster for the private home insurance market because those plans generally only serve to cover wind damage from hurricanes. That's a relief for the industry, which has been under increasing strain from other intensifying climate disasters such as wildfires and tornadoes. Nowhere is the shrinking private market due to climate instability more evident than in Florida, where many companies have already stopped selling policies — leaving the state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corporation now the largest home insurer in the state. Mark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said Helene is a 'very manageable loss event,' and estimates insurer losses will range from about $5 billion to $8 billion. That’s compared to the insured losses from the Category 4 Hurricane Ian in September 2022 that was estimated in excess of $50 billion. Friedlander and other experts point out that less than 1% of the inland areas that sustained the most catastrophic flood damage were protected with flood insurance. 'This is very common in inland communities across the country,' Friedlander said. ' Lack of flood insurance is a major insurance gap in the U.S., as only about 6% of homeowners carry the coverage, mostly in coastal counties.' Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said the images of the flood destruction in North Carolina shook her despite decades of seeing challenging recovery faced by victims of natural disasters. 'This is a pretty serious situation here in terms of people disappointed. They are going to be disappointed in their insurers and they are going to be disappointed in FEMA,' Bach said. 'FEMA cannot match the kind of dollars private insurers are supposed to be contributing to the recovery.' This week, FEMA announced it could meet the immediate needs of Helene but warned it doesn't have enough funding to make it through the hurricane season, which runs June 1 to Nov. 30 though most hurricanes typically occur in September and October. Even if a homeowner does have it, FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program only covers up to $250,000 for single-family homes and $100,000 for contents. Bach said that along with homeowners educating themselves about what their policies do and don’t cover, the solution is a national disaster insurance program that does for property insurance what the Affordable Care Act did for health insurance. After Hurricane Floyd in 1999, the state of North Carolina started requiring insurance agents to take a flood insurance class so they could properly advise their clients of the risk and policies available, Hicks said. The state also requires home insurance policies to clearly disclose that it does not cover flood. 'You can’t stop nature from doing what nature is going to do,' Hicks said. 'For us to think it’s never going to be this bad again would be a dangerous assumption. A lot of people underestimate their risk of flooding.' ___ Associated Press Staff Writers Jeff Amy in Asheville, North Carolina, Lisa Leff in London and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-homeowners-hit-by-hurricane-helene-face-the-grim-task-of-rebuilding-without-flood-insurance/	2024-10-05T08:18:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67015992b01a40.49700410.jpeg?w=900
Middle East latest: A Hamas official is killed in an Israeli stri...	An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed Hamas official Saeed Atallah Ali and his family, the militant group said Saturday. The early morning strike came a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Israel conducts more ground raids in southern Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Saturday its special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries’ shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it calls a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, which is saturated with arms and explosives, the military said. Israeli strikes in Lebanon have hit civilian areas and infrastructure including hospitals and paramedics. Israeli strikes hammer Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — Beirut’s southern suburbs was hit by 12 Israeli airstrikes early Saturday, including one that badly damaged a large hall Hezbollah has used to hold ceremonies, Lebanon’s state news agency said. Later in the day, more strikes hit the area, from which tens of thousands of people have fled over the past two weeks. Israeli airstrikes also hit areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to state media. At least six people were killed, according to NNA. Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 9, including 2 children CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least nine people, including two children. One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry’s Ambulance and Emergency service. Another strike hit a house in the northern part of Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of wounded people, it said. The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the almost year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Israel orders more evacuations in central Gaza CAIRO — The Israeli military on Saturday warned residents in parts of central Gaza to evacuate, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian militants. The warnings cover areas along a strategic corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military warned Palestinians in areas of Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps, located along the Netzarim corridor, to evacuate to an along Gaza's shore called Muwasi, which the military has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas affected by the order, parts of which were evacuated previously. Less than an hour after the evacuation order, Palestinians reported Israel’s artillery shelling and smoke bombing in the northern areas of Nuseirat camp. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the war one year ago. The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps. Others have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe. An Israeli strike on a refugee camp kills a Hamas official BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday. Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali’s wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima — whom the statement described as children — were also killed in the attack. Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in the recent conflict. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023. South Korea evacuates 97 people from Lebanon SEOUL, South Korea — A military plane evacuating 97 people from Lebanon arrived in South Korea on Saturday. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the group on the plane includes South Korean nationals and their family members. There are about 30 South Koreans left in Lebanon besides diplomats and embassy workers who are staying. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed officials Wednesday to send military aircraft to conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of the intensified fighting in the region. There are about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel and 110 in Iran.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/top-headlines/ap-top-headlines/ap-middle-east-latest-a-hamas-official-is-killed-in-an-israeli-strike-on-a-refugee-camp/	2024-10-05T04:14:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670120472de7f8.93840933.jpeg?w=900
Trump to rally with Elon Musk at site of first assassination atte...	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk will join Donald Trump at his rally Saturday in Butler, the Pennsylvania city where the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt earlier this year. 'I will be there to support!' Musk wrote on his social platform X on Thursday in a retweet of Trump’s own promotion of the rally. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO will be among special guests in attendance, Trump's campaign confirmed Friday. Saturday's rally will take place at the same property where a gunman's bullets grazed Trump's right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured. Where are Trump, Harris, Vance and Walz campaigning today? Several members of Comperatore's family, as well as other attendees and first responders from the July rally, will join Trump on Saturday at the farm show property, according to the campaign. The FBI said in July that the attempted assassin was Thomas Crooks. The Secret Service shot and killed the 20-year-old seconds after Trump was shot. The attack is the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Also appearing with the former president will be his running mate, Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, his son Eric Trump, his daughter-in-law and RNC co-chair Lara Trump and several Pennsylvania lawmakers and sheriffs, the campaign said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rally-butler-pa-elon-musk/	2024-10-04T12:50:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/AP24211571601042-e1723232689364.jpg?w=800
US launches airstrikes on Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, going after weapons systems, bases, and other equipment belonging to the Iranian-backed rebels, U.S. officials confirmed. Military aircraft and warships bombed Houthi strongholds at roughly five locations, according to the officials. Houthi media said seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sanaa, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province. The Houthi media office also reported three air raids in Bayda province, southeast of Sanaa. The strikes come just days after the Houthis threatened 'escalating military operations' targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships. Boris Johnson alleges Netanyahu may have bugged his bathroom The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The group has maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/ap-us-news/us-airstrikes-yemens-iran-houthi-rebels/	2024-10-04T12:13:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2173931972.jpg?w=900
Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu trying to influence election	President Biden on Friday said he wasn't aware of whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, while noting no administration has been a stronger ally to Israel than his own. In his first briefing room appearance of his presidency, Biden addressed Democratic concerns that the Israeli leader is ignoring Biden’s call to negotiate a Gaza peace deal and confronting Hezbollah and Iran in an effort to interfere with the White House race. 'No administration has helped Israel more than I have, none, none, none. And, I think Bibi should remember that,' Biden said. He added, 'And whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know. But I’m not counting on that.' The president has publicly and privately been frustrated with Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza over the past year, which has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians. Monday will mark the anniversary of the Hamas attack against Israel that set off the war. He was also pressed on if he wants to speak to Netanyahu and said he assumes that when Israel 'makes an assessment on how they’re going to respond, we will have a discussion.' He added that his team and the prime minister’s team are in 'constant contact' while they try to figure out their retaliation plan. Biden a day earlier had caused waves in the markets when he said the U.S. and Israel were in discussions about the response to Iran’s missile attack earlier in the week, including the possibility they could strike Iranian oil fields. On Friday, Biden suggested he would advise against such a move. 'The Israelis have not concluded what they’re going to do in terms of a strike,' Biden said. 'That’s under discussion. If I were in their shoes I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/biden-i-dont-know-if-netanyahu-trying-to-influence-election/	2024-10-04T11:56:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/BidenJoe.jpg?w=900
NewsNation's Nichole Berlie announces she's cancer free	(NewsNation) — NewsNation anchor Nichole Berlie announced on Friday, amid Breast Cancer Awareness Month, that she is officially cancer-free after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year. 'One year ago today, Oct 4. of last year, I was one of those women under the age of 50 to be diagnosed,' Berlie said in her emotional announcement during Friday's broadcast of her show 'NewsNation Now.' 'Mine started with no symptoms; I had no signs. So please hear this: My mammogram was fine. I was given the all-clear,' she said. 'And it’s because there was no cancer. The cancer was only detected through a recommended ultrasound because I have dense breast tissue. And another twist, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, but doctors never actually found any cancer in either breast. It was found in one lymph node in my armpit.' With October being Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Berlie has a request for viewers. 'I’ve always been healthy, I’ve always been active and I still got cancer. So it can happen to anyone. Please do not put off going to the doctor.' Berlie said that while she still has years of medication and screenings ahead, she’s relieved. 'I am here and I am thankful,' she said. If you or someone you love has breast cancer or want to get involved to help out, you can find help, resources, and community at the National Breast Cancer Foundation here.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/media/newsnations-nichole-berlie-announces-cancer-free/	2024-10-04T11:44:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-4.jpg?w=900
Boris Johnson alleges Netanyahu may have bugged his bathroom	(The Hill) -- Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson alleged in an interview with The Telegraph that his staff found a 'listening device' in his bathroom after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had used it in 2017. Johnson had been a foreign secretary at the time. Johnson claimed ahead of the release of his book 'Unleashed' that he was told, 'Later, when they (security) were doing a regular sweep for bugs, they found a listening device in the thunderbox.' When asked for more detail during the interview, Johnson said 'Everything you need to know about that episode is in the book.' Boris Johnson says Trump presidency would have prevented Ukraine invasion The Telegraph reported that 'it is not clear whether Israel was questioned or rebuked over the incident.' Israel also was accused around the same time of planting listening devices in The White House, The Telegraph also reported. U.S. officials said that 'Washington concluded that Israel was likely behind the placement of cellphone surveillance devices that were found near the White House and other sensitive locations around the capital,' The Telegraph wrote. The Hill has contacted the Israeli Embassy in London for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/boris-johnson-alleges-netanyahu-may-have-bugged-his-bathroom/	2024-10-04T11:41:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/646d0e774596b6.03191945-e1728042130490.jpeg?w=900
