Stirewalt breaks down what to expect with election night results	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris only have a few hours left to make their final appeals to voters ahead of the election. With 270 electoral votes needed to win, each candidate’s path to victory appears distinct. Key states and poll closing times The first crucial presidential election results will emerge from Georgia when polls close at 7 p.m. ET, with election analysts watching Forsyth County in suburban Atlanta for early signs of Trump's strength among affluent voters. North Carolina follows shortly after, with Nash County serving as a key indicator. The working-class region, with its 40 to 45% Black population, could signal whether Harris successfully mobilized Black voters. 4 potential paths to victory in the 2024 election The 8 p.m. ET rush of results positions Pennsylvania as the potential decider, with Erie County serving as the state's traditional bellwether. Erie's results have accurately predicted the statewide winner in the past two presidential cycles. By 9 p.m. ET, Michigan takes center stage, particularly three counties surrounding Detroit and Kent County near Grand Rapids. Trump's decision to end his campaign in Grand Rapids — as he did in previous races — underscores the region's importance in securing moderate Republican voters. Election experts predict a winner could emerge between midnight and 4 a.m. Eastern. Early results from Georgia and North Carolina, expected by 9:30 p.m., could provide strong indicators of the national outcome. Both states' efficient vote-counting systems typically deliver 80% of results by early evening, potentially offering clear signals of voter trends before the slower-counting Midwest states report their totals. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Trump and Harris paths to victory Harris faces a mathematically simpler path, needing only to defend traditionally Democratic states to reach 270 electoral votes. She could win without either North Carolina or Georgia if she maintains the Democratic Midwest firewall. Trump's route proves more challenging, requiring him to flip at least one traditionally Democratic state. While showing strength in Arizona, he needs either Pennsylvania or a combination of Michigan and Wisconsin plus Arizona or Nevada to secure victory.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/stirewalt-election-night-results/	2024-11-04T16:47:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_aeba71.jpg?w=900
Trump says he'll put ex-NFL player in charge of US missile shield	(The Hill) - Former President Trump told supporters Sunday that he wants to put former NFL player and failed GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker in charge of a new missile defense shield if elected. Walker, a staunch ally of Trump, appeared at a rally in Macon, Ga., where he flubbed the GOP presidential candidate’s name twice. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics 'It is time for it to stop, and it stops on Tuesday when we vote for my friend, and your friend, Donald Trump Jr. — Donald Trump. Jonald J. Trump,' Walker said at the end of his speech. Trump, who spoke after Walker, said if elected, he would 'build a missile defense shield all made in the USA,' and 'put Herschel Walker in charge of that little sucker.' Trump over the past year has declared that he would create an 'Iron Dome' for the United States in a second term, referring to the missile defense system used by Israel. Democrats call for investigation into grocery prices On Sunday, he said 'a lot of' such a system would be built in Georgia. But Iron Dome is used against short-range missiles, and any such system built to protect the U.S. mainland would come with an astronomical price tag and little use in stopping mid- to long-range missiles, such as from North Korea or Russia. It is unclear if Trump meant Walker would be in charge of overseeing all U.S. missile defenses or the process of building a new system. Walker spent 12 seasons in the NFL beginning in the late 1980s before retiring and pursuing business ventures in food processing, with no experience in missile defense or national security. He eventually made his way to politics and served under Trump as a co-chair of the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition from 2019 to 2020. Walker launched his first political campaign in Georgia's 2022 Senate election, during which he supported finishing Trump’s southern border wall and for Washington to 'heavily invest' in the military. Walker’s campaign, however, was plagued by controversies and baffling and false statements. He mistakenly said there were 52 states, falsely claimed he was once an FBI agent, and lied about graduating from the University of Georgia, when in reality he had left to play professional football and did not complete his degree.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-herschel-walker-missile-shield/	2024-11-04T11:27:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24309007583298-e1730746223488.jpg?w=900
Border important issue in battleground states like Arizona	(NewsNation) — Both candidates in the 2024 election have been talking about immigration, with Republican former President Donald Trump promising the country’s largest mass deportations in history and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris arguing to voters she is going to be tough on the border. In battleground border states like Arizona, this is an especially hot topic. Migrants arriving at Yuma in 2021 had to wait for so long for Border Patrol they began walking through the city looking for help. The regional medical center was sitting on more than $26 million in uncompensated migrant care. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Last year, in Lukeville, Arizona, thousands of migrants from Africa came across the border through holes cut in the wall by cartel members. NewsNation crews were there when more than 800 men waiting along the border to be transported were processed. The majority of fentanyl seized last year also came through Arizona. Immigration has had a profound impact on the economy. About 50% of the labor market’s recent growth came from foreign-born workers between January 2023 and January 2024, according to The Economic Policy Institute analysis of federal data. What Trump, Harris have said about the border Trump supporters have linked migrants to the rising cost of housing and said that the number of migrants coming into the country means they're taking jobs from American citizens. Democrats have noted that experts don't agree with Trump's comments on housing prices and say the Republican nominee's mass deportation plan would hurt employment opportunities for all Americans. The Biden administration’s early struggles to address the record number of people who poured across the border over the last 3 1/2 years may have done more damage than they can recover from despite unlawful crossings between the ports of entry being down. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said at a rally in Scottsdale on Saturday that this election's stakes 'could not be higher.' 'Arizona knows that better than almost any state in the union,' Vance said. 'There are over 453,000 illegal immigrants in this state because Kamala Harris refuses to do her job.' During an Oct. 29 speech, Harris said politicians need to stop treating immigration 'as an issue to scare up votes in an election and instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is, that we must finally come together to solve.' 'I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the border security bill that Donald Trump killed,' Harris said. Harris has leaned heavily on the failed Senate border bill as part of her campaign. However, opponents of the bill say it would have meant amnesty for millions and an open door for many more each year. The Border Patrol union pulled its support for the bill, and the National Sheriff's Association also came out in opposition to it. Arizona border ballot measure Arizona residents will consider a new ballot measure that would give more power to local officials when it comes to enforcing immigration law. Proposition 314 would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter Arizona from anywhere other than a port of entry, as well as allow for state judges to order deportations. In addition, state and local police would be given the power to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization. Supporters of the bill say something has to change after the state became such a hotbed for human and drug smuggling. Opponents call it reminiscent of the controversial Senate Bill 1070, which made it a crime to be in the state without immigration papers. They say that bill basically allowed law enforcement to racially profile people if they speculated that they crossed the border illegally. Senate Bill 1070, passed in 2010, was stripped down by the U.S. Supreme Court after it deemed aspects of the legislation unconstitutional in 2012.

Betting odds show Trump favored but Harris rising	(NewsNation) — Polls show former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are dead even heading into Election Day, and betting markets have also become closer in recent days. Unlike polling averages, which are primarily based on aggregated survey data, prediction markets offer insight into where people are putting their money. Those markets allow users to wager on the outcomes of future events. Betting platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket and PredictIt have shown Trump as the favorite since mid-October, which remains the case, but Harris' chances have improved recently. Election odds in every 2024 swing state Kalshi, a prediction market startup, shows Trump with a 53% chance of winning, compared to 47% for Harris, as of Nov. 4 at 11 a.m. A week ago, Trump was at 60%. Nearly $200 million has been wagered so far, according to Kalshi. Polymarket — which has seen more than $3 billion in bets on the election — showed Trump favored at 56% compared to Harris at 44%, as of midday Nov. 4. Last week, Trump was above 66% at one point. Another platform, PredictIt, showed Harris with an edge. A contract for a Harris win was priced at 54 cents versus 53 cents from Trump around 11 a.m. Nov. 4. That's an improvement for Harris from a week ago when Trump was at 59 cents, and Harris was at 45 cents. The RealClearPolitics betting average showed Trump with a 56% chance of winning and Harris at 43% as of Nov. 4. Note: Betting odds change from minute to minute, and the current percentages may not be reflected above. Are betting markets more reliable than polls? A U.S. appeals court cleared the way for election betting last month, and many are looking to gambling markets as a reliable indicator of which way the election will go. Proponents of prediction markets argue that they are better forecasters because they're more responsive to breaking developments than polls. In other words: Bettors are economically motivated to factor in new information faster. 'Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,' Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune last month. While it's true betting markets have generally been good forecasters of U.S. elections, there are some caveats to keep in mind. For one, betting platforms may be susceptible to manipulation. A Frenchman recently bet more than $30 million on Polymarket predicting a Trump victory, according to the Wall Street Journal. 'Even though volumes have surged on Polymarket this year, it is still small enough for one wealthy, opinionated individual to push prices around with a multimillion-dollar bet,' the WSJ noted. Big bets on Trump don't mean the market is rigged Other research from academics at the University of Arizona and University of Kansas suggests 'manipulating political stock markets is difficult and expensive to do for more than a short period.' Michael Schwimer, founder of the sports betting consultant firm JAMBOS Analytics, dismissed betting manipulation concerns in a recent NewsNation interview. He pointed out that international bets for Trump can't rig the markets any more than a big bet on the World Cup will affect how the game is played. PredictIt has an $850 cap on individual bets, which limits the potential for a single person to sway the odds. Liberty Vittert, a professor of data science at Washington University and the resident on-air statistician for NewsNation, also cautioned against reading too much into betting markets. '[Bettors] are betting on nothing more substantial than the 'vibes' that once made Harris’ victory seem inevitable earlier this summer,' Vittert wrote in a recent op-ed for The Hill. She added: 'In 2016, Hillary Clinton was the 88 percent favorite to win on the Sunday before the election. If you had the bright idea of putting your life savings on the easy favorite in hopes of making a quick buck, you lost it all.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/betting-odds-2024-election/	2024-11-04T11:03:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24304037053551.jpg?w=900
Has the Electoral College ever favored Democrats?	(NEXSTAR) — Did you know there have been five U.S. Presidential Elections in which the winner lost the popular vote? The Electoral College has voted to elect John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Benjamin Harrison in the distant past, and George W. Bush and Donald Trump in modern times. Ignoring the presidents of the distant past, as the political parties at those times were in flux and differed from today's Republicans and Democrats, it's easy to see why some argue the Electoral College has recently only benefitted Republicans. Can you vote in person if you were mailed a ballot? The Electoral College has famously decided a different winner in two modern-day elections: the 2000 Election and the 2016 Election — both Electoral College votes favored the Republican candidates who lost the popular vote, George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The reputational fallout of these votes — where the College appeared not to side with the will of the American people — has contributed to an increasingly unfavorable view of the Electoral College over the past few decades. Earlier this month, Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz even called for abolishing the Electoral College, though the Harris campaign later said this was not part of the official platform. 'I think all of us know, the Electoral College needs to go,' said Walz. 'We need a national popular vote.' Recently, Pew Research found that 64% of Americans (over 6 in 10) say they'd prefer the winner of the U.S. presidential elections be decided by national popular vote only. About 35% polled favored keeping the Electoral College. ‘He’ll never know’: 1 in 4 people lie about who they vote for When broken apart by political party, Pew Research found that most Democrats (87%) say they'd prefer the president be elected by popular vote only. Meanwhile, only 46% of Republicans say the same. Sixty-one percent of Moderates and more liberal Republicans said they'd prefer only a popular vote. Despite proposals to change or abolish the Electoral College (the University of Central Florida reports there have been over 1,000), there are many reasons why these attempts failed. Firstly, as UCF History Professor John Sacher explains, the Electoral College is part of the U.S. Constitution — and amending the Constitution is complicated and difficult. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Additionally, Sacher argues that the Electoral College is useful in instances like the 2000 Presidential Election. Despite Gore winning a plurality of the popular vote, he didn't win a majority. Neither Bush nor Gore won the majority and it fell upon the electors to decide. Sacher explains: 'We are the only nation that still uses an Electoral College... Given that this discussion has already lasted well over 100 years, we may be in for 100 more.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/electoral-college-democrats/	2024-11-04T11:02:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1284095375-1-e1730308594799.jpg?w=800
Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voter...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris has shaken the 2024 election, putting pressure on her Republican opponent since she entered the race in July. Since replacing President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket, Harris has quickly gained momentum, posing a threat to the healthy lead former President Donald Trump held over Biden, both nationally and in swing states. Harris has since announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, who himself has since extinguished any Democratic doubts during his performance at the DNC. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day Ohio Sen. JD Vance‘s nomination as Trump’s vice president pits him against Walz. Ahead of the 2024 election, NewsNation is committed to covering the issues that matter most to voters so they can make the most informed choices possible at the polls. Here is how the leading candidates’ policies compare on key voter issues. You can also read specific policy breakdowns for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Abortion Border crisis Climate change Crime Fentanyl crisis and opioid epidemic Inflation Israel-Palestine conflict Policing and gun safety Project 2025 Social Security War in Ukraine Abortion Trump During the September debate, Trump falsely said Democrats support abortions in the third trimester and after birth. No state in the country allows termination after birth. He refused to commit to vetoing a national abortion ban. When asked directly if he would veto a ban, Trump indicated Congress wouldn’t need to pass one. The former president wouldn’t initially say during a town hall whether he supports a federal abortion ban. He called the overturning of the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade 'a great victory' during a CNN town hall. In April 2024, he said on his social media platform Truth Social that it’d be best if states handled abortion the way their constituents want, adding he’s in favor of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Also said on Truth Social that he 'strongly' supports fertility treatments and that he 'has never and will never' advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives. Harris Harris said women do not want abortion bans, speaking about women who are miscarrying and denied care because doctors are afraid to go to jail and young teens who are incest victims being forced to give birth. She committed to signing a bill to protect the right to abortion across the U.S. Harris is aligned with Biden in her view on abortion and said 'everything is at stake' regarding women’s reproductive rights. The vice president is in favor of ensuring all American women have access to legal abortions. 'Every person of whatever gender should understand that, if such a fundamental freedom such as the right to make decisions about your own body can be taken, be aware of what other freedoms may be at stake,' Harris said in a joint MSNBC interview with Hadley Duvall, an abortion rights advocate from Kentucky who was raped by her stepfather as a child. Harris falsely wrote on X that Trump would ban abortion nationwide. She then added: 'President Joe Biden and I will do everything in our power to stop him and restore women’s reproductive freedom.' Harris also visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota in March, describing the banning or heavy restriction of abortions as 'immoral.' 'How dare these elected leaders believe they are in a better position to tell women what they need,' Harris said at the time. 'We have to be a nation that trusts women.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: VP picks' political views Border crisis Trump Trump and his allies have falsely accused Haitian immigrants in the small Ohio town of Springfield of abducting and eating pets. There’s no evidence that the community is doing that, officials told The Associated Press. The former president would launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, paid for with redirected military funds, Reuters reported. He would restore his 2019 'Remain in Mexico' program, which required asylum-seekers at the U.S. border to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed. Trump said he would end what he called 'catch and release' and instead detain all migrants who are caught entering the United States without authorization or violating other immigration laws. He'd also deputize the U.S. National Guard and local law enforcement to help with rapid deportations, according to Reuters. The former president said he would enact travel bans denying entry to people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and 'anywhere else that threatens our security.' Block communists, Marxists and socialists from entering the U.S. and send deportation officers to 'pro-Hamas' protests. End 'birthright' citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. End Biden’s immigration parole program and roll back Temporary Protected Status designations. Try again to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly referred to as DACA. While he was president, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the Southwest border, according to the Associated Press. Harris Among Republicans, Harris has the ironic moniker of 'border czar,' owing to her work wherein she oversaw diplomacy with Mexico and the Northern Triangle as a means of addressing 'root causes' of migration. Biden gave her the responsibility of manning everything immigration along the southern border in 2021, with her role, according to the White House at the time, to stem the arrival of 'irregular migrants.' Republicans heavily criticized the Biden-Harris approach to the border, a hot-button issue this election cycle. Under the Biden-Harris administration, migrants crossing into the US from Mexico hit record highs at the end of 2023. Close to 250,000 crossed during December 2023, surpassing the previous high of 224,000 encounters in May of 2022, also under the Biden-Harris watch. Harris announced in March that $5.2 billion in pledges from private companies had been made to prop up Central American communities to deter illegal entry to the U.S. under her guidance. 'The problems, of course, did not occur overnight, and the solutions will not be achieved overnight,' Harris said of the border at the time. Climate change Trump During the September debate, Trump falsely claimed that under Harris there would 'be no fossil fuels' and the country would 'go back to windmills.' At one point, Trump called himself a 'fan' of solar but then criticized solar farms that take up large plots of land. Claimed he will end the 'Green New Deal atrocities' on his first day if reelected. The measure was never signed into law. Said he would free up stores of liquid gold for energy development. Vowed to speed up approval of natural gas pipelines into the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York. Exit the Paris Climate Agreement again. Trump previously pulled the U.S. from the agreement, but Biden rejoined upon taking office. Said he would fight litigation from environmentalists. Harris During the September debate, Harris also called for investment in 'diverse' sources of energy, 'So we reduce our reliance on foreign oil.' Harris has backed the Biden administration’s climate initiatives, including legislation providing billions in tax credits for renewable energy and electric vehicles, the New York Times reported. 'The clock is not just ticking, it is banging,' she said last year, referencing climate change-driven disasters. She noted the administration made 'the largest climate investment in America’s history.' During her 2020 presidential bid, Harris emphasized environmental justice, addressing climate change’s effects on poor and minority communities. She’s continued this focus as vice president. In 2019, as a senator, Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., proposed legislation to evaluate environmental rules’ impact on low-income communities. It would have created an Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability and climate justice advisers in federal agencies. Harris introduced a broader version in 2020. Neither bill passed, The New York Times reported. How are presidential election votes counted? Crime Trump Said he would move homeless encampments out of cities. Vowed to give police more authority, deploy the military to fight the nation’s drug problem and impose the death penalty for convicted drug dealers. Promised to deliver record funding to hire and retrain police officers, strengthen qualified immunity and increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. Said he would send federal prosecutors and the National Guard into high-crime communities, according to his campaign website. As president, Trump granted pardons to 73 people and commuted the sentences of an additional 70. That includes former staff members and advisers such as Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Stephen K. Bannon and George Papadopoulos. Harris Harris, in April, hosted reality television star Kim Kardashian at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform after the Biden administration granted clemency to people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. The U.S. incarcerates more people than any other country. About 1 in 5 of those 1.9 million people are behind bars for a drug-related offense. Black and Latino people are disproportionately incarcerated, and drug law reform has the broadest support among young voters. Black, Latino and young voters tend to favor Democrats. 'Everybody makes mistakes, and for some, that might rise to the level of being a crime,' Harris said at the White House. 'But is it not the sign of a civil society that we allow people a way to earn their way back and give them the support and the resources they need to do that?' Harris’ record as California attorney general, however, drew the ire of many progressives during her 2020 bid for the presidency. During her seven years as a district attorney and then six as attorney general, she defended the cash bail system in a pair of federal court cases, shifting course only weeks before she entered the Senate. As a presidential candidate in 2020, she pledged a wholesale overhaul of the country’s criminal justice system, arguing for marijuana legalization, bail reform and a moratorium on the death penalty. Vice President Harris will face off with Republican nominee former President Trump this November for the White House. (Associated Press) Fentanyl crisis and opioid epidemic Trump Said he would 'impose a total naval embargo on cartels.' Vowed to designate cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Promised to order the Department of Defense to 'inflict maximum damage' on cartel leadership and operations. Said he would seek death penalty eligibility for cartel members and traffickers. Said he would permanently designate fentanyl as a federally controlled substance. Promised to threaten China with 'a steep price' unless it works to end the export of fentanyl’s chemical precursors. Vowed to create partnerships to encourage companies to provide job opportunities and skills training to people recovering from addiction. Said he would expand federal support for faith-based counseling, treatment and recovery programs. Promised family leave to care for relatives trying to overcome addiction. Harris In May 2024, the Biden-Harris administration announced the approval of over $1.5 billion in state or tribal opioid response funding to address the overdose crisis. Harris gathered state attorneys general from across the country at the White House in July 2023 to discuss fentanyl and illicit drugs in America. 'We each recognize and have joined together today because we are facing a public health crisis, and it also, therefore, is an issue that must have a response that addresses the underlying public health concerns that are both about addiction and treatment,' Harris said. Harris wants to increase access to and the affordability of naloxone, which reverses overdoses, with the vice president calling it 'the difference between life or death.' How do Donald Trump, Kamala Harris’ net worths compare? Inflation and economy Trump Promised 'lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for American workers' by enacting universal baseline tariffs that 'reward domestic production' and tax foreign companies. Said he would lower interest rates. Claimed to have achieved the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years — 3.5% with 6.4 million added jobs before the pandemic. During his presidency, federal debt held by the public rose from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion, influenced by Trump’s tax cuts, particularly his slashes to the corporate tax rate, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center’s FactCheck project. Trump is proposing tax cuts for big businesses and the wealthy to spur investment. He said his tax cuts would garner 3% growth, a milestone he did not reach in his first term. Trump has proposed broad tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. He has proposed no taxes on tips or Social Security income. Harris Shortly after taking office as vice president for Biden, the administration signed the American Rescue Plan, a $2 trillion stimulus package that delivered checks to Americans, boosted unemployment insurance benefits and expanded the child tax credit. Inflation peaked at a four-decade high of 9% in summer 2022 but has since receded to around 3.5%. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, which invested in clean energy that the White House estimates created 117,000 jobs and will reduce Americans’ energy costs by as much as 9% by 2030. Harris has said inflation was a high priority for the administration. 'The President and our administration’s probably highest priority is bringing down the price of gas and cost of living,' Harris said. During her time as a senator, Harris tried to get a bill passed where tax credits up to $6,000 would be available for middle- and low-income households. Harris has also been a strong proponent of forgiving student debt, spearheading the Biden administration’s move to abolish debt for several hundred thousand students at Corinthian Colleges. In 2017, she co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’ proposal for free college for middle-class students at four-year public schools and all who attended two-year institutions. Harris wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and big businesses to fund investments in housing and tax credits for parents. She has proposed more financial assistance for first-time homebuyers and expanded tax credits for parents. She also wants to cut taxes for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Harris wants to remove taxes on tips. . Israel-Palestine conflict Trump Said Israel should 'finish the problem' in Gaza, but warned that Israel is losing the public relations battle Was critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack Told Time Magazine in April that Netanyahu 'rightfully has been criticized for what took place' Trump has said Israel should 'finish the problem' in Gaza, though he has warned that the Israelis are losing the public relations battle.

Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Harris When asked how to handle the war in the Middle East, Harris said that Israel has a right to defend itself, citing the Oct. 7 attacks, while also saying that too many Palestinian civilians have been killed during fighting in Gaza. She said the war must end, there must be a cease-fire deal, and the hostages must be released by Hamas. Harris called for an 'immediate cease-fire' in Gaza in March, describing the situation as a 'humanitarian catastrophe,' the New York Times reported. She said Hamas’ threat to Israel 'must be eliminated' but added that 'too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.' She opposed an Israeli invasion of Rafah, southern Gaza, where over a million people had fled. 'I have studied the maps. There’s nowhere for those folks to go,' she said, noting about 1.5 million people were there after being told to go. Harris has repeatedly expressed support for a two-state solution. Policing and gun safety Trump During his first presidential campaign, Trump positioned himself as a defender of the Second Amendment. A Trump-era ban on bump stocks was overturned by the Supreme Court in June 2024, which said the Trump administration overstepped when it banned the rapid-fire gun attachments. After the May 24, 2022, Uvalde, Texas, shooting at Robb Elementary School, Trump called for 'drastically' changing the nation’s approach to mental health and 'a top-to-bottom security overhaul. at schools across this country' but dismissed calls for further firearm restrictions, AP reported. Trump vowed at an event sponsored by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in February to undo Biden-era gun restrictions if reelected. Harris Harris said during the September debate that she's a gun owner She has called for implementing universal background checks and expanding red flag laws to take away guns from people who are deemed dangerous or unstable. She also wants to ban so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Harris took a tough stand on policing in the wake of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. She co-sponsored legislation in the Senate that would’ve banned police from using chokeholds and no-knock warrants, set a national use-of-force standard and created a national police misconduct registry, among other things. It would have also reformed the qualified immunity system that shields officers from liability. The list in the legislation included practices Harris did not vocally fight to reform while leading California’s Department of Justice. And while she now wants independent investigations of police shootings, she didn’t support a 2015 California bill that would have required her office to take on such cases. In June, as vice president, Harris said that more needed to be done at the federal level to prevent gun violence during a campaign stop in Maryland. Harris, after high-profile shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, in 2022, called for a ban on assault-style weapons. Kamala Harris’ political views, from the border to the economy Project 2025 Trump At the September debate, Trump pushed back claims he's tied to plan, saying, 'I have nothing to do with Project 2025. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it purposely.' Trump has previously disavowed the controversial project, posting on his social media site that he has 'no idea' who is behind Project 2025 and knows 'nothing' about it, but dozens of people who worked closely with him and helped shape his administration are involved in the plan. 'I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,' he wrote. 'Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.' Trump’s campaign has previously said he sets his own priorities and that outside groups don’t speak for him. However, Trump's running mate, Vance, appears to have close ties with the people who had a hand in writing the conservative policy playbook. Harris One of Harris’ main points of attack on the Republican ticket is Project 2025, which she warns will go into effect should Trump get reelected. Harris has seized on the plan, linking it directly to Trump. At the September debate, Harris alleged Trump would sign a national abortion ban, referencing Project 2025. She said Americans believe the government should not control the freedom to make decisions about their body. Harris has pushed back against Trump’s denials, saying he will implement the conservative plan 'hatched by people who used to work for Donald Trump that focuses on the first 180 days' on her campaign website. Harris has spoken about Project 2025 numerous times both while campaigning for Biden and after she became the Democratic nominee for president. Her campaign website has a page dedicated to Project 2025 calling it 'Trump’s plan to take your power, your control and your money.' 'Donald Trump’s plans for a full government takeover have been exposed,' it reads, adding 'his Project 2025 agenda would strip away our freedoms.' At a campaign rally in Wisconsin, Harris said Project 2025 was a 'plan to weaken the middle class.' Harris’ running mate, Walz, also has spoken out against the conservative guidebook. 'Don’t believe him when he’s playing dumb about this Project 2025,' Walz said at a Glendale, Arizona, rally. 'He knows exactly what it will do. They are not playing. They wrote their plan out.' Harris has presented a diametrically opposite position on the issues Project 2025 aims to restructure. Social Security Trump Told Republicans in Congress not to cut 'a single penny' from Medicare or Social Security. Later made comments suggesting he was open to cuts to Medicare and Social Security; his team walked these back and claimed the remarks were taken out of context. Encouraged Republicans to focus their funding cuts on areas of 'waste, fraud and abuse' in addition to programs dealing with foreign aid, immigration, climate change and LGBTQ rights, Reuters reported. Said in a campaign statement he would reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. Harris When she was a U.S. senator for California, she supported the Social Security Expansion Act, which is now championed by leaders including Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., CNBC reported. As vice president, in Biden’s 2024 budget proposal, the administration called for 'protecting and strengthening' Social Security but offered few specifics on reforms to the program, CNBC reported. During the 2020 campaign, the administration proposed raising taxes on those making more than $400,000 to shore up Social Security but largely dropped the idea after taking office, Politico reported. The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare has endorsed Democrats’ Social Security plans, which call for applying additional taxes on wealthy individuals with incomes over $400,000, CNBC reported.

Falsely claimed that the war had killed 'millions' since Russia invaded Ukraine 2 1/2 years ago, while the United Nations says 11,700 civilian deaths have been verified. Called for a cease-fire in an official campaign statement. Said he could 'solve the conflict in a single day.' Trump: 'Every day this proxy battle in Ukraine continues, we risk global war.' More generally suggests overhauling the State Department, the 'defense bureaucracy' and intelligence services to fire who he called members of a 'deep state.' What are Donald Trump’s stances on major issues to voters? Harris Harris praised American and NATO support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion so far — and called for it to continue. Harris announced that the U.S. would donate over $1.5 billion to Ukraine, with funds coming from the State Department and USAID. The financial assistance will aid infrastructure, security, energy and refugee assistance. Harris has been in lockstep with Biden about helping Ukraine amid its war with Russia. During the June summit regarding peace in Ukraine, Harris spoke about the American commitment to the Eastern European nation.

Harris campaigns in Pennsylvania on eve of election	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Pennsylvania on Monday as she makes her final appeal to voters one day before the presidential election. Harris is scheduled to attend rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia alongside celebrities like DJ Cassidy, Fate Joe, Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey. She’ll begin by speaking at a campaign rally at 2:10 p.m. ET in Allentown, Pennsylvania, followed by a 9 p.m. ET rally in Pittsburgh and an 11 p.m. PT rally in Philadelphia. Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threats The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is neck-and-neck heading into Election Day. NewsNation’s partner Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) predicts Trump will win Pennsylvania by 53%. The Keystone State was a tipping point in the previous two presidential races. Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes are the most of any battleground state. Trump’s projected success would buck trends. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican for president by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Tuesday’s election remains a tossup in Pennsylvania, where Harris and Trump both had 50% chances of winning as recently as Oct. 20, according to DDHQ forecasts. This story is developing.

Trump stumps in battleground states in final push ahead of electi...	(NewsNation) — With election day less than 24 hour away, former President Donald Trump is making one final push to win over voters in battleground states. It's been four years since the former president lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, and since, he's been traveling the country and speaking to voters in hopes of returning to the Oval Office in January. Plus, it could be his last chance at becoming president a second time. Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threats Trump's last push ahead of election day Trump will watch the election results on Tuesday from his Mar-a-Largo Estate in Florida; but before then, he will barnstorm battleground states over the next 24 hours. Trump planned four rallies, beginning in Raleigh, North Carolina and stopping twice in Pennsylvania with events in Reading and Pittsburgh. The Republican nominee ends his campaign the way he ended the first two, with a late Monday night event in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Pennsylvania and Michigan are part of the 'blue wall' states for Democrats, and Trump's campaign hopes for a breakthrough. North Carolina is also seen as a must win state for the former president, but it's one where the polling shows an opportunity for Democrats to flip the traditionally Republican-leaning state. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Historic voter turnout Over the weekend, Trump's campaign made its final stretch, saying it's pleased with voter turnout already. The campaign told NewsNation their internal data shows the Trump campaign is turning out more mid and low-propensity voters, who are people who only vote in presidential elections or have never voted before. Trump spent the night in Georgia on Sunday, looking to build on the enthusiasm in the Peach State. 'You know we're on the five-yard line, maybe even the one-yard line. We're right there. We had a tremendous amount of early votes, records like no one can believe,' Trump said at his rally in Macon, Georgia. He continued, 'But all I can say is on Tuesday, just go out and vote. We're gonna close this thing out and it's gonna be party time.' Republicans are betting on voter turnout, arguing enthusiasm is on their side. About 77 million Americans already have voted early, but both candidates are pushing to turn out many millions more supporters on Tuesday. Either result on Election Day will yield a historic outcome. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said the Trump campaign was feeling 'bullish.' A Trump victory would make him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of a felony, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump would also become the second president in history to win non-consecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century.

Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threa...	(NewsNation) — With just two days until the presidential election, more than 77 million Americans have already cast their votes amid mounting legal challenges and concerns about election integrity. In Iowa, a federal judge ruled the state can continue challenging hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens, a decision critics say threatens the voting rights of new U.S. citizens. Recent polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading in Iowa by 3 percentage points. Legal battles are intensifying in key swing states, with both parties filing lawsuits challenging various aspects of the election process. The Republican National Committee has filed 135 lawsuits across 26 states over the past year, primarily concentrated in seven battleground states representing 93 electoral votes. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues In Pennsylvania, considered a crucial swing state, the Trump campaign secured a legal victory when early voting was extended in Bucks County after Republican voters reported being turned away. The state's Supreme Court also ruled in favor of Republicans by rejecting mail-in ballots without handwritten dates for the 2024 election. 'I think those cases are indicative of this overall strategy, which is kind of throw spaghetti at the wall strategy in challenging the integrity of our elections,' said Danielle Lang, Senior Director for the Voting Rights Program at Campaign Legal Center. 'It failed in 2020. They're getting a head start this time, but it's going to fail here as well, and the voters will decide this election, not political actors or litigation.' A Trump-aligned group is reportedly preparing to challenge this year's election results, citing concerns about voter fraud without providing evidence. If either candidate contests the results, they could file lawsuits or request recounts, potentially leading to Supreme Court involvement. The situation echoes the aftermath of the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump filed multiple lawsuits challenging the results. The Supreme Court declined to hear several of these cases, effectively upholding lower court rulings and the election outcome. Election officials and law enforcement are currently preparing for potential threats at polling locations as Americans express growing concern over election denialism.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/election-denial-polling-threats/	2024-11-03T18:00:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e378c8695379.01414579.jpeg?w=900
Republicans target weekend absentee ballot returns in Georgia	Republicans are taking aim at Democratic strongholds in Georgia that opened locations this weekend for voters to return their absentee ballots in person. The Republican National Committee (RNC) filed a new lawsuit Sunday after a state judge one day prior rejected allegations that deep-blue Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, was violating Georgia’s election law over its extension. Harris, Trump both see paths to victory as election nears Republicans cite a provision that mandates drop boxes close when in-person early voting, known as advance voting in Georgia, concludes, which it did Friday. The new case challenges both Fulton and six other Democratic-leaning counties that have similarly continued to accept hand-delivered absentee ballots through the weekend. It was filed in federal court and claims the practice violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection and its delegation of elections authority to state legislatures. 'The county’s actions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by granting special privileges to voters of those counties in violation of state law, thus arbitrarily and disparately affecting against voters and candidates in other counties,' the lawsuit states. The areas being sued include Fulton County and swaths of the Atlanta area that make up much of Democrats’ base in the key swing state: Cobb, DeKalb, Gwinnett and Clayton counties. The other two are Chatham County, which includes the city of Savannah, and Athens-Clarke County. President Biden won all seven counties in 2020 as he flipped Georgia blue in the presidential race for the first time in nearly three decades. This cycle, the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast estimates Trump has a 65 percent chance of winning the key battleground. The announcements to allow people to return absentee ballots in person this weekend and Monday quickly came under fire from the GOP. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now On Balance with Leland Vittert Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Republicans sued Fulton County late Friday night, leading to a hastily scheduled online hearing the following morning. Judge Kevin Farmer ruled in favor of the county, which was backed by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The state law provision at issue did not concern hand delivery of absentee ballots, he said. 'That refers to drop boxes. There are no drop boxes here. Drop boxes are off the table,' Farmer said. Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, said 305 absentee ballots were ultimately returned this weekend during the extension, which will continue Monday. Republicans have also criticized some of the counties for initially not letting the party’s poll watchers observe the continued ballot returns. RNC Chair Michael Whatley on Saturday wrote on the social platform X that observers were ultimately allowed inside. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Alex Kaufman, a Georgia attorney who represents the party, criticized Fulton County officials for announcing the extension just hours before it began. 'We have poll watchers that we would have had to have gone out. This clearly changes the time and conduct of the election at the last moment,' Kaufman said at Saturday's court hearing. The dispute over the extension is part of a broader legal battle playing out in key swing states over mail ballots. The current odds in every battleground state The DNC and other groups convinced a Georgia judge to extend the return deadline until Nov. 8, three days after Election Day, for 3,240 absentee voters whose mail ballots weren’t delivered in Cobb County. In Pennsylvania, the DNC similarly persuaded a state judge to extend additional options for Erie County voters that experienced mail ballot issues due to a vendor problem. The judge found that 365 voters received duplicate ballots and up to 17,000 others may not have received theirs. And in Bucks County, a populous area located north of Philadelphia, the Trump campaign won its lawsuit to extend on-demand mail balloting after voters reported long lines and being turned away early on the final day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-weekend-absentee-ballot-returns/	2024-11-03T16:05:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/georgia_lee_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Do you have to fill out the entire 2024 election ballot? Here's w...	(NEXSTAR) — With many high-stakes races on the ballot, voters face important decisions on Election Day, from presidential candidates to state and local measures. While some people may fill out a bubble in each section, others may be unsure about certain races and wonder: is it necessary to vote on every item? This can be especially true with lengthy ballots that contain numerous down-ballot races, judicial appointments, or proposals that may not have received widespread media coverage. Ballot box fires stoke fears of election violence Though widely encouraged, completing the entire ballot is not required. Ballots that are partially filled — referred to as 'undervoted' ballots — are still valid. So, you can opt to leave certain sections blank if you don't wish to vote on them. 'For example, a voter may choose to vote for president, senator, and governor, but not for other offices or ballot measures that are lower down on their ballot,' the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency explains on a website debunking election rumors. 'Even if a ballot includes an undervote in a particular contest, properly marked votes on their ballot are counted.'

(AP Photo/John Locher) To help make informed decisions, USA.gov, the federal government's official web portal, suggests reviewing voter guides and sample ballots before heading to the polls. Voter guides offer background information on candidates and ballot measures, including each candidate's experience, goals, and explanations of specific issues that will be on the ballot. You can find personalized guides using sites like Ballot Ready and Vote411. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics Sample ballots, on the other hand, simply show the elections, candidates, and measures you’ll encounter without additional information. Many local election offices offer downloadable sample ballots online, according to USA.gov. Voters can often bring these materials into the voting booth, which may be helpful to avoid memorizing each selection. However, some polling places restrict cell phone use, so paper copies may be the better option. Just make sure to check your local election office’s rules ahead of time.

DNC vice chair says 'we're prepared' for close race	Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Chair Ken Martin on Sunday projected confidence going into Election Day on Tuesday, saying Democrats have long prepared for a close race. 'I am really confident, in the end, not only with the early vote returns that we've seen, but also with the ground game that we have, that we'll be successful on election night,' Martin said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. 'Look, we've built this campaign from the very beginning; by the way, we knew this was going to be a close campaign, and we built it, and we're prepared for it,' he continued. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Martin said he tells voters to ignore the 'three Ps: polls, pundits and politicos' and said he was confident because Vice President Harris has the ground game going for her, and it’s riskier banking on low-propensity voters to turn out, which Martin suggested the Trump campaign is doing. 'One of the reasons we're buoyed, not only is the early vote returns that we're seeing throughout the nation, but also the fact that throughout all the battlegrounds, the only campaign that really has a sizable on-the-ground operation capable of actually getting their supporters to the polls, is the Harris-Walz campaign,' Martin said. 'And in the end, if you believe that this is a tied game, in the final quarter of the game, the tie has to go to the campaign that actually has the organization on the ground to get their voters and their supporters to the polls, and in all these battlegrounds, the only presence we're seeing on the ground in any sizable fashion is the Harris-Walz campaign,' he continued.

Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Michael Whatley said in a Sunday interview that he is confident in former President Trump's ability to win the Electoral College vote on Tuesday. 'We certainly have a great shot at winning the national vote, but I think more importantly is that we are going into Election Day with leads in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, and we are doing substantially better in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania than we were in either 2016 or in 2020,' Whatley said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. 'So we are in a great position to win this thing on Election Day,' he continued. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night The latest polling ahead of Election Day shows that Trump and Vice President Harris are locked in a close race, including in some of the key battleground states. In the national polling average from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points, with 48.3 percent support to Harris’s 48.1 percent. The polling averages in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia show Trump leading Harris by approximately 1 to 3 points. Trump leads Harris by an average of less than 1 point in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Michigan has Harris leading by an average of 0.2 points. 'We are very bullish,' Whatley continued in his interview. 'And Donald Trump is right now barnstorming across every one of these battleground states and talking directly with the American voters about the issues that they care about, and that's what's going to get him across the finish line.'

Harris, Trump both see paths to victory as election nears	The presidential race is tight, and neither candidate has a clear lead. But in the final weekend before Election Day, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump are ready to declare victory. Both campaigns say they have laid the groundwork to win. Both think they have the correct rationale for why they should win. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states The Harris campaign says their ground game will help see them through, pointing to more than 2,500 staffers and volunteers in key states. They also say issues like abortion along with Harris's favorability rating, which is several points higher than Trump’s in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill average of polls, will help catapult the vice president to the White House. At the same time, the Trump campaign points to polls that show that voters don't think the country is heading in the right direction, highlighting the recent rising costs and the overall 'vibe' of the economy. They also say Harris is tied to President Biden, whose own approval rating is underwater. Historically, they say when an incumbent has a low approval rating — Biden is at 40 percent — the opposing party prevails. They also feel good about their registration and early vote numbers. 'I think both sides have valid reasons for how and why a win is possible,' said one Democratic strategist close to the Harris campaign. 'That's part of the reason why it's so close and why neither side has the advantage. Every poll is ridiculously close.' A poll released by Gallup this week showed that approximately 49 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Harris compared to 44 percent for Trump. Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, also has a higher favorable rating at 45 percent than Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (Ohio), who is at 39 percent. Those numbers bode well for Harris, Gallup noted, because candidates with higher favorability ratings have typically won recent presidential elections. 'Honestly, there’s any number of data points and reasons I think Harris will win, but there’s also the Potter Stewart analogy: You may not be able to define a winning campaign, but you know it when you see it,' Democratic strategist Christy Setzer said. 'Harris continues to pack stadiums, generate excitement, while controlling the media narrative.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Since becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has leaned into abortion as an issue, and Democrats say that was a smart tack. They point to a recent NBC News poll that showed likely voters feel 'strongly' about abortion. When respondents were asked if there was one issue they felt strongly about that would decide their vote for or against a candidate, 22 percent said abortion, outranking other issues including immigration, protecting democracy and even cost of living. The current odds in every battleground state Since the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, Democrats have successfully rallied women around the issue, turning out record numbers of voters during the 2022 midterm elections. And that momentum shows no sign of slowing, Democrats say. 'So far, women are still voting at post-Dobbs level, and there are no corresponding sights yet of the ‘bro vote surge’ they have been targeting,' said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale. 'Harris has a strong closing message on the economy, abortion, and democracy, while Trump is flailing from grievance to grievance, playing dress-up garbage man, and threatening to shoot people.' But the Trump campaign says their message on top issues including the economy and immigration has been resonating with voters, a point even Republicans who aren’t supporting Trump acknowledge. 'When he’s on message and he’s talking about the issues, his points crack through the noise more than Kamala’s do,' one GOP strategist said. 'I still can’t tell you what her vision is.' Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Republicans have also 'made massive voter registration gains, and we are far outperforming in our share of the early vote relative to two or four years ago across all battleground states.' 'Voters know that Kamala Harris has destroyed our country, but President Trump will fix it when he ends inflation, secures the border, and makes America strong again — and that is why he is well-positioned for victory,' Leavitt added. Republicans say they have successfully tied Harris to Biden, who remains highly unpopular with the American electorate, which serves as a red flag to political observers. 'The bottom line is for Kamala Harris to win, she’d have to break history,' CNN’s Harry Enten, who analyzes election data, said this week on the cable network. Enten also pointed to recent polls that showed a majority of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction. 'There isn’t a single time in which 28 percent of the American public thinks the country is going on the right track in which the incumbent party actually won,' Enten said. Republicans also maintain Trump has also made significant inroads with Hispanic and Black men. 'It’s a matter of whether they can get them out to the polls now,' said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist who has worked on recent presidential campaigns. 'If he hits his mark with those two subsets of voters, look out.' How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election Speakers at a Trump rally in New York City last weekend caused a stir when a comedian made inappropriate jokes about Latinos and Puerto Rico. On Friday, Harris campaign aides said they saw the rally break through to undecided voters, giving them a shot in the arm in the final days of the campaign. The officials said internal data shows Harris winning by double digits among voters who just decided who to support in recent days. The Harris campaign also got good news on Saturday after a Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in Iowa showed Harris with a three-point lead over Trump. The poll of more than 800 voters who were surveyed showed Harris over Trump 47 percent to 44 percent. While the poll is within the margin of error, it revealed a significant shift from a September survey in the state which showed Trump leading by 4 points. Are Nevada voters swayed by promises of ‘no tax on tips’? The Trump campaign immediately cast the poll as a significant outlier, but it still gave the Harris camp a jolt of momentum. A second Democratic strategist said while Trump had been seen as the candidate with the momentum over the last couple of weeks, Harris has seen a turning point of sorts in the last several days. 'I think we are exactly where we need to be,' the strategist said. But Vale and other Democrats have concluded one thing: No one knows how it will end. 'It’s going to be close, and a grind to the finish,' Vale said. 'But the saying ‘Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades’ also applies to the Electoral College.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-victory-paths/	2024-11-03T14:37:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Declare_110324_Illustration_Courtney-JonesJulia-Demaree-Nikhinson-and-David-CalvertAPand-Adobe-Stock.png?w=900
Sen. Moore Capito: 'I don’t anticipate a scenario' where GOP refu...	Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said she does not anticipate a scenario in which Senate Republicans refuse to certify the election results but stressed she thinks former President Trump will win on Tuesday. 'Well, I think we want fair and safe elections. I think we see early reports that the safety and security of our ballots across the, across the country, now appear to be safe, and I think that is a great reassurance to all of us who are voting for President Trump,' Capito said in an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt when asked whether Senate Republicans were prepared to certify Vice President Harris as the next president if she is whom voters select on Election Day. 'Obviously, in a close election, every vote counts,' she continued. 'I don't anticipate a scenario where we're not ready to certify whoever wins, and but I believe that will be a reelection of President Trump.' What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Capito, however, avoided disagreeing with Trump when asked about his recent claims on social media that Pennsylvania 'is cheating and getting caught' ahead of the election. Pennsylvania is one of the closest battlegrounds for the major party candidates ahead of this election. 'Well, I think, I think Pennsylvania definitely needs to get their act together because we know in 2020 there were more than a few very suspicious ballots cast, and investigations showed that those who were in charge fell way short of assuring that our ballots were safe, counted properly, and attributed to the correct candidate,' Capito said, echoing unsubstantiated claims the former president has made. 'So I understand why President Trump is very suspicious of the state of Pennsylvania,' she continued. Capito said Pennsylvania has a lot of early votes and is being watched closely. Dems will ‘absolutely not’ repeat Jan. 6 if Trump wins: Senator 'I think what he's doing is very smart, and that he's keeping those in Pennsylvania feet to the fire. They know everyone's watching,' Capito said of the former president. 'Pennsylvania should definitely have this together. They've had, they've been challenged over the last four years as to the authenticity of the votes cast in 2020. I hope that they hear this, but they do know that those of us who experienced that in 2020 are very suspicious,' she said.

Trump says 'Fox News is not our friend,' claims it's airing 'Demo...	Former President Trump on Sunday took aim at Fox News for airing what the GOP presidential nominee sees as too much coverage devoted to the Democrats, just a few days before the election. 'FoxNews keeps putting on Democrat ads, as part of their news program. Their soundbites are almost all of Harris and her Democrat friends, all of whom are on the shows,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday morning. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics 'FOX NEWS IS NOT OUR FRIEND. It’s crazy!' Trump continued. The GOP presidential nominee has for months railed against Fox, the top-rated cable news channel, over its coverage of him and programming, though he is seen on the outlet regularly for interviews, town halls and other appearances. Just a few weeks ago, Trump criticized Fox News for airing negative political ads attacking him and said he would appeal directly to media mogul Rupert Murdoch to get them removed from the air during an interview on the network. 'In the old days, you never played negative ads. In other words, when I leave here, I’ll then be hit by five or six ads,' Trump said two weeks ago during an in-studio interview on 'Fox &amp; Friends,' the network’s flagship morning show. 'You mean Fox News?' host Brian Kilmeade interjected. 'When I leave, I’ll have 12 people from Kamala on, and pretty much unopposed,' Trump said. 'For 19 days, I don’t think we should do that anymore. I think you shouldn’t play negative ads. It’s very tough.' 'You do a show — and I complain all the time. I love complaining,' he added. 'I like to have everything perfect. But when I leave here … it’s sort of a net neutral.' The Hill has reached out to Fox News for comment. Trump’s latest remarks come just days before Election Day, as the race between him and Vice President Harris remains neck and neck. In the latest national polling average from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points, with 48.3 percent support to Harris’s 48.1 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-fox-news-ad-claims/	2024-11-03T12:32:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24308055921869-e1730601486191.jpg?w=900

(The Hill) — A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner has claimed that Vice President Harris’s recent appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' violates the 'equal time' rule. 'This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,' Commissioner Brendan Carr posted on the social platform X Saturday in response to a post from The Associated Press about Harris being on the show that night. 'The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct - a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.

Harris seeks boost from women voters to help her over finish line	Vice President Harris is seeking to maximize turnout from women voters in the final days before the election in hope the critical voting block can carry her over the finish line. While much of the conversation in the closing days of the campaign has surrounded Harris’s soft support among men, Democrats argue that women have the chance to boost Harris. They point to the voting bloc’s role in securing Democratic wins in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections. But Republicans remain skeptical that women, particularly suburban women in swing states, will be a shoo-in for Harris, pointing to concerns over the economy. 'Kamala Harris is positioned to win this election because of women,' said Jessica Mackler, the president of EMILY’s List, a group dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office. On Wednesday, the Harris campaign hammered Trump for defending comments he made in September, in which he pledged to be a 'protector of women.' During a rally on Wednesday, Trump said he disagreed with counsel from his advisers that he not use that language. 'I said, ‘Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I’m going to protect them. I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things,’' Trump told supporters in Wisconsin. Harris responded to Trump’s remarks on Thursday, calling them 'the latest in a series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women and their agency.' 'It actually is very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,' the vice president told reporters in Wisconsin. And earlier this week, the Harris campaign released an ad featuring actor Julia Roberts in which she encouraged women to vote for the vice president even if their husbands were backing Trump. 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,' Roberts says in the spot. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign worked to amplify comments from Harris campaign surrogate Mark Cuban, in which he told ABC’s 'The View' on Thursday that 'you never see [Trump] around strong, intelligent women.' Trump’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt tied Harris to the comments in a statement to The Hill. 'Kamala Harris' campaign thinks women who support President Trump are weak and dumb, and she takes issue with President Trump wanting to protect women, men, and children from migrant crime and foreign adversaries,' Leavitt said. 'Women deserve a President who will secure our nation's borders, remove violent criminals from our neighborhoods, and build an economy that helps our families thrive — and that's exactly what President Trump will do,' she continued. On policy, Harris and her allies have sought to amplify abortion access and reproductive health care in the closing salvos of the campaign, tying it to her campaign’s theme of 'freedom.' Amanda Zurawski, a Texas woman who sued the state after she said she was denied an abortion while facing pregnancy complications, delivered remarks alongside her husband ahead of Harris’s own closing argument remarks at the Ellipse outside the White House on Tuesday. Harris herself addressed the issue in her remarks, telling supporters she will 'restore what Donald Trump and his hand selected Supreme Court Justices took away from the women of America.' 'Kamala Harris has delivered this really clear message about the contrast, particularly on the issue of reproductive freedom,' Mackler said. Democrats point to their past success on the issue. In 2022, Democrats largely blunted what was expected to be a red wave in most parts of the country by focusing on abortion access in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The effects were also felt a year later in Virginia’s off-year elections, where Democrats took control of the state’s general assembly. In 2024, Harris and Democrats are tying Trump to bans and restrictions on the procedure at the state level. 'What we have seen since the Dobbs decision in every election is that women are motivated on the issue of abortion and this election is going to be fought and won on abortion,' Mackler said. The issue of abortion access seems to be resonating for young women in particular. According to a KFF survey released earlier this month, roughly four in ten women under 30 said abortion is the most important issue to their vote. Republicans, on the other hand, say abortion is not the only factor impacting the way women will vote in November. 'I don’t think they want to be defined as an abortion voter,' said Kristin Davison, a national GOP strategist. 'Obviously they care about the issue, but it’s not their main driver because they probably have bills to pay and crime is going up in their Atlanta suburb and they aren’t sure Harris is up to the job to fix it.' Republicans also point to the suburban female swing voters, predicting they could vote against Harris on the economy. 'The No. 1 issue for suburban women is the economy,' said Lauren Zelt, a national Republican strategist. 'The Harris campaign is working hard to make this about reproductive issues and understandably so. But at the end of the day women are the primary financial decision makers for their families and they’re going to be voting with their pocket books.' However, many Democrats say the two issues are fundamentally linked. 'I don’t see abortion and economy as separate issues,' said Rachel O’Leary Carmona, the executive director of the Women’s March. 'When we’re talking about the economy, I don’t think with the amount of women heads of household, women primary earners, women who are in the workforce that we can extricate the issue of reproductive freedom from concerns about the economy.' Others have pointed to poor messaging toward women on the part of Republicans, pointing to overly masculine messaging from figures like Elon Musk. 'This bromance and masculinity stuff, it borders on edgy to the point that it’s going to make women uncomfortable,' former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley told Fox News’ Bret Baier on Tuesday. 'You have got affiliated PACs doing commercials about calling Kamala the 'c' word or speakers at Madison Square Garden, you know, referring to her and her ‘pimps,’' she continued, referring to a video posted on X by Musk's super PAC calling Harris the 'c-word' before calling her a 'communist.' The video was deleted by the group on Monday. 'That is not the way to win women. That is not the way to win people who are concerned about Trump’s style,' Haley said. Early voting data shows heightened enthusiasm among women. According to a Politico analysis of the early vote data, women account for 55 percent of the early vote compared to men, who make up 45 percent in the battleground states. Democrats say they are optimistic about those numbers based on how women have broken in polling so far. A CBS News poll released earlier this week showed 55 percent of women supporting Harris, while 43 percent said the same about Trump. On the flip side, 45 percent of men said they were supporting Harris and 54 percent said the same about the former president. 'Every state will be different,' Davison said. 'I do think a woman in Buckhead, outside of Atlanta or Marietta, is going to have a different approach than someone who is in Media, Pa., which is in Delaware County outside of Philadelphia.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/harris-seeks-boost-from-women-voters-to-help-her-over-finish-line/	2024-11-03T10:15:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Female-voters_110324_AP_David-Calvert.jpg?w=900
Election security is a 'top concern': Atlanta mayor	(NewsNation) — Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens is focused on ensuring Atlantans feel safe as they head to the voting booth before Election Day. While concerns linger about the security of the election and those voting, Dickens told 'Morning in America Weekend' that is a top priority in his city. 'Election security is a top concern right now, the Atlanta police department and Fulton County Police Department are working hand in hand to make sure that all polling locations are safe so that voters can feel safe as they go to the polls and leave the polls,' Dickens said. Given the heightened rhetoric in American politics, there are worries violence and unruliness could occur once the next president is announced. 'We hope that individuals will use their best common sense to accept the results of the election, knowing that there's very little fraud that will occur, that this is going to be a safe and secure election, but we make sure that you know, as I talk to our police chief every single morning, we're going to do what needs to be done to keep the people of Atlanta safe,' Dickens added. According to Decision Desk HQ, former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 2.2% in the key battleground state of Georgia.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/election-security-top-concern-atlanta/	2024-11-03T10:10:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2176590215.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. says Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking wa...	PHOENIX (AP) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president. Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century. Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride. 'On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,' Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, 'want to Make America Healthy Again,' he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy. Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, 'but it sounds OK to me. You know it’s possible.' The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, 'He’s going to have a big role in the administration.' Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as 'a very talented guy and has strong views.' The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump’s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say. Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids. In August, a federal agency determined 'with moderate confidence' that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water. A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it’s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn’t say what those measures should be. In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food &amp; Water Watch. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit. What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to 'reorganize' agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture. But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: 'You can work on food, you can work on anything you want' except oil policy. 'He wants health, he wants women’s health, he wants men’s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,' Trump added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-donald-trump-would-push-to-remove-fluoride-from-drinking-water/	2024-11-03T09:44:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6727b6feee7ff2.41652838.jpeg?w=900
Final Senate rankings: 5 seats most likely to flip	Two days remain until Election Day, and Republicans are aiming to take control of the Senate and expand their majority. Democrats hold a 51-49 advantage, which Republicans have already sliced into with their pending victory in West Virginia. That leaves them needing only one more seat to win back the upper chamber, with Montana and Ohio being the prime targets. According to Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), the GOP has a 70 percent chance of wrestling back the Senate. A number of battleground races have tightened to dead heats, and the performance of former President Trump and Vice President Harris could also play a role in the outcomes. For the final time of the 2024 cycle, here are the top five seats likely to flip: Montana Republican Tim Sheehy, left, is in position to topple Democratic Montana Sen. Jon Tester. (Ben Allan Smith, The Missoulian via Associated Press) A win in Montana means the majority for the GOP, and the party has felt increasingly bullish that Republican Tim Sheehy is in position to topple Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). Montana is widely considered Republicans’ best chance at flipping a seat, outside of West Virginia. According to a recent survey by The Hill/Emerson College, Sheehy leads by 4 percentage points (50 percent to 46 percent) over the three-term incumbent. And the Cook Political Report has the seat in its 'lean Republican' column. Perhaps more indicative of where the race stands is how each side has maneuvered their final spends. A top GOP outside group recently shifted nearly $3 million from Montana to Nevada, where Republicans have seen some last-minute tightening, showing confidence that Sheehy is ready to seal the deal. 'I'm feeling certain about Montana right now,' one Senate Republican told The Hill, noting that recent internal polls on the GOP side have shown Sheehy holding a lead over Tester that is outside the margin of error. Democrats, however, don’t think this race is over despite the public polls. They are quick to note that Montana is notoriously difficult to poll and say that Tester’s 2012 victory, his last run in a presidential year, shows he can win despite polls showing him down. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), left, and Republican Bernie Moreno. (Jeff Dean and David Dermer, Associated Press) The race between Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Republican Bernie Moreno has drawn to even with Tuesday fast approaching. A win in Ohio would expand Republicans’ majority and the race has become the most expensive contest on the Senate map this year. Brown held a steady lead that lasted through Labor Day, buoyed by a massive advantage on the airwaves, but the wind appears to be at Moreno’s back now. An average of polls from DDHQ and The Hill shows Moreno up by just less than 1 percentage point. Republican operatives have argued that the contest is mirroring the trend line of Sen. JD Vance’s (R-Ohio) race two years ago. Vance trailed then-Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) throughout the summer and into October before overtaking and ultimately defeating him by 6 points. They are also counting on a boost from Trump. The operatives say an 8-point victory at the presidential level should be enough to pull Moreno across the finish line. Brown himself has reportedly told donors that an 8-point margin is one that he likely cannot overcome. 'Sherrod's an A [candidate] and Bernie's a C-,' one GOP operative involved in Senate races said. 'But we should win it based on gravity.' The Ohio contest is set to become not only the most expensive Senate race this cycle, but of all time. The Georgia Senate race in 2020 between Sen. Jon Ossoff (D) and former Sen. David Perdue (R) attracted $412 million, with this contest set to eclipse the $500 million mark. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), left, and Republican Eric Hovde. (Mark Schiefelbein and J. Scott Applewhite, Associated Press file) Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) is trying to hang on for dear life as Republican Eric Hovde has brought the must-win race for Democrats to a virtual dead heat. Republicans are eyeing Wisconsin as one of their best pickup opportunities outside of Montana and Ohio. Baldwin, a two-term incumbent, ran ahead of Hovde throughout much of the cycle, but that lead has largely disappeared as GOP-leaning men have come home to the Republican Party. The Cook Political Report rates the contest a 'toss-up.' Still, whether Hovde can get over the final hump remains a major question. According to the final Marquette University Law poll, Baldwin holds a 2-point lead over the GOP nominee. Perhaps just as important, she is outrunning Harris by a slight margin. Democrats still see work to do in the home stretch, and that centers on turning out Democratic-heavy Milwaukee. 'I think you'll see a real focus on the city of Milwaukee from Democrats up and down the ballot in the final hours,' one Wisconsin-based Democratic operative said, pointing to Harris’s rally with Baldwin in the city on Friday and other smaller events. Republicans, meanwhile, see Baldwin as a generic Democrat who will have trouble separating herself from the top of the ticket despite what the Marquette poll says. The race, much like several of the 'blue wall' states, also depends on the margin at the top of the ticket, with Hovde likely needing Trump to win with a big enough margin to carry him across the line. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) left, and David McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania. (Associated Press) Defeating Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has been atop the wish list of Pennsylvania Republicans ever since he knocked off Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) nearly two decades ago, and they easily have their best chance this week. Casey has held a consistent margin over Republican David McCormick into September, but has seen his lead sliced and diced to where it is now — almost deadlocked. While Republicans routinely note that toppling Casey is by no means easy, they laud McCormick and his team for how they’ve been able to tie the Democrat to Harris. The perceived inability to create separation is giving Democrats anxiety as they near the end. 'I always thought Casey would do like 3 points better than the top of the ticket. But polling isn’t showing that. His numbers are the same as Kamala’s,' one senior Pennsylvania Democrat said. 'I’m surprised.' 'Even [Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.)], who isn’t an incumbent, is running better than Bob and has some separation with Harris,' the Democrat continued, saying if Trump wins Pennsylvania 'by 1 then the Senate race could definitely go Republican too.' According to Decision Desk HQ, Casey leads by more than 2 percentage points and has a 72 percent chance at nabbing a fourth term. Republicans are also putting more muscle behind their message in the final stretch as they spent $16.2 million last week compared to $11.9 million by Democrats in the second most expensive Senate race on the map this cycle. Michigan Michigan Senate candidate Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), left, and former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.). (Associated Press) For a time this fall, Republicans had believed that Michigan represented the party’s best chance at winning a non-Montana or non-Ohio race. Unlike races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, the contest between former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and Slotkin does not feature an incumbent after Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) decided against seeking a fifth term, theoretically giving the GOP an advantage not seen elsewhere. However, Slotkin and Michigan have proved a tough nut to crack. Operatives on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged in recent days that while the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan are all up for grabs, Michigan is probably the least likely of the three to flip as the other states have narrowed more in the final weeks.

A tie in the Electoral College could have this unprecedented outc...	(NEXSTAR) – A tie in the Electoral College, while very unlikely, is still very much possible thanks to the even number of electoral votes (538) up for grabs in the upcoming presidential election. If neither candidate obtains the 270 votes needed to win — i.e., each candidate gets 269 votes apiece — then the elected members of Congress would decide the winner of the presidency and vice presidency in what’s called a contingent election. That process, in and of itself, would be 'disruptive' and 'problematic,' Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, previously told The Hill. But it could also result in a scenario that the American public hasn’t seen in over 200 years. Which states have the highest and lowest voter turnout in presidential elections? In a contingent election, the House of Representatives would meet to determine the president, with each state’s delegation allowed to cast one vote for the candidate of their choice. (Washington, D.C. would not participate.) The first candidate to receive 26 votes would then become president. But the Senate would be tasked with electing the vice president, with each Senator allowed to cast a single vote. (Again, D.C. would not participate in contingent elections.) The first candidate with 51 votes is then declared the winner. In a contingent election, therefore, it’s possible that the House selects a president from the majority’s preferred party, while the Senate chooses a vice president from the other. Such a scenario would be more likely if the House and Senate are controlled by different parties after the election. For example, a tie in the electoral college after the 2024 election could theoretically result in a Trump-Walz administration, if the Republicans and Democrats manage to retain their current majorities in the House and the Senate, respectively. Signs showing support for both Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump sit along a rural highway on September 26, 2024 near Traverse City, Michigan. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University and the author of 'The Presidents and the People: Five Leaders Who Threatened Democracy and the Citizens Who Fought to Defend It,' believes the chance of this happening in 2024 is 'low.' But that's largely because he believes there are 'vulnerabilities' in the Electoral College system that could allow one candidate — Trump, he named specifically — to unethically manipulate the electoral votes before a contingent election would ever need to take place. 'The system as a whole is very precarious,' Brettschneider said. 'It’s not as stable as it should be.' If indeed a contingent election were held, and a president and vice president from different parties were chosen to serve in the same administration, there would be constant 'undermining' of the other’s objectives, Brettschneider believes. The last time that two politicians from different political parties somewhat reluctantly served in the same administration was between 1797-1801, when President John Adams (a Federalist) and Vice President Thomas Jefferson (a Democratic-Republican) held the offices. '[With] the Adams Administration, you had a president who was intent in shutting down the opposition, and a vice president who was the leader of that opposition,' said Brettschneider, adding that the administration was 'a microcosm of the instability of the country as a whole.' But Adams and Jefferson didn’t end up together because of a contingent election: At the time, the candidate with the most electoral votes became president, and the runner-up became vice president. The 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, aimed to prevent this by overhauling the process to create a distinction between votes for the offices of president and vice president. There’s still nothing in the Constitution that would forbid a two-party presidential ticket. Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson had belonged to different parties (Republican and Democratic) before they successfully ran for the nation’s highest offices in 1864 — though, technically, they had both aligned prior to the election under the newly created National Union party. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had also revealed in his 2018 memoir that he nearly selected Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) as his running mate in the 2008 election, and even expressed regret that he hadn’t. McCain’s advisers, he said, steered him toward Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, fearing that Lieberman’s pro-choice stance on abortion would hurt his chances. 'It was sound advice that I could reason for myself,' McCain wrote. 'But my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.' Why doesn’t the popular vote determine the president? But even a potential McCain-Lieberman ticket would have been spearheaded by politicians who willingly chose to be running mates. A Trump-Walz administration, on the other hand, would not be built on as stable a foundation — and could result in both men trying to undermine each other, or oust the other from power. 'I don’t see it as a good thing,' said Brettschneider. 'I don’t see a world where this is a good thing for American democracy.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/a-tie-in-the-electoral-college-could-have-this-unprecedented-outcome/	2024-11-03T07:59:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/YardSignsHarrisTrumpGettyImages-2174737008-e1730401432832.jpg?w=800

Harris appears on 'Saturday Night Live' as mirror image of Maya R...	NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' in the final days before the election, playing herself as the mirror-image double of Maya Rudolph's version of her. The first lines the candidate spoke as she sat across from Rudolph was drowned out by cheers from the audience. 'It is nice to see you Kamala,' Harris told Rudolph, 'and I’m just here to remind you you got this.' In sync, the two said supporters need to 'Keep Kamala and carry-on-ala,' declared that they share each other's 'belief in the promise of America,' and delivered the signature 'Live from New York it's Saturday night!' Harris made the surprise trip to New York City with the election looming, briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she’s been furiously campaigning in favor of the iconic sketch comedy show, where she was hoping to generate buzz and appeal to a nationwide audience. Harris arrived in New York on Air Force Two after an early evening campaign stop Saturday on in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was scheduled to head to Detroit, but once in the air, aides said she'd be making an unscheduled stop and the plane landed at LaGuardia Airport. Harris arrived at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan, where SNL tapes, shortly after 8 p.m., enough time for a quick rehearsal before the show airs live at 11:30 p.m. It is the final SNL episode before Election Day on Tuesday. The visit wasn’t previously announced and an official familiar with Harris’ planning only officially confirmed it for reporters traveling with the vice president moments before the live airing began. The official insisted on anonymity to discuss plans before they were made public. Rudolph first played Harris on the show in 2019 and has reprised her role this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice president, including calling herself 'Momala' — a reference to the affectionate nickname her stepchildren gave her. Rudolph opened the show’s season premiere with the line: 'Well, well, well. Look who fell out of that coconut tree.' And she’s joked about keeping President Joe Biden in his place. Harris' husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, was played again by former cast member Andy Samberg and Dana Carvey appeared as President Joe Biden. Rudolph's performance has won critical and comedic acclaim — including from Harris herself. 'Maya Rudolph — I mean, she’s so good,' Harris said last month on ABC's 'The View.' 'She had the whole thing, the suit, the jewelry, everything!' Harris added that she was impressed with Rudolph’s 'mannerisms.' Jason Miller, a senior adviser to former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump, expressed surprise that Harris would appear on SNL given what he characterized as her unflattering portrayal on the show. Asked if Trump had been invited to appear, he said: 'I don’t know. Probably not.' Politicians nonetheless have a long history on SNL, including Trump, who hosted the show in 2015 — though appearing so close to Election Day is unusual. Hillary Clinton was running in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary when she appeared next to Amy Poehler, who played her on the show and was known for launching into a trademark, exaggerated cackle. The real Clinton wondered during her appearance, 'Do I really laugh like that?' Harris repeated that line in response to Rudolph's portrayal of her laugh in Saturday's episode. Clinton returned in 2016, while running against Trump in a race she ultimately lost. The first sitting president to appear on SNL was Republican Gerald Ford, who did so less than a year after the show debuted. Ford appeared in April 1976 on an episode hosted by his press secretary, Ron Nessen, and declared the show’s famous opening rejoinder, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday Night.' Then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama appeared alongside Poehler impersonating Clinton in 2007, and Republican Bob Dole was on the show in November 1996 -- a mere 11 days after losing that year’s election to Bill Clinton. Dole consoled Norm Macdonald, who played the Kansas senator. Then there was Tina Fey’s 2008 impression of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin — and in particular her joke that 'I can see Russia from my house.' It was so good that Fey eventually won an Emmy and Palin herself appeared on the show that October, in the weeks before the election. ___ Long, Miller and Weissert reported from Washington.

Trump's nephew warns of unchecked power in a second Trump term	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump's nephew Fred Trump III in an interview on 'NewsNation Prime' warned of what another presidency under his uncle would look like. Fred Trump also said that the former president reportedly told him to let his disabled son die. Fred Trump said his uncle had never met his son, William, now 25, who has complex disabilities. When he called Donald Trump to discuss his son's condition, the former president responded: 'Your son doesn't recognize you. Let him die and move down to Florida.' 'I just simply said 'Donald, he does recognize me, and he is to me … the most courageous and inspirational person I know,'' the younger Trump recalled during the Saturday interview. Harris takes lead over Trump in Iowa: Poll Fred Trump was promoting his new book, 'All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way,' which features 'never-before-told stories' about the Trump family and Fred Trump’s complex relationship with the former president. He said similar comments about disabled people were made by Donald Trump in the Oval Office in 2020. The former president's nephew also warned about a potential second Trump term, saying there would be no 'guardrails' to check his power. He criticized his uncle's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that 'tens of thousands' were dying daily during his administration. Fred Trump said he decided to publish the book after the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots, which he called 'an absolute turning point,' and after his son moved into a group home, ensuring his safety from potential harassment. Trump says it’s ‘tough’ for Republicans to win the popular vote Fred Trump and his sister, Mary, have been vocal critics of their uncle. Trump communications director Steven Cheung denied Fred Trump’s claims in a statement to NewsNation partner The Hill. 'This is completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order,' he said. 'It is appalling a lie so blatantly disgusting can be printed in media. Anyone who knows President Trump knows he would never use such language, and false stories like this have been thoroughly debunked.' 'This is nothing more than a cheap shot to sell copies of a book that belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section,' he added.

NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris has made an unannounced trip to New York to appear on ' Saturday Night Live,' briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she’s been campaigning with just three days to go before the election. Harris departed on Air Force Two after a campaign stop on Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was scheduled to head to Detroit, but once the aircraft was in the air, aides said it was actually going to New York.

Trump says it’s ‘tough’ for Republicans to win the popular vote	Former President Trump argued that Republicans winning the popular vote is 'tough' because of Democratic strength in certain strongholds ahead of Election Day on Tuesday. Trump said at a rally in Virginia that votes need to turn out on Tuesday because he wants to win 'everything,' including the popular vote. But he said states like California make winning the popular vote tough. 'When you have New York, Illinois and California, you have automatically, it’s like ridiculous, automatically goes to a Democrat, it’s tough to win the popular vote because they’re three big states,' he said. While Trump won the presidency in 2016, he was unsuccessful in winning the popular vote that year against Hillary Clinton or in 2020 against President Biden. Democrats have won the popular vote in the past five of six presidential elections going back to 2000, though Republicans have won in the Electoral College three of those times. Trump claimed that polls are showing him leading 'everything' and that he expects to win the popular vote. He also alluded to his false claims of voter fraud helping Democrats, as he has claimed cost him reelection in 2020. 'I’d love to win the popular vote with them cheating. Let them cheat because that’s what they do. They do it very well. They’re very professional, but I think we have a really good chance to win the popular vote, and I think things are going to be very interesting,' he said. Because the Electoral College requires candidates to win enough states to equal 270 electoral votes, winning the popular vote is not necessarily enough to get over the finish line. Democrats have more recently been the victim of this effect, as frequent winners of the popular vote recently but falling short in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by 2 points in 2016 but narrowly lost the electoral vote. Biden won the popular vote by 4.5 points but only narrowly pulled off an electoral win. Experts have said Vice President Harris may not have enough to win the popular vote by as much as past Democrats because of some shifts in the electorate giving Republicans an improvement in popular vote margins that don’t necessarily help in the Electoral College. Trump’s visit to Virginia is one of a couple of stops he’s making this weekend to states that have leaned Democratic and are expected to vote for Harris comfortably.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-its-tough-for-republicans-to-win-the-popular-vote/	2024-11-02T17:26:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trumpdonald_110224gn15_w.jpg?w=900
Harris takes lead over Trump in Iowa: Poll	Vice President Harris has taken a 3-point lead over her opponent, former President Trump, in red-leaning Iowa, according to a new poll released on Saturday. The new Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey found Harris outpacing Trump by 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent, among Iowa’s likely voters, jumping ahead of the former president who won the state in both 2016 and 2020. The result was just inside the survey’s margin of error. The September iteration of the poll had Trump leading the vice president by 4 points. 'It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,' pollster J. Ann Selzer told The Des Moines Register. 'She has clearly leaped into a leading position.' Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who remains on the Iowa ballot, got 3 percent support. Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver was at less than 1 percent. Some 3 percent said they were not sure about their choice, 2 percent did not share who they already voted for and 1 percent said they sided with someone else, according to the survey. Both White House candidates have heavily campaigned in the seven battleground states. Neither has campaigned in Iowa following the conclusion of the party’s primaries, the Register noted. The last time a Democratic nominee won Iowa was former President Obama in 2012. 'Age and gender are the two most dynamic factors that are explaining these numbers,' Selzer said. Harris leads Trump among women independent voters by 28 points, 57 percent to 29 percent, while the GOP nominee was ahead by 10 points among independent men voters, 47 percent to 37 percent, according to the poll. The vice president has an advantage among those aged 65 and above. She leads Trump by 35 points, 63 percent to 28 percent, among senior women. Her lead is significantly smaller among senior men, beating Trump 47 percent to 45 percent, according to the survey. The poll found a larger contingent of Trump supporters being enthusiastic about backing the former president compared to Harris’s supporters. Around 76 percent of the ex-president’s supporters are 'extremely or very enthusiastic' about their pick in this election, 5 points more than 71 percent that expressed the same about Harris. Approximately 91 percent of respondents said they were firm about the choice in his White House election. The poll was conducted Oct. 28-31 among 808 likely voters. The margin of error was 3.4 percentage points.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-takes-lead-over-trump-in-iowa-poll/	2024-11-02T17:25:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Top-Harris-and-Trump_102924_AP.jpg?w=900
Harrison Ford endorses Harris for president	Actor Harrison Ford announced his endorsement of Vice President Harris in the 2024 White House race three days before Election Day. Ford shared that he would be voting for the Democratic nominee in a video recorded for the Harris-Walz campaign. In them, he praised the Democratic ticket for believing in the 'rule of law' while slamming former President Trump for 'embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.' The 'Indiana Jones' star referenced former Trump administration officials who have spoken out against the GOP nominee in the video posted Saturday and added that Harris will protect the people’s 'right to disagree with her about policies or ideas.' 'You have to pay attention,' Ford said. 'They're telling us something important. These aren't soft people. They're governors, generals standing up against the leader of the party. They spent their lives advocating for many of them. This will be the first time they've ever voted for someone who doesn't have an R next to their name, because they know this really matters.' 'The other guy [Trump], he demands unquestioning loyalty, says he wants revenge,' Ford says in the video. 'I'm Harrison Ford. I've got one vote, same as anyone else, and I'm going to use it to move forward. I'm going to vote for, Kamala Harris.' Ford joins a group of other celebrities, artists and Hollywood stars that have endorsed the Democratic nominee, including Taylor Swift, Leonardo DiCaprio, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, and others. Some have appeared with Harris on the campaign trail. Ford, in another video that was released by Rolling Stone on Saturday, emphasized that he does not agree with every policy position the Democratic ticket holds, but said they would govern, if elected, for all Americans. 'But these two people believe in the rule of law,' the actor says in the video. 'They believe in science. They believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans, they believe that we are in this together. These are ideas I believe in. These are people I can get behind.' The actor, who endorsed President Biden in 2020, said he is displeased by 'a lot of things' in the U.S., but emphasized that the country needs to 'work together again.' 'Look, I'm frustrated about a lot of things in this country,' he said. 'I'm sure you are too. But the other guy, he spent four years turning us against each other while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world. That's not who we are. We don't need to make America great again. Come on. We are great, but we need is to work together again. All we need is a president who works for all of us, and again.' The Hill has reached out to the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign’s spokesperson for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/harrison-ford-endorses-harris-for-president/	2024-11-02T17:25:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24015081327606-2.jpg?w=900
Georgia surpasses 4 million votes on last day of early voting	The Georgia Secretary of State’s office announced 4,004,588 voters have cast ballots through early voting or absentee by mail in a Saturday release. 'This was the most successful Early Voting period in Georgia history because voters trust the process,' said Secretary Brad Raffensperger in a statement. 'Four years of progress brought us here. We’re battle-tested and ready, regardless of what the critics say. And we’re going to hold those who interfere in our elections accountable.' The Peach State's election official noted that 92 counties exceeded 50 percent turnout for the first time in state history. A total of 3,761,968 people voted in person early while 242,620 sent in ballots by mail. The Secretary of State’s office did flag that four individuals may have violated Georgia law by attempting to cast multiple ballots. They are investigating reports accordingly. This week, the state also was subject to false reports about immigrants casting multiple ballots in videos on social media. Raffensperger addressed the posts in a Thursday statement, casting blame on foreign election interference. 'Earlier today, our office became aware of a video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant with multiple Georgia ID’s claiming to have voted multiple times,' he wrote. 'This is false and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen in this and other elections. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election.' He said the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is investigating the matter and has asked Elon Musk to remove the post from the social media platform X in hopes of preventing false narratives. 'As Americans we can’t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine our faith in our institutions - or each other,' Raffensperger added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-surpasses-4-million-votes-on-last-day-of-early-voting/	2024-11-02T15:33:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/votesticker_100822_ap-ben-gray_georgia.jpeg?w=900
Swifties for Kamala launches fandom mail campaign in Pennsylvania	Swifties for Kamala launched a fandom mail program targeting low propensity voters in Pennsylvania.

'We are offering encouragement, information and a call to action all wrapped up in a welcoming, star-covered envelope.' According to the release from the group, more than 250,000 mail pieces have been sent to encourage voters in Pennsylvania to support Harris. Wu also made a post about the launch on the social platform X on Saturday, which included a screenshot of the press release and a photo of a 'VOTE' card and a 'Voting Era' friendship bracelet — a nod to the friendship bracelet exchange that happens among Taylor Swift fans oftentimes at her concerts. The press release said that the bracelets were included in 50,000 of the mailers. 'Potential voters across PA have started receiving these in their mailboxes over the past few weeks,' Annie Wu Henry wrote in the post. Swifties for Kamala sprung into action long before Taylor Swift endorsed Harris in September, with 35,000 helping to raise $130,000 during the course of a fundraising call earlier this year.

Trump blasts 'insecure' Cuban for remarks on women voters	Former President Trump hammered down on his comments alleging Mark Cuban was 'insecure' after the billionaire claimed the Republican nominee was 'intimidated' by intelligent women. 'I know Mark very well. He’s a very insecure guy. He can’t hit a golf ball more than 50 yards,' Trump said during a Saturday call in to Fox and Friends. 'He’s weak physically and mentally as far as I’m concerned, but I’ve known him for a long time.' The former president also described Cuban’s retraction and apology as a 'weak' move. 'He’s totally retracted his statement like weak people always do, they restrict their statements,' Trump said. After Cuban’s comments, various Republican women hit back on the billionaire's claims while affirming Trump’s support of them and their leadership. 'I’m told @mcuban needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are,' senior Trump adviser Susan Wiles posted on X. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R ) also chimed in encouraging voters to cast their ballot for Trump. 'I’m proud to be the highest-ranking woman in the United States Congress. When I ran, I was the youngest woman ever elected. I’m the most senior woman on the House Arms Services Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and I proudly am voting and endorse President Trump,' Stefanik said in a video. 'Save America in five days, vote Trump.' During the former president's call in, he said Cuban was held accountable by 'strong people.' 'He was hit by the strongest people. It wasn’t men, it was women,' Trump said on air. 'He was hit women that make men look like babies because if you know many of the women that I deal with, that I have, and I could go over the list but the list is long, including the fact that I happen to be married to a rather strong woman who just right now happens to have the number one best seller in the whole wide world.' Trump has criticized Cuban regularly throughout the campaign cycle. Last month, he called the top Harris surrogate a 'loser' in a Truth Social post.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-blasts-insecure-cuban-for-remarks-on-women-voters/	2024-11-02T15:32:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24300854967845-e1730204775938.jpg?w=900
Harris planning to vote by mail to ‘model behavior’	Vice President Harris will vote by mail ahead of Election Day as a way to 'model' the different modes of voting for Americans, the campaign told reporters Saturday. The team, however, didn't provide an update on whether Harris had already sent her ballot. The vice president is from California, but she has not traveled back to the state recently. Instead, she has prioritized her travel on the swing states, as the White House race remains close with less than a week left until the election. 'She wants to model behavior for other voters to continue to take advantage of the various modes of voting that we have during the [Get Out the Vote] time period,' campaign officials said. The team added that by Tuesday, they will be focused on convincing low propensity voters after they’ve made the push for early voting. 'That is the effort that we are pushing to all voters right now so that on Tuesday, it will be a last call for those final low propensity voters that this campaign needs to turn out and continue to convince all the way through polls closing on Election Day,' the official said. President Biden voted in-person in Delaware Monday, while early voting was open in his home. Gov Tim Walz (D), Harris's running mate, also opted to vote early, casting a ballot last week in his home state of Minnesota. The vice president is expected to spend election night at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, a source familiar told The Hill earlier this week. The vice president’s campaign has prioritized outreach to Black voters in the weeks before Election Day, while polling has indicated former President Trump is making gains with that voting bloc. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's polling aggregate shows that the party nominees are within 0.1 points of each other nationally. Harris had a slight edge over Trump, garnering 48.2 percent to his 48.1 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-planning-to-vote-by-mail-to-model-behavior/	2024-11-02T15:32:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24307100310143-e1730567526699.jpg?w=900
Harris, Trump issue appeal to Americans abroad in bid for more vo...	Nearly 5 million Americans living abroad are eligible to vote from overseas, representing a small but unique group that could influence the results in key swing states. While participation among overseas voters is considered low at less than 8 percent, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump have sent out direct appeals to these voters. 'We know there's a lot of enthusiasm,' said Sharon Manitta, global press secretary for Democrats Abroad, an official arm of the Democratic Party for overseas voters. 'The thing is, really, until the election is settled, goodness knows when that will be, we don't really know how that enthusiasm turns into turnout,' said Manitta, who is based in the United Kingdom. In 2020, more than 27,000 overseas ballot requests were registered in the swing states of Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Trump, in an Oct. 12 video, called on Americans living abroad to make sure they are registered to vote. He also promised to end double-taxation — where, generally, Americans pay taxes in the country they live in and the U.S. There are exemptions, and policies can vary from country to country. 'It was an October surprise from our side, from Republicans Overseas,' Solomon Yeu, the chief executive of Republicans Overseas, a political advocacy group that worked with the Trump campaign on the video. It also represented an about-face for Trump, who had earlier criticized and raised doubt over the legality of Americans voting overseas. Trump attacked the 1986 law that established overseas voting as 'a program that emails ballots overseas without any citizenship check or verification of identity, whatsoever,' in a post on Truth Social. Requirements can vary among states but generally a Social Security number or a valid state driver's license, or passport number can be used for identification verification. Republicans in North Carolina, Michigan and Pennsylvania have pursued, unsuccessfully, efforts to challenge rights for Americans overseas and people born overseas to American parents to vote in the U.S. elections. And while the Democratic Party has an official arm dedicated to overseas voters, this group is also generally overlooked. In this presidential election, for the first time, the Democratic National Committee provided Democrats Abroad with about $300,000 to help register voters and carry out get-out-the vote campaigns. Ballot requests for overseas voters opens 45 days before the election, in September. But it wasn’t until Oct. 24 that Harris published an open letter to Americans voting overseas in which she promised to take seriously their concerns surrounding finances, like banking and taxes, as well as access to consular services and immigration and citizenship processes. 'We were pleased … that both candidates have acknowledged that something has to be done on taxation of Americans overseas, or acknowledge that there's an interest in addressing these issues and doing something,' said Marylouise Serrato, executive director of American Citizens Abroad, a nonpartisan and nonprofit advocacy group. 'That's, for us, a really positive sign.' That came alongside a stepped up effort by the Biden administration earlier this year, which for the first time conducted a survey of Americans abroad on issues they are concerned about, said Martha McDevitt-Pugh, the international chair of Democrats Abroad. 'There really isn’t a lot of data around us, so we were really encouraged by that survey,' she said, adding that it led to the first-ever White House call with overseas stakeholders to talk about increasing awareness around government resources for Americans abroad. An estimated 2.9 million Americans who live abroad are eligible to vote. Another 1.4 million uniformed services members and 600,000 military spouses and vote-age dependents also live abroad, according to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). It’s not clear how many voters overseas come from specific states; that data won’t be available until well after Election Day and will have to be checked among multiple sources. The number of Americans voting from abroad can fluctuate for a variety of reasons: the increase in people working remotely, people retiring abroad, students studying overseas, Peace Corps workers, and military voters. Americans voting from abroad request ballots from their last address in the United States, no matter if it was a rented apartment or home or if decades had passed since they last lived there. And while the Federal Voting Assistance Program counted the participation rate of voters from abroad as unchanged between 2016 and 2020 — at 7.8 percent — the EAC recorded a 39 percent increase in returned overseas ballots between 2016 and 2020 — 655,844 overseas ballots in 2016 and more than 900,000 in 2020. Still, there are barriers to participation. Slow postal services, access to printers, personal follow through and confusion over each state’s voting requirements — either the need to mail in a ballot, fax, or submit it online — can also play a role in low participation rates. Rejected ballots are rare, at about 2.1 percent according to EAC, but the most common reason is an absentee ballot received after a state's deadline. On Thursday, Military Times published a report that election officials in the state of Georgia said 13,000 ballots requested by overseas military and Americans abroad have yet to be returned. One of the core issues with increasing the overseas vote is education, said Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and CEO of Overseas Vote, a 20-year-old nonpartisan, nonprofit public charity that helps inform people of their right to vote overseas and provides resources to help people submit their ballots. 'The fundamental problem we have with people voting from abroad is they don't know they have the right,' she said. Dzieduszycka-Suinat, who is based in Germany, said misinformation also plays a role in discouraging people from voting, such as a fear that there’s a connection between voting and increased taxes among people who live overseas. A myth versus fact section of the Overseas Vote website addresses the connection between voting and taxes. 'That is terrible for us in terms of voter participation, because people think, if I vote, they'll run me down for taxes,' she said. Still, she welcomes the increased attention on voters overseas as an opportunity to work to improve participation rates, even if some of that attention comes from Republican lawsuits or criticisms over the authenticity of overseas votes. 'There may be a renewed opportunity after the election, depending on how it goes, to improve the program, even more with some reform,' she said.

FBI condemns fake election security videos	The FBI released a statement on Saturday addressing false claims about the election and reaffirming their intention to ensure voter security leading up to Election Day. 'The FBI is aware of two videos falsely claiming to be from the FBI relating to election security, one stating the FBI has apprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud and a second relating to the Second Gentleman,' the agency wrote in a post on X. 'These videos are not authentic, are not from the FBI, and the content they depict is false.' While voters headed to precincts to cast their ballots, the FBI warned individuals to be aware of election related fraud schemes using fake images and names. 'Election integrity is among our highest priorities, and the FBI is working closely with state and local law enforcement partners to respond to election threats and protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote,' the bureau said in their statement. 'Attempts to deceive the public with false content about FBI operations undermines our democratic process and aims to erode trust in the electoral system.' The state of Georgia reported an instance of Russian election interference on Friday falsely depicting a Haitian immigrant casting multiple ballots. The Secretary of State addressed the matter by asking Elon Musk to remove the post, labeling it 'disinformation.' 'This is false, and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen this election. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election,' Raffensperger said in a statement on Thursday night. Earlier this month, the FBI and CISA also claimed China was behind former President Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance’s (R-Ohio), phone hacks. The agency is encouraging voters to stay aware of potential schemes as Nov. 5 approaches. 'The FBI encourages everyone to seek election and voting information from reliable sources, such as your local election office,' they wrote. 'And if you suspect criminal activity, we ask that you report that information to state or local law enforcement or your local FBI field office.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/fbi-condemns-fake-election-security-videos/	2024-11-02T15:31:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zoom-In-Georgia_052124_AP_Mike-Stewart.jpg?w=900

Raffensperger urges voters to ignore X ad purporting fraud: 'Don'...	Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensbegrer addresses a video falsely depicting a Haitian immigrant voting numerous times during a Friday CNN appearance. 'As we checked it out, came to a conclusion real quick. So we responded very quickly, you know, on Twitter and then also with a press release, just to let people know it's fake, don't fall for it,' Raffensperger said. 'Because in effect, what people want to do, these nation state actors, is really get us fighting among ourselves.' Earlier in the video, Raffensperger debunked the video by assuring voters that individuals cannot receive multiple state IDs with the same name. The leader attributed the video to 'bad actors' who are trying to divide the nation. 'We've got enough that splits us. We don't need to have the Russians or other bad actors try and split us further,' he said on air. 'So, you know, this was a week after the Intel community had said that a phony video showing fraud in Pennsylvania was just that, was phony, and that also had come from Russia.' The FBI has publicly addressed the uptick in fake videos by urging voters to be cautious of what they see on social media. The agency warned people that accounts using the name’s and images of candidates are being used to distribute false information.

Harris widens lead on Trump in Virginia: Poll	(The Hill) — Vice President Harris widened her lead over her opponent former President Trump in Virginia, with less than 3 days left before Election Day, according to a poll released on Friday. The survey, conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR) at Roanoke College, found the vice president leading Trump by 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent, among Virginia’s likely voters. Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both received 2 percent support while Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1 percent. Some 2 percent of respondents were undecided while another 2 percent said they would choose another candidate. The economy was the top issue for the likely voters at 43 percent. Abortion was second with 20 percent, followed by immigration at 12 percent. Foreign affairs was the fourth most important issue with 8 percent while crime was at 3 percent, according to the survey. Respondents trusted Harris more on both crime and foreign policy, 49 percent to Trump’s 45 percent. They favored Trump on the economy, 49 percent to 46 percent. On immigration, both White House contenders were tied at 48 percent. Likely voters had more faith in Harris on abortion, 57 percent to the Republican nominee’s 36 percent. Approximately 46 percent of the poll’s respondents said that Harris cares and understands people like them, nearly 10 points higher than Trump’s 37 percent. A Washington Post/Schar School, released just over a week ago, had Harris leading Trump by 6 points, 49 percent to 43 percent, in Virginia. The vice president is up by 5 percent over the GOP nominee, 50 percent to 45 percent, in Virginia, according to the latest The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s tally of surveys. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to 29 among 851 likely registered voters in the Old Dominion State. The margin of error was 4.6 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/polls/harris-widens-lead-on-trump-in-virginia-poll/	2024-11-02T15:00:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trumpdonald_harriskamala_110124gn01_w-e1730580140254.jpg?w=798
Ballot box fires stoke fears of election violence	Two ballot drop box fires in the Pacific Northwest this week have stoked concerns about election security and the risk of violence in the 2024 election days before voting concludes. Arson burned hundreds of ballots in what one official called 'a direct attack on democracy' in Vancouver, Wash., and harmed a small handful in nearby Portland, Ore. The pair of incidents mark rare disruptions to election administration, experts stressed, but they raise worries about whether more threats or attacks are to come amid a tense, polarized race — and whether the incidents could sow voter distrust in the systems. 'There’s this larger environment of distrust in our elections that has generated a set of security and safety concerns that ballot drop boxes are just one part of,' said Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California. 'These sorts of actions, like bombing these drop boxes, I think … are ultimately about increasing fear, increasing distrust and potentially discouraging people from voting.' Officials in Oregon and Washington have said the evidence suggests the two incidents this week, plus a third possible arson incident in the Evergreen State last month, are connected. A suspect description and vehicle have been identified, and the Portland Police Bureau said Wednesday that investigators believe 'it is possible that the suspect intends to continue these targeted attacks.' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been on alert in the run-up to Election Day that drop boxes could be targeted by 'domestic violent extremists' this cycle, according to internal bulletins, and experts are now concerned about continued or copycat attacks after the Pacific Northwest fires. 'Some social media users are discussing and encouraging various methods of sabotaging ballot drop boxes and avoiding detection, likely heightening the potential for targeting of this election infrastructure through the 2024 election cycle,' the DHS concluded in a September memo. The Vancouver drop box was notably in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, where incumbent Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D) faces a rematch against Republican Joe Kent in one of the cycle’s most competitive races. The Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman noted on social platform X, replying to the arson reports, that the Democrat beat Kent by just 2,629 votes in the midterms. The incidents also risk shaking voter confidence in an already fraught election cycle. Though a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Research Center found most voters have confidence their local and state officials will accurately count ballots, more than half of Republican voters in a YouGov survey last month said they’re worried poll workers could tamper with their ballots. Roughly three-quarters of voters in the AP polling also said that they’re at least somewhat concerned about violence over the election outcome. 'Sometimes the fear, the concern around it is enough to impact people’s sense of security. … People will see the headlines and wonder ‘Could this happen to my local drop box?’' Romero said. That’s why experts, who have been working overtime to debunk rumors and break through misinformation online ahead of Election Day, are pointing to how this week’s ballot drop box fires were handled as a positive sign of voting security for 2024. An incendiary device was placed inside the Portland ballot box, officials said, but fire suppressant inside protected 'virtually all' the ballots. Just three ballots were identified as damaged, and the affected voters were contacted for replacements. Hundreds of ballots were damaged at the Vancouver location, where a suspected incendiary device was found next to the drop box. It’s possible some ballots were completely burned, and a half-dozen were unidentifiable. But elections staff were able to identify 488 damaged ballots, according to the county. As of Tuesday evening, 345 of those voters had already contacted the Clark County office to request a replacement, and new ballots were mailed to the remaining identified voters on Thursday. 'This is certainly a threat that election officials have anticipated could happen in any given election from the moment we started installing drop boxes. So officials in Oregon and Washington really tried to make plans to respond to this, and prevent it from happening,' said Kim Wyman, a senior fellow with Bipartisan Policy Center's Elections Project and former Republican secretary of state in Washington. 'The good news is that election officials have really been preparing for this week for the last four years, and they’ve tried to build in as many security measures that they can for voters at polling places and early voting centers, [and] around mail-in ballots,' Wyman said, though she noted experts are bracing for 'a spike in activity' as Election Day nears. Oregon and Washington are both vote-by-mail states and have long used drop boxes to collect ballots. More states began embracing the tools last cycle to grapple with administration difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The boxes served as a way to avoid large crowds at polling places and have been seen as a more reliable delivery method than the U.S. Postal Service, due in part to confusion with postmarks and deadlines. The boxes have nevertheless drawn controversy amid an ongoing swirl of election conspiracies in recent years. Former President Trump, for one, has previously cast doubt on mail-in voting and argued the boxes opened ballots up to be tampered with. An Associated Press investigation in 2022 debunked those claims, finding that the expanded use of drop boxes in 2020 did not lead to fraud, theft or other issues that could have swayed the results. 'There’s almost no method of voting that’s invulnerable from somebody going to do something unexpected,' said Paul Gronke, director of the Elections &amp; Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland. But for the individual voter, he said, drop boxes are one of the safest methods of ensuring their votes are delivered on time. Still, other election security-related concerns loom over the 2024 homestretch. Threats and scrutiny often linked to false claims of voter fraud have contributed to a mass exodus of local election officials in recent years, raising alarms about understaffed and inexperienced teams left to handle the process — and to face potential new threats. Experts are also worried about misinformation, artificial intelligence and foreign influence on elections. And, as Trump and others continue to tout disproven claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 results, experts are on high alert for protests and violence postelection, nearly four years after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. The presidential race is on a razor’s edge as Election Day nears, and the latest polling averages from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill put Harris up by 0.3 points nationally, with similarly tight margins in key battlegrounds. Jim Messina, who served as a White House adviser to former President Obama, said last month that Trump 'is going to try to steal this.' Trump’s former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin has said the Biden administration 'needs to be ready to secure the Capitol and state capitols.' 'When you tell the population repeatedly, over and over again for years, that the election has been stolen and that election officials can't be trusted— that's inevitably going to lead to distrust of our election system and the risk of violence,' Ben Berwick, counsel at the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy, told The Hill in an interview last week. But even in the face of 'all this gloom and doom' around threats, conspiracies and potential violence, Wyman urged voters to remember that election officials have been readying to take on 2024 since 2020. 'A lot of planning has gone into this election by election officials across the country. They’ve been trying to think about those threats and have plans in place if something does materialize. They’ve been working with law enforcement and their federal partners to really vet those plans and be ready,' she said. 'People should feel safe going to their polling places on Election Day and participating in the election.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ballot-box-fires-stoke-fears-of-election-violence/	2024-11-02T14:59:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Ballot-box-fires_110224_AP_Greg-Kimsey.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump holds campaign event in Virginia	Former President Trump took a slight detour from his battleground state swing Saturday afternoon, giving remarks to supporters in Virginia. Trump is expected to target Vice President Harris over inflation, housing prices, and immigration, while arguing that the Biden administration has turned Virginia into a 'border state,' according to the campaign. The stop also comes as early voting is set to end in the state. The visit also follows a Supreme Court decision Wednesday that gave Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) and election officials the ability to cancel more than 1,600 voter registrations, which the state claimed were held by noncitizens. Youngkin endorsed the former president earlier this year. With just days left until the election, the GOP presidential nominee is trailing Harris by half a point — 45 percent to 50 percent — according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's polling index. Trump's remarks in Salem, Va., are scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. EDT. Watch the live video above.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/watch-live-trump-holds-campaign-event-in-virginia/	2024-11-02T14:39:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24307092238165-e1730558045352.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Harris, Bon Jovi rally voters in North Carolina	Vice President Harris will offer her closing remarks to voters in swing state North Carolina Saturday afternoon, just hours after early voting ended in the state. Harris will be joined in the battleground state by musical artists Bon Jovi and Khalid, as well as 'Scandal' actress Kerry Washington, among other guests. She has leaned heavily on celebrity endorsements as of late — including rallies in recent days with Cardi B and Jennifer Lopez. With 16 Electoral College votes up for grabs and just days until Election Day, both the vice president and former President Trump have spent significant time in the North Carolina. Trump is holding two campaign events in the state on Saturday. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling index shows that the race is still tight among Tar Heel State voters, with the former president garnering 49.1 percent support to Harris's 47.7 percent. The rally in Charlotte, N.C., is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

Trump will rally backers every day until the election in North Ca...	GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) — Donald Trump will rally supporters in North Carolina every day until Tuesday's election, a flurry of late activity in the only swing state that he won in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Even as Trump looks to expand the electoral map and project strength with trips to New Mexico and Virginia, two Democratic states not widely viewed as competitive, he is putting considerable time into North Carolina, which last backed a Democrat for president in 2008. The former president's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency gets significantly more complicated if he loses North Carolina. The fast-growing Southern state gave Trump his smallest margin of victory — 1.3 percentage points — over Democrat Joe Biden four years ago. Trump campaigned in Gastonia, west of Charlotte, on Saturday and was scheduled to be in Greensboro later in the day, with a stop in Salem, Virginia, in between. He will be in the eastern city of Kinston on Sunday and in Raleigh on Monday. Those four rallies will bring his total events in North Carolina since Oct. 1 to nine. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been in the state six times during the same period, most recently on Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, will also be in North Carolina on Saturday for a concert and rally in Charlotte. Her campaign has not announced any other travel to the state before Election Day. The extensive damage from Hurricane Helene across western North Carolina has created a dose of uncertainty about the state of play here. Flooding destroyed homes and displaced residents in several counties, including the liberal city of Asheville and the conservative rural areas surrounding it. Trump's team has said it is confident about his chances in North Carolina. Democrats see Trump's attention on the state as a signal of optimism for Harris. 'The repeat appearances may signal Trump’s campaign is in trouble,' said Democratic state Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham. 'If Trump continues with his dangerous, violent rhetoric these last few days, it may backfire. A campaign of personal retribution does not win votes from people.' Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump's late-campaign travels are not a signal of alarm. 'I'm not worried about anything,' Miller told reporters Friday. 'We have a smart strategy that's going to get President Trump across 270, maybe even a couple of states that surprise you, that slide in there. But we’re going to follow our strategy. Our strategy comes from our data and our targeting.' As he does at most of his events in North Carolina, Trump said in Gastonia that his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he installed as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, is from the state, and that Lara and Eric Trump named their daughter Carolina. 'It’s an amazing place. You’ve been through a lot,' Trump said, alluding to the hurricane before repeating a debunked claim that the Federal Emergency Management Agency prioritized people living in the country illegally over hurricane victims. 'Your government has not helped you too much, I can tell you. Your government, FEMA, has let you down because they wanted to spend the money on illegal migrants instead.' Roughly half of North Carolina's 7.8 million registered voters had already voted as of Friday, buoyed by early in-person voting, which ends on Saturday afternoon. North Carolina Republicans have been encouraged by early voter turnout among their supporters after national and state GOP leaders switched this year to a 'bank your vote' strategy, rather than focusing on Election Day turnout. Entering the final days of the campaign, over 50,000 more GOP registered voters than Democrats had voted early or by absentee ballot, even though there are over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans statewide, according to state elections data. It is unclear whether the Republicans' early vote surge will result in a higher overall turnout for Trump supporters. Independent voters now make up the largest group of registered voters in North Carolina. Trump lost ground with independents between 2016 and 2020. Harris supporter Gwen Garnett, 66, said Trump barnstorming North Carolina is 'just part of the process. It does not worry me at all.' She gave Harris’ candidacy a spiritual dimension. 'This is an anointed time for her to be in this role,' Garnett said. 'I just believe it’s God’s timing.' The state’s voters have shown a propensity to split their ticket over the years. That's why while Republicans have controlled the state legislature since 2011, Democrats have held the governor’s mansion for all but four years since 1993. The GOP's hopes to break that hold on Tuesday appeared to dwindle in recent weeks after the party’s nominee for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, received unwanted publicity from a CNN report that alleged he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago. While Robinson denied writing the messages and sued CNN for defamation last month, his campaign nearly imploded, raising fears that a large victory by Democrat Josh Stein, the state's attorney general, could harm GOP candidates in other races. ___ Robertson reported from Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Delphi murders: Jurors react to video of Richard Allen in custody	DELPHI, Ind. – Video of Richard Allen during his time at Westville Correctional Facility left some jurors 'aghast' and one defense attorney 'staring in horror.' Allen is charged with four counts of murder in the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge. Police arrested him in October 2022. On Day 13, the first portion of testimony focused on Allen’s mental health. He was kept in solitary confinement, which a defense witness testified could wear on a person, especially one with mental health issues. Further testimony from Friday included a witness who saw an 'out of place' car on the day of the murders and a photographer who didn’t recall seeing or hearing anything out of the ordinary on the trails. The defense also spoke to Delphi’s former fire chief about the search, grilled former Delphi police chief Steve Mullin about key testimony from witness Brad Weber and called former Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby to the stand. Videos at the center of Day 14 On Day 14, jurors watched a series of camcorder videos showing Allen in custody at Westville Correctional Facility. The videos were not played for the courtroom at large, meaning neither reporters nor media pool notes can shed any light on their actual content. The videos were at the center of objections and sidebars during Friday’s proceedings, with the state objecting to their admission. Special Judge Fran Gull allowed the defense to show them without audio. Allen’s defense team couldn’t play them Friday, however, because it didn’t know the exact dates of each clip. Gull said Allen’s lawyers couldn’t show the videos unless they could find out the exact dates. The defense shelved the videos for Friday and vowed to do additional research. By Saturday, it appeared the defense had figured things out, and Gull allowed the jury to watch the clips without audio. The prosecution objected to the showing of the 'rather explicit scenes,' but Gull replied, 'Obviously, the jury has to see this.' The monitor displaying the videos was turned away from the gallery so that only the jury could see it. The prosecution had to move in order to watch. Allen did not view the clips. The defense said the videos were being played only for the jury 'out of respect' for Allen. Some of the videos showed the defendant fully nude. They spanned from April 2023 through June 2023. Clips ranged between about two minutes to more than 50 minutes. Jurors react to videos Since court observers were unable to watch the videos, media pool notes relied on reactions from the jury, defense lawyers and prosecutor. As the first video played, one juror was 'aghast.' Jurors appeared 'tense' but not appalled at the second video. During the third video, one juror was seen biting her lower lip. Defense attorney Jennifer Auger shook her head and looked away from the screen. During video four, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland stood by the jury box to watch. One of the jurors sighed while the video was ending. The jury took numerous notes during the fifth video, the pool report noted. There was no audio from any of the videos, meaning the courtroom was relatively silent for this portion of the proceedings. The sixth video was just under three minutes. The seventh video spanned 26 minutes, but defense attorney Bradley Rozzi sped it up. During the eighth video, the pool reporter indicated one juror had a 'look of disgust' while Auger looked 'horrified.' During the ninth video, Allen’s mother left the courtroom. It should be noted that his wife, Kathy Allen, wasn’t present for any of this. The tenth video was about an hour long. This one had an impact on McLeland, according to the pool notes, who appeared 'taken aback' and was 'cringing' at what he was seeing. Auger stood behind him, arms crossed and mouth open 'staring in horror.' After the jurors watched the videos, the court took a break. Five more videos were shown in court after the break, with the flow interrupted by brief testimony from Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter. The next five videos spanned from May 13, 2023, to June 20, 2023. Most were relatively short, with limited reactions available in the media pool notes. The 15th and final video spanned 34 minutes. One juror's eyes 'widened rapidly in surprise' at something that stunned her. The videos were finished by about 11:50 a.m. Court adjourned shortly after that, with the jury given time to visit with family and enjoy activities on Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Court will resume at 9 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 4. Carter's testimony Between video sessions, ISP Superintendent Doug Carter took the stand. Carter has been notably outspoken about the Delphi murders case and often appeared at press conferences to give updates on the investigation and the search for 'Bridge Guy.' Carter told the court that 'dozens' of agencies were involved in the investigation, including federal resources like the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals Service and ATF. He said the FBI was involved until 2021. This led to a sidebar involving Judge Gull and counsel. Carter later testified that he made the decision for the FBI to leave the case and turn over all materials in August 2021. He was on the stand for less than 10 minutes. Reaction from Libby German's family The media pool notes indicated that Becky Patty, Libby German's grandmother, was upset while talking to McLeland before Saturday's proceedings began. Pool notes speculated that Patty may have been angry that videos of Allen were withheld from the public while graphic crime scene and autopsy photos of Libby and her friend Abby Williams were displayed in court earlier in the proceedings. At one point after Saturday's break, Patty left the courtroom and appeared 'very upset.' She was later seen whispering to her husband.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/delphi-murders-jurors-react-to-video-of-richard-allen-in-custody/	2024-11-02T10:22:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Richard-Allen-close.jpg?w=900
Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states	(NewsNation) — With just days to go, the 2024 election is wide open and voters in seven battleground states will ultimately decide the next president. Polls show a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. NewsNation and Nexstar affiliates across the country have been following the campaigns, highlighting the most important voter trends in the 'Swing State Spotlight' series. The current odds in every battleground state Here's what to know about the race in the seven swing states: Arizona, Georgian, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Arizona Arizona went blue in 2020 for the first time since Bill Clinton in 1996. Once considered a Republican stronghold, Arizona moderates have drifted away from the GOP and the Phoenix suburbs have swung left. With that said, more registered voters identify as Republicans (36%) than Democrats (29%) in Arizona, which means the 35% of people who identify as something else could ultimately decide the election. 'At this point, I think Arizona is going to be solidly purple. I think we are going to go back and forth,' Sarama Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona, told NewsNation in a recent interview. How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election All eyes will be on Maricopa County on Election Night. It's one of the largest voting jurisdictions in the nation and accounts for over 60% of Arizona's registered voters. Georgia As recently as 2016, Georiga was not considered a key battleground state. That changed in 2020. After defeating Clinton by more than five points, Trump lost to Joe Biden by less than half a point in the Peach State. Democrats were able to turn Georgia blue thanks to a rapidly growing and increasingly diverse population in the suburbs around metro Atlanta. Swing State Spotlight: Trump, Georgia Gov. Kemp join forces for Helene Trump has recently tried to improve his relationship with the state's popular Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Earlier this month, Trump praised Kemp's response to Hurricane Helene and said the governor was 'doing a fantastic job.' Georgia will also provide insight into which way Black voters are leaning. Harris is expected to carry that group but recent polling suggests the margin could be closer than in recent elections. Michigan Part of the so-called 'blue wall,' Democrats won Michigan in every election from 1992 to 2012. Trump broke that streak in 2016 after Clinton failed to fully mobilize her party's base. Biden flipped the state blue back in 2020 thanks to improved turnout in heavily Democratic cities like Detroit and Ann Arbor — voters that will be key if Harris is to repeat in Michigan. The state's 200,000 Muslim registered voters could also play a key role in deciding the outcome. Over the past year, Muslims’ support for the Democratic Party has dropped, in part, due to the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war In Michigan's Democratic primary, more than 100,000 people voted 'uncommitted' — a potential warning sign for Democrats in November. Nevada Republicans haven't won Nevada since George W. Bush in 2004 but it has become closer in recent elections, particularly in Clark County, the main population center. Barack Obama carried the state by more than six points in 2012. Four years later, Hillary Clinton won by just over two points. Biden maintained that margin in 2020 but Trump shrank the gap in Clark County (metro Las Vegas), home to nearly three-quarters of the population. Are Nevada voters swayed by promises of ‘no tax on tips’? Both candidates have tried to appeal to the state's leisure and hospitality workers, promising to eliminate taxes on tips. According to recent polling, 71% of Nevada voters support that idea. Hispanic voters will also play a major role. They make up a third of the population in Clark County and polling suggests Trump has been gaining ground, particularly with Hispanic men. North Carolina North Carolina is the only swing state that Trump won in 2020 and polling shows him favored this time around. In fact, Democrats have only won the Tar Heel State once since 1980 — Obama in 2008. But population gains in blue areas like Mecklenburg and Wake Counties have changed the math in the state, giving Democrats their best chance in years. North Carolina election officials grapple with storm’s impact To put the shift in perspective: Obama won Mecklenburg County by roughly 100,000 votes in 2012. Eight years later, Biden won that same county by about 200,000 votes. The state is also reeling from Hurricane Helene, which hit western North Carolina especially hard. It remains to be seen what impact, if any, that will have on Election day. Pennsylvania The outcome in Pennsylvania tends to predict the eventual winner. In 10 of the last 12 elections, the winner of Pennsylvania has gone on to the presidency. Why fracking in Pennsylvania is a major campaign issue Part of that is because the state is a microcosm of the country as a whole — home to two major cities, dozens of rural counties and education levels that generally mirror the American electorate. Fracking — the process of extracting oil and natural gas from underground rock formations — has become a popular debate topic in the Keystone State as voters weigh the economic trade-offs versus the environmental concerns. Pennsylvania is the second-largest natural gas producer behind Texas. The state has become a central location for discussions about the nation's energy future. Wisconsin Wisconsin is another blue wall state that Trump was able to flip in 2016. Before that, no Republican had won there since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Wisconsin voters with higher education tend to vote Democrat: Poll director Biden flipped it back in 2020 and was able to improve on Clinton's performance in the red-leaning Milwaukee suburbs, known as the WOW counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington). Harris will try to run up the score in urban areas like Dane and Milwaukee counties, while Trump will try to do better with suburban moderates and maintain his advantage in rural parts of the state.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/swing-state-spotlight/	2024-11-02T09:57:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.08_c978ec.png?w=900
Julia Roberts ad sparks debate about gender gap, voting in marria...	(The Hill) — A pro-Harris campaign ad encouraging women to break with their Trump-supporting partners at the ballot box is striking a nerve amid signs of a growing national gender gap in the high-stakes presidential race. Vote Common Good, which encourages evangelical and Catholic voters to break from the GOP, aired an ad voiced by actress Julia Roberts reminding women 'you can vote any way you want and no one will ever know' — prompting pushback from several prominent conservatives who criticized it for calling on wives to lie to their husbands. Polls show a significant gap, with Vice President Harris winning over a large majority of female voters and former President Trump building up a huge advantage with male voters. This difference would get attention in any presidential cycle, but it feels all the more important in the first presidential contest to take place since the fall of Roe v. Wade. 'It's definitely significant and has the potential of being historic,' explained Jackie Payne, the founder and executive director of the nonpartisan, moderate women-focused group Galvanize Action. 'When I'm looking at the data, what I see is, if only men voted, Trump would win,' said Payne, adding that 'women are making this a competitive election.' In the 30-second ad featuring Roberts, a couple are at a polling place when a man prompts his female partner, presumably after voting, 'your turn honey.' The woman, wearing a hat with a bedazzled American flag on it, is seen walking to her voting booth where she weighs choosing between Harris and Trump. She looks up at another woman voting in front of her and the two exchange a knowing glance, before marking her ballot for Harris. In the background, Roberts invokes the issue of abortion rights in her voice-over. 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want, and no one will ever know.' Toward the end of the ad, her husband asks if she 'made the right choice,' to which she smiles and says 'sure did, honey.' Fox News host Jesse Watters mentioned his own spouse in discussing the ad, comparing a woman who doesn’t tell her husband who she is voting for to someone having an affair. 'If I found out Emma was going to the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that’s the same thing as having an affair,' Watters said on air Wednesday in response to the ad. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk called it 'gross' to suggest women would 'undermine their husbands.' The ad isn’t the only effort this cycle to remind voters that their ballots are private, or to suggest that women and men are casting different ballots this fall. NBC News reported pro-Harris sticky notes have been found in women’s bathroom stalls and on the backs of tampon boxes. And women are taking to a TikTok trend in which Harris-Walz voters share that they’ll 'cancel out' a pro-Trump husband or family member’s ballot. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who’s doing work for independent expenditure groups in the presidential election, suggested the Harris ad with Julia Roberts could be effective, even if it doesn’t completely capture the dynamic she’s found in some relationships when it comes to voting. 'When we're trying to interview them or if you’re canvassing these married women, they'll say, ‘Well, you should really be talking to my husband. He knows more about this, or he follows politics,’ or ‘I just get his opinion on politics,’' Lake explained. 'These women presume that he has greater expertise, and he presumes that he has greater expertise. And so the first part of moving these women is to say you have your own way of doing things. You have your own opinion,' she added. Polling the extent to which couples may vote differently from each other is challenging to accurately measure given votes are privately cast and respondents may not always offer that information to pollsters. Still, it raises questions over how men and women will cast their votes this cycle — and how big a split it could be. The gender gap was at 11 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, with 42 percent of women and 52 percent of men backing Trump, according to Edison Research compiled by the Center for American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. In 2020, the gap was 12 points, with 57 percent of women and 45 percent of men backing President Biden. In 2024, there are signs of a growing divide. An October USA Today/Suffolk University national poll found women decidedly behind Harris, 53 percent to 36 percent. Men were behind Trump 53 percent to 36 percent. If similar splits show up on Nov. 5, it could make for a historic gender gap. Payne of Galvanize Action explained that moderate white women were driving the gender gap. At the same time, Zachary Donnini, a data scientist at Decision Desk HQ, noted gaps were emerging among Black and Latino voters, too. Polls have also suggested a deepening split among young voters in particular. Motivated by threats to reproductive rights and turned off by GOP rhetoric, young women are tending more liberal, experts said — while young men are pulled in by Trump’s messaging around masculinity. Women, who have long outpaced men in voter turnout, are also dominating early voting, according to the latest data compiled by the University of Florida Election Lab, making up 54 percent of the 66 million early votes so far. Only Election Day will reveal how many female voters are actually part of the hesitant demographic depicted in the Vote Common Good ad, said Martha McKenna, a Democratic strategist and veteran of EMILY’s List, a group aimed at getting abortion-rights female candidates elected to office. But McKenna argued many moderate Republican and independent women are 'feeling squeezed' this cycle. Even the Republican 'outrage' at the new ad, she said, could make the case for the ad’s message. 'Republicans fell straight into the trap that the ad laid out for them,' McKenna said, pointing to the responses from right-wing talkers. 'They have so far overreacted to this discussion in the final days of the campaign that they've really exposed themselves ... It is, like, embarrassing almost — how upset these guys were at the thought that the women in their lives would not vote the way that they wanted them to, for Trump.' Still, there are nuances within measuring the gap between how women and men vote for the winning presidential candidate. Kelly Dittmar, director of research and scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics, noted it’s possible there could be a record in the gender gap this presidential cycle while noting women have been more likely to vote for the Democratic presidential candidate since 1980. 'Anybody is going to be able to argue that women are the key to this election. But I think the more interesting story and the trends to watch are going to be, which women, how do they trend,' she explained. 'What is the diversity among women voters?' Kim Wyman, a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and the former Republican secretary of state in Washington, said the dynamics in the Vote Common Good ad aren’t limited to the gender divide. 'I really do believe that this election, based on what we saw in 2016 and what we saw in 2020, saying to people how you voted, and it doesn't matter which side you say you voted, can get a very emotional response from friends and family and people you've known your whole life,' Wyman said. 'And I think that for many Americans, they just kind of want to avoid it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/julia-roberts-ad-sparks-debate-about-gender-gap-voting-in-marriages/	2024-11-02T09:35:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Women_110124_AP_Ross-Franklin-e1730500777639.png?w=800
Record-breaking early voter turnout in Louisiana	BATON ROUGE, La.

Latino voters ready to emerge from 'garbage' fight	The Hispanic electorate has found its place at the center of national political discourse in an election marred by nativist rhetoric and punctuated by a 'garbage' war. In the final week of the election, the media tuned its radar on Puerto Ricans in swing states — particularly Pennsylvania and North Carolina — not because the campaigns elevated their concerns, but because of an ill-conceived joke that bashed the U.S. territory. Crude origins aside, the Puerto Rican electorate’s moment in the spotlight presents an opportunity for the Latino vote writ large. 'This helps us to battle the misinformation, and this helps us to sustain our message that, you know, communities that have large numbers of participation in elections are communities that have better resources, that [have] better schools, better hospitals, better parks,' said Frankie Miranda, president of the Hispanic Federation. Miranda said that despite the growth in Latino voter participation, 'still the headline is ‘Latinos are not participating enough,’ or it is Latinos — the one that, ‘because they are not participating enough that we lost a certain state’ like, for example, what happened with Florida in the past.' Whether Democrats’ past Florida recriminations — and the ensuing headlines — get replicated in 2024 will depend largely on election results in Pennsylvania. The state’s Latino Corridor stretches from the Maryland border along Highway 222 to Allentown, a majority-Hispanic city of 125,000 on the fringes of New York City’s commuter footprint. Before former President Trump’s Oct. 27 Madison Square Garden rally, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke about 'a floating island of garbage' got a mixed reception, the campaigns had already deployed significant resources to the corridor, and will continue to do so until the bitter end. Trump and Harris will hold dueling rallies in the Latino Corridor Monday afternoon: Harris will be in Allentown and Trump in Reading. But the unforced error of booking a shock comic for the New York rally is expected to energize low-propensity voters who the campaigns could not reach through conventional means. 'I mean Puerto Ricans, it's their moment. If they don't vote, come and show up and vote, you know what? … Puerto Ricans should be the new Cubans. It’s a swing state. They're the biggest bloc of Latinos in that state. They can all vote. Yeah, is your moment, guys. Don't f--- this up,' said Mike Madrid, a political consultant and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. The Trump campaign initially struggled to contain damage from Hinchcliffe’s joke, but on Tuesday, President Biden muddied the water with his own 'garbage' comments on a call hosted by Voto Latino. On the call, Biden appeared to refer to Trump supporters as 'garbage,' though the White House clarified the president was referring to Hitchcliffe, an account the Trump campaign did not buy. From that point, Trump took on the role of the aggrieved party, appearing in a Trump-branded garbage truck and reflective work vest. 'The problem with what Biden did is he f---ing stepped on the story. It could have gotten bigger and longer and been a stronger narrative. That's all. That's what happened. He f---ing stepped on her momentum,' said Madrid. By Friday, the story had lost steam on cable news, with outlets including CNN and MSNBC focused on Trump’s latest attack against former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Fox News dedicating some airtime to the White House’s cleanup of Biden’s comments. But anecdotal evidence suggests Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania are still energized against Hinchcliffe’s joke. 'There's nothing, nothing that you can do to a Puerto Rican that is going to move them in one way or another, [apart from] attacking Puerto Rico. You can be here for four generations, or you can just arrive yesterday: It’s the punch in the gut, your heart starts speeding every time you talk about our ancestral island, ancestral home,' said Miranda. With the back-and-forth so close to the election, polls are unlikely to shift significantly before Pennsylvania counts its official ballots. But the bet is that the 'garbage' war was a net negative for Trump. 'I think it absolutely hurts Trump more, because two of the groups that they need to anchor in the most important state — in Pennsylvania — are going to be motivated by that. Puerto Ricans are pissed. Like, quantifiably, that alone could cost them Pennsylvania,' said Madrid. '[This] freak show reminded a bunch of college-educated Republicans why they don't like the Republican Party in the first place, or why they're uneasy with it, why they don't like the GOP in the Trump era. It's a reminder that these guys — they're crass, there's a vulgarity they've never liked about Trump. They voted for Trump despite him, because they don't like the Democrats and they like Republican policies.' Still, the incident reflects a larger trend where parties prioritize the Latino vote, but don’t necessarily shift their broader pitch in doing so. For Republicans who seek to peel off only a fragment of the Latino vote, that approach can yield positive results. The Trump campaign, for instance, has been effective at identifying cultural divisions within Latino communities and targeting voters more likely to be responsive to their proposals, according to Ana Valdez, president of the Latino Donor Collaborative (LDC). 'Somebody [in the Trump campaign] understands how we tick, what makes us tick,' she said. LDC, a think tank founded by business leaders, last week released a report quantifying the political and economic size of the Latino electorate, seeking to drive home the idea that Hispanics can and will flip elections. 'What we expect from this report, we expect from this report is to bring some education, if you may, to bring some light into the real numbers of who Latinos are, into the impact that they are doing, and the potential of the impact if they are engaged again. You know, the Latino vote is for the parties to lose, not the other way around. And these are the numbers that show it,' said Valdez.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/latino-voters-ready-to-emerge-from-garbage-fight/	2024-11-02T09:11:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Joe-Biden-Donald-Trump-08.21.png?w=900
Trump, Harris camps prepare to 'go to the mattresses' in election...	Hours after Steve Bannon was released from prison Tuesday upon serving a four-month stint for evading a congressional subpoena, the onetime adviser to former President Trump sounded the alarm about the upcoming election. 'The Democrats are not going to give up,' he told reporters. 'They just hired Marc Elias. And you only hire Marc Elias — who I think is the toughest election lawyer in the country — you only hire Marc Elias when you want to go to the mattresses.' Elias, a leader of Vice President Harris’s election litigation efforts, hit back: 'My team of lawyers is better than the GOP's. And we're ready to beat them again in 2024.' The exchange came just days until the nation decides who will next occupy the White House — and the expectation that a dramatic legal standoff awaits, which both the Trump and Harris campaigns are preparing for. Already, there are more than 200 voting and election cases pending across the nation, according to Elias’s tally, with many in key battleground states that could alter the trajectory of the election's outcome. For weeks, lawyers for the Republican and Democratic parties have gone toe-to-toe in courtrooms on challenges to voter rolls, mail ballots and other election procedures. Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the former president's daughter-in-law, says the GOP’s election litigation operation is functioning 'as planned and as intended.' 'There were so many people in the wake of 2020 with a lot of questions,' she said on a press call Wednesday. 'And we hope that in 2024, we are going to ease any fears and any concerns that any American — regardless of if they're voting Republican, Democrat or third-party candidate — may have out there.' But Democrats have said the playbook is not so cut and dry. 'All of this is ‘cheating’ only in the mind of someone who wants to claim he was cheated, and it's yet another example of how Donald Trump tries to sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he's afraid he can't win,' a senior Harris-Walz campaign official said Thursday. 'He wants to lay the groundwork now to claim the election was stolen.' The Harris campaign has assembled a large legal team as they brace for a repeat of 2020, when former President Trump baselessly claimed mass election fraud in his narrow loss to President Biden. Beyond Elias, who runs an eponymous election law firm, Harris’s team includes former solicitors general Seth Waxman and Don Verrilli, as well as Biden’s personal counsel, Bob Bauer. The team has already drafted thousands of pages of legal briefs that respond to dozens of scenarios, according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Hill. 'The 2024 presidential election is already the most litigated in American history, but we are also the most prepared campaign in history for what we face,' Dana Remus, senior adviser and outside counsel to Harris’ campaign, and Democratic National Committee acting co-Executive Director Monica Guardiola wrote in the memo. 'We brought together the country’s best lawyers for each type of challenge we will face and expanded our footprint with national law firms and hundreds of lawyers on the ground across key states, monitoring closely and taking legal action wherever necessary,' it continued. Though the latest voter fraud claims overlap with the accusations made four years ago, some key attorneys on Trump’s 'elite strike force team' in 2020 aren’t expected to be involved this cycle. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who helped lead the 2020 push, has been disbarred and this week was forced to turn over most of his assets to two election workers he defamed. Two others involved, Jeff Clark and John Eastman, have also faced disciplinary proceedings. And attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis have pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from their post-2020 election work. Some are still fighting in the court of public opinion, however. Last week, Giuliani appeared at Trump’s rally in Madison Square Garden, and he hosts two daily shows where he talks extensively about the election. 'There’s a chance he can have a big win. There’s also a chance everything could go wrong, only because they did last time. And I’m sorry, you can torture me all you want, he was elected in 2020,' Giuliani said Thursday on his 'America’s Mayor Live' show. Trump himself has started planting seeds of election misconduct, claiming on his Truth Social social platform that his campaign caught Democrats 'CHEATING BIG' in Pennsylvania, a critical state for both campaigns to win. Authorities in several Pennsylvania counties have announced investigations into potential fraudulent voter registration applications caught during processing. But there is no indication that any fraudulent ballots have been counted. 'Must announce and PROSECUTE, NOW! This is a CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF THE LAW,' Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. 'STOP VOTER FRAUD! CHECK OUT KAMALA’S NEW SLEAZEBAG LAWYER. WE ARE ON THEM ALL THIS TIME! Who would have ever thought that our Country is so CORRUPT?' Much of Republicans’ legal efforts are being led by the RNC’s election integrity unit and outside law firms like Jones Day and Dhillon Law Group. Attorneys with prominent roles include Gineen Bresso, who previously chaired the U.S. Election Assistance Commission; Christina Bobb, a former One America News host who faces criminal charges in Arizona related to the 2020 election; and Bill McGinley, an attorney who served in the Trump administration. RNC co-Chair Michael Whatley told reporters Wednesday the party has also recruited over 230,000 volunteers who will be deployed as poll observers throughout the country. 'We have built the most expansive and experienced election integrity team in history,' Whatley said. The senior Harris-Walz campaign official asserted that Republicans are using the courts to 'try and sow their narratives,' but it could backfire. 'It is actually helpful when they do so in court, because they don't have evidence,' the official said. 'In a number of cases where they've been doing this, we're expediting those cases and winning, and that is an effective — to say the least — way of countering their misinformation.' It’s not just the campaigns and party committees getting involved, however. Many outside groups have formed or grown over the past few years in anticipation of a bombardment of litigation. 'We are working hard to make sure that it does NOT happen again this time,' Cleta Mitchell, a central figure in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 results who leads the Election Integrity Network, wrote on X this past week. 'We haven’t fixed everything in elections that the leftists spent billions of dollars breaking. But at least we know what to watch for in 2024. And we will be watching,' she wrote.

Politicians are reaching out to gamers ahead of the election – bu...	(NEXSTAR) — As the 2024 presidential election draws closer, both parties are pushing to secure as many votes as they can. One avenue the Harris-Walz campaign has been exploring is reaching out to gamers – a demographic that, according to a 2023 survey by the Entertainment Software Association, is largely made up of Gen Z and Millennials. This past weekend, vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went live on the official Kamala Harris Twitch channel to play some games and talk about the upcoming election. Twitch is a livestreaming website that specializes in video games, and averages around 2.3 million daily viewers. The two played Madden NFL '25 together, Ocasio-Cortez showed off her farm in the cozy indie farming simulator Stardew Valley, and Walz surprised viewers by showing off his driving skills in the 2000s Sega Dreamcast hit Crazy Taxi. See where abortion will be on the ballot in the 2024 election The campaign previously attempted another crossover event on Twitch in early October when they teamed up with World of Warcraft streamer Preheat, who showcased his gameplay on the page while a Harris rally played on the side of the screen. This event was largely panned by gamers on social media. Popular World of Warcraft streamer Maximum called it 'an insane thing to see' in a post on his X page. New England Institute of Technology eSports coordinator Brandon Eigenbrode thinks politicians may need to rethink their approach to leveraging Twitch. 'Stuff like that, where you just have a rally and a random game playing that’s completely unrelated, I think that’s the wrong way to do it,' Eigenbrode said. Both Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump also broadcast their rallies on Twitch, which Eigenbrode thinks may be missing the point of the platform. 'What’s the point of putting it on Twitch if it’s the same thing that’s on TV? That kind of defeats the purpose,' Eigenbrode said. This isn’t the first election cycle where campaigns are trying to leverage Twitch, either. In 2020, Ocasio-Cortez went live on her Twitch channel to play the breakout hit game Among Us, a multiplayer game of deception, with Rep. Ilhan Omar and a group of popular Twitch creators including Pokimane, Dr. Lupo and Hasanabi. According to eSports commentator Rod Breslau, the stream peaked at 439,000 concurrent viewers, at the time the third-highest concurrent viewer count in the platform’s history, with approximately 5.2 million total viewers over the course of the stream. Highlights of the stream were uploaded by various gaming websites and content creators on YouTube, racking up millions more in VOD views. Walz and Ocasio-Cortez’s Madden stream fell short of this success, however, peaking at just over 4,000 concurrent viewers, according to Twitchtracker.com. It’s difficult to quantify the effect these livestream events have on campaigns, but Eigenbrode suggests that if politicians want to successfully leverage Twitch as a platform, they need to focus on what makes it unique – the games. 'To people who do play games, you can kind of realize what [these politicans] are doing, and I think that might have been why AOC playing Among Us was so successful,' Eigenbrode said. 'She was just playing a game with other gamers.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/politicians-are-reaching-out-to-gamers-ahead-of-the-election-but-is-it-working/	2024-11-02T08:55:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1232609073.jpg?w=900
Ukraine's Zelenskyy urges allies to act before North Korean troop...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged its allies to stop 'watching' and take steps before North Koreans troops deployed in Russia reach the battlefield. Zelenskyy raised the prospect of a preemptive Ukrainian strike on camps where the North Korean troops are being trained, and said Kyiv knows their location. But he said Ukraine can’t do it without permission from allies to use Western-made long-range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. 'But instead … America is watching, Britain is watching, Germany is watching. Everyone is just waiting for the North Korean military to start attacking Ukrainians as well,' Zelenskyy said in a post late Friday on the Telegram messaging app. The Biden administration said Thursday that some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia’s Kursk region near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. On Saturday, Ukraine's military intelligence said that more than 7,000 North Koreans equipped with Russian gear and weapons had been transported to areas near Ukraine. The agency, known by its acronym GUR, said that North Korean troops were being trained at five locations in Russia's Far East. It did not specify its source of information. Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region, and open the door to technology transfers from Moscow to Pyongyang that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met with her Russian counterpart in Moscow in Friday. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to use Western weapons to strike arms depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. Moscow has also consistently signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. President Vladimir Putin warned on Sept. 12 that Russia would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them. Dozens injured in Russian strikes on Ukraine Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv overnight into Saturday, killing a policeman and injuring dozens, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. According to Syniehubov and Ukraine’s national police force, one missile slammed into a spot where a large group of police were gathered, killing a 40-year-old serviceman and injuring 36 more. In Ukraine’s southern Kherson province, Russian shelling on Saturday killed a 40-year-old woman and wounded three others, including two children, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Kyiv, air raid sirens wailed for over five hours early Saturday morning as Russian drones rained on the capital, sparking a fire in an office block downtown and injuring two people, according to the city’s military administration. Overall, Russian forces overnight attacked Ukraine with over 70 Iranian-made Shahed drones, the Ukrainian air force reported Saturday. It said most were shot down or sent off-course using GPS jamming. Falling debris damaged power networks and residential buildings in multiple provinces and injured an elderly woman near Kyiv, officials said. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry hinted that Russia’s drone campaign was slowing down, saying Moscow launched just over half as many in October as the month before. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-ukraines-zelenskyy-urges-allies-to-take-steps-before-north-korean-troops-reach-the-front/	2024-11-02T08:23:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672644bda88b58.95291194.jpeg?w=900
Supreme Court allows Pennsylvania to count contested provisional ...	DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans that could have led to thousands of provisional ballots not being counted in Pennsylvania as the presidential campaigns vie in the final days before the election in the nation’s biggest battleground state. The justices left in place a state Supreme Court ruling that elections officials must count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected. The ruling is a victory for voting-rights advocates, who had sought to force counties — primarily Republican-controlled counties — to let voters cast a provisional ballot on Election Day if their mail-in ballot was to be rejected for a garden-variety error. While the Supreme Court action was a setback for Republicans, the GOP separately claimed victory in a decision by Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court. That court rejected a last-ditch effort by voting rights advocates to ensure that mail-in ballots that lack an accurate, handwritten date on the exterior envelope will still count in this year’s presidential election. The rulings are the latest in four years of litigation over voting by mail in Pennsylvania, where every vote truly counts in presidential races. Republicans have sought in dozens of court cases to push the strictest possible interpretation for throwing out mail-in ballots, which are predominantly cast by Democrats. Taken together, Friday's near-simultaneous rulings will ensure a heavy emphasis on helping thousands of people vote provisionally on Election Day if their mail-in ballot was rejected — and potentially more litigation. As of Thursday, about 9,000 ballots out of more than 1.6 million returned have arrived at elections offices around Pennsylvania lacking a secrecy envelope, a signature or a handwritten date, according to state records. Pennsylvania is the biggest presidential election battleground this year, with 19 electoral votes, and is expected to play an outsized role in deciding the election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. It was decided by tens of thousands of votes in 2016 when Trump won it and again in 2020 when Democrat Joe Biden won it. A voting-rights lawyer in Pennsylvania who helped bring both cases said it is almost certain that another case over undated ballots will be back before the state Supreme Court within days after the presidential election if it is close. 'It’s almost certain that this is going to be raised again after the election, especially if it’s a close election,' Witold Walczak, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, said in an interview. In its unsigned, two-page order, the state’s highest court put a lower court ruling on hold that would have required counties to count the ballots. The high court said the case won’t apply to the presidential election being decided next week, but held out the possibility that it would still rule on the case at a later time. The rulings came as voters had their last chance Friday to apply for a mail-in ballot in a bellwether suburban Philadelphia county while a county clear across the state gave voters who didn't receive their ballot in the mail another chance to get one. A judge in Erie County, in Pennsylvania's northwestern corner, ruled Friday in a lawsuit brought by the Democratic Party that about 15,000 people who applied for a mail ballot but didn't receive it may go to the county elections office and get a replacement through Monday. The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot has passed in Pennsylvania. But the judge's ruling means that Erie County's elections office will be open every day through Monday for voters to go in, cancel the mail-in ballot they didn't receive in the mail, and get another one over the counter. In suburban Philadelphia's Bucks County, a court set a deadline of 5 p.m. for voters there to apply for and receive a mail-in ballot after a judge had ordered a three-day extension in response to a Trump campaign lawsuit that accused the county of breaking the law by turning voters from election offices that had struggled to keep up with demand. Lines outside the county's elections office in Doylestown were long throughout the day — snaking down the sidewalk — with the process taking about two hours by Friday afternoon. Nakesha McGuirk, 44, a Democrat from Bensalem, sized up the line and said: 'I did not expect the line to be this long. But I’m going to stick it out.' McGuirk, a Harris supporter, faces a long work commute next week and worried about her ability to make it to the polls on Election Day. 'I figured that rather than run into the risk of not getting home in time to go and vote, that it would be better to just do it this way early,' she said. Republican voter Patrick Lonieski, a Trump supporter from Buckingham, also found it more convenient with his work schedule to vote Friday in a county he called 'pivotal' to the outcome. 'I just want to make sure I get my ballot in and it’s counted,' said Lonieski, 62, who was joined by his 18-year-old son, voting for the first time. The line steadily dwindled as 5 p.m. approached. One last straggler broke into a run to make it by the deadline as elections workers cheerfully counted down the seconds. 'Let’s go! Hurry up! You can do it!' a bystander yelled. People broke into applause as she walked through the door — just in time. ___ Associated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.

Residents along southern border share concerns over crossings	(NewsNation) — Communities near the U.S.-Mexico border are caught in the middle of one of the biggest issues in the 2024 election: immigration. At the Del Rio, Texas, sector of the southern border, families say they are concerned about the number of migrants crossing the border. Those living there say they see people running through yards and hiding through docks, all with the aim of evading law enforcement. How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election One neighborhood in Eagle Pass has become a staging ground for law enforcement, as it is situated just below the Rio Grande. Migrants are crossing the hundreds daily there. Neighbors recognize the problem but say in interviews that they don't feel safe talking about it because they fear retaliation. One told NewsNation off-camera that he looked over his fence one day, and five men were actually leaning up against it, just waiting for law enforcement to leave. Another woman was followed into her home by migrants. Her husband said she locked herself inside of her car in the garage until police arrived. Gilberto Rodriguez has been living in a Texas border neighborhood since 1969. While he was initially hesitant to talk, Rodriguez said that, for the first time since coming there, he did not feel safe living in the area. Right in the background of the neighborhood is a part of the border wall. While some individuals say it's a bit of an eyesore, they also want to see extra reinforcements and law enforcement to deal with border issues. The Biden administration initially halted progress on the wall on his first day in office: Pausing work on it was one of 17 executive orders issued on his first day in office. However, he later decided to greenlight construction on it in Starr County, Texas, and an open area of southern Arizona near Yuma. The current odds in every key Senate race: Decision Desk HQ President Joe Biden explained that he did so because funds were already appropriated to build the wall in 2019 before he took office. Biden said he tried to get lawmakers to redirect the money, but Congress refused. 'The money was appropriated for the border wall,' Biden said at the time. 'I can’t stop that.' During the 2024 campaign season, Trump and Harris have both talked about plans to continue creating the wall. Texas is making its own moves to build the border wall. On Tuesday, the state's land commissioner, Dawn Buckingham, announced the Texas General Land Office acquired a 1,402-acre ranch in Starr County, as the property's frontage on the Rio Grande makes it the 'crucial location' for the barrier. 'Within 24 hours, we had the easement for the wall done,' Buckingham said. 'We expect construction to start in four to six weeks.' So far, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has built nearly 50 miles of wall in the Lone Star State. With the latest land acquisition, there'll be another 1 1/2 miles. When it comes to previous presidential administrations, Democratic former President Barack Obama built about 137 miles of border wall, Trump had about 452 miles, and Biden allowed for the construction of about 20 miles.

4 potential paths to victory in the 2024 election	(NewsNation) — It will take 270 electoral votes to win the 2024 presidential election, and both candidates have several paths to get there. Across the seven swing states, former President Donald Trump's best odds are in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, which means the Sun Belt could be key to a Republican victory. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris could get to 270 by winning the so-called 'blue wall' — specifically, the three northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. She's currently favored in Michigan and almost dead even in the other two. NewsNation’s election partner, Decision Desk HQ, shows Trump with a 54% chance of winning and Harris with a 46% chance as of Nov. 1. Here are four possible paths to victory on Election Day. Election odds in every 2024 swing state Trump: The sunbelt path to victory Swing state breakdown: Trump wins: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania Harris wins: Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin Electoral votes: Trump: 281 ✔ Harris: 257 How likely is it? This is Trump's most likely path to victory. The former president is currently favored in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina — three states that have tended to vote Republican since the 1980s. If Trump wins those, he would only have to take one of the blue wall states — either Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin — to get to 270. Current polling suggests his best bet is Pennsylvania, where Decision Desk HQ gives Trump a 53% chance of victory as of Nov. 1. If that happens, Trump could lose Arizona and still win the election. Here's which counties will decide the 2024 election Historically, Republicans have done well in Georgia and North Carolina, particularly among higher-income white voters, but the winning formula could look different this time. 'The coalition that Trump is building in these states is more of a multiracial working-class coalition versus the strongest area for him in these states used to be in affluent exurbs,' said Zachary Donnini, a data scientist at Decision Desk HQ. Harris: The blue wall holds Swing state breakdown: Harris wins: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin Trump wins: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina Electoral votes: Harris: 270 ✔ Trump: 268 How likely is it? For Harris, the clearest path to 270 is winning the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The three were reliably Democratic until Trump turned them red in 2016. Four years later, Joe Biden flipped them back, a sign Trump's win may have been an anomaly rather than the new norm. One reason for Democratic optimism: newcomers to the three northern battleground states. '[Those three states] are shifting to the left relative to the nation as a whole, and a lot of this comes down to migration patterns in the past four years,' Donnini said. A recent New York Times analysis underscores that point. It found that newcomers to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have tended to be more Democratic than their neighbors in recent years. Harris is currently favored in Michigan but is slightly behind in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Nov. 1). Trump: A crack in the blue wall Swing state breakdown: Trump wins: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin Harris wins: Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania Electoral votes: Trump: 272 ✔ Harris: 266 How likely is it? With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the top battleground prize, but if Trump wins in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina — where polls show him ahead — he can afford to lose the Keystone State by winning Wisconsin. In other words, it doesn't matter which northern battleground state he flips so long as he wins across the Sun Belt. 'For Trump, just winning Georgia and North Carolina gives him a lot of different options for how he can win the presidency,' Donnini said. A solid performance in the Milwaukee suburbs, the so-called WOW counties — Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington — could be all Trump needs to win Wisconsin. Those areas have remained more Republican than similar Midwestern suburbs but still moved leftwards in the Trump Era. Harris: The road through the South Electoral votes: Harris: 279 ✔ Trump: 259 Swing States: Harris wins: Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina Trump wins: Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin How likely is it? There's a 19% chance Harris wins Georgia and North Carolina, in which case she could afford to lose one, potentially two, blue wall states. For that to happen, Harris will likely have to perform better with Black voters than she's expected to. Another winning formula: Suburbanites around metro Atlanta and metro Charlotte continue to move left. While it's not the most likely scenario, a Harris win in North Carolina and Georgia would bode well for her chances in other swing states. 'If she's winning her weaker states, she's very likely to win the strong ones,' Donnini said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/paths-victory-2024-election/	2024-11-01T17:02:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-09.26-e1727818452392.png?w=800
Trump seeks to clarify Cheney 'shooting' comment: No 'guts to fig...	Former President Trump on Friday responded to criticism of his comments a day earlier, in which he attacked former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) by using violent imagery to chastise her foreign policy views. Trump sparked backlash after he told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that Cheney, an outspoken critic of the former president, was a 'radical war hawk' and suggested she should be put into a war zone 'with nine barrels shooting at her.' The former president sought to clarify those comments in a Truth Social post. 'All I’m saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a War Hawk, and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn’t have 'the guts' to fight herself,' Trump posted. 'It’s easy for her to talk, sitting far from where the death scenes take place, but put a gun in her hand, and let her go fight, and she’ll say, 'No thanks!'' 'Her father decimated the Middle East, and other places, and got rich by doing so. He’s caused plenty of DEATH, and probably never even gave it a thought,' Trump continued, referring to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has endorsed Vice President Harris in the 2024 election. Trump's critics lambasted him over his rhetoric toward Cheney, who has campaigned alongside Harris ahead of Election Day. 'This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death,' Cheney posted on X. Ian Sams, senior adviser for the Vice President Harris’s campaign, slammed Trump for 'dangerous, violent rhetoric.' 'You have Donald Trump, who’s talking about sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad. And you have Vice President Harris talking about sending one to her Cabinet,' Sams said Friday morning on MSNBC.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-seeks-to-clarify-cheney-shooting-comment-no-guts-to-fight/	2024-11-01T13:21:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Liz-Cheney-v-Trump.png?w=900
Swing states see gender gap in early voting numbers	(NewsNation) — With the election just days away, women are showing up big at the polls, especially in swing states. For instance, in Pennsylvania, 1,427,436 people have already cast their ballots, with data from TargetSmart showing 55.6% of these early voters are women and 43.2% are men. In Wisconsin, where 1,067,383 have voted early, 51.3% have been women, and 42.7% are men. Michigan has seen 2,187,896 early voters: 55.4% female and 44.5% male. This gender gap seems to be driven by a combination of a lot of things, especially key issues like reproductive rights, health care access and education. The current odds in every swing Senate race With this being the case, both candidates are intensifying their efforts to reach female voters. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign put out an ad voiced by actress Julia Roberts telling women they have the right to choose when it comes to their pick for president — even if their husbands disagree. 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,' Roberts says in the ad, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Both campaigns are hosting rallies, phone banking and going door-to-door. The Harris campaign, in particular, is focusing on suburban areas where female voter turnout could make a really significant difference. Campaign surrogates like Lara Trump, meanwhile, are making stops for the former president's campaign.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/swing-states-gender-gap-early-voting/	2024-11-01T12:04:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Trump-Harris_092524_AP_Uncredited.jpg?w=900
Could Donald Trump, Kamala Harris tie in the Electoral College?	(NewsNation) — The race for the White House between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris remains in the too-close-to-call category, which has created scenarios in the minds of some political junkies about both presidential candidates receiving an identical number of Electoral College votes in next week’s election. The 12th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates win a majority of the votes of the 538 electors appointed to represent the 50 states and the District of Columbia. That puts the number of electoral votes required to win the election at 270. A tie of Electoral College votes has never taken place in modern history. However, some scenarios exist in which Trump and Harris could each finish with 269 Electoral College votes, although such a possibility is remote, according to NewsNation partner Decision Desk HQ. How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election As part of its forecasting models, Decision Desk HQ runs tens of thousands of simulations each day, the organization’s president, Drew McCoy, said. However, the outcome of a tie in the Electoral College happens 'incredibly infrequently,' McCoy told NewsNation. For example, for a tie to occur next week, in three of the simulations run by Decision Desk HQ, Harris would need to win Nevada in two of the scenarios, Arizona in all three of the scenarios, and could never win Michigan and Pennsylvania, McCoy said. NBC News reported that another scenario for a tie exists if Trump were to win all of Nebraska’s Electoral College votes. To do so, the former president would have to capture the state’s 2nd Congressional District, which many pundits say favors Harris. But McCoy said for that to happen, several other states would have to fall into place for the 269-269 scenario to play out. McCoy said that Trump could still reach 270 electoral votes by maintaining his 2020 map and then picking up Georgia and Pennsylvania. While Decision Desk HQ’s forecasting allows for the possibility of Trump and Harris each finishing with 269 Electoral College votes, the scenario remains highly improbable, he added. 'It’s like winning the lottery kind of a thing,' McCoy told NewsNation. 'It’s possible, but it’s probably nothing that you plan on.' He added: 'It's not a high probability event, but it's not an impossible one.' Images of Trump and Harris by the Associated Press If neither Trump nor Harris was to reach the necessary 270 Electoral College votes, the 12th Amendment calls on the U.S. House of Representatives to elect the new president while the U.S. Senate would appoint a new vice president. The procedure of a 'contingent election' has not taken place in the case of a U.S. president since 1825 (John Quincy Adams) and 1837 for the vice president. Yet in an election cycle that saw the presumptive Democratic nominee, President Joe Biden, drop out of the race in favor of Harris, questions of what could happen next have arisen. That includes the notion of an Electoral College tie, McCoy said. In a contingent election, the House of Representatives would choose between up to three candidates that won the most electoral votes, according to the Congressional Research Service. Each state would cast one vote for president regardless of its population. The agency said that in states where two or more U.S. Representatives are seated, that group would need to determine which candidate would receive that state’s voice. Trump, Harris separated by 1 point in Georgia, North Carolina: Polls Although such a scenario has piqued the interest of those who delve deeply into election night possibilities, McCoy said that Decision Desk HQ’s simulations very rarely land on a tie. Out of millions of simulations, an Electoral College tie comes up perhaps a handful of times, he added. On election night, Decision Desk HQ, the first organization to accurately call the past two presidential elections, works to understand the possibilities but deals much more in data that comes out of each state, McCoy said. As someone who digests the numbers his organization turns out daily, McCoy says he is intrigued by the idea of the Electoral College vote tie. But based on the way the numbers are pointing in a race that remains anyone’s with just days remaining, he prefers to deal with reality. 'It’s intriguing as a thought experiment, certainly,' McCoy said. 'But if (a tie) were to happen, I think we would all be very surprised.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/could-trump-harris-tie-electoral-college/	2024-11-01T11:19:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2172377704-e1729215616414.jpg?w=800
Daniel Penny trial opening arguments begin	(NewsNation) — Opening arguments in the Daniel Penny trial began Friday morning, with both prosecution and defense laying out their arguments in the case. It's also possible some witnesses will be called. Penny is accused of killing a mentally ill homeless man, Jordan Neely, while riding the New York City subway. Delphi murders: Allen’s mental health at center of Day 13 Jury selection in the trial took eight days, and of the jury, five are men, seven are women. During the selection process, the defense questioned them. All of the jurors ride the train, and many have seen outbursts before, which is important for the defense. Outside of the court, protesters gathered. Hawk Newsome, co-founder of New York's Black Lives Matter organization, spoke out against jury deliberations. 'The majority of the people who defense council struck from the jury were Black,' he said. 'Five Black people, two Latinos, and one Asian. In the whole island of Manhattan, you got one Black man who is on the jury, no more.' Penny said Neely was threatening to kill everyone on the train, according to court documents, and that he was willing to go to prison for the rest of his life. Penny said he sprang into action, pinning Neely to the ground and putting him in a chokehold for several minutes. The former Marine's lawyers argue he acted in self-defense. Florida police believe they caught ‘an undetected serial killer’ Prosecutors say Penny's intention was a good one, but he went too far and used excessive force. Penny's attorneys have said they want the jurors to understand, from his perspective, what it felt like to be in that stressful situation, confined in a small box with no ability to run away. They say they will introduce Neely's mental health issues and that he was high on the drug K2 at the time. They also say the video of the incident is their best piece of evidence. Penny has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of second-degree manslaughter and up to four years if convicted of criminally negligent homicide. The trial is expected to last at least a month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/daniel-penny-opening-arguments/	2024-11-01T10:46:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180010129.jpg?w=900
Trump works to pick up Michigan voters days before election	(NewsNation) — With just days to go before the election, former President Donald Trump is heading to Michigan to talk to voters in the battleground state. Trump is in Michigan hoping to pick up voters in the 'blue wall' area that could prove critical in determining the next resident of the White House. Trump has been trailing in the latest polls, but the difference between the two candidates is well within the margin of error, making the race a toss-up. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters His team is trying to clarify comments the former president made about former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney during a hurricane relief benefit with Tucker Carlson in Arizona. 'She's a radical war hawk,' he said. 'Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting there; let's see how she feels about it when the guns are trained on her face.' The Trump campaign is pushing back against claims it was a threat, saying he was talking about people like her who advocate for wars they don't fight in. That was not how the comment was perceived, and Cheney herself responded on X. 'This is how dictators destroy free nations,' she said. 'They threaten those who speak against them with death.' In Michigan, Trump will be meeting with business owners in Dearborn, Michigan, an area with a large Arab American community. DC businesses board up before Election Day, blocks away from White House Many have objected to the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the war in Gaza, sparking a movement during the primary to vote for uncommitted delegates not committed to President Joe Biden. Though Biden later stepped down from the ticket and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, many in the Arab and Muslim communities have said they will not be voting or will be voting for third-party candidate Jill Stein instead. Trump will be hoping to try to pick up those voters, though he has expressed strong support for Israel and its military actions in the Middle East region.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-michigan-days-election/	2024-11-01T10:40:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181215235.jpg?w=900
Why can't you wear your political gear to the polls?	(NEXSTAR) – An outfit may not be the first thing most people think of before heading to the polls, but a misstep while dressing could jeopardize one’s vote. All states have some restrictions when it comes to voting in person, and most states have rules about actively campaigning within a certain distance of a polling place. Some states, however, have extended that rule to include a dress code. One of those states is New Jersey, where a reported incident between an early voter and a poll worker received national attention after vice-presidential candidate JD Vance commented on a post. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } A Reddit user posted a photo of a bra-clad woman purportedly voting shirtless after a poll worker told her the Trump shirt she was wearing violated electioneering prohibitions. According to the person who posted the image, the woman fired multiple expletives at the worker before taking off the shirt and saying 'this is why she votes Trump.' 'What a patriot' Vance wrote on X. The post he commented on has since been deleted, but as of Oct. 30 the original Reddit post was still live. According to New Jersey election law, campaign-related apparel and other accessories are not allowed within 100 ft. of the polling place. Another voter in Texas made headlines in late October after allegedly punching a 69-year-old election worker who asked him to remove his pro-Trump hat at a polling place. Electioneering rules are meant to keep people from feeling pressured or intimidated in any way while voting, said Quinn Yeargain, an associate professor of law at Michigan State University. 'This is not something that functions in any way to chill anybody's free speech,' Yeargain said. 'This is to keep polling places neutral locations.' Conflict over electioneering statues isn't new, and in one notable instance voters successfully challenged state law. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group of Minnesota Tea Party supporters who argued that the state's ill-defined ban on apparel with 'political' messages was too broad. How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election 'How much states can necessarily do is something we might see some Supreme Court cases on in the future,' Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, told Nexstar. 'But I think that maybe the Minnesota law was being interpreted in that state potentially a lot more broadly than in some other places.' Current Minnesota law bans 'campaign T-shirts, buttons or literature which relate to specific candidates, official political parties or b allot questions on the ballot that day.' There are 21 states that have statutes banning electioneering apparel at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Arkansas California Delaware Indiana Kansas Maine Michigan Minnesota Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Dakota Rhode Island South Carolina Tennessee Texas Vermont Banned apparel items vary depending on the state, but include buttons, hats, shirts, stickers and other articles of clothing. '…a person may not wear a badge, insignia, emblem, or other similar communicative device relating to a candidate, measure, or political party appearing on the ballot, or to the conduct of the election, in the polling place,' Texas law states. That’s right, in nearly half of U.S. states, those T-shirts emblazoned with candidates’ faces or campaign slogans could be considered electioneering, or an attempt to influence someone’s vote. State laws vary when it comes to how far someone needs to be from a polling place while electioneering – in Alabama it’s 30 feet from the door, while in Iowa it’s 300 feet – and also what apparel might cross the line. In California, for instance, a shirt bearing a 'candidate's name, likeness or logo' is prohibited, but campaign slogans such as Make America Great Again are not. Violating the rules may result in more than a wasted trip to the polls, depending on what state you live in. Trump, Harris separated by 1 point in Georgia, North Carolina: Polls In Kansas, for instance, prohibited electioneering is a class C misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or up to a $500 fine. It’s always a good idea to check your local voting guidelines before heading to the polls. Some states like Maine, where campaign apparel isn’t allowed, have exceptions – buttons that 'do not exceed 3 inches and are worn by people at the polling place solely for the purpose of voting' are allowed. 'My general advice is don't go to the polling place with campaign apparel, be respectful of the location and the process,' Yeargain said. 'You know, it's not difficult to just wear a different shirt and take your picture with your 'I Voted' sticker outside the polling place with whatever shirt you want.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/political-gear-polls-voting/	2024-11-01T09:15:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24304676689676.jpg?w=900
Kamala Harris aims to keep lead in Wisconsin	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both in Wisconsin Friday. Harris is hoping to keep her slight lead in the polls over Trump in the Badger State. Earlier this week, she did a swing through the Sun Belt, going to Arizona and Nevada on Thursday to talk about fighting for workers and raising the minimum wage. At an event in Nevada, actress and singer Jennifer Lopez spoke, criticizing a comedian from a Trump rally in New York's Madison Square Garden who on Sunday called Puerto Rico a 'floating pile of garbage.' 'You can't even spell American without Rican,' Lopez said. 'This is our country, too, and we must exercise our right to vote on Nov. 5' How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election Speakers at Trump's weekend rally faced backlash for crude and racist comments, but the GOP presidential candidate defended the scene as a 'lovefest.' This was something Harris hit on in Nevada. 'Listen to what he's saying as his closing argument. It's all about hate and division. Jennifer talked about it,' Harris said. 'It's all about hate and division. And it's not just what he says, it's what he will do.' As of Friday morning, Harris was pulling two points ahead of Trump in Wisconsin overall, with 50% over his 48%, according to a survey from Marist College. Much of her support came from female voters. Harris leads Trump 55% to 43% among women in the Marist poll. For the rest of Friday, Harris has been going across Wisconsin, with an afternoon stop in Janesville before a rally in suburban Milwaukee. In a press call, senior campaign officials said internal data indicates Harris is winning battleground voters by double-digit margins. Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, focus group data shows, didn't just impact how Puerto Ricans and Latinos view the race — but also undecided voters at large, campaign officials said. So far, the campaign has knocked on over 13 million doors across battleground states, and made over 100 million to these kinds of voters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-wisconsin-lead/	2024-11-01T07:37:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24305051934317.jpg?w=900
Liz Cheney wants to be deciding factor against Trump on Election ...	Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) has jumped head first into the election fight on behalf of her former political rivals, stumping for Vice President Harris and endorsing a handful of downballot Democrats in a bid to keep former President Trump and his congressional allies from winning power next year. Her impact, however, remains as nebulous as the election results themselves. And the parties are at odds over the breadth of her influence. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has national name recognition, model conservative credentials and a network of powerful GOP allies forged over the course of decades. Democrats consider her a potent ally in the late-campaign scramble to attract both independent and traditional Republican voters averse to Trump’s irreverent brand of populist nationalism. 'There are a lot of Republicans out there who feel like their party has just gone off the edge following Donald Trump,' Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said. 'And nobody speaks to them better than Liz Cheney.' Yet the GOP has changed dramatically in recent decades, shifting from a party championing free trade, immigration, muscular foreign policy and strong support for overseas allies — all ideas promoted by the Reagan and two Bush administrations — into a more isolationist mold embodied by Trump. With that in mind, GOP campaign operatives are brushing off Cheney’s messaging blitz, saying her brand of old-school conservatism is a stale relic of a bygone era — one that’s lost the power to sway voters in any significant numbers. 'We haven't lost a wink of sleep about it,' a House GOP strategist said. 'We know it's there, but it's really irrelevant. … Our coalitions have shifted so much. Now we're picking up these blue-collar, working class former Democrats, and they're all in for Trump. And now the Cheneys are known for this war-mongering effort, and that's kind of the Kamala Harris base, you know. They're pro-Ukraine. 'So it's just a different coalition these days.' Cheney endorsed Harris in September and has since thrown her weight behind four Democrats in tough races for Congress: Reps. Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Colin Allred (Texas), who are both vying for Senate seats in their respective states; Rep. Susan Wild, who’s running for a fifth term in a battleground Pennsylvania district; and John Avlon, a former CNN commentator who’s challenging Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) on Long Island. Cheney has been similarly selective in deciding where to take her anti-Trump message on the road, opting for a handful of counties with sizable populations of suburban GOP women — a key constituency that Harris is trying to siphon off from Trump — in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, three critical swing states that could make-or-break Harris’s bid for the presidency. The stops have overlapped with where former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley performed well during the GOP primary, a sign she’s targeting Republican voters with unfavorable views of Trump. Cheney, for example, has campaigned in Ripon, Wis., Waukesha County, Wis., Chester County, Pa., and Oakland County, Mich., all of which saw more than 10 percent of GOP voters cast primary ballots for Haley. In Oakland County, the second-largest county by population in Michigan as of 2023, per the state Senate, Haley drew 24 percent of GOP voters. 'A very natural voter base for Cheney to target are Nikki Haley voters, in the sense that they probably have conservative views, you know they’re voting for a conservative candidate, but they have some skepticism of Trump because they’ve broken with the rest of the party and actively chose to support a candidate who at times was voicing very anti-Trump and anti-big lie,' said Zachary Donnini, a data scientist at Decision Desk HQ, a nonpartisan election handicapper. 'These are the voters that Cheney thinks she can maybe flip,' he added. 'It’s people who might have a positive view of her but haven’t fully defected from the Republican Party yet.' Whether that effort is effective, however, remains the key question. Recent polls have found the presidential candidates separated by a razor-thin margin — making it anyone’s game less than a week out from Election Day. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Wednesday found Harris with a 6-point lead in Wisconsin among likely voters, a 5-point edge in Michigan, and a tied race in Pennsylvania, with the two candidates both drawing 48 percent support. The margin of error is 4.8 percentage points for Wisconsin and 4.7 percentage points for Michigan and Pennsylvania, making the states at a near statistical tie. The close nature of the race opens an opportunity for any voting bloc to tip the scales in one direction or another. Former GOP Rep. Charlie Dent (Pa.) — who revealed earlier this month that he voted for Harris — said Cheney’s impact may be marginal, but that could be enough to make a difference in this race. 'This game is gonna be won or lost on the margins and to the extent that Liz Cheney can help Kamala Harris with certain demographics like college educated, suburban, Republican and Independent women, well that’s all the better for Harris,' Dent, who left Congress in 2018 after more than a dozen years in the House, told The Hill in an interview. '[Do] I think it will be a dramatic impact? No. But do I think on the margins Liz Cheney helps? Absolutely,' Dent continued. 'And again, even a small movement can be enormously consequential. So I think overall it’s a net positive for her.' The marginal impact may remain silent until Election Day. On the trail, Cheney has reminded Republicans that their ballot is a 'secret vote,' a message designed to ease any concerns about retribution for supporting the opposite party. 'I think you're going to have, frankly, a lot of men and women who will go into the voting booth and will vote their conscience, will vote for Vice President Harris,' Cheney said on CBS’s 'Face the Nation' last month. 'They may not ever say anything publicly, but the results will speak for themselves.' Cheney wasn’t the most predictable figure to launch a crusade against her party’s presidential nominee. During her early years in the House, Cheney was a superstar of the right, rising quickly into the ranks of GOP leadership and siding with Trump on virtually every major policy fight while defending him through his first impeachment in 2019. The breaking point came after the 2020 election, when Trump refused to concede defeat and fought to remain in the White House by nullifying Joe Biden’s victory. That campaign led directly to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed into the building in a failed effort to block Congress from certifying the election results. Since then, Cheney has become Trump’s most prominent Republican critic, voting to impeach the president in the days after the rampage and later joining the House investigative committee that found him culpable of fomenting the violence. The castigations cost Cheney her seat in Congress — replaced by a Trump ally. But with Trump racing for a second term, Cheney has returned to the national stage with warnings that the former president poses a material threat to the country's foundational democratic traditions. Her criticisms have extended to those in her party — including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — who are supporting Trump’s reelection bid. But while Cheney is the most vocal anti-Trump Republican to emerge this campaign cycle, she also represents a much larger universe of conservatives who have declined to support the GOP nominee — not because they support Harris on the issues, but because they see Trump as a threat to democracy. Hardly fringe characters, the detractors embody a who's who of GOP leaders stretching back decades, including former President George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Mike Pence, who served as vice president in Trump's first term. Still, a large majority of Republicans on and off Capitol Hill have stuck by Trump amid the internal clash. And many say his appeal to former Democrats more than compensates for the erosion of support from conservative traditionalists. 'To tell you the truth, I think we've picked up more than we've lost,' the GOP campaign strategist said. Democrats have a different view, pointing to recent polls indicating that there are many more Republicans supporting Harris than there are Democrats supporting Trump. Some say Cheney is influencing that trend. 'I do think there is a subset of suburban Republican voters out there that feel left behind by today’s MAGA-fied Republican Party,' said a Democratic campaign strategist familiar with House races. 'So if Republicans for Democrats creates a permission structure for those individuals, then more power to 'em.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/liz-cheney-wants-to-be-deciding-factor-against-trump-on-election-day/	2024-11-01T06:59:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/cheneyliz_harriskamala_102124ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Democrats see hope for Harris in Trump controversies	A series of controversial statements from former President Trump and his allies in the final week of the campaign has opened the door for Democrats to potentially make gains with key voters. A comedian’s racist joke at a Sunday rally about Puerto Rico sparked outcry from the Latino community. Elon Musk, a top Trump supporter, acknowledged that Americans would face 'temporary hardship' under Trump’s economic proposals. A leading transition official indicated Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, would be handed data about immunizations to potentially pull them off the market. And Trump himself said he would be a protector for women 'whether the women like it or not.' Trump’s team has been optimistic about his chances next Tuesday, and the former president managed to seize back the news cycle on Wednesday after President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters 'garbage.' While Biden’s comments may serve to further galvanize Trump’s base — and provided Trump with a political stunt — Biden is no longer on the ballot and Vice President Harris has distanced herself from his comments. Instead, the string of high-profile comments from Trump and his allies has given Democrats fresh talking points to warn of the risks of electing the GOP nominee. 'Every day Trump has dropped a bit of poison in a different voting pool where people might be undecided,' said Jesse Lee, a former Biden and Obama White House official. 'Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics have learned that Trump has a problem with all of them, and not just new immigrants, lots of suburban moms will recoil in horror at the idea of ending childhood vaccinations, and Trump’s protector talk makes him sound like an abuser — women recognize that, and some men will, too,' Lee added. Harris has long framed herself as the underdog in the race. A victory Tuesday would likely be a result of a surge in turnout among women and college-educated voters, and a strong performance among Black and Latino voters. The Trump campaign first handed Harris a gift during a Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden that was intended to be a triumphant delivery of Trump’s closing message. Instead, it was overshadowed by racist and sexist comments by guest speakers, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who compared Puerto Rico to a 'floating island of garbage.' Hinchcliffe’s comments sparked backlash among some Latino voters and prompted Bad Bunny, a superstar Puerto Rican musician, to post on social media backing Harris. Days later, reggaeton star Nicky Jam walked back his endorsement of Trump over the controversy. Musk, the billionaire Trump supporter who has signaled he would lead a government efficiency commission to cut spending, said at a recent telephone town hall that the changes under a Trump administration would 'necessarily involve some temporary hardship.' Democrats jumped on those comments to warn that even Trump’s advisers are aware that his economic plans, which call for the imposition of tariffs on all foreign imports and a hodgepodge of proposed tax cuts, could adversely affect many Americans initially. Howard Lutnick, a co-chair of Trump’s transition team, made more waves Wednesday when he sparred with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about the efficacy of vaccines. He suggested a Trump administration would provide outspoken vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. with data about vaccine safety to show 'it’s not safe.' Meanwhile, Trump at a Wednesday night rally, doubled down on calling himself a 'protector' for women, saying he would do so 'whether the women like it or not.' The series of controversial comments could give Harris and her campaign an opening to appeal to the crucial voting blocs Democrats need to carry key battleground states on Tuesday. Polling has shown Harris lagging behind Biden’s 2020 mark with Latino voters, and Democratic campaign officials have launched ads and increased outreach to capitalize on the Puerto Rico remarks from Trump’s rally. Harris’s campaign is also hoping to drive up its advantage with women and college-educated voters, as it has centered its closing argument on protecting reproductive rights and the idea that Trump is 'unhinged' and only out for power. 'Each day, I think that there are also indications that we are receiving from my opponent that verify, validate and reinforce the fact that, one, he is not going to be fighting for women’s reproductive rights,' Harris told reporters. 'He does not prioritize the freedom of women and the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives and bodies. And health care for all Americans is on the line in this election, as well.' The former president and his campaign have expressed optimism about their position heading into Election Day. Republicans have turned out in strong numbers to vote early, polls have shown Trump in a stronger position than in previous elections, and aides have argued internal data shows Trump on track to win the election. A Decision Desk HQ forecast of the presidential election gives Trump a 53 percent chance of winning the White House, while polling averages show Trump and Harris are within 2 percentage points of each other in each of the seven key battleground states. The Trump team has also shown a knack for seizing control of the news cycle through photo ops, such as when the former president worked briefly behind the counter at a McDonald’s or when he climbed into a garbage truck to highlight Biden’s gaffe earlier this week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-see-hope-for-harris-in-trump-controversies/	2024-11-01T06:57:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trump-controversy_samuels_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
How 'blue wall' sweep could tilt election	(NewsNation) — Late-deciding voters could tip the scales for either presidential candidate this election year. Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will hit the 'blue wall' states just days before the election, hoping to tilt the race in those swing states their way. Recent history dictates that whoever wins the blue wall states wins the presidency. In 2016, that was Trump. In 2020, it was President Joe Biden. For this year's election, it remains a toss-up between candidates. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Where the candidates stand in blue wall states So far, Harris has increased the level of support in several key constituencies but is often trailing the levels in which Biden won them, a new Marist/NPR poll found. It also showed Trump's numbers in some of these categories trailing what his numbers were back in 2020. Harris has seen solid support among non-whites over Trump while he continues to have an advantage among white voters, according to the latest poll in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Marist survey showed Harris, however, trailing in support among nonwhites compared to what Biden had among this group in 2020 in all three states. The contests in all three states are dead heats. Harris currently has advantages in all three, but they are within the margin of error. Harris is doing much better with independents than in the last Marist survey of the blue wall states. In Pennsylvania, she now garners 55% versus 40% for Trump, according to the Marist survey. In September, he topped her. In Michigan and Wisconsin, she has slightly widened her previous lead over Trump in this important constituency. In the key gender gap, Harris' lead among women compared to Trump's with men has grown in two of the states but shrunk in Pennsylvania. The gap in Pennsylvania has narrowed to 12 points. In Michigan, the gender gap has grown to 17 points. In Wisconsin, a 21-point gender gap exists. DC businesses boarding up storefronts ahead of election Securing blue wall states is easy way to victory Securing the blue all states could be Harris' easiest way to victory because securing the blue wall means she likely secures the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. However, if she loses even just one of the blue wall states, Harris will have to bank on other battleground states such as North Carolina. Hoping to avoid that possibility, Harris will spend her last two days campaigning in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump will also make stops in those two states.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/blue-wall-sweep-tilt-election/	2024-11-01T05:27:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/undefined.png?w=900
DC businesses board up before Election Day, blocks away from Whit...	(NewsNation) — Heading into the final weekend before the election, some businesses in the nation's capital are boarding up their windows and doors in case of civil unrest. Friday morning in Washington D.C., multiple businesses blocks from the White House started boarding up their windows. While the D.C. Police Department said there are no known credible threats at the moment, the entire department will be deployed next week to ensure safety. Harris ‘strongly disagrees’ with Biden calling Trump supporters ‘garbage’ NewsNation saw firsthand workers boarding up some of the storefronts — including chains like McDonald's as well as small, locally-owned businesses — over concerns of possible protests or violence related to the election. 'We will not tolerate any violence of any kind,' said D.C. Police Chief Pamela A. Smith at a news conference. 'We will not tolerate the destruction of property. We will not tolerate any unlawful behavior. Offenders will be arrested and will be held accountable.' The police chief also recently said 3,300 officers will be deployed across the district, each working 12-hour shifts keeping a close watch on business districts and polling locations. They can also call in officers from other nearby locations if needed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/dc-businesses-board-up-before-election-day/	2024-11-01T05:03:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-01-065515.png?w=900

If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673. (NewsNation) — Courtney Burgess, a Sean 'Diddy' Combs investigation court witness, exclusively told NewsNation's 'Banfield' he was given 11 flash drives containing at least eight sex tapes involving eight celebrities. Burgess testified before the Combs grand jury in the Southern District of New York on Thursday. Among the eight celebrities that were Combs' 'victims,' 'two to three' were minors, according to Burgess. Burgess said he was working in Atlanta when his former associate Kim Porter, Combs' ex-girlfriend, shared the flash drives with him. What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? Burgess also recieved a manuscript from Porter's alleged memoir titled 'Kim’s Lost Words: A journey for justice, from the other side.' The book details physical abuse, sexual coercion and other acts of violence Combs allegedly committed. The $22 paperback had a quiet release on Amazon but skyrocketed after the news of Combs’ arrest and the shocking details of the indictment against him. Ariel Mitchell, Burgess’ attorney, said the alleged tapes 'tell the story of what Diddy has done over the past 30 years. His deviant activities.' 'I would imagine that is what is encompased if said flash drives exist,' Mitchell said on 'Banfield.' Burgess says he's no longer in possession of the tapes. Chris Brown prevented fight between Diddy’s sons, Ray J: Sources Combs pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. New charges, evidence or additional defendants in his investigation could delay his court date. Combs has been at the center of a storm of controversy and legal troubles where multiple individuals have come forward with allegations of sexual assault against him, leading to a series of lawsuits.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/diddy-court-witness-says-he-saw-8-sex-tapes-with-at-least-2-celeb-minors/	2024-10-31T19:06:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/la-me-ln-sean-diddy-combs-arrested-at-ucla-201-001.jpg?w=750
Josh Hawley, Lucas Kunce face off in U.S Senate debate	ST. LOUIS - U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce agreed to a live televised debate on Oct. 31, 2024, just five days before the general election. The debate will be broadcast at 7 p.m. across Missouri on Nexstar stations, including KTVI/KPLR-St. Louis, WDAF-Kansas City, KRBK-Springfield, and KSN-Joplin, as well as their digital platforms. This event, titled 'Debate Night in Missouri, the Race for the U.S. Senate,' marks the only scheduled debate between the two candidates in one of the country's most closely watched Senate races. Viewers can tune in to see the candidates discuss their positions and address key issues facing Missouri voters. The debate agreement comes after months of public challenges and a face-to-face confrontation between Hawley and Kunce at the Missouri State Fair in August. Both campaigns have been actively engaging in media advertising, with each accusing the other of misrepresenting their positions on various issues. Recent polling by Emerson College, The Hill, and Nexstar shows Hawley with an 11-point lead, though the incumbent suggests the race may be closer. Key topics likely to be addressed during the debate include abortion exceptions, IVF, electric vehicle mandates, and potential presidential endorsements. Nexstar Media, Inc. aims to provide a balanced and accessible platform for the candidates to present their views, aligning with the company's commitment to informing voters, and fostering well-informed electoral choices.

California 13th Congressional District Debate: John Duarte and Ad...	With less than a week to go before Election Day on November 5, Republican incumbent Rep. John Duarte and Democratic challenger Adam Gray will debate live on Thursday night as they seek the 13th Congressional District, a race that could help determine which party controls the U.S. House. 'DEBATE NIGHT IN CALIFORNIA: 13th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,' will begin at 7 p.m. PST and will be moderated by FOX40 News anchor and co-host of Inside California Politics, Nikki Laurenzo, and KGPE CBS47 News anchor Brian Dorman. The debate will air in the Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto areas on FOX40, and in the Fresno and Visalia areas on CBS47. There will be a livestream of the debate at the top of this article, and the debate will also be livestreamed on YourCentralValley.com, and on the FOX40 and CBS47 mobile apps. The race for the 13th Congressional District is a rematch of the 2022 race, which Gray lost by 564 votes, the second-closest House race in that election. The district encompasses the communities between and along the I-5 and Highway 99, from the Tracy area in the north to the Coalinga area in the south. Freshman Rep. Duarte comes from a farming family in the Central Valley and owns one of the largest crop nurseries in the country, Duarte Nursery. As a farmer, Duarte clashed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over violations of the Clean Water Act related to the use of wetlands for farming. Duarte ultimately agreed to pay $1.1 million to settle the issue. In Congress, Duarte serves on various subcommittees, including the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit; the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials; and the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries. During the campaign, Duarte has framed himself as a more moderate Republican who is focused on bipartisanship. The congressman has occasionally voted out of step with his fellow Republicans on key bills such as the 2023 Secure Our Borders Act, which he said would hurt farmers and noted that it lacked support for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). According to his campaign, Gray was born and raised in Merced and worked at his family's farm supply store. Gray worked as a staff member for various California elected officials, including disgraced state Senator Ron Calderon, before becoming a State Assembly member in 2012. Gray held his Assembly seat for 10 years, during which he also at times went against his party. While in the Assembly, Gray fought an environmental effort by the state to restrict the use of water flowing through the region in order to help preserve the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/california-13th-congressional-district-debate-john-duarte-and-adam-gray/	2024-10-31T18:05:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Thursday-Push_BothStations.png?w=900
Trump sues CBS for $10B over Harris's '60 Minutes' interview	Former President Trump is suing CBS News over a '60 Minutes' interview it broadcast with Vice President Harris earlier this month that he and his allies have claimed was edited to cast her in a positive light. The lawsuit, which seeks $10 billion in damages and was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas alleges the network engaged in 'partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion.' Jimmy Kimmel appeals to Republicans to reject Trump in 19-minute monologue 'To paper over Kamala’s 'word salad' weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,' the lawsuit reads. CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump and his allies have railed against CBS for weeks over the wide-ranging interview with Harris, pointing to an answer the vice president gave to a question about the war in Gaza that was not included in the full broadcast and instead published by the outlet online. It is standard practice for broadcast outlets to edit questions and answers during interviews with major newsmakers for clarity, accuracy and time. Trump initially agreed to sit for a similar interview with '60 Minutes,' the network said at the time it broadcast its conversation with Harris, but the former president backed out after the program said it would fact-check him.

Conservatives in furor over Julia Roberts ad for Kamala Harris	A new Harris-Walz campaign ad voiced by actor Julia Roberts encourages women to vote for Vice President Harris in the presidential election, even if their husbands are backing former President Trump. The Roberts ad, put out by Vote Common Good, also alludes to abortion rights, which is seen as a pivotal issue in a race that has seen Trump with big polling leads among male voters and Harris with a large lead among female voters. Jimmy Kimmel appeals to Republicans to reject Trump in 19-minute monologue 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,' Roberts says in the ad as a woman on screen meets up with her husband after casting her ballot for Harris. The voter winks at a fellow female voter as her husband asks if she made the 'right choice.' Republicans have responded to the video with outrage, with some claiming that a wife lying about her vote is as bad as an affair. 'If I found out Emma was going to the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that’s the same thing as having an affair,' Fox News host Jesse Watters said on air Wednesday in a clip highlighted by Mediaite. Other GOP members including Charlie Kirk said the thought was 'nauseating.' In criticizing the ad, he discussed a husband working hard to afford his wife's lifestyle, and then said a wife who lied to her husband about whom she backed would amount to undermining her husband. 'I think it's so gross. I think it's so nauseating where this wife is wearing the American hat, she's coming in with her sweet husband who probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go you know and have a nice life and provide to the family, and then she lies to him saying, 'Oh, yeah, I'm gonna vote for Trump,' and then she votes for Kamala Harris as her little secret in the voting booth,' Kirk fumed to radio host Megyn Kelly.

In response to his statements, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) called Kirk a 'twit.' 'Listen to this twit make Donald Trump’s closing argument.

'The backlash from certain men who are horrified to think their wives might disagree with them actually proves our point.

Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines off the market 'Our work is all about helping people do the thing in the voting booth that they know in their heart they want to do. We’ve traveled the country and met people all over who have a higher calling for their vote than just what their political party or friends demand of them,' he added.

Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines of...	(The Hill) - Howard Lutnick, co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team, said in a Tuesday interview that former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is backing former President Trump, is seeking the federal data to prove vaccines should be kept off the market. Lutnick added, however, that Kennedy will not get — nor does he want — the job of secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Georgia secretary of state: Election is secure, and here’s why 'He's not getting a job for HHS,' Lutnick told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, pushing back against the claim that Trump had promised Kennedy the job. 'He wants the data, so he can say, ‘These things are unsafe.’ He says, ‘If you give me the data, all I want is the data, and I'll take on the data and show that it's not safe. And then if you pull the product liability, the companies will yank these vaccines right off, off of the market.’' Former President Trump shakes hands with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a Turning Point Action campaign rally, Oct. 23, 2024, in Duluth, Ga. (Alex Brandon, Associated Press) 'So, that's his point. He's not trying to do anything, but things that made sense,' Lutnick added. He said he recently spent two-and-a-half hours with Kennedy, who explained to him several theories related to vaccines that Lutnick said made sense to him. Lutnick repeated several unsubstantiated claims in the interview with Collins, including that the government is withholding data about vaccines, that vaccines are linked to a rise in autism diagnoses and that scientists were paid to say that Kennedy is lying about vaccines. Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome Autism diagnoses have increased steadily in the last couple of decades, a trend many scientists attribute to a change in environmental factors, a broadening of criteria for the diagnosis and a wider awareness about the disease. Scientists also say that having an older father can increase one’s chance of autism. Kennedy has previously said that Trump has promised him 'control' of HHS and the related health agencies, leading to concern among some scientists about the consequences on vaccine access and research availability if Trump returns to the White House.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-rfk-jr-vaccines/	2024-10-31T15:05:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kennedyjrrober_trumpdonald_102324ap01_w_7103b7-e1730385094734.jpg?w=900
Georgia secretary of state: Election is secure, and here's why	(The Hill) -- Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) reassured the state’s voters that the upcoming election is secure and that voters' ballots will be counted. Raffensperger said that no matter which presidential candidate triumphs in the 2024 White House election, 'every voter in our state should know that the results will be valid because the election is secure.' Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines off the market 'Election security begins with highly accurate voter registration lists — and to even get on that list Georgia verifies the U.S. citizenship of everyone attempting to register to vote,' Raffensperger wrote in an op-ed published Thursday in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'Noncitizens cannot vote in Georgia,' he continued, adding that the state cross-checks applications with a database administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 'Registering to vote or even attempting to register to vote as a noncitizen is a felony under both federal and state law and carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.' He wrote that voter roll maintenance is done 'daily,' and emphasized that voters are required to show government-issued identification and sign an oath. Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome Raffensperger said in the op-ed that ballots are printed on 'a special paper with security features built into the fibers of the ballot.' 'Election workers in Georgia can use a handheld scanner to detect the presence of security features woven into the fibers of the ballot itself to detect any counterfeit ballots,' he said, adding that this year’s ballots have a 'unique watermark to visually identify any attempt to create a phony ballot.' Earlier this month, the Republican election official shut down claims of voter fraud as the state saw a historic early-voting turnout. Days later, he also warned Republicans that vote integrity claims will 'really hurt' the turnout of the GOP. Raffensperger concluded the op-ed by backing election workers in the state, saying they are 'hardworking public servants who do their absolute best under intense public scrutiny and on tight deadlines.' 'They are people who live and work and worship in the very communities you live in,' he added. 'They have their eyes on the process, and, if something out of the ordinary happens, they notice.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-secretary-of-state-election-is-secure-and-heres-why/	2024-10-31T15:04:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/raffenspergerbrad_022524gn01_w-e1730398186829.jpg?w=800
The current odds in every swing Senate race	(NewsNation) — The 2024 presidential election is still anybody's game, but polling suggests Democrats are facing an uphill battle to maintain control of the U.S. Senate. Republicans have to win just one of two competitive races in red states — Montana or Ohio — to secure a surefire majority, assuming everything else goes as projected. NewsNation’s election partner, Decision Desk HQ, shows Republicans with a 71% chance of winning the Senate as of Oct. 31. The current odds in every battleground state Scott Tranter, the director of data science at DDHQ, recently explained what goes into that projection: 'We have over 20,000 polls in our database from this cycle, as well as past performance and voter registration [data].' Other variables, like fundraising amounts, also go into the model, Tranter said. In this election, GOP candidates are favored to flip blue seats in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia. Two other Democratic incumbents — Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin and Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania — are in closely contested races. Meanwhile, Democrats will try to pull off upsets in Missouri and Texas, hoping to unseat two prominent GOP senators — Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley — both of whom are in closer races than they'd prefer. Here are the current odds in 13 key Senate races. Arizona: Kari Lake vs. Rep. Ruben Gallego In this combination photo, Kari Lake speaks in Dallas, Aug. 5, 2022, left, and Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., is seen in the Capitol, July 14, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Gallego (D): 82% Lake (R): 18% GOP: Anything short of 52-seat Senate majority would be a ‘failure’ Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Gallego (D): 49.7% Lake (R): 43.5% What to know: Trump-backed former TV anchor Kari Lake is eyeing an Arizona Senate seat after coming up short in her 2022 bid for governor, but polling suggests she has a tough hill to climb. As recently as July, Lake and U.S. Rep Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., were within three points of each other, but since then, Gallego has widened the margin to more than six points. He's also raised considerably more money: over $56 million versus Lake's $21 million. Florida: Sen. Rick Scott vs. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), left, and former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.) are in a tight race for Florida's Senate seat. Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Scott (R): 75% Mucarsel-Powell (D): 25% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Scott (R): 49.5% Mucarsel-Powell (D): 44.8% What to know: Once a hotly contested swing state, Florida now leans Republican. That bodes well for GOP Senator Rick Scott, the incumbent, who won by a slim 10,000 vote margin in 2018. Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former representative from Miami, will have to overcome a roughly 5-point polling gap and a $10 million spending disadvantage to flip the seat blue.

Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Sheehy (R): 74% Tester (D): 26% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Sheehy (R): 50.0% Tester (D): 45.2% What to know: Senator Jon Tester, the incumbent, is the most vulnerable Democrat this cycle and is now considered an underdog against GOP challenger Tim Sheehy. The reason is fairly straightforward: Montana is a solidly red state that Trump won by more than 16 points in 2020. '[Tester's] reputation as a straight-shooting, authentic, and deeply rooted rural Montanan arguably matters less than ever in a highly nationalized electoral environment and in a Montana that has changed dramatically since his last run in 2018,' Kal Munis, a political scientist and Montana native, wrote in a recent Brookings article. Nevada: Sen. Jacky Rosen vs. Sam Brown US Senate candidate Sam Brown, left, and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Rosen (D): 80% Brown (R): 20% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Rosen (D): 48.9% Brown (R): 43.3% What to watch: Republican presidential candidates have been gaining ground in Nevada in recent elections, so much so that it has become a legitimate swing state. But losing by less and winning are two different things. Republican Adam Laxalt came up short in his 2022 Senate bid, losing to Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. Now, polling suggests Democratic incumbent Jacky Rosen is heavily favored to retain her seat against Republican challenger Sam Brown. The net worth of richest Congress members New Mexico: Nella Domenici vs. Sen. Martin Heinrich Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich (left) and Republican challenger Nella Domenici (right) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Heinrich (D): 94% Domenici (R): 6% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Heinrich (D): 50.5% Domenici (R): 39.2% What to watch: Democratic incumbent Martin Heinrich has raised more than twice as much as GOP challenger Nella Domenici, the daughter of the last New Mexico Republican elected to the Senate. Domenici will have to pull off a major upset to get elected in a state that Joe Biden carried by more than 10 points in 2020. Ohio: Sen. Sherrod Brown vs. Bernie Moreno This combination photo shows Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Oct. 26, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington, left, and Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno, a Republican candidate for Senate, in Westlake, Ohio, March 19, 2024. (AP Photo) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Moreno (R): 54% Brown (D): 46% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Moreno (R): 47.7% Brown (D): 46.9% What to know: Polls suggest Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown could be in trouble against Republican businessman Bernie Moreno. A few elections ago, Ohio was a key battleground state, but since then, it's grown increasingly red. 'There's been several polls over the last week that have [Moreno] anywhere from one to three points ahead, on top of the fact it looks like Donald Trump's going to probably win the state by five to seven points,' Tranter told NewsNation's Markie Martin on Monday. What time do the polls close in my state? Pennsylvania: Sen. Bob Casey vs. David McCormick This combination of photos taken in Pennsylvania shows Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., left, at a campaign event, Sept. 13, 2024, in Wilkes-Barre, and David McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania, at a campaign event, April 25, 2024, in Harrisburg. (AP Photo) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Casey (D): 72% McCormick (R): 28% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Casey (D): 48.0% McCormick (R): 45.5% What to know: Businessman David McCormick is back after narrowly losing to Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Republican primary election for the Senate back in 2022. McCormick was trailing by about seven points in early September but has since cut Democratic incumbent Bob Casey's lead to less than three points. Casey's war chest is almost twice as big, and he's outraised McCormick $52 million to $27 million. Texas: Sen. Ted Cruz vs. Rep. Colin Allred (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File/J. Scott Applewhite) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Cruz (R): 75% Allred (D): 25% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Cruz (R): 49.1% Allred (D): 45.9% What to watch: Former presidential hopeful and current Senator Ted Cruz is facing a tough battle for his seat in the Lone Star State. If Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred can pull it off, it would be a major upset. Current polls suggest that's unlikely, though not impossible. 'Ted Cruz won his last race by 2.6% against Beto O'Rourke six years ago, and right now, he's polling better than that,' Tranter said. West Virginia: Jim Justice vs. Glenn Elliott West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice and Glenn Elliott are facing off for the Senate seat in West Virginia. Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Justice (R): &gt;99% Elliott (D): &lt;1% What to know: Republicans are all but guaranteed to pick up outgoing Senator Joe Manchin's seat. Trump carried the state by roughly 30 points in 2020, meaning the Senate candidate with 'R' by their name has a pretty good shot. That means West Virginia GOP Governor Jim Justice is likely headed to the U.S. Senate. He's outspent his Democratic opponent, Glenn Elliott, by 5 to 1. Close Thank you for signing up!

Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin has a major fundraising advantage but just narrowly leads in the polls. GOP challenger Eric Hovde, a businessman, currently has the momentum. At the start of October, Hovde was behind by more than four points; now, that gap is less than half a point, according to Decision Desk HQ.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/current-odds-senate-race-states/	2024-10-31T15:04:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670bafa0480f66.43464132.jpeg?w=900
Trump, Harris separated by 1 point in Georgia, North Carolina: Po...	Former President Trump and Vice President Harris are separated by only 1 point in the battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina, according to polling released Thursday. The surveys from CNN, which were conducted by SSRS, found that Trump leads Harris by 1 point — with 48 percent support to her 47 percent — among likely voters in Georgia, while Harris sports the same margin among North Carolina’s likely voters, with 48 percent support to 47 percent. Both leads are within the margin of error, meaning the candidates are statistically tied. Little has changed since CNN’s polls of both states came out in the past two months. More than half of the respondents in both Georgia, 59 percent, and North Carolina, 52 percent, said they already voted, according to the survey. The Democratic nominee leads Trump among Black likely voters in both North Carolina, 78 percent to 19 percent, and Georgia, 84 percent to 13 percent. She also has an advantage with white college-educated voters in both states: with 55 percent support to Trump's 39 percent in Georgia and 53 percent to 42 percent in the Tar Heel State, according to the poll. Trump outpaced Harris among white voters without college degrees in the Peach State, with 81 percent support to Harris's 15 percent, but he had a smaller advantage in North Carolina, with 65 percent support to 31 percent, the survey found. Voters in both states said they trust Trump more than Harris on immigration, foreign policy and the economy. They had more faith in Harris when it came to abortion, but were split on the issue of democracy. The new polls come just a day after another set of CNN polls had Harris outpacing Trump by 6 points, with 51 percent support to his 45 percent, among likely Wisconsin voters. She also led by 5 points in Michigan, with 48 percent support to 43 percent. Nationally, Harris leads the former president by 0.8 percentage points, with 48.2 percent support to Trump's 47.4 percent, in the latest The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate of polls. The CNN surveys were conducted Oct. 23-28 among 732 registered voters in Georgia and 750 registered voters in North Carolina. The margin of error was 4.7 percentage points in Georgia and 4.5 points in North Carolina.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-separated-by-1-point-in-georgia-north-carolina-polls/	2024-10-31T15:03:42-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Trump-Harris-Emerson-Hill-10.26.png?w=900
How a 2022 law speeds up the presidential transition process	(NewsNation) — A winner in next week’s presidential race may not be determined for days, but the clock for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to begin moving toward a transition of power will begin ticking in the days immediately after the election, according to rules passed by Congress The Presidential Transition Improvement Act, which was enacted in late 2022, mandates the transition process will begin five days after the election — even if a presidential candidate has not conceded the race. According to the Center For Presidential Transition, if a 'sole apparent successful candidate' is not determined within the five days after election day, transition assistance is provided 'on an equitable basis' to both candidates until a lone successful candidate emerges. Elon Musk $1M giveaway case moved to federal court by PA judge Under the 2022 act, every federal agency will be required to provide access to the Harris and Trump campaigns beginning November 11. The provision allows both candidates’ teams to begin assembling their respective administrative Cabinets. The Washington Post reported that each federal agency is currently seeking out office space, preferably on two different floors, for each campaign to begin moving forward. Trump and Harris remain virtually deadlocked in the national polls and in several swing states. Political experts have told NewsNation that election outcomes in several states could delay the presidential race being called. Four years after Trump mounted legal challenges over state results that led to President Joe Biden’s victory, the congressional action paved the way for the transition process to begin in a timelier fashion. That transition includes access to sensitive materials and key government agencies for both campaigns, even if the election results are being challenged as they were by Trump in 2020. The race wasn’t called for Biden until the Saturday following the election, setting off claims by Trump the election had been taken from him. But even if there is a delay in the race being called in Harris’ or Trump’s favor next week, the revised version of the presidential transition act will treat both candidates equally in their planning efforts, Trump: Advisers told him not to say he would be ‘protector’ of women The Post reported Trump’s campaign has begun vetting potential Cabinet candidates inside a Washington hotel. However, the newspaper reported that the former president has yet to sign an ethics pledge and agreements involving transition fundraising disclosures and limits. A Biden administration official who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity said that Trump is expected to eventually sign the documents that grant his staff access to government computer equipment and email systems. Harris has signed the necessary documentation that would allow her to begin building a team, the Post report indicated. In 2020, Trump’s false claims of voter fraud delayed the beginning of the presidential transition process until November 23, 20 days after the election, The Associated Press reported. Emily Murphy, the administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration, determined that she had no legal right to determine a winner according to the 1963 transition laws, the AP reported. Murphy eventually did so, but only after Trump had exhausted all of his legal challenges over election results. However, the 2022 congressional actions changed the GSA’s role in the transition process, the AP reported, creating a roadblock for lengthy delays to take place. The Presidential Transition Improvement Act provides for federal cooperation for both candidates to begin the process of building a team even if legal challenges continue and until they have been 'substantially resolved.' That could continue until December, when members of the Electoral College from each state meet to certify election results and choose an Electoral College winner, the AP reported. That meeting takes place about a month before the inauguration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/2022-law-presidential-transition-process/	2024-10-31T14:42:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-10.14.png?w=900
Republican Virginia House candidate defends 'fake family' photos	(NewsNation) — A Republican candidate for Virginia's 7th Congressional District is going viral after posing for photos with what critics say is a fake family. The New York Times was first to report about Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret in the Army, posting footage of himself with a woman and her three daughters on his official YouTube page and on a website paid for by the National Republican Campaign Committee. This footage was not used in a specific ad, the Times wrote. Democrat Eugene Vindman, who is running against Anderson, ran an ad calling Anderson out for this, saying that 'he's trying to hide that he's another extreme MAGA politician' using a 'fake wife and kids.' Anderson is not married and does not have children, but he announced earlier this year that he's engaged. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters On 'NewsNation Now' Thursday, Anderson said it's 'pretty unbelievable' that his opponent is focused on what he called 'B-roll footage that every single candidate in the nation takes.' The people in the picture, Anderson said, are good friends of his. He served with the woman in them and her husband in the military. 'This is the kind of stuff that my opponent is focused on because it's a distraction' from the issues, Anderson said, also mentioning allegations that he didn't tell the truth about his military background. Both candidates have been accused of inauthenticity, The Washington Post writes. Vindman has fielded questions over his military rank and combat record, while Anderson faces allegations he does not live in the 7th District. 'We are five days away from an election, and we're talking about this rather than the issues,' Anderson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/republican-virginia-house-candidate-family-photo/	2024-10-31T14:26:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24297605438072.jpg?w=900
Michigan secretary of state flags Dominion ballot machine program...	LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) — Split-ticket voters using a Dominion ICX Voter Assist Terminal (VAT) on Election Day should be prepared for straight-ticket/split-ticket programming issues when marking their ballot, according to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. A VAT is a special type of device that people with disabilities may use to assist with marking their ballot, which is then printed from the machine and put through the tabulator—but the machine has issues with properly processing certain types of ballots. Election worker fired after completed ballots fell off truck in Florida Benson stresses that this is a nationwide issue and is not only affecting Michigan. 'Yeah, this is a nationwide issue with Dominion voter access terminals in, in the counties that use them in the voter access terminals,' says Benson. 'Of course, not all the machines, just the ones that are accessible, have an issue. With the straight-party voting and a programming issue, that’s again affected the machines nationwide.' Voters using a VAT this Election Day will have to either vote straight-ticket or manually split their ballot—unlike how Michigan voters usually have the option to select the straight party option and then override their party selection for certain races. Benson also says this issue has frustrated officials in places where these machines are used. 'I think all of us who used Dominion machines were unhappy to learn about this during the testing period and as early voting began, so we’re working with Dominion to seek accountability on that front, and also are working with our clerks to ensure voters are aware of this programming issue that will require them to ensure they are voting every section on the ballot,' says Benson. ‘Get out there and vote:’ 102-year-old casts ballot in her 21st presidential election If a VAT user votes straight party and then splits their ticket, they will receive an error message—but will have the chance to fix it and still cast a ballot. While this does not change who or what a voter would cast their ballot for, it will make the process more inconvenient for VAT users who vote split-ticket. The Department of State says the issue can not be fixed in time for Election Day next week—but will be corrected for future elections—and only affects VATS in certain counties. Check here to see which type of VAT your county uses.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dominion-ballot-voting-machine-issue/	2024-10-31T13:51:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/vlcsnap-2024-10-31-14h34m53s497.png?w=900
Elon Musk $1M giveaway case moved to federal court by PA judge	(NewsNation) — A court case filed against billionaire Elon Musk over his $1 million daily giveaways to registered voters is on hold after a Pennsylvania judge heard arguments from the Tesla CEO's legal team and the Philadelphia district attorney Thursday morning. Lawyers for Musk's super PAC on Wednesday night put in a last-minute request to have the whole case bumped up to federal court. District Attorney Larry Krasner argued the issue belongs in state court because this is affecting their border voters. Judge Angelo Foglietta ultimately agreed to kick the matter up to federal court, but the lawyer representing Krasner, John Summers, said they are going to seek to have the matter remanded back to state court. Musk did not show up to Thursday's hearing. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters This all began after Musk's America PAC launched what they say is a 'petition in favor of free speech and the right to bear arms.' The world's richest man is giving $1 million a day to registered voters in battleground states. Some campaign finance experts and Democrats argue that this amounts to paying people to register to vote, which is illegal. Musk's defenders say it is merely a contest that's open to voters. In the 2024 presidential election, Musk is backing Trump, who took to Truth Social on Wednesday to tell his 8 million followers that 'Pennsylvania is cheating and getting caught at large-scale levels rarely seen before.' Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, responded on X to this claim by saying that Republican and Democratic clerks of elections are making sure only eligible voters are able to register and cast ballots. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, third from right, arrives for a hearing at a City Hall courtroom, Thursday, Oct. 31, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) 'We will again have a free and fair, safe and secure election — and the will of the people will be respected,' Shapiro wrote. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said on NewsNation's 'The Hill' that the organization is going to 'continue to be very aggressive in our monitoring and our engagement with the voters across Pennsylvania and every other battleground state.' 'If we need to go to the courts, then we will go to the court,' Whatley said. Pennsylvania is a very important state for presidential candidates, with 19 electoral votes. Polls in the state show Trump and Harris are neck and neck. Joe Biden won the state by one percentage point in the last election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-1-million-giveaway-case/	2024-10-31T12:52:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24291821306487.jpg?w=900
Michigan county clerk race resurrects 2020 election conspiracies	(NewsNation) — The race for county clerk in a Michigan community has ignited familiar arguments over election denial and alleged fraud. Years after the Republican-leaning Antrim County incorrectly announced a landslide victory for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, concerns about election integrity haven’t quieted. RFK Jr. says Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies Now, the sitting county clerk, who oversees the area’s election procedures, hopes to defeat one of her biggest skeptics who’s campaigning for the same role. The race, happening against the backdrop of another Trump presidential campaign, has garnered widespread attention for its ties to the 2020 election. Sheryl Guy has worked for Antrim County for more than 40 years, and she’d like to retire. But she has concerns about 'those seeking to replace her' as county clerk. That’s the pitch the Antrim County Democratic Party outlines in its plea for voters to reelect Guy as a write-in candidate. Campaigning for Guy’s position is Victoria Bishop, a woman whom The Associated Press described as a 'vocal proponent of election conspiracy theories' and the wife of a conservative radio host. BELLAIRE, MI - September 9: A campaign sign for Victoria Bishop next to an American flag in Bellaire, Michigan on Sept. 9, 2024. (Photo by Nic Antaya for The Washington Post via Getty Images) If elected, Bishop has promised to 'clean up the Qualified Voter Files (QVF),' 'remove ‘Dead People’ and Names who no longer live in (Antrim County)' and 'Hand Count every ballot' to make sure they match the machine’s tape. Her victory in the primary election prompted Guy to delay her retirement and seek reelection via a write-in campaign. Guy, backed by the local Democratic Party, said she voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. But her role overseeing that same election drew national attention and positioned Guy as the target of unfounded conspiracy theories. 'In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country,' Trump told his supporters during his Jan. 6, 2021, speech on the Ellipse. The county in question was Antrim — a Republican-leaning area near the resort town of Traverse City. Shortly after the presidential election in 2020, the county reported a landslide win for Biden. Bill O’Reilly: American divide split between progressive values, tradition The problem was attributed to human error, not any issue with voting machines, and the results were quickly corrected to show that Trump won the county. That did nothing to calm the speculation. Those who questioned Trump’s loss in Michigan quickly latched on to the reporting error to suggest that voting machines were responsible for widespread fraud, even though there has been no such evidence. 'I feel that [Trump’s] goal at that time was to use Antrim County to open up other jurisdictions with problems,' Guy told NBC News. BELLAIRE, MI - September 9: Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy works in her office at the Antrim County Government Building in Bellaire, Michigan on Sept. 9, 2024. (Photo by Nic Antaya for The Washington Post via Getty Images) An analysis of the incident cited 'vulnerabilities' and 'human errors that directly led to inaccurate results.' Still, there was 'no evidence that any of these problems was ever exploited in Antrim County,' and the errors were not the product of a security breach, the March 2021 analysis stated. Michigan’s concerns about election integrity mirror those playing out on the national stage. This year’s election is the first presidential contest since Trump began spreading lies about widespread voter fraud costing him reelection in 2020. The false claims, which he continues to repeat, have undermined public confidence in elections and in the people who oversee them among a broad swath of Republican voters. Investigations have found no widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines four years ago, and each of the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss has affirmed Democrat Joe Biden’s win. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/michigan-antrim-county-clerk-race-election-denial/	2024-10-31T11:16:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2170868929.jpg?w=900
Trump: Advisers told him not to say he would be ‘protector’ of wo...	(The Hill) -- Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his advisers had counseled him against describing himself as a 'protector' for women, a phrase he used in late September as he sought to make up ground with female voters and repeated again at a Wisconsin rally. 'My people told me about four weeks ago, I would say, 'No, I want to protect the people; I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women,'' Trump said at a Green Bay, Wisconsin, rally. 'They said, 'Sir, I just think it's inappropriate for you to say.' I pay these guys a lot of money; can you believe it?' Trump continued. 'I said, 'Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them. I'm going to protect them from migrants coming in. I'm going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things.'' FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign aides were quick to highlight the remarks, arguing it showed Trump did not care about women voters. 'Defining line of this campaign? Trump: 'I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not,'' Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer posted on X. 'Saying the quiet part out loud there,' Lauren Hitt, another Harris campaign aide, posted on X. Trump at a late September rally sought to directly address the women in the crowd, telling them, 'I am your protector. I want to be your protector. As president, I have to be your protector. I hope you don't make too much of it. I hope the fake news doesn't go, 'Oh, he wants to be their protector.' Well, I am. As president, I have to be your protector.' RFK Jr. says Trump promised him ‘control’ of public health agencies Trump has had trouble winning over female voters in his past two presidential campaigns, and polls have shown that he once again trails Harris, who has rapidly consolidated support among female voters since she replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket. Harris has made reproductive rights central to her campaign, blaming Trump for the end of Roe v. Wade and the restrictive abortion bans subsequently passed by states across the country. But Trump has led Harris among male voters, setting up a significant gender gap ahead of Election Day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-protector-of-women/	2024-10-31T11:09:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300854967845-e1730204775938_77fa0f-e1730377793913.jpg?w=800
Jimmy Kimmel appeals to Republicans to reject Trump in 19-minute ...	(The Hill) - Comedian Jimmy Kimmel, who is known for criticizing Donald Trump, made an appeal to Republicans to reject the former president in his 19-minute opening monologue on Tuesday evening, one week before Election Day. 'Tonight’s monologue is for Republicans. So, if you have someone in your life who is either planning to vote for Trump or thinking about it, I would like you to send this to a Republican you love and respect with a request: Ask them to watch this whole thing as a personal favor to you. And I promise I won’t make you regret it, because it’s not going to be our usual roast of Trump or some kind of liberal virtual signaling, none of that,' Kimmel said. FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes 'We’re a week away from an election, and we are very divided, and not just because of Donald Trump, because of people like, if I’m being honest, me. I do a lot of mocking and belittling and it isn’t always productive,' the host of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' admitted. 'Am I biased against Donald Trump? Yes. Do I think I have good reasons for being biased against him? Yes.' In his monologue, Kimmel then went on to show clips of the former president, saying he believes some Republicans are so busy they might not really take in the 'words that come out of his mouth.' He included clips dating back to 2015 of Trump saying he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a new plan. The clips sifted through the years as no GOP alternative to ObamaCare ever emerged, going up through the recent presidential debate against Vice President Harris, when Trump said he has 'concepts of a plan' for health care in the country. Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, left, and former President Trump (Chris Pizzello, Associated Press; and Greg Nash) Kimmel then went on to talk about Trump’s baseless claims of transgender children undergoing sex change surgeries at school. 'Parents can’t send their kids to school with peanut butter, OK?' Kimmel said. 'This is a lie, you have to know this.' Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome The late night host then pointed out that most presidents and former presidents don't try to brand themselves for personal gain, though Trump has hawked everything from sneakers to Bibles to NFTs. 'Listen, politics, in a lot of ways, is like sports. You probably just root for the team your Dad roots for. Maybe you’ve been a Republican your whole life, that’s your team, and it feels wrong not to root for them, or to vote for them, but this time around, you wouldn’t be alone,' Kimmel said. He later added that he saw someone wearing a t-shirt that said they support Trump because Trump angers the same people who anger them. RFK Jr. says Trump promised him ‘control’ of public health agencies 'It’s funny, I get it. Sometimes it feels like no one has a sense of humor anymore. But is that really all we want for America? To piss each other off? I don’t want that, away,' Kimmel said. 'If you made it this far, thank you for listening, and whoever wins, once the votes are counted, if Trump has more of those votes, we are going to accept that, even if it doesn’t go our way. We won’t like it, but we’ll accept it, because that’s how it has to go.' 'We vote, we count the votes, winner wins, loser goes away. That’s the only way this country can work, and it’s up to you to do whatever you think is the right thing to do,' he concluded.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-monologue/	2024-10-31T11:08:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/jimmy-kimmell-trump-split_014298-e1730368827531.jpg?w=900

Kennedy Jr. said Monday that former President Trump has promised him 'control' of public health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, should he win a second term next week, according to a video viewed by The Hill. 'The key that ... President Trump has promised me is — is control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH and a few others, and then also the USDA, which is ... key to making America healthy,' Kennedy said in the video. 'Because we’ve got to get off of seed oils, and we’ve got to get off of pesticide intensive agriculture.' FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes Kennedy suspended his own long-shot presidential campaign in August and endorsed Trump. During his endorsement, Kennedy pledged that if he were 'given the chance to fix the chronic disease crisis and reform our food production … within two years, we will watch chronic disease burden lift dramatically.' Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks as he endorses Republican presidential nominee former President Trump at a campaign rally at the Desert Diamond Arena, Aug. 23, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (Evan Vucci, Associated Press) Kennedy now serves on Trump’s transition team and has become a campaign surrogate. He has been telling voters that the 45th president will 'make America healthy again.' Kennedy, a longtime purveyor of anti-vaccine messaging who founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, has been speaking more insistently in recent months about children’s health and solving the problems of chronic childhood diseases. Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome The Democrat-turned-independent has been lobbying Trump for a role in his possible next administration. HHS oversees 13 separate agencies, and Kennedy has long argued they are in desperate need of reform. Trump has said he would put Kennedy on a panel that would investigate 'the decades-long increase in chronic health problems, including autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity, infertility and many more.' During a campaign rally in New York City on Sunday, Trump said he would let Kennedy 'go wild on food' and 'go wild on medicines' if he wins in November. RFK Jr. says Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies The Trump campaign did not deny that the former president promised Kennedy control. Trump has pledged Kennedy would have a role in his administration but has not been specific. 'No formal decisions about Cabinet and personnel have been made, however, President Trump has said he will work alongside passionate voices like RFK Jr. to Make America Healthy Again by providing families with safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic plaguing our children,' Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, said in a statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-trump-public-health-agencies/	2024-10-31T11:03:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci_e93ed6-e1730368358641.jpg?w=900
Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome	Billionaires who have funneled tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 election or who have made key decisions affecting the race have a lot riding on the outcome. Two of the biggest names to get attention this fall are Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post. Also in the mix are Bill Gates, the former CEO of Microsoft who donated $50 million to a nonprofit that supports Vice President Harris, and Reid Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, who is also backing Harris. These titans of industries have major economic stakes in federal policy ranging from subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) to lucrative military contracts and antitrust actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice. Musk, who has endorsed former President Trump, has been a critic of the Biden-Harris administration’s tax credits for electric vehicles, which he says help his competitors more than Tesla. He said in July that a rollback of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which would be a top priority of a new Trump administration, might hurt Tesla 'slightly' but would be 'devastating for our competitors.' Joe Sacks, the executive director of the EV Politics Project, said Tesla is 'losing market share to companies that are subject to the $7,500 tax credit to cars that are being manufactured here in North America.' 'Tesla is not subject to the same tax credit and so there are certainly incentives there,' he added. 'That’s at play.' 'He stands to benefit from eliminating the kind of key EV provisions from the IRA,' he said. Sacks said Musk 'also has a role to play in getting the former president to stop EV bashing,' noting that Trump has softened his attacks on electric vehicles since Musk endorsed his candidacy. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk’s other major business venture, SpaceX, has more than $15 billion in contracts with the Department of Defense and NASA. The New York Times reported this month that Musk’s companies have been the targets of at least 20 government investigations or reviews related to issues ranging from consumer safety to environmental concerns. Trump hasn’t said what position Musk might have in his administration, but the South African-born entrepreneur is expected to wield a lot of influence if Trump returns to the Oval Office. Bezos has also come under scrutiny in recent days after it was widely reported that he decided to end The Washington Post’s tradition dating to 1976 of endorsing presidential candidates. Bezos explained in an essay published by the Post that such endorsements 'create a perception of bias' and 'non-independence.' 'Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one,' he said. The last-minute decision to kill the pending endorsement of Vice President Harris, however, sparked outrage and raised questions about whether Bezos’s financial interests weigh on a decision not to pick a fight with Trump given his strong chance of being reelected president. Dan Froomkin, a former Washington Post staffer wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review in 2022 that Bezos’s businesses interests posed a 'conflict of interest.' Amazon, the company Bezos founded and in which he retains a large financial interest, has a significant amount of business with the federal government and will likely be in the mix for major federal contracts in the future. Amazon Web Services was awarded a 10-year, $10 billion contract with the National Security Agency in 2021 and a contract with the Defense Department to work on its Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability in 2022. It was one of five companies, along with Google, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, to provide products and services to the Central Intelligence Agency over 15 years. And the Navy signed a blanket purchasing agreement worth $724 million with Amazon Web Services in 2022. Amazon once claimed that it had been blocked from government contracting because of Trump’s complaints about The Washington Post’s coverage of his administration. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy tried to establish a better relationship with Trump by reaching out to him in August, after he formally became the Republican Party’s nominee for president. Amazon and Amazon Web Services did not respond to a request for comment. Bezos also founded a space-exploration company, Blue Horizon, that has significant business interests that could be impacted by federal policymaking. It has a $3.4 billion contract with NASA to build a lunar lander, and advocates for the company sought a $10 billion funding provision for it in Endless Frontier Act in 2021. Senior officials with the company met with Trump briefly after he gave a speech in Austin, Texas, last week, soon after The Washington Post spiked its endorsement. Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and Harris supporter, meanwhile, sits on the board of another company with major financial interests in doing business with the federal government. Microsoft split a big cloud-computing contract from the Defense Department with several competitors including Amazon, Google and Oracle in 2022. Microsoft also faces an antitrust investigation from the FTC related to OpenAI, in which Microsoft is a major investor. Hoffman accused FTC Chair Lina Khan of 'waging war on American business' and said he wants Harris to replace her if elected. He has donated $7 million to help the Biden-Harris campaign and has organized a fundraising effort for Harris in Silicon Valley. Beyond that, Harris has voiced support for a billionaire minimum tax and raising the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. 'Nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations and I plan on making that fair,' Harris told '60 Minutes' earlier this month. But Harris hasn’t said whether she would support one of President Biden’s most controversial proposals — taxes on unrealized capital gains — which would inflict a big financial hit on the nation’s wealthiest individuals and families. 'The billionaires, what they know about Trump is he’ll lower taxes and he’ll deregulate. … He’ll shut down antitrust and they see that has a huge benefit,' said Bob Borosage, co-director of Campaign for America’s Future, a progressive advocacy group. 'They’ve got antitrust problems in Europe so they really want an American president who’s not going to go down that route,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/billionaires-have-business-interests-hinging-on-election-outcome/	2024-10-31T10:39:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Billionaires_103124_AP_Sean-Simmers-and-Evan-Agostini.png?w=900
He'll never know': 1 in 4 people lie about who they vote for	(NewsNation) — What happens in the voting booth stays in the voting booth, a new Harris campaign ad reminds women. Meanwhile, a new survey found that people lie to loved ones about who they vote for. Half of Gen Z voters and a quarter of U.S. voters have lied about their voting selections, a survey from The Harris Poll found. The Harris Poll, unaffiliated with the Kamala Harris campaign, is a global consulting and market research firm. According to that same poll, conducted in partnership with Axios, 33% responded saying political differences have created distance in their families. Texas Republicans and Democrats spar in ‘Billboard War’ The younger the voter, the more likely this statement is true, with experts saying younger Americans raised on smartphones are conflict-averse. The Harris campaign seized the opportunity with a controversial ad targeting women they believe will be afraid to vote differently than their significant others, reminding them that the choice for president is theirs alone. 'You still voting for him?' one man asks another in the ad. 'Hell yeah. What about your wife?' the other man responds. 'She doesn't like him, but she's voting for him.' Here’s why millions of Americans in Puerto Rico, other territories can’t vote for president 'Same with mine.' The women vote for a different candidate without their husbands knowing. The Lincoln Project, a self-described 'pro-democracy organization,' published the ad titled, 'Secret.' Democrats hope to capitalize on the female vote. 'Your vote is your secret,' the ad says. 'He'll never know.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/1-in-4-people-lie-vote-choice/	2024-10-31T10:36:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2172377704-e1729215616414.jpg?w=800
Musk shares election misinformation: Michigan official	(NewsNation) — Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says she's fighting misinformation being spread online by Elon Musk. 'I hope to debunk some of the agenda-driven misinformation that's out there by simply providing the data for everyone to see,' Benson told NewsNation's Markie Martin on 'Morning in America' on Thursday. Musk has frequently shared misleading and false claims about the 2024 election, going as far as to pick a fight with Benson. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Social media feud over misinformation The two have had a series of exchanges on Musk's platform, X. Musk accused Michigan of having more registered voters than eligible citizens. Benson shot back clarifying federal laws and not to 'feed the trolls.' In response to all the misinformation, Benson and other Michigan officials have set up a website for people to fact-check all of the different conspiracy theories they might come across. 'Transparency is our front and so we are posting the data, the raw numbers, every day,' Benson said. 'People can see the actual numbers for themselves from the very data file that is at the forefront of our elections in our state.': Benson said she hopes that this information helps debunk some of the misinformation being spread. FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes Full confidence in election system The secretary of state said she has full confidence in the election system, saying it has time-tested security layers in place to ensure the integrity of the voting process. 'We really want everyone, no matter who you're voting for or where or how you choose to participate to have faith in the process and participate,' Benson said. So far, over two million Michigan citizens have voted in this year's election, and Benson said she is hopeful to see that number double, if not more.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/musk-election-misinformation-michigan-jocelyn-benson/	2024-10-31T09:58:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Musk.png?w=900
Harris appeals to voters in Arizona, Nevada	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will make stops Thursday in Arizona and Nevada, continuing her series of star-studded rallies and concerts with less than one week until Election Day. Election results could further splinter US: Luntz Harris and Walz will attend a rally featuring musical guest Los Tigres del Norte at 10 a.m. MT in Phoenix, Arizona. In the afternoon, the vice president will host a rally at 4:30 p.m. PT in Reno, Nevada, and close her day with a 9 p.m. PT rally and concert in Las Vegas. The event will feature a performance by the band Maná and remarks by Jennifer Lopez. The packed schedule reflects Harris' efforts to reach voters in key battleground areas. Arizona and Nevada are among the six 'toss-up' states that could make or break Harris' presidential bid in a race that could be won in the margins. Why Arizona matters Republicans have carried Arizona in 16 out of 17 presidential elections, but the state has slowly shifted toward the center. Arizona was called for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Decided by 10,000 votes, it was the slimmest margin in the country. About 60% of the state's population lives in Maricopa County, which generally decides the outcome in Arizona. Biden's margin in Maricopa during the 2020 election was 50.3% to 48.1%, according to DDHQ data. A raw vote lead of 45,000 was enough for Biden to overcome the Republican lead in the rest of the state and win 49.4% to 49.1%. As for early voter turnout, election officials say Republicans have an advantage of more than 89,000 ballots. Those numbers, however, only confirm which party voters are registered with — not how they voted. Here’s why millions of Americans in Puerto Rico, other territories can’t vote for president More than 1.6 million voters — about 28% of the electorate — have cast their ballots in Phoenix, Arizona. Trump has a 60% chance of winning the state, NewsNation’s partner Decision Desk HQ forecasts suggested Thursday morning. Supporters on both sides say they’re optimistic as current polling points to a close race. Election officials warn it could take them as many as two weeks to tabulate ballots as they adhere to new voting laws passed after the contested 2020 election. More than 130,000 volunteers have signed up to help with canvassing across the state, according to the Harris campaign. Why Nevada matters No Republican presidential candidate has won Nevada since George W. Bush's narrow 2004 victory. Historically, in every election that flipped the White House, the winning candidate also flipped at least one state. That's most likely to be Nevada in this election, DDHQ anticipates. Harris had a clear lead over Trump earlier this month, but a neck-and-neck race developed as the weeks went by. Both candidates had a 50% chance of winning Nevada as of Saturday. Trump now holds a slight lead at 51%, according to DDHQ. About 187,000 voters had cast early ballots in Nevada as of Wednesday, according to state election data. Republicans submitted most of those ballots, with a 43% early voter-turnout rate, compared to Democrats' 28%.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-appeals-to-voters-in-arizona-nevada/	2024-10-31T07:45:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
RFK Jr. says Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencie...	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Republican nominee Donald Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies like the Food and Drug Administration or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if he wins the 2024 presidential election. 'He's asked me to clean up the corruption number one,' Kennedy said during a town hall Wednesday with NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'Number two, end the conflicts of interest, return those agencies to their rich tradition of gold standard, empirically-based, evidence-based science, evidence-based medicine, and to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country.' Kennedy ran as an Independent in the election before dropping out and endorsing Trump. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Trump said Sunday at a rally that he would let Kennedy 'go wild' on issues related to food, medicine and health if elected to another term. The event, which took place at New York's Madison Square Garden, was widely criticized for racist and crude comments made by some speakers. Kennedy in the past has disseminated false information about health topics such as vaccines, and is known for spreading conspiracy theories as well. Because of this, NewsNation partner The Hill reports that medical experts have raised concerns about Kennedy’s potential influence in a future Trump administration. Noting that some people call Kennedy an 'extremist,' Cuomo asked him about those who say they are concerned about what the former presidential candidate would do when given the power of a government position. 'I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist,' Kennedy answered, though added that he's written 'five best-selling books on public health' and, as a lawyer, 'litigated on health issues for 40 years.' What his job would be in the Trump administration, Kennedy said, is to address corruption, not impose his personal beliefs on the American people. 'I've sued almost all of these agencies. I've sued FDA, CDC, NIH, FCC, USDA, almost all these agencies,' Kennedy said. 'When you litigate against these agencies, you get a PhD in in in corporate capture and how to unravel it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rfk-jr-health-agencies/	2024-10-31T07:42:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/RFK_041024_Photo_Getty-e1719968339331.png?w=800
Trump takes his campaign out west	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is heading to New Mexico and Nevada on Thursday to secure support out west before the last weekend of the 2024 election. Trump will also make a stop in Arizona on Thursday for a live interview with Tucker Carlson. The proceeds from the event will be donated to relief efforts for those impacted by Hurricane Milton and Helene. The latest poll by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ shows that Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris by less than two points in Nevada but is trailing the vice president by 8.3 percent in New Mexico. While New Mexico is not considered a swing state, Trump is heading to Albuquerque in a last effort to win over voters. Republicans have won in the state only once over the last eight presidential elections. Election results could further splinter US: Luntz Dead-even presidential race As of Thursday morning, the race between Trump and Harris remained a toss-up with Harris leading Trump nationally by just 0.6%, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling. The polling average is based on 312 national polls. In New Mexico, the former president is expected to address the border crisis during his rally, blaming Harris for her part in the Biden administration policies that Trump's campaign said 'wreaked havoc' on the state's residents. He is also expected to address inflation in the state and the unaffordable cost of living. According to New Mexico's inflation update, as of September, the average household is paying more than $1,000 more on basic essentials and reeling with a 22.1% inflation rate compared to prices in January 2021. In Nevada, Trump is expected to discuss housing costs and the economy, promoting Harris' 'failed economic agenda.' He is also expected to vow to make housing more affordable, especially in Nevada where it is short by over 78,000 affordable renting units and inflation has left residents unable to afford the cost of living. Mark Cuban, Dana White butt heads about inflation at town hall Trump's garbage truck ride On Wednesday, Trump stumped in North Carolina and Wisconsin, to shore up voters in the two swing states. It was in Wisconsin that Trump climbed into a Trump-themed garbage truck in his motorcade to draw attention to comments from President Joe Biden where he seemingly called Trump supporters 'garbage.' 'How do you like my garbage truck? This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,' Trump said from the passenger seat of the truck, which was adorned with a Trump campaign sticker and Trump flag. Trump campaign staff widely shared photos of the truck and the former president in the passenger seat as photographers snapped pictures. The campaign has tried to capitalize on outrage among Trump supporters over Biden’s remark, even as Vice President Harris has distanced herself from the comment. 'First of all, he clarified his comments but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,' Harris told reporters earlier Wednesday. Biden sparked backlash Tuesday night when he appeared to compare Trump’s supporters to garbage while commenting on a racist joke a comedian made at a Trump rally days earlier likening Puerto Rico to an 'island of garbage.' The White House, in a statement, argued that the president was being misinterpreted and had been referring to the rhetoric at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally Sunday as 'garbage,' not the Republican’s supporters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-campaign-west-nevada-new-mexico/	2024-10-31T04:38:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24304843561867.jpg?w=900
Sarah Palin supports Trump's stance on abortion	(NewsNation) — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she '100%' supports Trump's stance on abortion because he's not 'forcing anyone's opportunity to end a pregnancy.' During NewsNation's town hall on Wednesday, panelists discussed women's reproductive rights ahead of the 2024 election. Palin said she's supportive of the former president making abortions 'a states issue via the court.' Town Hall: Cuban and White disagree on who will deliver for economy 'He (Trump) is supportive of the Supreme Court deciding Roe v. Wade, which should have been reversed a long time ago, to allow the state to have the people vote on it,' Palin said. Stephen A. Smith challenged Palin to consider that 'federal rights are being stripped.' Smith referenced Michelle Obama's recent speech at a rally in Michigan, where she said women’s lives would be at risk if Donald Trump returned to the White House. The former first lady described dangerous limitations on healthcare for women. Palin responded by saying she believed Obama was 'trying to paint a picture of women not having as many rights as men. .. America is a land of equal opportunity.' American divide split between progressive values, tradition: O’Reilly Sarah Palin: Gender impacts election polling Palin also discussed how gender impacts polling ahead of the election. Polls show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are currently neck and neck. 'I personally don't feel that gender is a big darn deal in this race,' Palin said. However, she does have an issue when men are arguing about abortion. Harris widens advantage over Trump among women in new survey 'When men talk about a woman's feelings and what they go through to make the decision, I say, you guys, you don't know, you haven't been there,' Palin said. 'That's when gender does become an issue.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/sarah-palin-donald-trump-abortion/	2024-10-30T19:29:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/430DF437394ADDE337592B2607C5A85C.jpg?w=900
Mark Cuban: High inflation 'started with Donald Trump'	(NewsNation) — Mark Cuban, a major backer of Vice President Kamala Harris, sparred with Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO and noted Donald Trump supporter Dana White on NewsNation's preelection town hall Wednesday. The two businessman bickered over their candidates' impact on the economy and America's current inflation rate, with White saying Harris has 'done nothing' during her tenure and Cuban advocating for Harris' future plans. American divide split between progressive values, tradition: O’Reilly Cuban said he 'can’t deny that there’s inflation,' but there are more nuanced concerns at hand, including the cost of health care. Referencing Trump’s 'concept of a plan' about replacing Medicare, Cuban pointed to Harris’ proposed medical changes. 'Under Trump … the inflation rate will only continue at the same rate or go up, which means you’re going to keep on going backwards if anybody in your family gets sick at all,' Cuban said. Mark Cuban: Harris inherited economic problems The former 'Shark Tank' investor also pointed out that the Biden-Harris administration inherited their economic problems from Trump. 'I'll tell you exactly when the very first kernel of inflation was set, and that was in April of 2020. It was right at the early days of the pandemic,' Cuban said, going on to explain that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump chose 'his oil company cronies' over keeping gas prices low. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'You can take all you want and blame it on the Biden administration, but it started with Donald Trump,' Cuban said, later admonishing the businessman's tariffs and their impact on the Obama economy he inherited. 2020 saw the lowest inflation rate in years at 1.4%, followed by a massive spike in 2021, when rates hit 7%. Inflation peaked at a four-decade high of 9% in the summer of 2022, under Biden and Harris. It has since dwindled back down to 2.4% in 2024, according to US Inflation Calculator. Dana White: Trump 'proven' on strong economy White pushed the blame back to Biden, honing in on what he sees as Harris' pitfalls compared to the GOP nominee. 'Trump has already proven he can build a strong economy, he can secure the borders, and he is somebody that allies and adversaries respect. Those are all very important things. What has she proven?' White asked. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night During his presidency, federal debt held by the public rose from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion, influenced by Trump’s tax cuts, particularly his slashes to the corporate tax rate, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center’s FactCheck project. While White didn't directly address the economy or Trump's impact on inflation, he doubled down on his criticism of Harris, saying: 'She is the sitting vice president of the United States right now. She's proven nothing. She's done nothing. I think she's in over her head. She knows she's in over her head.' 'Nobody voted her there. Nobody voted Kamala Harris. If she went up against other Democrats, she would not be in the position she's in right now,' White added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/mark-cuban-dana-white-inflation-economy/	2024-10-30T18:30:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/AP24064765648905-e1709644840419.jpg?w=900
American divide split between progressive values, tradition: O'Re...	(NewsNation) — As former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris head into the final stretch of a neck-and-neck presidential election, a recent poll shows that the vast majority of Americans believe the country is more divided than united. An Ipsos Poll, conducted on behalf of the 'With Honor' organization, shows that 81% of U.S. residents believe the country is more divided and that 69% believe most Americans want the same things. Bill O’Reilly: Trump’s ‘dunderhead’ staff should’ve vetted comedian 'I think everybody wants a nice life and a pursuit of happiness and opportunity,' Bill O’Reilly said during a televised town hall on Wednesday night. O’Reilly said the nation finds itself the most divided it has been in history only behind the Civil War. Yet, while the nation is split in its support of Trump and Harris, O’Reilly said that instead, the battle is over the progressive values that Harris promotes and the tradition trumpeted by the former president. 'That’s what people are going to vote on,' O’Reilly said. Bill O’Reilly: 'People know what they’re paying' The bigger priority, O’Reilly said, is the economy – an issue that he said will force Harris to enter Election Day facing a deficit because of the cost Americans are paying for basic necessities compared to four years ago when President Joe Biden took office, he added. 'People know what they’re paying – and they don’t like it,' O’Reilly said. 'That’s going to work against Harris.' Driving the Vote: California sees growing number of Asian Republicans Stephen A. Smith: Roe v. Wade could 'bite' Trump However, Stephen A. Smith, the former ESPN personality who has delved more into politics, said during the NewsNation town hall that he believes reproductive rights will play a huge factor in Tuesday’s election. With women representing 53% of the electorate, the overturning of Roe v. Wade is something, Smith said, that 'potentially could comeback back to bite Donald Trump.' Bill O’Reilly: Cuomo made ‘big mistake’ while questioning Vance But Smith said there is also a 'white issue' with white voters making up 57.4% of the population – the lowest it has been in recent history, Smith said. That, Smith added, could potentially be a deciding factor in how a certain population of Americans vote in Tuesday's election. 'When you have a former president that was speaking about immigration, closing the borders, not letting people in illegally, and eluding – if not flat-out saying – that to some degree, they are costing you, you have to remember that you once considered that you’re a very powerful entity,' Smith said. 'And you believe that power is dissipating before your very eyes and somebody comes along, and they are literally transfixing your attention on that as the issue and that is the reason why, it not only builds fear, it builds grievance, When people go to the polls, the first thing that serves as a motivational factor is grievance.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/bill-oreilly-politics-progressive-values-tradition/	2024-10-30T18:17:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180700408.jpg?w=900
Who is Dana White, UFC CEO and Donald Trump supporter?	(NewsNation) — Dana White may be best known among UFC fans, but the face of the popular mixed martial arts brand has climbed the ranks of those promoting Donald Trump as their choice to win the White House in next week’s election against Vice President Kamala Harris. White’s relationship with Trump dates back 25 years to his early ties with UFC. His support for the former president has put him front and center at campaign rallies as Trump and Harris remain nearly deadlocked in the presidential race with just days remaining. Schwarzenegger endorses Harris: Trump would only make us ‘angrier, more divided’ As White has become more publicly connected to the political arena, who is he, and why has the former amateur boxer turned mixed martial arts executive become so politically active? Dana White is the UFC president and CEO White, 55, acquired a minority stake in UFC in 2002 after breaking into the fight game near Boston, where he was boxing, training and managing fighters. However, after he said he was threatened by men who claimed White owed them $2,500, he abruptly left the East Coast for Las Vegas, according to Forbes. White began training MMA fighters in Las Vegas, including some who were featured in UFC events. He told Forbes he began attending UFC events. 'I ended up finding that out, that they're in trouble and they're probably going to go out of business,' White told Forbes. 'And I'd been to a (UFC) event, and I was looking around and thinking, 'Imagine if they did this, and imagine if they did that. This thing could actually be really big.'' Serving as the president of Zuffa LLC, White became part of a group that acquired UFC when it was on the verge of bankruptcy and began sanctioning fights out of Las Vegas. More than two decades later, Forbes valued UFC at $11.3 billion, the highest combat sports promotion in the county, well ahead of World Westling Entertainment, which was valued at $6.8 billion by Forbes earlier this year. Dana White is a staunch Donald Trump supporter Long before Trump first sought the presidency in 2016, he helped to get White’s UFC brand off the ground. Due to the brutality of the sport, many critics — including late U.S. Sen. John McCain — helped get UFC events banned from cable television. McCain referred to MMA as 'human cockfighting' and was among those hoping to have events banished.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) 'Nobody took us serious then, except Donald Trump,' White said in a 2018 interview. 'I would never say anything negative about Donald Trump because he was there when other people weren’t.' White is now the one supporting Trump and promoting his brand, beginning in 2016 when the UFC executive spoke at the Republican National Convention when Trump was named the Republican nominee for president. 'I know fighters,' White said in his speech. 'Donald Trump is a fighter, and I know he will fight for this country.' White rallied for Trump again in 2020 and called the then-president’s reelection 'critically important,' according to the BBC. White introduced Trump at this year’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and has since been featured at several high-profile campaign events, including a recent rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Outside of his support for Trump, White maintains that he attempts to stay out of the political spotlight, he told Yahoo Sports. He said that when he does appear on political programming, he is trying to appeal to everyone — not just conservatives. 'I don't care what side you're on. We're all Americans,' White said in the interview. 'We all want the same things. We want to make a good living. We want to get a house, we want a car. We want to feel safe in our hometown and definitely in our houses, and we want to take care of our families. No matter what walk of life you’re from, what you want, we all want the same things.' However, in appearing in support of Trump, White has become more partisan in his commentary. 'The stakes have never been higher, and the choice has never been clearer,' White said at the New York City rally. Donald Trump has appeared at many UFC events Since attending many of the UFC fight cards that took place at his properties, Trump has become a prominent figure at several of White’s events. That includes one in New Jersey just days after Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in his high-profile hush money trial. At the event, Trump was ushered to his seat to blaring music and fanfare, escorted by White.

But his campaign has been bolstering his schedule with appearances at major sporting events, including this weekend’s Edwards vs. Covington UFC fight in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) White said that his friendship with Trump dates back two decades and took shape just because of their common love of combat sports and fighting. 'This guy is a fight fan,' White said, according to NJ.com. 'He’s been a fight fan.' Judge extends early voting option in a suburban Philadelphia county after Trump’s campaign sued According to White, he would treat any American president with the same attention at his events as he does for the Republican candidate for president. 'If (Joe) Biden came to a UFC event, I would treat Biden the same way,' White told Yahoo Sports. 'I probably wouldn't walk, but if Biden was there, we would cover the fact that the president of the United States — or if (Barack) Obama or (George) Bush or any of those guys ever came to an event — we would treat them with the same respect.' Donald Trump was shocked at UFC’s merger with WWE After White helped to broker a merger this year between UFC and WWE, Trump expressed surprise after White once bristled at the two combat sports companies coming together in 2016. But after the deal was finalized in 2023, creating TKO Holdings, which is valued at $21.4 billion, Trump credited White for making it happen, 'He is the greatest guy,' Trump said of White on the 'Joe Rogan Experience.' 'You know, I always say, everybody, nobody is indispensable, you know. Everybody can be replaced. Maybe you can’t be. You might not be. But Dana White truly, I don’t think, you know, the things he sold for $4 billion. I said, ‘What the hell! Who the hell is gonna pay $4 billion?’ And they made like a great deal. I mean, because of him. Take him out, I think it’s a whole different world.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/who-is-dana-white/	2024-10-30T16:47:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f5857388f698.98572669.jpeg?w=900
Who is Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty?	(NewsNation) — Moms for Liberty is a 'parental rights' nonprofit that reported $2.1 million in total revenue in 2022. Since its founding in 2021, Moms for Liberty has amassed vigorous support from some conservatives who support its efforts to target references to race and LGBTQ+ identity in schools across the country. At the same time, the group has generated forceful backlash from grassroots groups and anti-hate organizations who argue its activism stirs extremist ideas and harms minority and LGBTQ+ students. Their stated mission according to the Mom’s for Liberty website reads: 'Moms for Liberty is dedicated to fighting for the survival of America by unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.'

How did town halls become a staple of American politics?	(NewsNation) — The 2024 election is just days away, and on Wednesday night, voters will have an opportunity to have their voices heard during a town hall with NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. The preelection town hall is on Wednesday, Oct. 30, at 8 p.m. ET and will feature guests from across the political spectrum. Bill O'Reilly, Stephen A. Smith, Mark Cuban, former candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others will talk with voters about the main issues heading into the 2024 election. To find out how to watch NewsNation, visit JoinNN.com. Last week, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance took questions from Michigan voters during a separate NewsNation town hall. Republicans, Democrats and independents asked about a range of issues, including border security, housing costs and political polarization. Unlike a campaign rally or a moderated debate, town halls allow everyday Americans to engage with candidates directly. The entire event is meant to feel less scripted and informal. Here's how town halls became a staple of American politics. How to watch NewsNation Oct. 30 town hall with Bill O’Reilly and more When did town halls begin? The very first town hall in the United States was established in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1633, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Back then, it was a physical place where townspeople held meetings and gathered to make decisions. The meeting format soon spread throughout New England and gave locals a way to have their say in local affairs and decide on important issues. Over time, the community forum became distinct from the structure, evolving into a core feature of American democracy. Nowadays, town hall meetings often refer to any forum where community participation is allowed on a given topic. These meetings can be held in a variety of venues like churches, schools and libraries. Town halls are not just a way for community members to convene with each other — they're also a format for local and national politicians to talk with constituents or even debate with their opponents. American lawmakers held 23,000 town hall meetings over eight years from Aug. 2013 to Dec. 2021, according to research by the Center for Effective Lawmaking. The study found that representatives and senators who engage with town halls can enhance their lawmaking effectiveness in Congress. JD Vance town hall: Here's the transcript When did town halls become part of presidential politics? Though the meeting format has been around for hundreds of years — when it comes to presidents — town halls are a relatively modern development. In the past, presidential hopefuls didn't participate in town halls; in fact, back in George Washington's day, they didn't even campaign for votes. 'On-the-sly politicking and newspaper editorials were expected to do the campaign work for them — no debates needed,' Smithsonian Magazine said. Quite a bit later, in March 1977, then-President Jimmy Carter conducted a town hall, and in doing so, 'innovated a new form of presidential communication,' media professor David Michael Ryfe wrote. Trump asks Vance in town hall: ‘How brilliant is Donald J. Trump?’ Before that, 'no sitting president had ever engaged in a televised forum so spontaneous, informal and intimate,' Ryfe wrote. Fifteen years later, in 1992, Bill Clinton took the format to the next level when he hosted televised town halls and answered questions from a studio audience while on the campaign trail. That same year, 1992, saw the first 'town hall-style' presidential debate between Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot. What's the difference between a regular debate and town hall debate? Since the inaugural town hall debate in 1992, the format has become a regular part of the presidential debate schedule. 'The principle difference between a regular debate and a town hall debate is that instead of questions from a panel of journalists, questions come from 'real people,' specifically undecided voters,' professor Jonathan Beecher Field wrote in 'Town Hall Meetings and the Death of Deliberation.' Town hall debates have produced some memorable moments over the years because personal character tends to take center stage rather than policy. 'Instead of simply asking about a candidate’s policies or legislation they want to enact, questions are more likely to touch on understanding why the candidates hold certain beliefs,' authors noted in a Columbia Journalism Review article. Clinton scored points over Perot and Bush in 1992 when he adeptly answered a question about how the national debt had affected him personally. The former president walked toward the woman and spoke directly to her, coming off personable and concerned. This year's presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, did not have a town-hall style debate, instead opting for a single moderated debate without an audience. However, both candidates have held separate televised town halls.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/town-halls-staple-american-politics/	2024-10-30T16:30:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-576822696.jpg?w=900
Who is Mark Cuban, the billionaire backing Kamala Harris?	(NewsNation) — Entrepreneur Mark Cuban has made headlines this election cycle over his disdain for Elon Musk and support of Vice President Kamala Harris. Whether the billionaire is on the campaign trail with Harris or making cable news appearances to back her, Cuban's involvement in the election cycle has been notable. Who is Mark Cuban? Cuban is a businessman and television personality known for ABC's 'Shark Tank,' the show where aspiring entrepreneurs pitched their ideas to a panel of industry titans. The former principal and minority owner of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, Cuban's business ventures include founding IT corporation MicroSolutions and video portal Broadcast.com, which he sold for major profits. Schwarzenegger endorses Harris: Trump would only make us ‘angrier, more divided’ His investments are varied — with some coming from his time as a 'shark' on TV — and have banked him a whopping $5.7 billion net worth, according to Forbes. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native is also an author of one book, 'How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It.' Mark Cuban backs Kamala Harris Cuban backed President Joe Biden prior to his exit from the 2024 presidential race, specifically defending his handling of the economy. He has since tweeted in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris multiple times, emerging as one of her most visible surrogates on the campaign trail. Cuban told The Hill Harris has been 'very transparent' about being open-minded, suggesting 'she will listen to Republicans, independents like me and others.' 'She doesn’t base who she speaks to on loyalty,' he said. 'She looks for diverse feedback before making a pragmatic decision.' What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night The 66-year-old is an outspoken critic of the Biden administration’s aggressive approach to antitrust and cryptocurrency, two issues with which Democratic donors and some moderates who could be persuaded to choose Harris may still have concerns. Despite these concerns, Cuban — alongside other billionaires, like avid Donald Trump supporter Elon Musk — has gone all in on this election cycle. Another billionaire, fellow 'Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary told NewsNation, 'I really don’t show for politicians, I show for politics.'

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) Mark Cuban outspoken against Elon Musk In September, Cuban said X, the former Twitter, is 'only as free as Elon [Musk] wants it to be,' adding that the Tesla owner is the 'ultimate arbiter of everything on here.' It’s not the first time Cuban has called Musk out for his approach to running X. During an interview with 'The Daily Show' in August, he accused the South African entrepreneur of tailoring the platform to his own preferences via algorithm design. Cuban has also spoken about AI and social media’s influence on the upcoming election, arguing that the current election cycle is being 'driven' by artificial intelligence and algorithms. Trump on rally speaker’s Puerto Rico comments: ‘I can’t imagine it’s a big deal’ 'This seems to be to be a race where everyone’s frame of reference is influenced more by the narratives delivered by the algorithms we consume than the actual events themselves,' Cuban wrote Monday in a post on X. 'Those algorithms evolve as new information, accurate or not, are posted. So none of us really have any idea how any event or reality will impact the Presidential and other important races this cycle.' Mark Cuban joins NewsNation town hall NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo will host a preelection town hall Wednesday, giving voters a chance to have their say just days before the election. Cuomo, along with guests Bill O’Reilly and Stephen A. Smith, will lead the conversation. Special guests include Cuban, Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice; Dana White, the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship; and former candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now works with the Trump transition team. NewsNation Senior Correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera will join the town hall as well, along with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a Republican, and Democratic Congressmen Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Jared Moskowitz.

Judge extends early voting option in a suburban Philadelphia coun...	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Donald Trump's campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disenfranchised by an unprepared election office. Judge Jeffrey Trauger said in a one-page order that Bucks County voters who want to apply for an early mail ballot now have until Friday. The Trump campaign's lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday morning, comes amid a flurry of litigation and complaints over voting in a battleground state that is expected to play a central role in helping select the next president in 2024's election. The lawsuit sought a one-day extension, through Wednesday at 5 p.m., for voters to apply in-person for a mail-in ballot. The judge's order permits applications through the close of business on Friday. A message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Bucks County government. Neighboring Lehigh County on Tuesday asked a judge to extend the deadline there by one day, through Wednesday, because road closures in downtown Allentown around Trump's rally blocked access to the elections office. The judge agreed. In Bucks County, the Trump campaign lawsuit said people who were in line by Tuesday's 5 p.m. deadline to apply in-person for a mail ballot should have been allowed to get a ballot, even after the deadline. However, Bucks County's election office denied voters that right and ordered them to leave, the lawsuit said. 'This is a direct violation of Pennsylvanians’ rights to cast their ballot — and all voters have a right to STAY in line,' the Trump campaign said in a statement. The Republican National Committee and the campaign of Republican Senate nominee David McCormick joined the lawsuit against Bucks County, where Democrats control the government in a closely politically divided county often seen as a political bellwether. Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration had urged counties to allow every voter who was in line by the 5 p.m. deadline to submit a mail-in ballot application. Responding to criticism and misinformation on social media Tuesday, Bucks County had said every voter in line by 5 p.m. Tuesday would be allowed to apply for a mail ballot. Bucks County officials did not immediately comment Wednesday. Pennsylvania does not allow early voting on voting machines in polling places, as some states do. But Bucks County, like other counties in Pennsylvania, allows voters to apply for a mail-in ballot in-person at the elections office and receive it there, a time-consuming process strained to the limit by Trump's exhortations to his supporters to get out and vote before Tuesday's deadline. Voters can also fill it out and hand it in at the office. Voters waited up to three hours on Tuesday. Those still in line at 5 p.m. were told to go home, the lawsuit said. In neighboring Lehigh County, a steady stream of voters took advantage of the one-day extension Wednesday, descending to the basement office of the voter registration office in Allentown to apply for a mail-in ballot, fill it out and turn it in. County elections workers explained the process as voters stepped off the elevator into a crowded hallway. 'There are wonderful reps here who are telling everybody what to do, how to do it. It’s moving smoothly. I’m excited to be here,' Jeanne Birosik, a Republican voter, said as she waited for elections workers to prepare her mail ballot. Birosik typically votes on Election Day, but in 2020, she said, she showed up to her polling place and was incorrectly told she’d already voted. She filled out a provisional ballot that time, but didn’t want to leave anything to chance for this election. 'This just seemed like a safer way to go about it,' she said. Her husband, Chris Birosik, 62, who was also there to vote, said they didn’t consider dropping their ballots in the mail weeks ago — too risky, in his view. 'I just feel more confident that we get it in and do it this way,' he said. The early voting angst in Bucks County is the latest dustup over voting in Pennsylvania, which has the largest trove of electoral votes of any battleground state and is by far the state most visited by the Democratic and Republican presidential tickets this year. The runup to Election Day in the state has been marked by numerous battles over mail ballots, some landing on the doorstep of the U.S. Supreme Court.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/philadelphia-early-voting-trump-lawsuit/	2024-10-30T13:04:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24303827563284.jpg?w=900
Trump vows to seize money from migrant gangs, cartels	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump vowed to seize money and assets from criminal migrant gangs and the cartels, saying he would give it to the victims of crimes committed by people in the U.S. illegally. 'We're going to get them out fast. We're going to get them out,' Trump said. 'I'm announcing that for the first time under my administration, we are seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartelsand we will use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime, and the government will help in the restoration.' The former president announced his plan as the cartels continued to get richer. Tren de Aragua’s footprint increasing in the US 'Something had to be done,' Trump said. Cartels: A $13 billion industry The deputy director of ICE testified to Congress that back in 2018, the criminal cartels were making roughly $500 million annually. The primary funding source was moving drugs illegally into the U.S. Now, as they smuggle drugs and people, the cartels are reportedly a $13 billion industry annually, according to Congress. That is a 2,500 percent increase from 2018. Every person who is smuggled has to pay a fee to the cartels, and because of President Joe Biden's executive action, it is tougher to get people into the country. Because of this, the cartel makes sure every single person pays. Groups coming across in the Eagle Pass area right are being found with color-coordinated bracelets for the first time in this sector. It's something the border has only historically seen in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Law enforcement believes the cartels are using the bracelets to identify people who have paid. No bracelet means no crossing. Alabama governor deploys over 100 soldiers to southern border Most migrants reportedly pay about $3,000 to $5,000 to the cartels for help in crossing the border. Some undocumented migrants from special interest countries have reportedly paid upwards of $15,000. What happens to seized funds, assets? The DEA claims the cartels are present in all 50 states and are not flying under the radar. When cartels are caught, any funds seized are deposited into the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, an account with the Department of Treasury. The Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture administers the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which was established in 1992, according to a 2023 report from the Treasury Department. Money deposited into this fund is used for several initiatives, including to pay state and local law enforcement agencies that helped seize the funds, compensate victims where the seized assets represent the proceeds of fraud schemes and cover the operating costs of maintaining the fund, according to the report. In 2023, over $800 million was in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Last year, CBP seized more than $53 million in undeclared or illicit currency, which can be proceeds from alleged illicit activity or currency that funds transnational criminal organizations, federal data showed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/trump-seize-money-migrant-gangs-cartels/	2024-10-30T08:36:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181215235.jpg?w=900
Harris 'strongly disagrees' with Biden calling Trump supporters '...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris says she 'strongly disagrees' with criticizing people based on who they vote. Her comments come one day after President Joe Biden called former President Donald Trump’s supporters 'garbage.' 'I believe the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not,' Harris told reporters before reporters before heading to North Carolina for a campaign event. 'And as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. That’s my responsibility and that’s the kind of work that I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously.' The back-and-forth name-calling began during a weekend Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, where a comedian and guest speaker called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden responded Tuesday saying: 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.' He later clarified the statement on social media. 'Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,' Biden said. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.' This story is developing.

Harris to visit three battleground states where Trump has slight ...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is campaigning Wednesday in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — key states where Trump maintains a narrow lead with less than a week left until Election Day. Latest poll numbers have the candidates nearly deadlocked in Pennsylvania, where Harris’ ground campaign has been highly organized, well-funded and thorough. A Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) national forecast Wednesday morning predicts that former President Donald Trump has a 54% chance of winning. Harris makes closing argument to voters on National Mall Harris on the campaign trail She’ll begin her day in North Carolina before heading to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and ending her day in Wisconsin. All three are strategic swing states and Pennsylvania is the most crucial for both campaigns. Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes — the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican presidential candidate by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Wednesday marks the vice president’s first trip to Harrisburg. So far, she’s spent much time in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the state and visited Philadelphia earlier this week. How is Harris performing in key swing states? Trump maintained a slight lead over Harris Tuesday in Pennsylvania. That’s according to the latest forecasts from NewsNation’s partners Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and The Hill, which predict Trump has a 52% chance of winning in the Keystone State. DDHQ also forecasts that Trump will outperform Harris in North Carolina and Wisconsin, with 65% and 55% chances of victory, respectively.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-pennsylvania-north-carolina-wisconsin/	2024-10-30T05:42:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24293048178340-e1729364377105.jpg?w=900
Trump, Harris host dueling rallies in North Carolina ahead of ele...	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris head to North Carolina Wednesday to share their final arguments with voters in the Tar Heel State during dueling rallies ahead of the 2024 election. Trump is expected to spotlight the nation's economy and housing crisis while Harris is anticipated to encourage residents to vote early and keep the enthusiasm surrounding her campaign electric. As of Monday morning, the race between Trump and Harris remained a toss-up with the former president leading Harris by just 1.4 points, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Democrats have a chance to flip the Republican-leaning state blue even though North Carolina has voted red in 10 of the last 11 races. Former President Barack Obama won the Tar Heel State in 2008 and was the first Democrat to do so in nearly three decades. Dead-even presidential race in NC A dead-heat race and an opportunity for Democrats is leading to dueling rallies on Wednesday as Harris is also expected to stump in North Carolina. The two rallies are scheduled at roughly the same time, just located about an hour from each other. The Harris campaign said it believes it has the enthusiasm on its side, while Trump's team said it's looking to cut through that and solidify Trump's lead in the battleground state. North Carolina is one of seven swing states that could sway this year's election. It's another state that has seen another record turnout from early voting. Preliminary data reveals about 3.2 million people in the state have already voted, which is over one-third of the state's registered voters. 475 ballots retrieved from burned drop box in Washington state: Auditor Helene influencing election turnout A new survey found that Hurricane Helene is also playing a role for some voters as they head to the ballot box. The survey released this week by Elon University found that Helene galvanized them, and many voters were motivated to get out to polling sites in part by the federal response to the state's widespread damage. Trump and some Republicans have looked to sow frustration with the response, falsely claiming that nobody from the federal government was helping residents after the storm. FEMA and the White House pushed back on those comments, reassuring there were boots on the ground helping those affected by Helene. Still, the poll found that 20% of voters said they were more likely to vote because of Helene.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-rallies-north-carolina/	2024-10-30T04:47:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6712f380747eb4.31583800.jpeg?w=900
Biden suggests Trump supporters are 'garbage' after comic's insul...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden took a swipe against Donald Trump's supporters on Tuesday as he reacted to the Republican presidential nominee's weekend rally at Madison Square Garden, which was overshadowed by crude and racist rhetoric. In a call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino, Biden responded to a comic at Trump's rally who called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden's initial comments were garbled. 'Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something, I don’t, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know, the Puerto Rico where I’m fr -- in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent honorable people,' he said. The president then added: 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.' White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden 'referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’' Biden then took to social media to personally clarify what he said. 'Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,' he posted on X. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.' In referring to Trump's supporters as 'garbage,' however, Biden's tone was at odds with the message that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is seeking to present as she aims to cast a broad appeal, including to disaffected Republicans. Shortly after Biden's comments, Harris spoke from the Ellipse in Washington, vowing to be a president who would unite the country. 'I pledge to be a president for all Americans,' said Harris, who is Biden's vice president. Republicans quickly highlighted Biden's remark. Trump called up Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during his rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to recount what happened. 'Moments ago Joe Biden stated that our supporters, our patriots, are garbage,' Rubio said. 'He’s talking about everyday Americans who love their country.' Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a subsequent statement, 'There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him.' A Trump campaign fundraising text declared, 'KAMALA’S BOSS JOE BIDEN JUST CALLED ALL MY SUPPORTERS GARBAGE!' before ensuring recipients that Trump himself thinks, 'YOU ARE AMAZING!' Even some prominent Democrats began distancing themselves from Biden's comments. Speaking on CNN, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he would 'never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn't support.' The comments recalled then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton dismissing Trump supporters during a 2016 fundraiser in New York by saying that half would fit into a ' basket of deplorables.' Clinton later called that characterization 'grossly generalistic.' But it became a defiant rallying cry for many Trump backers who said the insult encapsulated the elitist attitudes of Clinton and the Democrats. As reactions to Biden's reaction began to fly, meanwhile, Trump was asked in an interview Tuesday night with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity about the racist and vulgar joke at his New York rally. He responded: 'Somebody said there was a comedian that joked about Puerto Rico or something. And I have no idea who he is.' The former president added, 'I can’t imagine it’s a big deal.' At a rally Tuesday in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a city with a large Hispanic population, Trump repeated his claim that Biden's immigration policies have allowed other countries to treat the U.S. like 'a giant garbage can.' With Election Day now just a week off, Biden has worked to maintain relevance, furiously promoting his administration’s accomplishments while Harris in her race against Trump. But his efforts to remain in the political spotlight might not always be so helpful for the top of the Democratic ticket he’s now promoting. That’s because, while Harris has been sharply critical of Trump for months, repeatedly calling him 'unstable' and 'unhinged' and even suggesting that he was ' fascist,' she has been careful not to decry his supporters. In fact, the vice president has campaigned extensively with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and other former GOP elected officials — hoping to woo conservative crossover voters. The Democratic convention — and Harris ads — have highlighted the stories of everyday Americans who talked about having voted for Trump in the past but now say they are supporting the vice president. On Tuesday’s call, Biden also said that Trump 'doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community' and urged rejection of the former president even as Trump’s campaign says its support is rising among Hispanics, particularly men. 'Vote to keep Donald Trump out of the White House,' Biden said. 'He’s a true danger to, not just Latinos but to all people. Particularly those who are in a minority in this country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-biden-suggests-trump-supporters-are-garbage-after-comics-insult-of-puerto-rico/	2024-10-29T20:04:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6721a07f63ff80.82837425.jpeg?w=900
North Carolina on Election Day: What to expect	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump has won North Carolina in each of the last two elections, but Democrats have been gaining ground, particularly in the major population centers: Mecklenburg and Wake counties. If Harris can improve in those areas, Democrats have a chance to win the state for the first time since Barack Obama in 2008. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout How votes will be counted In North Carolina, the polls close at 7:30 p.m. Counties can start processing mail-in ballots at 5:00 p.m., while some counties with passed measures can begin processing mail-in ballots at 2:00 p.m. on Election Day. While the North Carolina Board of Elections allows for same-day voter registration for early voting — which runs through November 2 — the state does not allow residents to register to vote if they are casting ballots on the day of the general election. To register to vote the same day during early voting, residents must have a state identification number from their state-issued driver’s license or must have proof of the last four digits of their Social Security number. North Carolina Senate race in 2022 In the 2022 U.S. Senate race, Democrat Cheri Beasley took a 20-point lead over Ted Budd when the first batches of votes were released after polls closed. That lead disappeared after about 90 minutes when Budd overtook Beasley in the vote count and went on to win the seat. Mail and early in-person votes accounted for about 59% of all ballots in that election. In statewide elections, the Democratic strongholds are in the Raleigh, Charlotte, Greensboro and Fayetteville areas, while Republicans tend to perform best in the western, eastern and southeastern areas of the state. When Obama carried North Carolina in 2008, he won beyond the safe Democratic areas and picked up an additional 11 counties in what were moderate Republican areas. More than half of those counties may have moved out of reach for Democrats today, as Trump outperformed Biden by double-digit margins in 2020. But that same year, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper picked up Granville, Pasquotank and Scotland counties in his successful reelection bid and reduced the margin in others.

(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly criticized former President Donald Trump's campaign staff as 'dunderheads' for not vetting a comedian who called Puerto Rico an 'island of garbage' during a Sunday rally. O'Reilly, while discussing the Madison Square Garden rally, revealed that Trump 'didn't know that comedian who disparaged all Puerto Ricans' and blamed the incident on poor campaign management. 'He's got a lot of people working for him that are dunderheads. … They're only there because they kiss his butt, and that's not what you want,' O'Reilly said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' However, O'Reilly noted exceptions to his criticism, praising Lara Trump and campaign executive Susie White as 'very powerful' and 'very smart' members of the team. Megyn Kelly: Trump speakers alienating key voters at MSG not ‘smart’ O'Reilly also characterized Vice President Kamala Harris as a 'machine candidate' who 'does what the machine tells her to do' and criticized her campaign's performance, particularly noting that 'she can't answer a question.' 'You think she's got a bunch of geniuses running her campaign? ... You think PhDs are running that operation?' O'Reilly said. What happened at Trump's MSG rally? The event was a surreal spectacle that included former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, billionaire Elon Musk, TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, politicians including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik and an artist who painted a picture of Trump hugging the Empire State Building. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, one of the featured guests at Trump’s New York City event, sparked a furor after referring to Puerto Rico as 'a floating island of garbage,' prompting some members of the GOP, like Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, R-N.Y., who is Puerto Rican, to come out against the remarks. GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally In addition to his remark about Puerto Rico, Hinchcliffe also made a crude joke about Latinos in which he said, 'They love making babies too. Just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They c-- inside. Just like they did to our country.' Hinchcliffe wasn’t the only one who made controversial remarks about different racial and ethnic groups during the rally. Carlson referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as a 'Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor' even though Harris is neither Samoan nor Malaysian but rather Black and Indian American. Sid Rosenberg, a New York City radio host whose show Trump calls into periodically, blasted Democrats in derogatory and explicit terms. 'She is some sick b------, that Hillary Clinton. What a sick son of a b----,' he said of the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee. 'The whole fucking party. A bunch of degenerates.'

Businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris 'and her pimp handlers will destroy our country. Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement that Hinchcliffe’s 'joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Trump later defended the rally, calling it a 'lovefest.'

Megyn Kelly: Trump speakers alienating key voters at MSG not 'sma...	(NewsNation) — Megyn Kelly tells 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' she found former President Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally speakers alienated female and Hispanic voters rather than uplifting them. Kelly, a noted Trump supporter who told NewsNation she finds Vice President Kamala Harris 'empty-headed,' thinks that 'there is zero point in offering man after man after man to call her the devil.' She said she doesn't think the rally or its explosive backlash will have an impact on Trump's chances of winning, but there was 'no point' in insulting two major voter pools. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night 'Trump has not won this thing, not by a long shot. You've got to get as many votes as humanly possible.' Kelly said Tuesday. 'And there is absolutely no point in doing or saying anything that would alienate these key voting blocks, including Hispanics and Blacks and women.' NewsNation’s election partner, Decision Desk HQ, shows Trump with a 54% chance of winning and Harris with a 46% chance as of Oct. 29. Kelly expressed disappointment in the speakers chosen for the rally, saying that the Republican men in her life were 'not motivated by, like, racist jokes about Hispanics and Blacks and sexist comments about women.' 'They are capable of so much more than this, and the No. 1 goal was to serve Trump, which they didn't. So whoever actually did screen these remarks, if indeed that's true, ought to be removed from the campaign for the next seven days and just let a grown-up handle this,' she said. What are the swing states for the 2024 election? Kelly clarified that while she believes the GOP nominee will still win the presidential election, the event did him no favors. 'At something like this, you want to be inspired, you might want to laugh, but you don't want to hit below the belt,' she said. 'And above all, do nothing to make your stupid joke, whether you're the comic or one of the supporting acts, the story. Trump needs to be the story.' What happened at Trump's MSG rally? The event was a surreal spectacle that included former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, billionaire Elon Musk, TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, politicians including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik and an artist who painted a picture of Trump hugging the Empire State Building.

Driving the vote: Hispanic voters in Nevada crucial in election	(NewsNation) — The road to the White House in Nevada must include the growing Hispanic vote. In Nevada, as well as bordering Arizona, Latinos make up about 25% of registered voters, who hit the ballot box with a swirl of backgrounds, issues and traditions. To emerge as the successor in the 2024 election, Republican former President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris need to gain approval from the nearly 1 in 4 voters in Nevada who are Hispanic. For example, take Alina Gardner, a realtor who moved to the United States from Cuba as a young girl. She's able to show her listings in English and Spanish. The current odds in every battleground Senate race Gardner is what's called a 'persuadable,' meaning that even though she’s a registered Republican, her vote is not set in stone. 'I get a lot of texts and emails from the Democrats, so I listen to both,' Gardner told NewsNation. 'I'm open to both.' At the same time, while she's willing to vote for a Republican, Gardner doesn't believe Trump should be president 'at his age.' 'As of right now, it's going to be Kamala Harris,' Gardner said. Ivet Aldaba will have her daughters top of mind as she votes this November. The college professor is among the estimated 36 million Latinos eligible to vote this time around nationwide. That’s up from 14 million in the year 2000 — an increase of 153%. 'Having immigrant parents and them not being able to vote — at the time, I felt that civic responsibility even more,' Aldaba said. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout For Aldaba, her reason for voting Democrat is reproductive rights. 'I want my daughters to have a voice, to be able to decide what they can do with their own bodies,' Aldaba said. Meanwhile, retired blackjack dealer David Mendez says when he started showing support for Trump, he lost a lot of friends. He's voting for Trump because of what he says are the culture wars playing out in his casino. Rudy Zamora, of the nonpartisan voter engagement group Chicanos Por La Causa, serves a community that mirrors the country as a whole. There's young voter apathy he sees as well as distrust in election integrity. 'I've heard conversations from my aunts and uncles saying, ‘Oh, back in my country, my vote doesn't really matter,' or 'The election was already bought,'' Zamora said. 'That's not the case here. Every single vote is one vote, one voice, and we have to ensure that our voice is being represented at the polls.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-vote-hispanic-voters-nevada/	2024-10-29T15:59:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/6521e49f957f28.91693881.jpeg?w=900
Pennsylvania on Election Day: What to expect	(NewsNation) — Pennsylvania voters should prepare for potential swings in reported results on election night due to the state's complex vote-counting procedures. With polls closing at 8 p.m. ET, initial results could show significant shifts between candidates as counties report mail-in ballots and Election Day votes at different times throughout the night. State law prohibits counties from processing mail-in ballots before 7 a.m. on Election Day, and results cannot be published until after polls close. This restriction, combined with county-by-county reporting autonomy, means early results may not reflect the outcome. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout Philadelphia election officials have invested in new technology to speed up the count. The city plans to deploy six new mail-in ballot processing machines capable of opening 40,000 envelopes per hour — a significant upgrade from older machines that handled just 3,600 hourly. The 2020 presidential election illustrates the potential for early result fluctuations. President Joe Biden initially led when early votes were counted before former President Donald Trump pulled ahead as Election Day votes were tallied. After all mail-in ballots were counted, Biden ultimately won the state by approximately 80,000 votes. Trump narrowly leads Harris in Pennsylvania: DDHQ Trump maintained a narrow lead over Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday in Pennsylvania. That’s according to the latest forecasts from NewsNation’s partners Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and The Hill, which predict Trump has a 51% chance of winning in the Keystone State. The opposite was true as recently as Oct. 17. The candidates were tied until Trump gained a slight lead on Oct. 21. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Nearly twice as many Democrats than Republicans have voted early in Pennsylvania. Tuesday marks Pennsylvania residents’ last chance to request mail-in or absentee ballots. With more than 1.4 million early ballots cast, Trump and Harris are in a close race that could flip the state. Registered Democrats had returned 849,849 ballots as of Tuesday, compared to the 468,067 that registered Republicans have returned so far, according to state election data. Early voting data, however, only shows a person’s party affiliation — not how they voted. The current odds in every swing state Election officials need to process mail ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. It often takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Trump narrowly carried the state by 0.7% in 2016 but lost his hold on Pennsylvania to Biden in the 2020 election.

Maricopa County has 'zero tolerance' for election crimes	(NewsNation) — The sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County has ensured they are ready for Election Day. The Phoenix-area county came under scrutiny during the 2020 presidential election, as the Arizona Senate launched a publicly-funded investigation into election fraud after President Joe Biden won the state. The claims made by former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters were unfounded. More recently, ballots were damaged in the area — some even destroyed — by an arsonist last Thursday. 'We want to make sure that security is for democracy in this election campaign,' Maricopa County Sheriff Russ Skinner told 'NewsNation Now.' 'We want to make sure that our community feels safe and secure,' he added. When will we know the results of the presidential election? Ballot box arson also occurred in the Pacific Northwest, with votes destroyed in Washington and Oregon on Monday. As for a repeat of 2020, Skinner says they hope it is not the case, but the county is prepared for any possible circumstances. 'This is a process for democracy, and we want to make sure that everybody respects each other, and hopefully nobody's out there doing criminal activity,' Skinner said. 'Are we prepared? Absolutely so. Again, we know that there is some divide amongst the politics involved in this, but I want to make sure that we keep our community safe and secure.' According to Decision Desk HQ polling averages, Trump has a 1.9% lead on Harris in Arizona based on 62 polls.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/maricopa-county-zero-tolerance-election-crimes/	2024-10-29T14:41:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179768105.jpg?w=900

Harris to make closing argument to voters on National Mall	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is delivering her closing message of the campaign, asking Americans to 'turn the page' on the era of former President Donald Trump. Her appearance on the National Mall will be the culmination of messages she's delivered over the course of her campaign. She'll be making the case to voters with a focus on Republican voters who are on the fence about voting for Trump and supporters of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley who aren't sure how to vote. A senior campaign official told NewsNation Harris will be focusing on two very different visions of America. The event is being held in a strategic place in front of the White House for two reasons. When will we know the results of the presidential election? One is to paint a picture of the choice in front of Americans. The second is a reminder of 2021, as she will be giving her speech from the very same spot Trump spoke to his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, just before the riots at the U.S. Capitol. The latest polling from Decision Desk HQ shows the race still neck and neck. As of Tuesday morning, Harris held a 0.8% lead based on 305 polls. Yesterday, it was Harris at 48.5% and Trump at 48%, still well within the margin of error. Some Democratic lawmakers and strategists have said they are concerned that Harris is focusing so much on Trump, taking time away from other major campaign issues like the economy, immigration, health care and abortion. A pro-Harris super PAC called Future Forward has warned that attacking Trump's character or stamina is less effective than Harris highlighting her own policy proposals. Joe Rogan: ‘Hope we can make’ Kamala Harris interview happen Voters have also said they want to hear more about her specific policy plans. Others have said they don't like the fear-mongering and feel it contrasts with her vision of a positive, bright outlook on America. However, the campaign said Harris is choosing to make her closing argument on the National Mall to draw a stark contrast between her and her opponent. 'One of the things I love about the American people is we can hold many thoughts at once,' Harris said on Friday, adding that bringing down costs is a priority in her agenda along with fighting for democracy and the freedom to make decisions about one's own body.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-closing-argument-national-mall/	2024-10-29T11:22:41-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180022822-1.jpg?w=900
Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout	(NewsNation) — Nearly twice as many Democrats than Republicans have voted early in Pennsylvania — a swing state that played a pivotal role in the outcomes of the past two presidential elections. Tuesday marks Pennsylvania residents’ last chance to request mail-in or absentee ballots. With more than 1.4 million early ballots cast, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a close race that could flip the state. Swing state counties to watch on election night Registered Democrats had returned 849,849 ballots as of Tuesday, compared to the 468,067 that registered Republicans have returned so far, according to state election data. ON EARLY VOTING: The Harris campaign says they are feeling &quot;very good about what we&#39;re seeing. &quot;We&#39;re confident we&#39;re going to win&quot; a close election. Focused on their own numbers that show they&#39;re on track to win, they say. per @Jackie_Koppell @NewsNation&mdash; Kellie Meyer (@KellieMeyerNews) October 29, 2024 Early voting data, however, only shows a person’s party affiliation — not how they voted. Election officials need to process mail ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. It often takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Trump maintained a narrow lead over Harris Tuesday in Pennsylvania. That’s according to the latest forecasts from NewsNation’s partners Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and The Hill, which predict Trump has a 51% chance of winning in the Keystone State. The opposite was true as recently as Oct. 17. The candidates were tied until Trump gained a slight lead on Oct. 21. How are presidential election votes counted? Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes — the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican presidential candidate by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Trump narrowly carried the state by 0.7% in 2016 but lost his hold on Pennsylvania to Biden in the 2020 election. Ronald Raegan was the last Republican to win the state’s electoral votes twice. Here’s a closer look at Pennsylvania’s early voter turnout as of Tuesday morning: Total ballots returned: 1,473,825 Democratic: 849,849 Republican: 468,067 Other: 155,909 Total mail-in ballots returned: 1,435,280 Democratic: 831,501 Republican: 452,875 Other: 150,904 Total absentee ballots returned: 38,545 Democratic: 18,348 Republican: 15,192 Other: 5,005	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/pennsylvania-2024-electoin-early-voting-democrats-republicans-harris-trump/	2024-10-29T10:44:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/01/88a19c102c7b470d9a85e26b74bfef24.jpg?w=900
Joe Rogan: 'Hope we can make' Kamala Harris interview happen	(NewsNation) — Podcaster Joe Rogan says he wants to interview Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris after Republican former president Donald Trump appeared on his show, though he rejected requests her team made for conducting one. 'For the record, the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast,' Rogan wrote on X. 'They offered a date for Tuesday, but I would have had to travel to her and they only wanted to do an hour. I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin. My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being. I really hope we can make it happen.' Last week, Reuters reported that Harris was considering talking to Rogan as she tried to garner support with male voters and his audience leans heavily toward young men. 'The Joe Rogan Experience' has millions of followers on Spotify, and the Trump interview had 174,000 likes on X as of Tuesday morning. The current odds in every battleground Senate race However, the news outlet said at the time that while Harris campaign officials met with Rogan's team, an interview had not been confirmed yet. On MSNBC Thursday, Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams said the vice president going on Rogan's podcast 'isn't going to work out right now because of the scheduling of this... period of the campaign.' NewsNation has reached out to Harris' campaign for comment. In his three-hour interview with Rogan, Trump repeated lies about voting, election fraud and his loss in the 2020 presidential election. Trump's running mate, GOP Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is set to sit down for an interview with Rogan on Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the vice presidential nominee's spokesperson told NewsNation. NewsNation campaign reporter Libbey Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/joe-rogan-rejected-requests-kamala-harris-interview/	2024-10-29T10:11:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/ca._joe_rogan_gettyimages-975449576-e1720540523892.jpg?w=900
Here are the states where you can register to vote on Election Da...	(NewsNation) — Americans hoping to cast ballots in next week's general election but have not yet registered to vote can do so on Election Day depending on where they live, although others may be locked out because they missed their state's registration deadline. Twenty-three U.S. states and the District of Columbia provide for same-day voter registration, according to state election guidelines. Yet, in places where residents can wait until November 5 to cast their ballot for former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, state and federal offices, and a host of ballot initiatives after registering to vote when they arrived, the rules vary. Meanwhile, 26 states, including several swing states like Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania still prevent unregistered voters from casting last-minute ballots despite calls to give unregistered voters more time. Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts The only U.S. state where these rules do not apply is North Dakota, where residents are not required to register to vote.

Oklahoma governor encourages residents to vote: 'Absolutely safe'	(NewsNation) — The 2024 election is just one week away, and polling site safety is at the top of voters' minds. Cities across the U.S. have been working to beef up security at polling places, which has been driven by a troubling increase in violent threats toward election workers. Local governments have coordinated with law enforcement to ensure safe voting and implement new security measures at polling locations. Trump boasts about rally amid Puerto Rico joke furor A visible police presence, installing cameras and training poll workers on how to handle disruptive individuals are just a few steps being taken. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt told NewsNation's Markie Martin on 'Morning in America' Tuesday that his state is doing everything possible to keep polling sites safe this upcoming election. ISIS-K orchestrated foiled Election Day terror plot Just weeks ago, an Afghani national was arrested in Oklahoma City, suspected of plotting an Election Day terror attack. Afghan native Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was arrested in early October and accused of planning to target large groups of people on Nov. 5. He told investigators he and a co-conspirator — whose identity has not been released — planned to die as martyrs. Tawhedi first arrived in the United States in September 2021. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, the Oklahoma City resident bought AK-47 rifles, liquidated his family’s assets and purchased one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan, charging documents revealed. His younger brother-in-law was also arrested in connection to the potential attack. Since the arrests, some Senate Republicans have called on the Department of Homeland Security to release more information on the suspects. Stitt told NewsNation he was grateful that law enforcement caught the plot early, saying he had been briefly back in July and August on the potential of their ill intent for the country. 'They don't love America. We need to make sure we know who's coming into our country,' he said, making this situation a border problem and encouraging former President Donald Trump's policies. 'There are people who don't like us very much, and we need to find out who they are,' Stitt continued. Regardless, Stitt said he's grateful they were able to thwart the attack. 5 things to watch for in Harris's speech at the Ellipse Oklahoma election day safety measures Despite the recent election day threat in Oklahoma, Stitt said the state is prepared for voters to go out to the polls safely. '100% you're absolutely safe,' he said. 'We have all law enforcement, all my troopers, all the state law enforcement, are in all 77 counties.' Stitt explained that he has law enforcement agents monitoring all the polling locations and working with the election board to ensure voter safety. 'We'll make sure that all Oklahomans are safe,' Stitt said. However, Stitt warned that enemies of the U.S. want to cause fear and chaos within the country. Stitt encouraged voters to get out and vote and to not let the fear get to them and prevent them from doing their national duty. 'Let's not let someone make us afraid to get out of our homes and go vote,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/oklahoma-voter-safety/	2024-10-29T08:46:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1728615622.jpg?w=900
When will we know the results of the presidential election?	(NewsNation) — Voters will likely not know the outcome of the presidential election come election night or even for days depending on how close the race gets in critical swing states, political experts say. It took nearly five days before the race was called by major news organizations for President Joe Biden in 2020 due in part to states being overwhelmed with increased mail in ballots during the pandemic. Some states have updated laws to help expedite that process to avoid a 2020 repeat, but many others remain on the same timeline, which could still stretch final tallies. 13 Senate races that will determine the balance of power 'While we have a national election, it’s not administered nationally,' Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, told NewsNation. 'Elections are run or conducted at the state and local levels, so that means that we have a lot of variation.' How long before we know the results of the presidential election? Several variables will affect the timeframe on an apparent winner, including how close the race is, the amount of mail-in ballots and how quickly electors can start counting, Donahue said. The biggest factor is how close the election is because if it’s tight, we will need to wait for every vote to be counted. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been polling neck-and-neck according to Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecasts. States have moved up timelines Delays during the 2020 election occurred due to higher mail-in ballots which took time to tally but since then, several states including Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan and Georgia have moved up timelines to start counting. In 2020, more than 43% of votes were mailed in as the coronavirus pandemic led states to greatly expand mail-in balloting and early voting, according to a federal report. This took days and as a result, most states updated or changed laws to allow for a head start on preparing mail-in or absentee ballots before election day, according to the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. In Michigan, lawmakers passed rules to allow absentee ballot counting up to eight days before the election and in Nevada officials can begin counting mail ballots on Oct. 21. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Pennsylvania doesn’t allow offices to begin opening mail-in ballots until 7am on Election Day so it could take a longer time to finish. But Donahue says there likely won't be as many mail-in ballots this time around which means results will be quicker than they were in 2020. Some states where early numbers could emerge are North Carolina, Michigan, and potentially Wisconsin where officials can get a head start, Donahue said. 'But we'll have to see what the volumes are and if counties actually start doing that in the morning, or do they wait till the polls close,' he added. Delays may happen in Nevada and Arizona which typically don’t move as fast on counting, he said. 'It's nothing particularly nefarious. A lot of the states in the West don't have that much in-person Election Day voting, and it just takes them a while to get through the ballots.' Election officials publish unofficial results after the polls close on Election Day. Those results will fluctuate as in-person, mail-in, provisional, overseas and military ballots are counted. Could candidates cause delays in election counting process? Legal challenges by either candidate would not delay the counting process, but it could take the certification process closer to its deadline, Donahue said. Under the Election Reform Act of 2022, each state must issue a certificate of ascertainment, which contains a final certified vote tally, no later than Dec. 11, six days before the Electoral College meets. As election day draws closer, Trump has revved up claims that if he loses the election, it’s due to cheating, and has vowed to mount legal challenges. Abortion measures on ballots in record number of states 'They’re going to cheat. They cheat. That’s all they want to do is cheat, and when you see this, it’s the only way they’re going to win,' Trump said during a rally in Wisconsin, reported The New York Times. 'And we can’t let that happen and we can’t let it happen again.' During the 2020 election, delays in counting due to mail-in ballots were used by Trump to fuel false claims that the election was stolen. As a result, counting will be even more careful this year, John Mark Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said in an email to NewsNation. 'This year, there may be a tendency to do the count even more carefully because of all the misinformation Trump is spreading about fraud. Caution means there could be more widespread delays - but not because anything nefarious is happening.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/results-presidential-election-trump-harris-potential-timeline/	2024-10-29T08:28:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181411771.jpg?w=900
Puerto Rican voters rise as key bloc in 2024	Puerto Rican voters have shot to center stage in national elections, marking a major shift for an electorate that was largely overlooked for a century. The voting bloc is at the center of national attention following a series of crude jokes told by Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday at former President Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, in which the comedian equated Puerto Rico to oceanic garbage patches. Though the Trump campaign and many individual Republicans have disavowed Hinchcliffe’s set, the fracas opened a window for Vice President Harris to make a last-minute pitch to low-propensity voters who could help decide the election. 'I think there is a significant number of people who will not be turned off and will make excuses for Trump,' said Federico de Jesús, a Washington-based consultant and former deputy director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. 'But I think that this can and could make a big difference with Puerto Ricans who were already anti-Trump but were not sold yet or were soft on Kamala. They might be voting for her, but they weren't enthusiastic. I think that this will create rage, anger and motivate people to go out and maybe volunteer. Maybe take their relatives to vote. Maybe take a second look at Kamala if they were undecided, and really shore that vote up.' Hinchcliffe’s garbage joke struck at the most sensitive of soft spots for Puerto Ricans across the political spectrum: their homeland. 'The young and the old, their heart is in Puerto Rico — even the ones who were born here in Pennsylvania, in New York, in Nevada, in Georgia, where you have a Puerto Rican population who can decide an election,' said Javier Llano, a D.C.-based Puerto Rican political consultant. Hinchcliffe's segment also included a crass line about Hispanic reproductive habits, as well as anti-Black and antisemitic punchlines that drew a mixed reception from the audience. Republicans including Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.), Reps. María Elvira Salazar (Fla.) and Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.) and Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón, who is running for governor, all disavowed the comedy set, which Hinchcliffe defended Monday, saying it was taken out of context and 'made fun of everyone.' 'This is also, I think, an opportunity for every single American to pay real close attention to what was said at that rally, because no group went unscathed. He talked about Latinos, he talked about Puerto Ricans, he talked about African Americans, he talked about women. The only group that was safe was literally white men — cis white males, to be very specific,' said María Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino. Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement, 'this joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Yet the timing of the Madison Square Garden rally played in favor of Harris, who on the same day released a set of policy proposals for the U.S. territory. 'I will create a new Puerto Rico opportunity economy task force, where the federal government will work with the private sector, with nonprofits and community leaders to foster economic growth and create thousands of new, good-paying jobs in Puerto Rico, including for our young people. And I know that Puerto Rico's economic future depends on urgently rebuilding and modernizing the island's energy grid,' Harris said in a video posted on social media Sunday. That contrast also drew support from top Puerto Rican celebrities, including Ricky Martin, Jennifer López and Bad Bunny. Bad Bunny reposted Harris’s economic pledge to his Instagram account, which is followed by 45.6 million people, highlighting her line, 'I will never forget what Donald Trump did when Puerto Rico needed a caring and competent leader.' Bad Bunny’s jump into national politics is especially significant not only for his worldwide fame, but because he has historically focused his attention on internal Puerto Rican issues, rather than national ones. 'The reason that getting a Bad Bunny — the reason that getting a Ricky Martin and getting a Jennifer Lopez to endorse, is that it allows them to use their information on their feeds to talk to low-propensity information voters,' Kumar said. The Harris campaign quickly cut an ad with footage of the 'garbage' joke, including Trump's unorthodox pronunciation of the island's name in 2017 and Harris's economic pitch. Still, Trump has pulled in his own Puerto Rican celebrity support, most notably from reggaeton stars Anuel AA and Nicky Jam, a sign that both campaigns understand the outsize role Puerto Rican voters could play in this election. 'The fact that both of them and Trump referred to Puerto Rico as a country, which for some Democrats might be a surprise, but to anybody who's spoken to Puerto Ricans in Spanish knows that's how we refer to the island. It resonated with some people, right? And again, he doesn't need to win the majority of Puerto Ricans, but there's a swath of Puerto Rican men with which that resonated,' de Jesús said. 'And Kamala Harris was yesterday in Pennsylvania rolling out a plan on Puerto Rico. So Puerto Ricans on the island may not vote for president, but Puerto Ricans in the states obviously do, and there's a large number of us that have the island in our hearts when we go out to vote.' Puerto Ricans are at the center of the fight for Pennsylvania — the essential swing state — and Florida, a once-swing state with a potentially competitive Senate race. Puerto Rican voters are also expected to play a key role in Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina. That's a far cry from the group's historical clout in safe blue strongholds such as New York and Illinois, and from the electoral marginalization of Puerto Rico's territorial status. Puerto Ricans on the island have been statutory U.S. citizens since 1917, but only Puerto Ricans with residence in D.C. or one of the 50 states can vote in federal elections. Though the Jones Act, the law that conferred citizenship in 1917, spurred migration to the mainland, most Puerto Ricans originally settled in nonbattleground liberal states. For the next century, the Puerto Rican vote was crucial in some local elections but never at the presidential level. 'This time, we could be the decisive vote. In 2020 we were one of several groups, but this time around we could be the decisive swing vote,' de Jesús said. 'We didn't really matter per se in the presidential races until Florida became such a heavy state, with more than 1 million Puerto Ricans. And you know what's happened since, obviously, for local races, statewide races in New York and in Pennsylvania and other states, Puerto Ricans have mattered. But the fact that there's so many Puerto Ricans, more than 100,000 in Georgia, for example, more than that in North Carolina and obviously in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin, that changes things.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/puerto-rican-voters-rise-as-key-bloc-in-2024/	2024-10-29T04:37:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/puerto_rico_voters_091724ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump ally Steve Bannon is released after serving 4 months in pri...	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He’s also expected to resume his podcast Tuesday. Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his conviction. A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race. When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a 'political prisoner.' 'I am proud of going to prison,' he said at the time, adding that he was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a 'corrupt' Justice Department. Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next week's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's convictions in May. Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee. Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court, alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges. A trial in that case is scheduled to begin in December.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-trump-ally-steve-bannon-to-be-released-after-serving-4-months-in-prison-for-contempt-of-congress/	2024-10-29T04:32:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6720c1bc9946a9.60910221.jpeg?w=900
5 things to watch for in Harris's speech at the Ellipse	(The Hill) - Vice President Harris will solidify her closing argument that Donald Trump is a danger to democracy by delivering a speech on Tuesday at the Ellipse — the very site where the former president spoke just before a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Harris’s speech a week before Election Day is expected to be a further plea to voters to turn the page on Trump and highlight his role in the events of that day. She will focus on the two different visions of America that voters are given in this election and after the speech, she will take that closing message on the road and visit every battleground state over the next week, a senior Harris campaign official previewed. Vice President Harris speaks with reporters after attending a service at the Church of Christian Compassion on Oct. 27, 2024, in Philadelphia. (Susan Walsh, Associated Press) Here are five things to watch. Harris to emphasize Trump’s threat to democracy Harris will keep up her plea to voters that Trump is a threat to democracy, which has become a major part of her closing message. The Harris campaign official described the tone of the speech as 'optimistic' and 'hopeful' but said it will center on her and Trump’s different visions of America. Harris will argue that Trump as president would focus on a supposed 'enemies list.' Harris will reiterate that she, instead, has a 'to-do list.' She is set to warn voters that Trump is all-consumed by his grievances and desire for retribution and will argue that tens of millions of Americans are frustrated by the division in politics, according to the campaign official. The vice president has increasingly been leaning into labeling Trump as a threat to democracy and talking about his role in the riots on Jan. 6 during her rallies. But as polling tightens and shifts towards Trump’s favor, Democrats have expressed concerns that she has made her campaign a rebuke of the former president instead of about her own plans. When questioned on Friday about those concerns, the vice president said the American people 'can hold many thoughts at once.' 'One of the highest priorities for the American people right now is bringing down cost… and will be the priority of my work when I'm elected president United States,' she said. 'My priority includes fighting for our democracy… and I will continue to speak on all of them.' Ellipse turnout The Harris campaign expects about 20,000 people to be in the audience at the Ellipse, according to an updated permit from the National Park Service that was expanded from an initial 7,500 people. The campaign is expecting attendees near the site with crowd overflow on the northeast quadrant of the Washington Monument grounds for the program slated to be from 7:15 p.m. to 8:15 p.m.ET on Tuesday night. The site opens to the public starting at 3 p.m., which will allow for a large crowd to accumulate before it begins, according to the permit. Harris’s largest rally to date was in Houston on Friday, when the crowd size was 30,000 people. That rally included Beyonce and Willie Nelson, which added to the draw. Similarly, the speech at the Ellipse could include appearances from celebrities and could bring out a large crowd considering Washington, D.C., neighboring Maryland and northern Virginia are all areas where Harris has wide support. Harris to invoke Jan. 6, Trump contesting election results Harris’s decision to use the Ellipse is twofold, according to the campaign official, one, because it is within view of the White House and two, because it is the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 speech. The vice president will likely warn that history may repeat itself. Trump has not committed to accepting the 2024 election results outright - only if he deems them 'free and fair,' similar to sentiments he declared just before the 2020 election that led to his contesting the results. The vice president will likely warn in her remarks that Trump could declare a victory prematurely, like he did in 2020 before a winner was projected, or refuse to accept the results of the election, which is what led to supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. 'Of course. This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo … a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people,' Harris told NBC last week. 'The American people… are being presented with a very, very serious decision about what will be the future of our country.' A CNN/SSRS poll released Monday found that 69 percent of registered voters nationally think Trump would not accept the election results, and 30 percent think he would. Will she call Trump a fascist? Despite being asked multiple times, Harris has never outright labeled her political opponent a 'fascist.' Harris has agreed in two separate interviews on the notion that Trump’s campaign runs on 'fascism' and agreed with John Kelly’s assessment that Trump is a 'fascist' but she’s never used the word herself. The conversation over whether Trump should be labeled as such was sparked last week when Kelly, Trump’s ex-White House chief of staff, said the 45th president 'certainly falls into the general definition of fascist' in an interview in The New York Times. Harris, at the town hall, would not agree when she was asked if she believes Trump is antisemitic, but instead called him 'dangerous' and 'a danger to the well-being and security of America.' Harris’s Ellipse remarks could be an opportunity for her to take that one step further. Despite Trump labeling Harris a plethora of personal and offensive names, Republicans suggest her name-calling is too harsh following the two assassination attempts on Trump’s life in recent months. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) issued a joint statement on Friday condemning Harris for saying she believes Trump is a fascist, arguing that it could invite another assassination attempt. Possible pro-Trump or pro-Palestine protests Harris has faced pro-Palestine protesters at campaign stops more often than pro-Trump protesters, but she could see both during her speech in Washington given the importance of the location to Jan. 6. The vice president was interrupted by Gaza demonstrators as recently as during her rally in Houston, Texas on Friday. She responded to yelling by quipping that the protesters are at the wrong venue. 'Just send them to the small rally down the street,' she said to protesters, referring to a rally Trump hosted earlier in Austin. 'Some people don’t have a great sense of direction but that’s okay, we’ll show them the way.' Harris has maintained her pro-Israel stance and stuck to her talking points when pressed last week on what she would say to voters who are thinking about supporting a third-party candidate because of the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. 'Far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It’s unconscionable,' she said, adding that she thinks there is a current opportunity to end the war and bring the hostages held by Hamas home given the recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The Biden administration’s support for Israel throughout the war has led to protests from pro-Palestinian Americans, raising concerns among Democrats about whether anger on the issue will hurt Harris’s support among Arab and Muslim Americans and young voters in critical swing states like Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/5-things-to-watch-for-in-harriss-speech-at-the-ellipse/	2024-10-29T04:31:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Harris-Ellipse-five-things_102924_AP_Susan-Walsh-e1730196649227.png?w=900
Could Trump win popular vote, but lose Electoral College?

Swing state counties to watch on election night	(NewsNation) — NewsNation political editor Chris Stirewalt breaks down the battleground state counties that will count the most during Election Day. The counties are incredibly varied, with rural, suburban and urban communities all crucial to Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as they seek the presidency.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/swing-state-counties-2024-election/	2024-10-28T15:32:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181411771.jpg?w=900
When will we know the results of the presidential election?	Voters may not have to wait quite as long after Election Day as four years ago to know whom the next president will be. The public needed to wait almost five days in 2020 before most major news outlets could issue a projection, the longest they had to wait since the infamous 2000 election. One main reason was a historic increase in mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic that several key states weren’t prepared to handle quickly. But experts say some changes in state policies since then and an expected drop in mail-ins this year should speed the process up, even if the final result isn’t known on election night. 'Things will be different this year,' said Quinn Yeargain, an associate professor of law at Michigan State University. 'It may not be as quick as 2022. Famous last words I suppose, but I would be surprised if the process took as long as it did in 2020.' 'At the same time, the ultimate outcome in 2020 was quite clear before the networks called it on that Saturday,' Yeargain added. 'There was no real question as to what was going to happen probably after Wednesday afternoon or Thursday.' Up until 2020, Americans had broadly gotten used to relatively quick race calls for elections, usually no later than late Tuesday or early Wednesday after the election. Of the races of the past few decades, all of them had been called by major media outlets by early the following morning, except for 2000 when a recount in Florida caused weeks of delays. But four years ago marked a sharp difference, with the pandemic yielding health guidelines to minimize in-person, indoor interactions as much as possible. With the election approaching, many voters turned to mail-in voting to avoid voting in-person, and several states altered their policies to allow more voters to cast their ballots through that method. That caused a historic amount of mail-in voting, making up more than 43 percent of all votes cast, as opposed to just a quarter of all votes in 2016 and 2018, according to a federal report released after the election evaluating voting methods used in 2020. But that caused an issue with states being able to process and count all the ballots with the speed that many have gotten used to. Yeargain said state laws vary, but many did not allow mail-in ballots to be opened or checked for signatures until Election Day. 'The volume was so high that it took a significant amount of time to fully deal with that, which is what opened up the possibility of more conspiracy theories about the election to proliferate,' they said. Chris Mann, the research director for the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, also emphasized the closeness of the race, which made the task for media outlets to call races more difficult. Biden only carried the key states that clinched him victory by about a percentage point at most, and that could repeat itself with this year's winner, with polls showing a neck and neck race. 'The process that the news media decision desk could go through is trying to get to a point where the remaining uncounted ballots are not enough to potentially make a difference, and given that the polls show things to be essentially a tie, and if they prove to be correct and these elections are going to be decided by very narrow margins, it will again take quite a while,' Mann said. But some states have altered their policies for processing ballots ahead of Election Day in ways could speed up the process, reducing the chance for a delay as long as in 2020. The center, which works with election officials to build trust in elections, released a report this month gathering vote processing policies for all 50 states. Almost all states allow envelopes for mail-in ballots to be processed ahead of Election Day itself, according to the report. That includes processes such as verifying signatures and other information on the outside of the ballot, sorting envelopes, rejecting improperly filled-out ballots and preparing them for a machine to scan. 'The important part that takes time is that processing to verify every ballot, to make sure that it is valid and completed, has all the information to verify the voters identity,' Mann said. 'Tabulation is the technical term that the election officials use that is separate — much faster, much easier — in that process.' Time is needed to know if the mail-in ballots this year will resemble the total from 2020, though it may be less now that the pandemic is not dominating daily life. But millions of mail-ins have already been cast, and Republicans appear to be embracing the method more than in the past. About half of all states also allow machines to scan ballots before Election Day as long as the results aren’t aggregated, the report states. The current rules for two of the main battlegrounds, Michigan and Nevada, include changes from their policies for the 2020 election, allowing their ballots to be processed in advance. This could be especially critical in Nevada, a state where most voters cast their ballots by mail. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina will also allow processing ahead of Election Day, though North Carolina’s may be complicated by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Georgia in particular seems likely to be quicker among the battlegrounds. But a quick race call might be impossible if the election is particularly close and comes down to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — both states do not allow envelope processing to start until Election Day. Mann underscored that the rules for how the process works were set well in advance of the election but are susceptible to misinformation and disinformation affecting how the public views them. 'The same process that's used in Pennsylvania is used in other states. The same process that's used in Wisconsin is used in other states,' he said. 'The states where the doubt is cast is being passed by people spreading mis- and disinformation about it. The same system isn't causing doubts in other places because it's not being attacked, and there isn’t disinformation being spread about it.' And the closer the race is, the more likely for temperatures to be heightened on both sides around the process, said Pete Seat, an instructor for the University of Arizona’s School of Government and Public Policy and a former George W. Bush White House spokesperson. 'The closer the election is and the longer it takes to find out — particularly if you get into a situation where you're going to the courts to have the result adjudicated in some way — half the country is going to be displeased,' he said. 'It's just a matter of which half it is.' Analysts widely expect the race to be close even if one candidate wins most of the key swing states, but just how close and in which states may decide how long the country is holding its breath. Seat argued people should remember to be patient, even as impatience is a 'function' of society. 'I know a lot of people who just want the election to be over so we can move on, but we're going to have to be patient, because it may not be as over as quickly as we want it to be,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/when-will-we-know-the-results-of-the-presidential-election/	2024-10-28T15:18:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/when-will-we-know_gans_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
The Washington Post endorsement controversy sparks staff resignat...	(The Hill) -- A decision by The Washington Post to not endorse a candidate for president in next week's election is sparking vocal protests and resignations from some staffers. Post publisher and CEO William Lewis announced Friday that the Post would not be making an endorsement, a move that has angered staffers and stoked fears about the newspaper's editorial independence. GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally The Post itself reported hours later that Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon who owns the newspaper, personally made the decision not to run an endorsement after the Post's editorial board had already drafted its endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The first protest was from Post editor Robert Kagan, who told the news outlet Semafor he would step down from the publication. On Monday, Molly Roberts, a member of the Post's editorial board, said she was also stepping down because 'the imperative to endorse Kamala Harris over Donald Trump is about as morally clear as it gets.' 'Worse, our silence is exactly what Donald Trump wants,' Roberts wrote in a statement. 'For the media, for us, to keep quiet.' A third staffer, David Hoffman, a Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist, wrote in a note to his editors obtained by The New York Times that he was stepping down from the Post's editorial board but would remain at the newspaper. Elon Musk sued by Philadelphia district attorney over $1M giveaway 'While leaving the board, I refuse to give up on The Post, where I have spent 42 years,' he wrote. In his announcement on Friday, Lewis acknowledged the decision to not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in more than 30 years was likely to receive blowback. 'We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility,' the newspaper's publisher wrote. 'That is inevitable. We don’t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/the-washington-post-endorsement-controversy-sparks-staff-resignations/	2024-10-28T15:16:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP070803011330-e1718977519545_238212.jpg?w=900
GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally	Republicans are expressing frustration about controversial remarks made at former President Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, worrying it could complicate the party’s outreach to Hispanic, Latino and Black voters. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, one of the featured guests at Trump’s New York City event, sparked a furor after referring to Puerto Rico as a 'a floating island of garbage,' prompting some members of the GOP, like Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-N.Y.), who is Puerto Rican, to come out against the remarks. And Tucker Carlson mocked Vice President Harris’s racial identity. The controversy comes as Republicans have looked to expand their reach with different voting cohorts, which could hold the keys to another Trump reelection. 'This is just a big punch in the gut for Republicans who have sincerely and over a period of time been working to grow strong relationships and roots in Puerto Rican communities, particularly here in the state of Florida,' said former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.). Although recent polls show Harris holding the majority of support among Latino voters — with a 40-point favorability gap among women — one-third of Latino voters remain undecided. For that reason, Trump and his allies have been working hard to shore up support among Latino voters in the closing stretch of the election — though Hinchcliffe’s comments could complicate those efforts. In addition to his remark about Puerto Rico, the comedian also made a crude joke about Latinos in which he said 'they love making babies too. Just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside. Just like they did to our country.' Hinchcliffe’s remarks prompted several sitting GOP members of Congress to push back against the derogatory remarks. 'I’m proud to be Puerto Rican. My mom was born and raised in Puerto Rico,' D’Esposito wrote on the social platform X. 'It’s a beautiful island with a rich culture and an integral part of the USA. The only thing that’s ‘garbage’ was a bad comedy set. Stay on message.' Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), who was born in Cuba but raised in part in Puerto Rico, said on X that she was 'disgusted' by Hinchcliffe’s remarks. 'This rhetoric does not reflect GOP values,' she said. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), whose successful 2018 election was won with the help of Puerto Rican voters, also said on X that the joke 'bombed,' calling it 'not funny and not true.' The Trump campaign, too, has distanced itself from the comedian’s rhetoric. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said on 'Fox &amp; Friends' on Monday that 'it was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste.' 'Obviously, that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign, and I think it is sad that the media will pick up on one joke that was made by a comedian, rather than the truths that were shared by the phenomenal list of speakers that we had,' she said. Hinchcliffe, for his part, defended his remarks, responding to criticism from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). 'These people have no sense of humor,' he wrote. 'Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his ‘busy schedule’ to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone … watch the whole set. I’m a comedian Tim … might be time to change your tampon.' Hinchcliffe wasn’t the only one who made controversial remarks about different racial and ethic groups during the rally. Carlson referred to Vice President Harris as a 'Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor' despite the fact that Harris is neither Samoan nor Malaysian, but rather Black and Indian American. Trump ally Rudy Giuliani used racist stereotypes about Palestinians in his address at the rally, claiming, 'They may have good people. I’m sorry, I don’t take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2.' Democrats have used the speakers’ comments to double down on their criticism of Trump. Talking to reporters on Monday, Harris criticized Trump's New York City rally, calling it 'nonsense.' 'Donald Trump spends full-time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hate and division, and that’s why people are exhausted with him. … People are literally ready to turn the page. They’re tired of it,' Harris said. The incendiary remarks came just more than a week out from the election, and polling across the battleground states suggests a nail-biter of a presidential race. Pennsylvania, New York and Florida are some of the states home to large Puerto Rican communities, and some Republicans say the comments at the rally could impact the GOP presidential campaign and competitive congressional bids. 'With over 456k Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania, one guy’s abhorrent jokes are like a gift wrapped in ribbon for the Harris campaign,' Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton wrote on X. 'At this stage, no campaign can afford negative press — not a single word, not a single action that could alienate or disillusion potential voters.' Curbelo suggested that Hinchcliffe’s remarks could sway Puerto Rican voters in Florida not as familiar with Scott to vote for downballot Democrats. 'What tends to happen is that there's a lot of times a sense of solidarity amongst Hispanic communities. We certainly see that here in South Florida, with Cuban Americans, Venezuelan Americans, Nicaraguan Americans,' said Curbelo, who is Cuban. 'So some, non-Puerto Rican Hispanics could also feel offended by this.' Other Republicans, meanwhile, are skeptical the rhetoric could negatively impact the party in November. Giancarlo Sopo, who led Hispanic media for Trump during his 2020 campaign, called Hinchcliffe’s joke 'stupid' in a text message to The Hill, while adding 'it’s a mistake to assume it will offend all Hispanics.' 'It’s certainly not going to matter to Mexican-Americans in the Southwest. And let’s be real—Hispanic culture isn’t exactly politically correct. Was it in poor taste? Sure, but it’s tame compared to what you hear around lonchera trucks and nail salons,' Sopo wrote. 'At the end of the day, you know what really offends Hispanics? The prices they’re paying at the grocery store.' Brian Seitchik, a Republican strategist and Trump campaign alum, dismissed worries that the comments could reflect on Trump. Voters, he said, are well aware of Trump’s controversial rhetoric and those around him. 'Latino voters, Black voters, white voters, whomever, millions of Americans are choosing Donald Trump not because they love all of his rhetoric or his friends, it’s because they support his policies,' Seitchik said. While Democrats have tried to highlight Trump’s history of controversial — and sometimes racist — comments to deter voters of color from supporting him, Seitchik argued it didn’t work in 2020 and won’t work this year. 'They’re playing identity politics that so offends minority voters these days,' Seitchik said. 'They're Americans. They're not Black Americans or Latino Americans. They're Americans. They want a strong economy, they want to buy a home, they want to send their children to college. They want what every other American wants. And this identity politics approach is simply not working anymore.' Nonetheless, the controversy swirling around the rally isn’t helpful for Trump. Erin Perrine, who served as the Trump campaign’s 2020 communications director, said the real test will come from Democrats and how far they highlight those speakers’ comments.

Ballot drop boxes set on fire in Oregon and Washington: police	PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Investigations are underway after authorities say incendiary devices were placed near two ballot boxes in Portland, Oregon, and a third in Vancouver, Washington, and used to start the fires in the early morning hours on Monday. Portland Police Bureau says the incidents were possibly connected to each other as well as another incident that took place on Oct. 8. 'We got a call that indicated one of the ballot boxes was smoking. We found a device there next to the ballot box,' Vancouver police officials said of the previous October incident. 'Today’s incident was very similar.' According to Portland police, at around 3:30 a.m. Monday, officers responded to reports of a fire at a ballot box on Southeast Morrison Street, near the Multnomah County Elections Division office. By the time officers arrived, they said the fire had already been put out by security employees who work in the area. Woman found dead near Bridgeport Village parking structure Authorities said they found that an incendiary device had been placed in the ballot box and used to start the fire. Information about the incident is still limited and authorities are asking anyone with information to contact Portland police or Portland Fire &amp; Rescue. Just half an hour later, Vancouver police said a Clark County ballot box was also found to be on fire. When officers arrived, they said the ballot box at 3510 SE 164th Ave. was smoking and on fire, and the Metro Explosive Disposal Unit arrived to collect the explosive device. Portland police say they identified a suspect vehicle in connection with the Multnomah County case, which they later revealed to be a Volvo.

'We have multiple systems and security measures in place to ensure your ballot is safe,' Scott said in a statement. 'Your Elections team is working hard to make sure that every vote counts.' A similar situation happened in early October near a ballot box in Vancouver. In the incident, authorities said the ballot box wasn't compromised and the suspicious device was safely removed by the bomb squad.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ballot-drop-boxes-set-on-fire-in-oregon-and-washington-police/	2024-10-28T15:08:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/1920x1080-to-resize-pics-55.jpg?w=900
Texas police investigating 'Klan' flyers threatening Kamala Harri...	AUSTIN (KXAN) — The San Marcos Police Department (SMPD) said Saturday it's investigating threatening flyers found throughout San Marcos that target supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a social media post. SMPD chief Stan Standridge said his department has found at least five flyers, with reports about the flyers starting on Friday. Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts 'We're trying to identify the scope of how many flyers have been disseminated across San Marcos,' Standridge said. 'We have already notified the FBI, and that we've also notified the regional fusion centers—both Southwest [Texas] Fusion center and the Austin Regional Intelligence Center.' The flyers, found on residents' campaign signs, state that the resident is now in a 'national database.' It also threatens that the resident 'will be IRS tax audited.' Picture of a flyer found threatening Harris supporters (Courtesy San Marcos Police Department) 'It's a crime in the state of Texas to try to influence or coerce or even prevent a voter from voting,' Standridge said. 'When we identify the suspect or suspects, then we will present that to the district attorney's office for consideration of applicable charges.' How are presidential election votes counted? SMPD said that people who find one of these flyers should not remove it, and should call the agency's non-emergency number, 512-753-2108. An officer will come to investigate the scene and remove the flyer, it said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-klan-flyers-kamala-harris-supporters/	2024-10-28T14:53:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/SMPD-Facebook-Post-Picture.jpg?w=900
Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts	(NewsNation) — Both the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns are acutely aware the Latino vote could sway the presidential election. Long-term trends indicate Latino men may be shifting to the right as Latina women remain more firmly in the Democratic camp. However, short-term missteps, like last night’s insult by a comedian about Puerto Rico at former President Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, could prove decisive. Long-term trends Based on polling, there’s good reason to believe that a shift in the Latino vote may be underway, although we won’t know if it actually materializes until we get the election results. In 2020, President Joe Biden got 60% of the Latino vote, while Trump got 37%. In Cook’s national polling average, Vice President Kamala Harris is currently garnering 52.7% to Trump’s 42.1%. With about 36 million Latinos eligible to vote in this election, those five additional points for Trump could make a difference. How are presidential electoral votes counted? Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who has worked on Latino voter issues for 30 years and is a co-founder of The Lincoln Project, explains the shift. 'Latino voters are quickly moving away from being a racially and ethnically motivated voter to becoming an economic populist and pocketbook voter. That, in a nutshell, is what's happening,' he said. The base voters of both parties are shifting. College-educated voters are moving toward Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are leaning toward the Republican Party. Madrid says that Latinos are the largest entrants into the non-college-educated workforce, and their voting behaviors match those of their white peers in jobs like ones on an assembly line or in construction. Education level and its impact can also be witnessed in the widening gender gap that is emerging with all voters, including Latinos. Women are becoming more Democratic, and men are turning toward the Republican Party. In the Latino community, more women are earning degrees than men. Given Trump’s previous negative statements about immigrants in this country, including his saying that they are 'poisoning the blood of our country,' many question how some Latinos could vote for him. Madrid explains that many Latinos just don’t think Trump is talking about them. They believe 'he's talking about the undocumented migrant, which they're certainly not,' Madrid said. He says the increase in third and even fourth-generation Latino voters means that many are more likely to identify as 'typically American.' This multigenerational status impacts how Latinos view immigration as well. Madrid believes that Democrats failed to understand that the Latino community sees immigration reform and border security as two different issues, not one large problem to address. Harris, Trump make final pleas to voters ahead of election In a recent New York Times/Siena poll, 43% of Latinos support building a wall, and Madrid said that 69% supported Biden's executive actions on asylum and shutting down the border. While Latinos have more sensitivity to immigration solutions like a pathway to citizenship, they are still concerned with border security. Policy for Latino voters Last week, Harris shared policy proposals highlighting how her plans for the economy and jobs will benefit Latinos, and in particular, Latino men. The proposals include doubling the number of apprenticeships, eliminating unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, offering forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to entrepreneurs and doubling the number of Latino homeowners. While the Trump campaign did not share any Latino-specific policy proposals, last week, he held a Latino roundtable. The campaign said that 'President Trump's successful record and common-sense policies resonate with all voters, including Hispanics' and that the shift towards Trump is undeniable. Short-term optics Just yesterday, Harris also unveiled specific policy proposals for Puerto Rico while campaigning in Pennsylvania. If elected president, she said she would create a Puerto Rico Opportunity Economy Task Force to create thousands of jobs on the island, foster economic growth and rebuild and modernize their electric grid. High-profile Puerto Rican artists like Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin all praised her plans. Collectively, they have over 300 million followers on social media. Later in the evening, at the Trump rally in New York, one of the speakers, a comedian, called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said, 'This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Several Republican politicians denounced the comments as well, further evidence that this could cause trouble with voters. There are almost six million Puerto Ricans in the United States, and nearly 500,000 live in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. In an election that is expected to be won with razor-thin margins, antagonizing any group of voters could be problematic. Ultimately, Madrid believes that the answer to this question will determine the winner. 'Can the Democrats hold on to their U.S.-born Hispanic male base to a greater extent than Republicans can hold on to their white, college-educated female, suburban voter base? That's the whole race,' he said. There is just one week left to find out.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-latino-vote/	2024-10-28T11:35:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
Trump better for stocks, Harris better for housing: Survey	(NewsNation) — A Donald Trump victory is seen as better for the stock market and gold while a Kamala Harris win is expected to be better for housing costs, according to a new Bloomberg survey. Respondents to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey think American wealth will grow regardless of who takes the White House but their confidence varies across different investments. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 22% year to date and more respondents (38%) see stock market gains accelerating under Trump, compared to Harris (13%). Current election odds in every 2024 swing state With that said, research shows there isn't a clear connection between the outcome of a presidential election and stock market performance over the long term. 'The historical data suggests that economic and inflation trends, more so than election outcomes, tend to have a stronger, more consistent relationship with market returns,' a recent U.S. Bank analysis noted. Earlier this year, the value of a gold bar hit $1 million for the first time and 57% of survey respondents expect the price of gold to be higher a year from now if Trump wins versus 45% who felt the same about Harris. For potential homebuyers, however, a Harris victory is seen more positively. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.54% last week, according to Freddie Mac. By the end of a Harris term, the median estimate for that rate is 5.5% according to respondents, compared to 5.9% under Trump. Donald Trump's and Kamala Harris' views on the economy Housing affordability has become a major topic on the campaign trail and both candidates have put forward different plans to address the issue. Meanwhile, former President Trump is also expected to be better for Bitcoin, respondents said. Bloomberg's weekly MLIV Pulse survey was conducted from Oct. 21 to Oct. 25 and included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors. Respondents were Bloomberg News terminal and online readers worldwide who chose to engage with the survey. What do other polls show? The economy has consistently ranked as the top issue in this year's election and Trump has generally polled better on that topic but on specifics, voters are mixed. The latest Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of swing state voters shows more people trust Trump (50%) than Harris (46%) on the economy overall. Specifically, respondents trusted Trump more than Harris on stock market performance (49% to 37%), interest rates (47% to 42%) and gas prices (50% to 41%). However, swing state voters trusted Harris more than Trump on housing costs (48% to 43%), pay raises (44% to 42%) and health care costs (51% to 42%). They also think Harris will be better at helping the middle class (50% to 41%). The two candidates were deadlocked on taxes and unemployment, according to the poll which was conducted online from Oct. 16 to Oct. 20 and surveyed 5,308 registered voters in seven swing states. Here's what other surveys show about voters' views on the candidates and the economy: New York Times/Siena Poll (Oct. 20 to Oct. 23) Expected to do a better job at handling the economy Trump: 52% Harris: 45% Financial Times/University of Michigan Ross School of Business survey (Oct. 17 to Oct. 21) Trust more to handle the economy Trump: 44% Harris: 43% Polling across the seven battleground states, shows Trump and Harris are roughly tied overall.

Harris, Trump make final pleas to voters ahead of election	(NewsNation) — With just eight days until the election, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s campaigns are making one last push to win over voters. The race is still neck and neck, with Harris gaining a slight edge over Trump in the latest Decision Desk HQ polling. Virginia asks Supreme Court to greenlight 1,600 voter roll removals Pollsters say the campaigns’ ability to rally voters in this final stretch — particularly in the swing states — could decide the election. Harris is driving home her plans for health care and the economy, while Trump is focusing on immigration and economic issues. Mobilizing voters With the election just more than a week away, candidates are encouraging Americans to register and vote early or show up at the polls Nov. 5. Harris and Trump have been visiting battleground states. The vice president was in Michigan Monday after campaigning in Texas. Meanwhile, Trump had two appearances scheduled Monday in Georgia on the heels of his rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Trump says he’ll let RFK Jr. ‘go wild’ on health and food in potential second term Will Biden campaign with Harris? President Joe Biden cast his ballot on Monday in Delaware, but it’s unclear whether he’ll appear alongside his vice president as she makes her final pleas to voters this week. Some analysts say Biden’s presence would be an advantage to Harris’ campaign in places like Scranton or Erie, Pennsylvania. Others say Biden could be a disadvantage to Harris on the campaign trail. What are Harris, Trump’s messages at this stage? Both candidates tried to spread messages of joy over the weekend. Harris has tried to paint Trump as a dark force while positioning herself as a positive, new light. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'For the next nine days, no one can sit on the sidelines,' Harris said at a weekend rally. 'There is too much on the line and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days.' Trump similarly framed his potential win as an optimistic outcome for the country. 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' Trump asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden. 'I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-final-campaign-visits/	2024-10-28T11:06:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
Trump says he'll let RFK Jr. 'go wild' on health and food in pote...	(The Hill) - Former President Trump said Sunday that he would let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 'go wild' in dealing with issues related to food, medicine and health in a potential second administration. 'I’m going to let him go wild on health. I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines,' Trump told supporters at Madison Square Garden. RFK Jr.’s presence on Michigan, Wisconsin ballots raises concerns for Trump 'The only thing I don’t think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,' he added, referring to oil. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a campaign rally for former President Trump on Aug. 23, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (Ross Franklin, Associated Press) Kennedy ran an independent White House campaign before dropping out in August and and endorsing Trump. Kennedy, who has led an initiative for the Trump campaign dubbed 'Make America Healthy Again,' has long drawn criticism for his anti-vaccine comments. He has spoken about the proliferation of processed foods and additives, and he has worked as an environmental lawyer. 5 takeaways from Trump’s 3-hour interview with Joe Rogan Medical experts have raised concerns about Kennedy's potential influence in a future Trump administration. Kennedy has denied being against vaccines outright but has long peddled debunked conspiracy theories about them. At a congressional hearing last year, he denied telling people to avoid getting vaccinated, but two years earlier he said on a podcast that he regularly tells strangers not to vaccinate their babies. And on CNN in December, he denied saying no vaccines are 'safe and effective,' despite having said exactly that in an interview last July.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rfk-jr-second-term/	2024-10-28T09:57:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/RFK-dangerous_083124_AP_Ross-Franklin-e1730125705257.png?w=900

Virginia asks Supreme Court to greenlight 1,600 voter roll remova...	Virginia asked the Supreme Court on Monday to greenlight the removals of more than 1,600 people from the state’s voter rolls. State officials say the individuals are noncitizens, but the Justice Department challenged that assertion and convinced a district judge to reinstate the voters because the removals took place too close to the election. Virginia now seeks emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause that ruling after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to do so in a rare Sunday decision. 'Not only will the Commonwealth of Virginia be irreparably harmed absent a stay, so will its voters and the public at large,' the state wrote in its emergency application. Though research indicates noncitizen voting is rare, Republicans have latched on to the issue as the election approaches. Former President Trump at a Friday campaign event brought up the court-ordered restoration of the registrations in Virginia, calling it 'outrageous.' The Justice Department and a group of private plaintiffs claim Virginia violated the federal National Voter Registration Act’s prohibition on systematic voter roll removals within 90 days of an election. The Justice Department has similarly sued Alabama. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), exactly 90 days before Election Day, issued an executive order formalizing a program to remove potential noncitizens from the state’s rolls — more than 1,600 people have been removed as a result, court filings show. Virginia election officials say the individuals were identified as noncitizens based on a federal database or Department of Motor Vehicles forms. But when blocking the removals Friday, U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles noted the challengers quickly found citizens among the list and that some of the discrepancies could be explained by user error. Giles was appointed by President Biden. A three-judge 4th Circuit panel, all appointed by Democratic presidents, largely refused Virginia’s emergency request to pause the ruling. In a rare occurrence, the decision was handed down during the weekend. The 4th Circuit kept Giles’s ruling in place except for a provision ordering Virginia to educate poll workers and the public about the voters’ restoration. The panel said that requirement was 'not sufficiently clear.' Virginia officials 'remain able to prevent noncitizens from voting by canceling registrations on an individualized basis or prosecuting any noncitizen who votes,' the panel wrote in its ruling.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/virginia-asks-supreme-court-to-greenlight-1600-voter-roll-removals/	2024-10-28T07:28:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Quiz-SCOTUS_102124_AP_Susan-Walsh.jpg?w=900
7 House seats Democrats think they can flip	Democrats are battling to flip control of the House at the polls next week, eyeing gains in battleground districts from coast to coast in an effort to win back the Speaker’s gavel after two years in the minority wilderness. The fight for control of the lower chamber remains neck and neck, and campaign handicappers say the gavel is still up for grabs with just eight days left before Election Day. Both parties concede the contest could tip either way. Democrats got a big boost over the summer, when Vice President Harris replaced President Biden at the top of the ticket, bringing a surge in fundraising, volunteerism and general enthusiasm among base voters who had been deflated by Biden’s dismal approval ratings. Party leaders are also animated by the fact 18 incumbent Republicans represent districts won by Biden in 2020, and many of them are vulnerable. Indeed, there are 14 Republican incumbents in 'toss-up' races, representing the most competitive contests in the country, according to the latest tally from the Cook Political Report, and another is in the 'lean Democrat' column. But Democrats lost a bit of ground during the redistricting process, which is expected to net the Republicans one additional seat. And Democrats have 11 'toss-up' races to defend themselves, including three contests where Democratic retirements have put the seats in play. Still, Democratic candidates have vastly outraised their GOP opponents in races across the country, and party leaders are voicing confidence they’ll seize control of the House next year. Here are seven seats where Democrats are most confident they can pick off sitting GOP lawmakers in their quest for the House majority. New York-22: Brandon Williams Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.), a first-term conservative, is among the most vulnerable GOP incumbents this cycle. Although he swept into office in 2022 on New York’s red wave, his margin was only 1 percentage point — roughly 2,600 votes — and Biden won the district by roughly 7 points two years earlier. Since then, state redistricting changes have shifted the 22nd District even further toward the Democrats — Biden’s margin in the new district would have been 11.4 points — and handicappers at the Cook Political Report have the race 'leaning' in favor of Williams’s Democratic challenger, John Mannion, a moderate state senator. Democratic campaign operatives say that shift — combined with Williams’s conservative policy record, especially on abortion — make the seat ripe for flipping next week. 'Unlike some of the other vulnerable Republicans in New York — who are desperately trying to hide their anti-abortion extremism in a desperate attempt to sound moderate — he will openly run as a far-right conservative,' a Democratic strategist familiar with House races said. 'He's unapologetic about it.' The fundraising numbers also favor the Democrats. While outside groups have spent $4.2 million on behalf of Williams, they’ve spent $6.6 million favoring Mannion, according to OpenSecrets. Nebraska-2: Don Bacon Democrats have been trying unsuccessfully for years to pick off Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a moderate district centered around Omaha. This year, they think they have their best shot to date. Not only did Biden carry the district by 6.3 percentage points in 2020, but independent polling shows that Tony Vargas, the Democratic state senator challenging Bacon, is performing better than he did two years ago, when he lost to the incumbent Republican by roughly 6,000 votes. In this year’s rematch, the analysts at Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan handicapper based at the University of Virginia, have rated the race 'lean Democrat.' On top of that, the Harris campaign has focused squarely on the district in the final weeks of the race, sending vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife to stump in the region. That’s because Nebraska is one of only two states, along with Maine, to award presidential electoral votes by congressional district — in contrast to the winner-take-all system adopted by every other state. House political operatives say the additional campaigning and spending at the presidential level marks a break from the 2016 and 2020 cycles — when Democratic contenders for the White House largely ignored the district — and will benefit Vargas downballot. 'This is the year,' the strategist said. 'Unlike other years where many didn't think the presidential race would come down to maybe one electoral vote, I think everyone realizes it’s a possibility and is acting accordingly. And as a consequence of that, you're seeing a lot of Dem investments out there.' Election handicappers say the ascension of Harris to the top of the ticket is also a factor, since it’s likely to boost turnout of Black and other minority voters in Omaha. Outside spending has poured in to try to boost the Republican, with $10.7 million spent to either promote Bacon or oppose Vargas, according to OpenSecrets. On the other side, $6.8 million has been spent to support Vargas or oppose Bacon. New York-4: Anthony D’Esposito Rep. Anthony D'Esposito is another of the first-term New York Republicans at the top of the Democrats’ target list. Not only did Biden win the district by a whopping 14.5 percentage points in 2020, but D’Esposito has found himself embroiled in a late-campaign scandal after The New York Times reported in September he had an affair with a woman while engaged to his longtime fiancee, and then put the mistress on his congressional payroll. Such episodes are not unheard of on Capitol Hill. But in a region of New York where many voters are still humiliated by the numerous ethics and legal troubles surrounding former GOP Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from Congress last year, Democrats think the scandal will spark a voter backlash that will only help propel D’Esposito’s challenger, Laura Gillen, into Congress. 'It is a factor,' the strategist said. 'On Long Island, there is Santos scandal fatigue, and now D’Esposito is being dogged by his own scandals.' The race is a rematch of the 2022 contest, when D’Esposito defeated Gillen, an attorney and former town supervisor, by almost 4 percentage points. This time around, she’ll have Harris at the top of the ticket — a dynamic that’s expected to increase turnout among Black and other minority voters on Long Island to the benefit of Democrats. Gillen is also better funded this cycle. Democrats have flooded the district with outside spending, pouring $13 million into efforts opposing D'Esposito or supporting Gillen, according to OpenSecrets. Republicans have spent more than $5.7 million to oppose Gillen or boost the Republican congressman. Oregon-5: Lori Chavez-DeRemer Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the first GOP woman to represent Oregon in the House, has spent her two years on Capitol Hill fighting to build a reputation as a moderate voice within the heavily conservative GOP conference. Democrats, however, see her as particularly vulnerable on an issue of outsize prominence this cycle: abortion, where she’s wavered between vows to oppose any bans on federal funding for the procedure, and voting to do just that when legislation hit the floor. Democrats are hoping that track record will repel voters in Oregon’s 5th District, which includes the suburbs of both Portland and Salem, while boosting the Democratic challenger, Janelle Bynum, an Oregon state House member. Fueling their optimism, Biden won the district in 2020 by 8.9 points. Fueling it further, 2024 is the first presidential cycle since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. With that in mind, Democratic operatives maintain the abortion issue will overwhelm the GOP efforts to tie Democrats, including Bynum, to Portland’s controversial liberal policies related to crime and immigration. 'This district is overwhelmingly, without question, pro-choice. And it is absolutely a huge deal in that part of the country — unequivocally so,' the strategist said. 'You cannot get elected in Oregon unless you're pro-choice. Which is why Chavez-DeRemer is trying so, so, so, so hard to cover up her anti-abortion views and her anti-abortion history and her anti-abortion votes.' Outside spending is relatively even in the race, with $10.8 million spent to support Bynum or oppose Chavez-DeRemer, and $10.4 million to support the Republican or oppose Bynum, according to OpenSecrets. California-13: John Duarte To know that first-term Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) is one of the most vulnerable members of the House GOP in the cycle, look back to the 2022 election, which he won by just 564 votes. Democrats believe Duarte will fare worse in a presidential year, particularly in a district where Biden had a nearly 11-point edge with voters in 2020. Democrats have the advantage in outside spending, with $11.4 million spent to oppose Duarte or support Democratic nominee Adam Gray, and $8.3 million spent to support Duarte or oppose Gray, according to OpenSecrets. Duarte has struck one of the most moderate tones in the House GOP on abortion, even saying he is 'pro-choice' despite not supporting codifying protections for abortion. But his Democratic opponent, a former member of the California State Assembly, has heavily attacked Duarte on abortion rights. Another major theme from Democrats is that in the agricultural district, Duarte has nothing to show on immigration reform — an issue that resonates loudly in a region where migrant workers are a crucial part of the economy. Democrats also think the chaotic House GOP majority, which endured two drawn-out battles for Speaker and numerous intraparty fights, helped Duarte from getting meaningful wins. Arizona-1: David Schweikert Democrats have long been hoping to capture Rep. David Schweikert’s (R-Ariz.) district that includes the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, which has been trending blue. Biden won the district by 1.5 percentage points in 2020. This year might be the one where it catches up to the unapologetically conservative Schweikert, who was first elected to Congress as part of the 2010 Tea Party wave. Outside spending on the Democratic side has topped $11.6 million to either oppose Schweikert or support his Democratic challenger, Amish Shah, compared to more than $9.6 million to support the Republican or oppose Shah, according to OpenSecrets. Democrats hope the extra efforts being put into Arizona due to the competitive open Senate seat, and the fact it is a swing state, will also make a difference in the House race, running up the score to help Shah, a physician and former state representative. 'The district is trending blue and fast growing with a lot of new residents,' the strategist said. 'And eventually, all these new folks who are coming in who are blue-leaning are realizing, 'Wait a minute, I don't really want to vote for an anti-choice Republican who's been there 14 years.'' California-27: Mike Garcia Second-term Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) represents a district north of Los Angeles that swung for Biden by 12.4 points in 2020, making him a prime target for Democrats. His Democratic challenger, George Whitesides, was the first CEO of Virgin Galactic and was chief of staff of NASA during the Obama administration — a business-friendly resume that could blunt some of the GOP attacks on Biden and Democrats as the drivers of inflation. The broader political environment within the Golden State could also work to Whitesides’s favor. Because California is solidly Democratic statewide, much of the grassroots and donor enthusiasm has been directed at the handful of competitive congressional races, the Democratic strategist said. 'There are no other competitive races other than these congressional seats,' the strategist said. '[Democratic Senate candidate Adam] Schiff doesn't have a competitive seat. It's California, it's going to go Harris. Volunteers are looking at their local House race to engage, because that's where the action is right now.' Republicans have put about $11 million into outside spending to support Garcia or tear down Whitesides, while outside Democratic groups have spent $10.5 million to support the challenger or oppose Garcia, according to OpenSecrets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/7-house-seats-democrats-think-they-can-flip/	2024-10-28T06:41:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/7-possible-flips-dems_brooks-lillis_illo_SamanthaWong-GregNash.jpg?w=900
Michigan could play pivotal role in presidential election	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris has her eyes on Michigan as she and former president Donald Trump blitz swing states in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign cycle. The race is poised for a tossup in six states, Decision Desk HQ data suggests. Michigan — part of a so-called blue wall along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — could be especially important. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters The midwestern state is home to 15 electoral votes and has favored Democrats in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. Trump, however, led the state by 0.2%, in 2016, contributing to the Electoral College victory that carried him to the White House. Decision Desk HQ models as of Monday predict Harris has a 57% chance of winning the key state. How has Michigan voted in previous elections? Nov. 5 will mark Trump’s third presidential election as the GOP nominee. The presidential race was close in both of his previous bids in 2016 and 2020. Trump garnered 47.5% of Michigan votes and narrowly defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, who claimed 47.3% of votes. President Joe Biden flipped the script in 2020 and defeated Trump by about 150,000 votes. Comedian calls Puerto Rico ‘island of garbage’ at Trump rally Key Michigan counties Washtenaw County is home to the University of Michigan just west of Detroit in Anabor, where Harris is campaigning Monday. The Harris campaign has invested significant time and money visiting college campuses to energize younger voters. Washtenaw County voters overwhelmingly favored Democratic presidential candidates in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Wayne County, where Detroit is located, also encompasses Dearborn. The city of about 110,000 people is home to the country’s largest Arab American population. Most voters in Wayne County also favored Biden and Clinton in the previous two presidential elections.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/michigan-2024-presidential-race-kamala-harris-donald-trump/	2024-10-28T06:08:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.10.png?w=900
Violent threats against poll workers increasing ahead of election	(NewsNation) — With just one week until the 2024 election, cities across the U.S. are beefing up security at polling places, driven by a troubling increase in threats directed toward election workers. Local governments have coordinated with law enforcement to ensure safe voting and implement new security measures at polling locations. A visible police presence, installing cameras and training poll workers on how to handle disruptive individuals are just a few steps being taken. The 2024 election is major source of stress: Survey Poll workers face violence, threats The violence and threats against poll workers have already begun. Jesse Lutzenberger, 63, was arrested last Thursday after he was accused of assaulting a 69-year-old election worker in San Antonio, Texas. Lutzenberger was asked to remove his cap, which showed support for former President Donald Trump, while walking through a polling place. He cast his vote and then put his hat on before leaving the place, according to Bexar’s County Sheriff Javier Salazar. As Lutzenberger was leaving, the voting clerk told him to take off his hat as it is illegal to sport clothing supporting a candidate inside a polling area under Texas law. Lutzenberger then allegedly threw an arm or elbow back at the clerk, and then turned and threw several punches right at the victim's face, Salazar said. The 69-year-old election worker suffered some 'marks' on his face but no life-threatening injuries, Salazar said Friday. The sheriff said that Lutzenberger was arrested following the incident and taken to Bexar County jail. Incidents such as this are what have the safety of polling places around the country on the top of voters' minds. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Increasing election security measures In Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, election workers installed a bullet-proof protective covering inside the polling site windows. People can see outside the building, but cannot see inside. They said the move was taken after recommendations made to the county by federal security experts. 'We invited Homeland Security to come in and access the building. They did, and this is one of the suggestions,' County manager Romilda Crocamo said about the bulletproof protector. Luzerne County, where Wilkes-Barre is located, has implemented several other security measures, including adding a low barrier of large rocks surrounding the county building. The county has faced multiple threats during past elections and has taken extra security measures to ensure voter safety. Emily Cook, the director of the Luzerne County's Bureau of Elections, has also reportedly received several threats through social media and in person. The county voted in favor of Trump during the 2016 and 2020 elections, facing election controversy in the past when several absentee ballots were discarded in 2020. Those ballots were eventually recovered and counted.

Trump's Madison Square Garden rally: 5 takeaways	Former President Trump on Sunday held a rally at Madison Square Garden, kicking off the final full week of campaigning in the heart of Manhattan. The Trump campaign trotted out a number of high profile speakers to excite the crowd. And while Trump is unlikely to be competitive in New York on Election Day, the event served as a way to generate significant media attention and deliver something akin to a closing message to voters. But some of the earlier speakers overshadowed the event with their incendiary rhetoric. Here are five takeaways. Trump’s closing message sounds familiar The former president’s Madison Square Garden rally was billed as the opening salvo of his closing argument to voters just nine days before Election Day. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters There were signs of a closing message scattered throughout Trump’s speech. He opened his remarks by asking attendees if they were better off than they were four years ago. 'On issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it. And we’re going to fix it,' Trump said later as supporters seated behind the stage waved signs that read, 'Trump Will Fix It.' But those looking for a clearer, more concise message heard more of the same from Trump as he repeated many of his same attacks on Vice President Harris’s intelligence, described the U.S. as an 'occupied country' because of the surge in immigration at the southern border and emphasized his plans to impose tariffs on foreign imports and companies that outsource production. The former president repeated many of the same anecdotes he tells at other rallies, including one about watching a SpaceX launch and another claiming New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges for speaking out about the surge in migrants in the city. Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City rally Trump brings out high profile allies Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, billionaire Elon Musk, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), Donald Trump Jr., Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Hulk Hogan and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) were among those who took the stage ahead of the former president. Former first lady Melania Trump made an extremely rare campaign appearance, delivering brief remarks and introducing her husband. The slew of speakers are unlikely to win over voters on the fence, but their presence on the trail could boost enthusiasm among Trump’s base and among less reliable voting blocs, such as young men. Musk and Carlson in particular have become popular with Trump’s base and have had a more active role on the trail in the closing weeks of the campaign. 'This is a real election battle. So you need to get friends and families to vote. Make sure they vote. Vote early. This is important,' said Musk, who basked in the adoration of the crowd. Carlson spoke at a Trump rally in Georgia last week and will host an event with the former president in Arizona on Thursday. Musk has backed a major super PAC working on get out the vote efforts for the Trump campaign, spending millions on the effort. He has also campaigned in the key battleground of Pennsylvania, even as some of his efforts to register swing state voters have drawn legal scrutiny. Harris stumps in Philadelphia 9 days out from Election Day Guest speakers stir controversy The parade of guest speakers who preceded Trump seemed intent on creating controversial headlines for the party, hurling racist and sexist insults. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by Kill Tony, delivered a set that included inflammatory attacks on Puerto Ricans. 'There’s a lot going on. Like I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,' Hinchcliffe said, eliciting mixed reactions from the crowd. Harris campaign aides noted that Hinchcliffe's remarks came as the vice president was in Philadelphia speaking at a Puerto Rican restaurant, where she detailed her plans to assist the island and bolster its electrical grid. Others noted the key battleground of Pennsylvania is home to hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans. Carlson mocked Harris’s racial identity. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters Sid Rosenberg, a New York City radio host whose show Trump calls into periodically, blasted Democrats in derogatory and explicit terms. 'She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton. What a sick son of a bitch,' he said of the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee. 'The whole fucking party. A bunch of degenerates.' One speaker described Harris as 'the devil' and 'the antichrist.' Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani spent a portion of his remarks fear-mongering about Palestinians, saying they are taught to 'kill us at 2 years old' and are 'on the side of the terrorists.' 'Usually pre-game speeches matter little. Pretty remarkable Trump’s MSG warm up acts are all creating controversy and content that will hurt him,' senior Harris campaign aide David Plouffe posted on X. 'And that’s before his Soviet style speech that will generate much material of concern to the remaining undecided voters.' When will next COVID surge start? Experts weigh in Trump repeats ‘enemy from within’ attack The former president has drawn backlash from Democrats in recent weeks as he has repeatedly labeled his political rivals the 'enemy from within' and suggested his opponents are worse than foreign adversaries. On Sunday, Trump defended and repeated that line. 'When I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy. Becomes a soundbite – ‘Oh how can he say…,’' Trump said. 'No, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we’re fighting.' He later disparaged the press as the 'enemy of the people.' Trump has used the line repeatedly in recent weeks, including in an interview with Fox News when he suggested the military could be used to quell protests from his critics. Those comments have been at the center of criticism from some of his former top White House aides and from the Harris campaign. The former president’s insistence on using such harsh attacks against his critics come as some Republicans have claimed Democrats are going too far with their rhetoric by labeling Trump a fascist. DOD lacked paperwork for $1.1B in Ukraine aid: Inspector general Another tax proposal Trump rolled out one new policy, and it is one that echoed something first proposed by his opponent. 'I am announcing a new policy today that I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one. It's about time that they were recognized,' Trump said. Harris earlier this month introduced a new plan to expand Medicare benefits so that the program covers the costs of long-term home care for older Americans. The plan is aimed at helping the 'sandwich generation' who are caring for both their own children and their aging parents. Trump has previously called for eliminating taxes on tipped wages, overtime and Social Security benefits, though some experts have questioned how Trump would pay for those tax cuts without expanding the deficit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-madison-square-garden-rally/	2024-10-27T18:49:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/donald-melania-trump-nyc-ap.jpg?w=900
Harris stumps in Philadelphia 9 days out from Election Day	Vice President Harris rallied voters in Philadelphia on Sunday as the race between her and former President Trump grows tighter nine days out from Election Day. Harris largely stuck to her stump speech in nearly 15 minute remarks from downtown Philadelphia, urging voters in battleground Pennsylvania to head to the polls. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'There is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days,' Harris told the crowd. Harris gave a special shoutout to young voters, in particular, praising them for their political activism on climate, gun control and abortion access. 'Is Gen Z in the house?' the vice president said. 'You are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient. You, who have only known the climate crisis — you are leaders in what we need to do to protect our planet.' 'You, who grew up with active shooter drills,' she continued. 'You, who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, understand the importance of fighting for the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.' Harris spent Sunday campaigning throughout the city, which will play a critical role in Democratic turnout within the battleground state. Earlier in the day, Harris visited West Philadelphia where she spoke at the Church of Christian Compassion, a Black church in the neighborhood, and visited a local barbershop. The vice president also made stops at a bookstore specializing in Black history, and a Puerto Rican restaurant. Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City rally 'Philadelphia is a very important part of our path to victory,' Harris told reporters. 'It’s the reason I have been spending time here.' Pennsylvania will likely play a consequential role in the election with its 19 Electoral College votes. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average shows a razor thin race, with Trump narrowly leading nationally, 48.5 percent to 48.3 percent. While Harris spent Sunday in Philadelphia, Trump was preparing to stump at Manhattan’s Madison Square Garden. The event is expected to draw thousands of supporters in deep blue New York City, including a number of Republican lawmakers. While New York City is considered a Democratic stronghold, it is home to a massive media market and in relatively close proximity to a handful of competitive House races.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-philadelphia/	2024-10-27T17:51:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kamala-harris-philadelphia-rally-oct-27-ap.jpg?w=900
Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City ral...	Former first lady Melania Trump made an exceedingly rare appearance Sunday on the campaign trail when she delivered remarks at her husband's rally in New York City. The former first lady was not listed among the expected speakers publicized by the Trump campaign, but she introduced her husband at the Madison Square Garden event. She spoke for less than 5 minutes, arguing the country was dealing with a decline in quality of life. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'Let us charge together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let’s seize this moment and create a country for tomorrow — the future that we deserve,' Melania Trump said. She stood on stage and embraced former President Trump as he arrived for his speech. The former first lady has hardly attended any public campaign events with her husband. The Madison Square Garden event was the first rally she has appeared at during this cycle, and she attended the Republican National Convention in July, though she did not speak. The first lady hosted two fundraisers for the LGBTQ group Log Cabin Republicans this year: one at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and another in New York City. The former model made waves earlier this month when she wrote in her memoir about her support for abortion access and for women to make choices about their bodies 'based on their own convictions.' Democrats have hammered the 45th president on the issue of abortion, blaming him and his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices for the end of Roe v. Wade. Donald Trump said he told his wife that she should follow her heart when writing about the topic in her memoir.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/melania-trump-new-york-city-rally-msg/	2024-10-27T17:49:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/melania-trump-nyc-ap.jpg?w=900
Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new policy platform for Puerto Rico on Sunday, targeting the Latino vote ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election through promises of economic development and improved disaster response. While residents of Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections despite being American citizens, the message was aimed at more than 5.8 million people of Puerto Rican origin living on the mainland who can vote, according to Pew Research Center. The announcement gained additional visibility when Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny shared Harris' video message on Instagram, highlighting her criticism of former President Donald Trump's response to Hurricane Maria in 2017. Couple recounts surviving Hurricane Helene on floating couch 'Throughout my career, I've always fought for the people of Puerto Rico,' Harris said in the video. 'Every chance he got, Donald Trump abandoned and insulted them.' Harris outlined several initiatives, including creating a Puerto Rico Opportunity Economy Task Force to foster economic growth and create thousands of new jobs. She also promised to accelerate disaster recovery funds and modernize the island's electrical grid, which still experiences daily outages. 'I will cut red tape to ensure disaster recovery funds are used quickly and effectively, and work with leaders across the island to ensure all Puerto Ricans have access to reliable, affordable electricity,' Harris said. The video release follows Harris' March 22 visit to Puerto Rico, where she toured hurricane recovery efforts. During the five-hour visit, Harris visited a rebuilt home in Canovanas that Hurricane Maria had destroyed. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters 'I see we are making a difference. There is still more work to do,' Harris said during the visit, noting that the federal government has provided about $3 billion for reliable energy sources, including rooftop solar panels. The visit wasn't without controversy. A small group of protesters gathered in San Juan to demonstrate against Puerto Rico's territorial status and demand a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanted 'Yankee, go home!' while supporters responded with chants of 'U.S.A.!'

New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ imm...	New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) on Sunday defended Vice President Harris’s support for the bipartisan border legislation and pushed back on the suggestion that she was upsetting both poles of the party by sidestepping difficult issues on the topic. In an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday,' Chris Stirewalt asked Grisham whether Harris's lack of response on whether she would continue building a border wall—coupled with her push for a conservative bipartisan border bill—has managed to push away voters from both extremes of the party. Michigan Republican: Trump ‘has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community’ 'I don't think that she is stuck. I think we've gotten stuck largely driven, frankly, by the Republican Party, and when the Republicans were in the majority,' Grisham said about whether Harris is stuck between these two dissatisfied groups. The border governor, also a Harris surrogate, said the vice president is not ruling out the possibility of doing more to improve immigration and border security by supporting the bill that never made it through Congress this past term. 'She is not eliminating the possibility that it could be bolder and bigger on either side of that equation,' Grisham said, 'protecting the people who are here, the folks who have followed the laws of this country once they got here, kids who knew no other country other than this one, than their own and their families, and also curbing illegal immigration at the border by creating upstream opportunities for getting visas and asylum protections.' 'That's smart, and I want the border security smart border security,' she said. 'That's what every border state governor wants.' New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority Grisham was asked about Harris’s response to reporters, who pushed the Democratic nominee to answer whether construction of a southern border wall would continue in her administration. 'I will tell you that my highest priority is to put the resources into ensuring that our border is secure, which is why I've been very clear I'm going to bring back up as president that bipartisan border security bill and make sure that it is brought to my desk so I can sign it into law,' Harris said in response this past week, in a clip that Stirewalt played on the show.

Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) said on Sunday the Muslim community in Michigan trusts former President Trump over Vice President Harris to guide Middle East policy. 'For the people of the state of Michigan, actions speak louder than words. I was just at a rally yesterday with former President Trump, and I can share with you, he has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community, and it's because they want peace in the Middle East,' McClain said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority 'And they trust him much more as a leader than they ever would under Vice President Harris,' she continued. Stirewalt noted Trump has supported military action by Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem during his administration. He asked McClain whether she thinks the issue 'comes down to' whether 'they like his leadership vibe better.' 'I think they like the fact that under President Trump, there was peace in the Middle East. There weren't wars that were raging. We didn't have any Americans held hostage in the Middle East like we do now under this Harris and Biden administration,' she responded. 'That's what they liked.' New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ immigration legislation Muslim and Arab Americans have pushed the Democratic ticket to take further steps to hold Israel accountable for Palestinian deaths stemming from its war with Hamas and other Iranian proxy groups in the region. A recent poll showed Trump leading Harris nationally among Arab American and Muslim voters, by 4 points, amid criticism of the Biden administration’s support for Israel.

Comedian calls Puerto Rico ‘island of garbage’ at Trump rally	(The Hill, NewsNation) — A speaker at former President Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday spent a portion of his time attacking Puerto Rico, drawing backlash from Democrats and the Harris campaign. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by Kill Tony, delivered a set to the crowd ahead of the former president’s speech. 'There’s a lot going on. Like, I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,' Hinchcliffe said, eliciting mixed reactions from the crowd. At another point, Hinchcliffe said Latinos 'love making babies.' Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They c** inside. Just like they did to our country,' he said. Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement that Hinchcliffe’s 'joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' The remarks, particularly about Puerto Rico, were swiftly condemned by Democrats, as well as some Republicans. 'As a Puerto Rican, I am tempted to call Hinchcliffe racist garbage but doing so would be an insult to garbage,' Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) posted on the social platform X. 'When casting their ballots at the voting booth, Latinos should never forget the racism that Donald Trump seems all too willing to platform.' Harris campaign aides noted Hinchcliffe’s remarks came as Vice President Harris was in Philadelphia speaking at a Puerto Rican restaurant, where she detailed her plans to assist the island and bolster its electrical grid. Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally: 5 takeaways Other Democrats pointed out that hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans live in Pennsylvania, which is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds on Election Day. 'Who wants to tell these guys there are ~ HALF A MILLION Puerto Ricans living in Battleground PA, whose votes are up for grabs?' Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House official who is an outspoken critic of the former president, posted on the social platform X. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who is up for reelection in November, said Hinchcliffe’s comments were 'not funny' and 'not true.' 'Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans! I’ve been to the island many times. It’s a beautiful place. Everyone should visit!' Scott posted on X. 'I will always do whatever I can to help any Puerto Rican in Florida or on the island.' Former Puerto Rico governor demands Trump denounce comments Former Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló on 'NewsNation Prime' called on Trump to denounce 'egregious' and 'insulting' comments made by the comedian. 'We were just called garbage in Madison Square Garden, no less, the home state of over a million Puerto Ricans,' said Rosselló, who currently serves as a congressional delegate. 'This is egregious. It's insulting, and it will cost President Trump if he does not address this.' Rosselló emphasized Puerto Rico's contributions to the United States, noting the territory has one of the highest per capita military participation rates in the nation. He called the island 'an incubator that generates innovation and art' with a legacy of patriotism. 'If you do not denounce this strongly, this is what you're saying, this is what you're supporting,' Rosselló said, urging Trump to use his social media platforms to 'reject the statement of a comedian then recall his love for the people of Puerto Rico.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-rally-puerto-rico-garbage/	2024-10-27T14:35:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/puertorico_051922_ap_ricardoarguengo.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump, Vance rally New Yorkers at Madison Square Gard...	Former President Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) are campaigning in New York City on Sunday, holding an event at the iconic Madison Square Garden. The event is expected to draw thousands to the arena at the center of deep-blue Manhattan. Others expected to make an appearance include the former president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr., former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, billionaire Elon Musk, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.). It’s extremely unlikely Trump will win the state, which hasn’t backed a GOP presidential candidate since 1984. With just over a week until Election Day, The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of early polls shows Vice President Harris with a sizable lead over the GOP nominee — 58 percent to 40.2 percent — in the Empire State. The rally is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House maj...	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Democrats are going all-in on efforts to flip New York’s 4th Congressional District blue, funneling big names and money into the Long Island locale with hopes that a victory could help usher in a Democratic House majority next year. The district, which sits on the South Shore of Long Island, holds the title of most Democratic-leaning district currently represented by a Republican. The area broke for President Biden by 14.6 percentage points in 2020. But in 2022, Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito beat Democrat Laura Gillen for the district’s open House seat by 3.6 points, putting the liberal bastion in GOP hands for the first time in more than two decades. This year's race — one of the most competitive this cycle — is a rematch between D’Esposito and Gillen, a take-two showdown that has drawn outsize attention, and fundraising, on the national stage. In a sign of its importance, the top three House Democrats — Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — have visited to campaign with Gillen this month, while House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) recently made a stop for D’Esposito. Democrats need to net four seats to take control of the chamber next year, and Jeffries — speaking at a rally for Gillen in a packed Hempstead gymnasium — said the race is key to that effort. Early voting began Saturday in New York. 'No pressure on y'all,' Jeffries said. 'But one of four seats that we need to win.' Gillen is leading D’Esposito 53 percent to 41 percent among likely voters in a new Newsday/Siena College poll, with less than a month to go until Election Day. The margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. Money and turnout could swing race The race is one of 75 House rematches from 2022, according to Ballotpedia. And this time around, both candidates say the contest is different. Gillen, a former Hempstead town supervisor, told The Hill during a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office that additional resources, an earlier campaign launch and reverberations from the 2022 Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade are fueling her optimism this cycle. 'I didn’t have the resources to communicate at the level I’d like to to talk to women about what the Dobbs decision really meant, even if you live in a blue state. And also to talk about other issues that people care about,' said Gillen, seated next to Clark. 'In this race, I worked really hard, I got in early, I got the runway I needed to raise the resources to communicate to all the folks in this district at the levels I’d like,' she added. Gillen has also significantly outraised D’Esposito throughout the race: The Democrat has raked in nearly $5.69 million thus far, with D’Esposito trailing at $4.24 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The numbers mark a staggering increase from 2020, when Gillen brought in $1.83 million to D’Esposito’s $1.33 million. D’Esposito’s fundraising deficit is even larger when assessing outside spending. House Majority PAC, the fund associated with Jeffries, has spent $5.43 million on the race, while the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is endorsed by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), has funneled just $3.35 million into the rematch. In an interview with The Hill at Hempstead Town Hall, D’Esposito — after an hour-plus town hall with roughly a dozen veterans — pointed to his cash disadvantage when asked if this year’s race feels different from his 2022 match-up, and attributed it to the national Democratic Party. 'It’s the fact that Hakeem Jeffries wants to be Speaker of the House, and he wants it to run through New York,' D’Esposito said. 'And quite frankly, he should have chose someone else, because Nassau County is not gonna allow a liberal Laura Gillen to take this seat.' While the candidates cited the money game when discussing the difference between now and 2022, Jeffries had a different theory in mind: voter turnout. Republicans crushed Democrats in turnout in 2022. Of the 250,142 registered Democrats in the district, only 130,871 cast a ballot for Gillen — a 52.32 percent turnout. In contrast, of the 168,934 registered Republicans in the district, 140,622 came out in support of D’Esposito — an 83.24 percent turnout. Jeffries — during his gaggle with reporters after Gillen’s rally — said he is focused on turning out the Democratic vote this cycle, which will lead the party to victory in November. 'There were 100,000 Democrats who stayed home during the midterm elections in 2022,' Jeffries said, standing below a scoreboard in the gymnasium with the home score set to 11, the guest score at 5, and 20:24 as the time — an homage to Election Day. 'We’re going to make sure that those Democrats come out to vote, and when they do, it’ll ensure that Laura Gillen is elected the next congressperson from the 4th Congressional district.' Candidates moderate on immigration, abortion The purple nature of the district — Cook Political Report rates the race a 'toss-up' — has encouraged both candidates to moderate their stances on a number of hot-button issues. Gillen has taken the issue of immigration head-on, sending a letter to President Biden recommending executive action pertaining to the border and cutting an ad that directly addresses the matter. D’Esposito, meanwhile, has worked to present himself as a moderate on the issue of reproductive rights. Gillen’s immigration strategy mimics that of Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who leaned into the issue during his successful campaign to replace ousted Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.). 'I’m Laura Gillen, and I’m here at the border — of Nassau County,' she says in the ad. 'We’re 2,000 miles from Mexico, but we’re feeling the migrant crisis almost every day. So I want you to hear me loud and clear: You send me to Congress, I will work with anyone in any party to secure our southern border, lock up criminals pushing fentanyl and stop the migrant crisis.' Gillen told The Hill the issue of immigration is 'an issue that people in my district care about very much' before criticizing both parties for the 'lack of political will' to tackle it. Colleen Ryan, a D’Esposito supporter, mentioned immigration when asking a question at the incumbent’s town hall focused on veterans' issues. Afterward, she called the influx of migrants a 'problem.' 'I support immigration,' Ryan told The Hill. 'It is the problem with illegal immigration, and they are being transported around the country and they have a disregard for the law of the land. And that’s demoralizing. … I’m absolutely for Anthony D’Esposito stopping the lawbreaking.' If immigration has been a leading issue for Republicans, women’s reproductive rights has been a top issue for Democrats, with the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022 continuing to motivate liberal voters across the country. During a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office, Gillen and Clark sought to paint D’Esposito as extreme when it comes to the issue of abortion, arguing he would sign a nationwide ban on the procedure and knocking him for calling it a 'state issue.' D’Esposito, however, has strongly rejected that interpretation. He told The Hill that he would never sign a nationwide abortion ban, touted his part in keeping an appropriations bill off the House floor that would have restricted access to the abortion pill mifepristone, and named bills he has co-sponsored that protect in vitro fertilization. 'When it comes to abortion, I have been a champion of women’s rights,' he said. Helene Spierman, a Gillen supporter who has lived in the district for 25 years, listed women’s reproductive rights as a top issue for her this cycle. 'That everybody has a voice and that people are created equal and that the government has got to trust that,' she said. 'I could say that it’s abortion, I could say that it’s the Constitution, I could say that it’s not going back to the 17th century, the 18th century, when the Constitution was written.' September surprise threatens to shake up race While those issues — and others — have dominated the campaign, a September surprise is threatening to shake up the race. The New York Times published a bombshell report last month alleging D’Esposito, shortly after being sworn into the House, hired his longtime fiancée’s daughter and a woman he was having an affair with. D’Esposito has repeatedly denied engaging in any wrongdoing and claimed he has abided by ethical standards throughout his tenure in Congress. He told The Hill the story was 'a political hit piece' and said he is 'absolutely not' concerned about backlash from the report on Election Day. That response, however, is not putting the story to bed. The Times report was the subject of the first question at the N.Y.-4 debate earlier this month, putting D’Esposito on the defensive out of the gate. He reiterated his denial, before reading off a number of headlines from right-leaning outlets calling Gillen’s ethics into question. Gillen, for her part, has leaned into the allegations against D’Esposito in the final stretch of the election. She referenced the report during her rally in Hempstead alongside Jeffries, and she tore into his alleged 'abuse of power' during an interview with The Hill. The Times report is likely to be a mainstay of Gillen’s final pitch to voters, in addition to her message on the economy, state and local taxes, immigration and women’s reproductive rights — an all-encompassing campaign trail blitz as Democrats look to reclaim the coveted seat after the crushing loss last cycle. 'A setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback,' Jeffries said at his rally with Gillen. 'We had a setback in 2022. Are we ready for a comeback?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/new-york-rematch-could-hold-key-to-democratic-quest-for-house-majority/	2024-10-27T14:02:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GillenLaura_102424ap.jpg?w=900
Crowd waits outside Madison Square Garden hours ahead of Donald T...	MANHATTAN, N.Y. (PIX11) -- Around eight hours before Donald Trump's campaign rally starts, a crowd has already amassed outside Madison Square Garden Sunday morning. The rally is expected to kick off around 5 p.m., but roads were already closed around the stadium early Sunday morning, and security was in place. The crowd was allowed into Madison Square Garden starting around 12 p.m. Yamamoto, Freeman lead Dodgers to 4-2 win over Yankees, 2-0 Series lead A crowd waiting outside Madison Square Garden hours ahead of a Donald Trump campaign rally. (PIX11 News) Before 8 a.m. Sunday, huge crowds of supporters in American flag and Trump merch lined the block around the venue. 'There's a lot of energy, people are very sleep-deprived, everyone woke up really early, but it doesn't matter people are so hyped up,' said Greenpoint resident Anthony Filipelli. 'Regardless if you support him or not, this event is just an iconic American event.' Trump will be accompanied by a host of high-profile speakers at Sunday's rally, including his running mate Sen. JD Vance, Rudy Giuliani, former presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his kids. Elon Musk is also expected to appear at Sunday's rally. One person, Michael Barbuzze told PIX11 News he had been at the venue since 5 a.m. 'I definitely am excited, I really wanted to see him,' one person in line told PIX11 News. 'I'm here to show solidarity. ... He calls it like he sees it.' Counter-protesters are expected to demonstrate at Sunday's rally, including billboard trucks and a town hall organized by the Lincoln Project. Organizers with Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice also planned to protest the event. When the rally was announced, local elected official Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal called for it to be canceled. 'This is a disastrous decision by Madison Square Garden that will endanger the public safety of New Yorkers and has the potential to incite widespread violence,' Hoylman-Sigal said in a post to X. Other elected officials, like Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, celebrated the rally. 'The Garden is the world’s biggest stage and the perfect forum for President Trump,' she said. A rally for Trump on Long Island in September drew huge crowds that camped out overnight and throughout the day of the rally. The following streets are expected to be closed Sunday for the Donald Trump rally: 33rd Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 32nd Street between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue 31st Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 30th Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue Seventh Avenue will be closed to pedestrians from 34th to 29th Street This is a developing story.

Walz, AOC to play Madden on Twitch in an appeal to young men	Vice President Harris's running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) are set to play Madden NFL together on the live-streaming platform Twitch on Sunday. The announcement comes as the Harris campaign seeks to court young male voters, a voting bloc that former President Trump seems to be leading with in the polls. The Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll found that the gender gap among youth supporters of Harris and Trump more than doubled since the spring, growing from 8 percentage points in the spring, when President Biden was the Democratic nominee, to 20 points now, with Harris as the party’s candidate. Polling has also shown the Democratic nominee trailing behind Trump among male voters in key swing states. A CNN/SSRS poll from September showed Trump leading Harris among likely male voters in Pennsylvania by 15 points — 55 percent to 40 percent — and Harris leading Trump among female voters in the state by 11 points — 53 percent to 42 percent. The survey of likely voters in Nevada showed Trump with an 18-point lead among male voters, 57 percent to 39 percent, while Harris had a 16-point lead among female voters, 55 percent to 39 percent. The campaign has used Twitch to attract younger voters in the past, even using the platform, along with TikTok, YouTube and more than a dozen digital services, to stream the Democratic National Convention in August. This announcement also comes amid a series of ads on Yahoo Sports and DraftKings — platforms with predominantly male audiences — launched by the Harris campaign last week specifically aimed at winning over young male voters. Earlier this month, some Democrats expressed worry that Harris is struggling to engage men in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. 'She has a problem with men for the same reason Hillary Clinton did: because misogyny exists, as do outdated ideas about who should hold the presidency,' Democratic strategist Christy Setzer told The Hill earlier this month. 'Meanwhile, Trump has doubled down on this ‘strongman’ machismo and dictator’s act, playing ‘It’s a Man’s World’ at his rallies.' Clinton lost the male vote to Trump in 2016 by 11 points, 41 percent to 52 percent, while she won the female vote by 13 points, 54 percent to 41 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/walz-aoc-to-play-madden-on-twitch-in-an-appeal-to-young-men/	2024-10-27T13:06:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/OcasioCortezAlexandria_AOC.jpg?w=900
Tropical disturbance 'likely to develop' this week, NHC says	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Although we're nearing the end of hurricane season next month, the tropics are still active and popping up with disturbances. A new system has formed in the Caribbean that is 'likely to develop' sometime this week, according to the National Hurricane Center. All hands on deck as Florida recovers abandoned boats after Helene and Milton In the 8 a.m. ET update on Sunday, the disturbance shows a 30% chance for development over the next seven days. The NHC said gradual development is possible through the end of the week, as it moves northward or northeastward over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The system first popped up on Saturday afternoon with a 20% chance over the course of seven days. Earlier this month, the Caribbean region was impacted by Tropical Storm Oscar, which made landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane before disintegrating as it headed toward the Bahamas.

Driving the vote: Nebraska's electoral system divides voters	(NewsNation) — Omaha, Nebraska, is punching far above its weight class politically thanks to a unique way of assigning electoral votes that could play a key role in the upcoming election. Omaha is the home of Kool-Aid, the frozen TV dinner and Marlon Brando, the epicenter of baseball and a city with history. During World War II, a Japanese balloon bomb exploded in the air just a few miles from what is now Charles Schwab Field. Driving the vote: Ohio voters swapping parties Nebraska has an unorthodox way of awarding presidential electors, departing from the winner-take-all model used by almost all states. Two of the state's electoral votes go to the statewide winner and the winner in each congressional district gets one elector. Now, Nebraska is a reliably red state, but its 2nd Congressional District, which includes Omaha, can and does go blue. That's earned it the nickname the 'blue dot.' The importance of Omaha isn't lost on the campaigns, with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on the ground in the area early, a clue they both feel that it could be crucial in what is shaping up to be a nail-biter election. The oversized role of Nebraska's 2nd District has put the home of the College World Series in the spotlight for a very different reason. NewsNation brought together voters from the diverse district, where party lines prevailed when it came to how people felt about the system. Republicans want the state to go back to a winner-take-all system. 'I think it's us and Maine are the only two states that give up the congressional districts to separate them,' said Tony Connor. 'I think there should be consistency in every state. So I would like to see some consistency.' Driving the Vote: Will Black voters swing Pennsylvania for Trump? On the other side of the aisle, many Democrats like that the state legislature has stood up to GOP efforts to roll back Nebraska's system of awarding electors. 'I don't believe in winner-take-all. I don't think it matches the people's choice as well as it should,' said Jean Couchey. 'I think there's too many enclaves within the state that are not represented by that.' The district is not defined by being a blue dot alone. Where Interstate 80 runs just south of downtown, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats. 'We're on I-80. We're right in the middle of the country, and there's a lot of trafficking that comes right through her,' said Colleen Brennan. 'Human trafficking is a big problem. Drug trafficking is a huge problem.' One issue that sparks debate? Immigration. '[My] first language was Spanish,' said Dulce Sherman. 'I learned English. I'm successful. I mean, I'm the example that not all people that come from immigrants are bad people.' The diverse opinions reflect the bigger conversations across the nation. 'In many respects, this district becomes a microcosm of society,' said Randy Adkins. Adkins is a professor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, where he teaches campaigns and elections. He's happy to see the nation learning about how the Cornhusker State handles the race for the White House. Driving the vote: Illinois farmers feel forgotten in blue state 'I think it is unique. I think it is more democratic, with a small 'D,' in the sense that even the minority is represented somehow in the state, in the Electoral College vote, which doesn't happen in 48 out of 50 states,' he said. 'Or at least there's a possibility of that.' Like the rest of the nation, diverse views can, at times, result in heated debate, especially on controversial issues like abortion. 'My grandchildren, I want the ability for them to have a say in my body, my right to decide what I do with my body,' Dulce Sherman said. Another voter disagreed. 'It's not their body, it's not their choice,' said William Duerr. 'That body is a separate entity, a separate human being.' Still, the state has a strong sense of community bolstered by smart, civil discussion as voters cast their ballots to see exactly how Nebraska's unique electoral system will play out in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-vote-nebraska-electoral/	2024-10-27T10:26:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/Nebraska_2nddistrict_BidenTrump.jpg?w=900
Trump and Harris pledged to save Social Security. Here's what the...	(The Hill) — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both vowed to protect Social Security, but experts say both of their campaign platforms fall short of specific solutions for a program that faces threats to funding in roughly a decade. Recent estimates show not only would neither candidate’s agenda stave off the threat of insolvency — but that one’s proposals could worsen its budget outlook, absent ideas to tax or spending reforms to extend the lifetime of the program. Here’s some of what the candidates have said so far. Trump’s Social Security plans Trump drew attention during the summer by proposing eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits — one of a list of proposals aimed at providing tax relief to some Americans. However, experts have raised concerns about the costs of scrapping income taxes on Social Security checks and how it would impact the program’s finances. 'His proposal would have a significant financial impact on Social Security, because now, those income taxes that some beneficiaries pay account for about 4 percent of Social Security's revenues,' said Richard Johnson, senior fellow for the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Here’s what to do if you lose an absentee ballot before Election Day The combined trust funds for Social Security retirement and disability benefits are currently projected by the program’s trustees to run out in 2035, a year later than previously expected, after economic growth exceeded expectations last year. But under what Trump has proposed thus far, a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimated the program’s funds could run out by 2031 while increasing Social Security’s cash deficit by $2.3 trillion between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2035. A chunk of the cost comes from what the group identified as a roughly $950 billion price tag to eliminate income taxation of Social Security benefits. Trump’s campaign has come out strongly against the analysis, with its national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accusing the 'so-called experts' of being 'consistently wrong throughout the years.' 'President Trump delivered on his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare in his first term, and President Trump will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term,' Leavitt said. Leavitt said a second Trump administration would shore up Social Security funding by 'unleashing a new economic boom.' IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? Still, Trump’s agenda leaves experts guessing as to what changes he would support to shore up solvency for the program. In the official 2024 GOP policy platform highlighted on Trump’s campaign site, the plan calls for 'no cuts' to Social Security and Medicare, as well as 'no changes to the retirement age.' Harris on Social Security Harris’s online campaign page has vowed she will protect Social Security and 'strengthen' the program by 'making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes.' As part of the rollout for the proposed fiscal 2025 federal budget earlier this year, the Biden-Harris administration additionally outlined a pitch to extend solvency for the program by focusing on higher earners, noting that 'middle-class and lower-income Americans pay Social Security taxes on all of their earnings, but higher-income Americans do not.' Extra check coming to some Social Security recipients in November: Here’s why At the time, the White House said the president also opposed benefit cuts and proposals to privatize Social Security. But experts and budget hawks say the vice president’s agenda is still missing key details about her plans to shore up the program’s finances. In a statement Tuesday, Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said 'neither presidential candidate has addressed this challenge, and every year we fail to take action it only becomes more difficult to fix.' 'Overwhelming majorities of voters want candidates to prioritize solutions to strengthen Social Security, and the good news is that there are many available options to do just that,' he said, while also noting the program is 'less than a decade away from automatic, across-the-board cuts, putting many millions of current retirees at financial risk.' In the latest analysis by the CRFB, the group said Harris’s proposals 'would not have large effects on Social Security trust fund solvency.' Is this year’s COVID booster a good match for new variants? But polling has shown the program’s solvency is still one of importance for voters, with a recent poll out of the Peterson Foundation showing a vast majority of voters, 96 percent, say it’s important for 'candidates to have a plan to prevent automatic cuts to Social Security.' In their latest report over the summer, trustees projected the depletion date for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund, which pays out Social Security benefits to retirees, and the program’s smaller Disability Insurance Trust Fund, will be in 2035. Once the reserves of the OASI trust fund are depleted, the report projected that account income will only be able to cover roughly 80 percent of scheduled benefits for recipients. Experts say lawmakers will likely need to either agree to reductions on the benefits side, raising taxes, or both, to prevent automatic cuts to benefits for seniors if funds run out. Social Security announces 2.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2025 'The Social Security date has not changed much in probably the past decade, and yet, what we have seen is, with each presidential election, we’re getting closer and closer to that day of reckoning. And so we should become more and more urgent,' Johnson said. 'So, it's a little bit surprising that we haven't seen more specific proposals.' 'On the other hand, these proposals would involve some pain — either more taxes or lower benefits. And pain doesn't always win you votes,' he added. The Hill has reached out to Harris’s campaign for further comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-and-harris-pledged-to-save-social-security-heres-what-theyll-do/	2024-10-27T07:31:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24295819243226-e1729602526227_09e742-e1729713450753.jpg?w=800
Scrutiny over Sheehy’s military record grows in Montana Senate ra...	Intensifying scrutiny over businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy’s military record could shake up the Senate race in Montana, where Sheehy, the GOP candidate, is pulling away from Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in the polls. Sheehy, a decorated combat veteran, has been dogged for months by questions about a bullet wound he claimed he received during a firefight in Afghanistan after it came to light that a park ranger reported in 2015 that he shot himself accidentally in a parking lot at Glacier National Park. Sheehy now claims that he fabricated the story that he shot himself in the parking lot to explain to cover up for a fellow soldier whose bullet ricocheted into his arm during a skirmish in Afghanistan. Longtime observers of Montana politics say the late-breaking controversy of Sheehy’s military record could impact voters, though they question whether it’s enough to help Tester save his seat. 'It goes to credibility and from that standpoint it has the potential to impact the race,' said David McCumber, the former editor of The Montana Standard and the former regional editor for Lee Enterprises in central Montana. 'From what I hear and from reading accounts and ads, it’s clearly the topic of conversation,' he said, explaining that the question of credibility is 'where Sheehy is vulnerable with it.' 'He gets big points for being a decorated veteran. There’s no question about that,' he added, noting that Montana is home to many veterans who served in war. 'The default is that Sheehy is a veteran and deserves a lot of credit for that but I think this has the potential to undercut. It does deal with his military service and it doesn’t pass the smell test.' Sheehy served as a Navy SEAL officer in Iraq, Afghanistan, South America and the Pacific, earning a Bronze Star with Valor and a Purple Heart across dozens of engagements with enemy forces, according to his campaign website. Sheehy’s conflicting accounts of his arm injury was the subject of stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times earlier this month, but the issue is now getting more attention in Montana, where a group of military veterans supporting Tester this week demanded that Sheehy release his medical records. The Washington Post first broke the story that Sheehy told a park ranger in 2015 that he shot himself after dropping his revolver in a parking lot. The ranger, Kim Peach, told The New York Times in an interview: 'I am 100 percent sure he shot himself that day,' referring to the October 2015 incident that he responded to in Glacier. Peach says Sheehy told him at a hospital outside the park that his .45 caliber revolver discharged accidently after he dropped it, hitting him in the arm. Peach investigated the incident after a someone reported a shot being fired in a parking lot to the ranger station. In a written statement to the park service, Sheehy testified that 'while reloading our vehicle an improperly placed firearm kept in the vehicle for bear protection fell out and discharged into my right forearm.' Sheehy paid a $525 fine to settle the matter, as discharging a firearm in a national park is illegal. Sheehy’s lawyers told The Times that Sheehy did indeed sustain the wound in Afghanistan, but did not initially report the wound because he suspected it was caused by friendly fire. But when Sheehy went to the hospital nine years for an unrelated injury, doctors told him he needed to explain the bullet still embedded in his arm to law enforcement. The attorney said Sheehy made up the story of accidentally shooting himself to protect his former platoonmates and that any attempt to dispute his claim of being wounded in combat is 'tantamount to falsely accusing him of stolen valor.' Katie Martin, a spokesperson for the Sheehy campaign, said he 'served our nation with honor' and said attempts to raise questions about his character and military record were 'appalling.' 'Tim Sheehy humbly served our nation with honor and served alongside many heroes. Many of them never came home. Full stop. The bullet in Tim’s arm was a result of his service in Afghanistan. Tim never reported it because he didn’t want to trigger an investigation of his team, be pulled from the battlefield, and see a fellow teammate be punished,' Martin said. 'It was always about protecting a fellow team member of his unit he thought could have been responsible due to friendly fire ricochet in the heat of an engagement with the enemy,' the spokesperson added. 'To witness the media in cahoots with Jon Tester and his allies attempting to tear down a combat veteran’s record is appalling, and they should be ashamed of themselves. It shows just how desperate they are to win this U.S. Senate race. Jon Tester doesn’t care about veterans and their sacrifices; he only cares about another term in office.' Now Tester is pressing the issue in a new television ad highlighting skepticism about Sheehy’s claim that he was wounded in combat as he has described on the campaign trail. Tester ad shows a clip of Sheehy claiming 'I have a bullet stuck in this arm still from Afghanistan' juxtaposed with media reports that a national park ranger, Kim Peach, is certain Sheehy instead shot himself accidently. A new television ad was also launched this week by Senate Majority PAC, the Senate Democrats’ biggest super PAC, features a video clip of a former SEAL who trained with Sheehy contesting his one-time friend’s claim that he was shot in Afghanistan. 'Tim and I had about as close a working relationship in the platoon as possible. So when he says he took a bullet in the arm in Afghanistan, we all know it’s not true. We would have seen it, we would have heard about it,' said Dave Madden, the former SEAL who also shared his skepticism about Sheehy’s claim in an interview with The New York Times. NBC Montana, MTN News and other local media outlets have picked up on the story in recent days. Several military veterans supporting Tester held a press conference in Missoula Tuesday demanding that Sheehy release his medical records to help clear up the controversy. 'If Tim Sheehy really wants to tell Montanans the truth, he could come clean and release his medical records from the Kalispell hospital from that day in Glacier,' Jonas Rides At The Door, a Marine Corps combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served in Iraq, told The Daily Montanan. The Sheehy campaign responded Friday with its own television ad pushing back on Tester and others questioning his story of being shot in the arm during combat. 'Jon Tester is desperate and losing. Seen these Democrat lies?' the ad’s narrator says at the start of the ad, which labels the park ranger who blew the whistle on Sheehy 'a never Trumper.' Sheehy tells viewers 'I joined the Navy at 18, I met my wife in the military' and shares more details about his military service. He said he received the Purple Heart after 'being wounded by an IED' and a Bronze Star with Valor 'after carrying a wounded brother out of enemy fire.' He makes no mention of the bullet lodged in his arm, however. Martin said Sheehy got into the race 'to put our country first and won’t ever let any of this slander stop him from fighting every day as your next U.S. senator.' 'What Montanans know is that Tim Sheehy is an American Warrior who fought for our country and laid his life on the line for our freedoms. Anyone trying to take away from the fact that he signed up for war as a young man and spent most of his 20s in some of the most dangerous places in the world is either a partisan hack, a journalist with an agenda, or outright a disgusting person,' she said. Political handicappers have said that Sheehy, who is leading Tester in recent polls, is likely to win the race in a state that former President Trump carried by 16 points in 2020. But Democrats want to change the dynamics of the race in the final week by raising questions about his credibility and character. A group called Republicans for Tester has taken out full-page newspaper ads statewide next week accusing Sheehy of 'dishonesty about his service.' It features a blown-up image of the park ranger’s report of the shooting at Glacier and quotes from veterans criticizing the Republican candidate.

Unnamed pro athlete stopped assault at 2022 Diddy party: Lawsuit	(NewsNation) — A professional athlete stopped a drunken Sean 'Diddy' Combs from sexually assaulting a 'luxury car businessman' at a party in 2022, a lawsuit obtained by the New York Post alleges. The alleged victim said Diddy invited him into a private office during a launch party for the music mogul's Ciroc vodka brand. He claims Combs took off his pants and exposed himself when they were alone. 'Combs continued to move closer and then grabbed Plaintiff’s genitals through his pants, squeezing them in a rough and sexual manner,' the suit alleges. 'Plaintiff, shocked and disoriented, frozen momentarily and did not know how to respond to the weirdly inappropriate sexual advance made by Combs,' it continues. What we know about the Diddy investigation The assault was stopped by 'Professional Athlete A,' who came into the office and intervened, the documents allege. The sports star was not named. Only identified as 'John Doe,' the plaintiff runs a Los Angeles-based business renting luxury cars and jewelry. He'd worked with Diddy for years before the alleged assault, the lawsuit claims. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline Diddy has been at the center of a storm of controversy and legal troubles where multiple individuals have come forward with allegations of sexual assault against him, leading to a series of lawsuits. These accusations have triggered a federal investigation, with reports suggesting that authorities are looking into sex trafficking charges. A May 5 trial date was set on Oct. 10.

Trump claims Harris ‘guaranteed’ to get US into World War III	Former President Trump claimed that Vice President Harris is 'guaranteed' to get the United States into World War III if she is elected president, continuing intense rhetoric common throughout the 2024 campaign. Trump spoke at a rally in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday, arguing that Harris would be incompetent at dealing with other country’s leaders like Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'To make her president would be to gamble with the lives of millions of people,' he said. 'She would get us into a World War III guaranteed because she is too grossly incompetent to do the job.' Trump continued that people’s 'sons and daughters will end up getting drafted to go fight for a war in a country that you’ve never heard of.' Later in the speech, Trump vowed that he would avoid World War III even as the country has 'never been so close' to it occurring. Which newspapers have endorsed and not endorsed Trump and Harris? Trump also repeated past arguments that conflicts like the one stemming from Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel would not have happened if he had been president. The former president’s remarks come after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a letter on Friday denouncing Harris’s calling Trump a 'fascist,' a term that Trump himself has used for Harris. Johnson and McConnell said, 'The Democratic nominee for President of the United States has only fanned the flames beneath a boiling cauldron of political animus. Her most recent and most reckless invocations of the darkest evil of the 20th century seem to dare it to boil over.' 'Labeling a political opponent as a ‘fascist’ risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before Election Day,' they said, referencing the two assassination attempts on Trump earlier this year. Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan Harris had previously not used the word fascist to describe Trump but said she believed he is one at the CNN town hall she participated in on Wednesday. The answer came in response to a question about Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly, saying Trump 'certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.' Following the first assassination attempt on Trump in July, members of both parties called for toning down political rhetoric to avoid such a politically charged environment that could lead to incidents like that one. But language from both candidates largely returned to normal soon after.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-claims-harris-guaranteed-to-get-us-into-world-war-iii/	2024-10-26T17:23:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300818698844.jpg?w=900
Which newspapers have and not endorsed Trump and Harris?	(NewsNation) — The Washington Post announced Friday it will no longer endorse presidential candidates, abandoning a 30-year tradition amid reports that owner Jeff Bezos blocked a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The decision comes as major newspapers increasingly step back from presidential endorsements, with the Los Angeles Times making a similar move this week. Washington Post publisher William Lewis said the decision marks a return to the paper's earlier practice of not endorsing presidential candidates, describing it as 'consistent with the values the Post has always stood for.' Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan According to internal sources cited by the Post, the paper's editorial board had prepared an endorsement of Harris over former President Donald Trump before the announcement. The reversal prompted criticism from Martin Baron, the Post's former executive editor, who called it 'cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.' The LA Times' decision triggered resignations from its editorial page editor and two editorial board members. Mariel Garza, the departing editorials editor, questioned how the paper could 'spend eight years railing against Trump and the danger his leadership poses to the country and then fail to endorse the perfectly decent Democrat challenger.' The shifts in both papers have highlighted the growing reluctance of news organizations to make presidential endorsements. The Minnesota Star Tribune also announced in August it would end the practice. Many newspapers are dropping endorsements as they struggle with declining readership and fear losing subscribers who disagree with their political positions. The trend comes as traditional media faces broader challenges, including evolving reader habits and the need to combat election misinformation. The current odds in every swing state Some major outlets still endorse, with most backing Harris over Trump While some major publications are stepping back from endorsements, others are maintaining the tradition. The New York Times, Boston Globe, Seattle Times, Las Vegas Sun and The New Yorker have endorsed Harris, while Trump has received backing from the New York Post. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently announced its support for Harris, coupling the endorsement with sharp criticism of Trump, whom they described as 'a convicted criminal, insurrectionist, tax dodger, sexual harasser, serial liar and Russian sympathizer.' The announcements come as Trump has renewed his attacks on the media, recently calling them 'the enemy of the people' at an Arizona rally and threatening to revoke CBS's broadcast license. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/newspapers-endorse-trump-harris/	2024-10-26T16:44:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/SEND-TO-DIGITAL-1.png?w=900
Michelle Obama blasts Trump in battleground Michigan	Former First Lady Michelle Obama hit the campaign trail for Vice President Harris in battleground Michigan on Saturday, blasting former President Trump and railing against what she cast as a double standard in the high-stakes presidential race. 'I gotta ask myself: why on earth is this race even close? I lay awake at night wondering: what in the world is going on?' Obama told a raucous rally crowd in Kalamazoo, Mich. The former first lady, an early endorser for Harris after President Biden's withdrawal from the race this summer, hammered a stark contrast between the two presidential race rivals as she sounded alarms about a second Trump term. Republicans push false claims about noncitizens voting. Here’s what to know 'I hope you'll forgive me if I'm a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump's gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,' Obama said. 'I hope that you'll forgive me if I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse, all of this while we pick apart Kamala’s answers from interviews that he doesn't even have the courage to do, y'all,' she added. Her searing remarks against the former president come as the polls show Harris and Trump neck-and-neck as Nov. 5 nears. Polling averages from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill put Harris up by a narrow 0.7 points nationally while, in the critical swing state of Michigan, the polling averages put the competitors at an exact tie. Obama said she's 'praying' that voters considering casting their ballot for Trump – and voters thinking about sitting out the election – will 'snap out of whatever fog we are in' before Election Day. Man charged for punching election worker after asking to remove Trump hat 'I am praying that we consider the decades of sacrifice and struggle by all of our ancestors, the folks who marched and sacrificed and shed their blood for us. We have to ask ourselves: is a vote for Trump or no vote at all the way we honor their lives? And if that's the case, well, that surely doesn't sound like freedom to me,' Obama said. The Kalamazoo stop marked Obama's first appearance on the campaign trail for Harris, and comes on the first day of early voting in Michigan. Her husband, former President Obama, has been making stops in key states throughout the month, and appeared with Harris in Georgia on Thursday. The Obamas have remained major voices in the Democratic Party since leaving the White House after the 2016 cycle, when Trump won his term in the Oval Office. Both gave memorable speeches at this summer's Democratic National Convention in Chicago as Harris accepted the party nomination. With less than two weeks until Election Day, the White House hopefuls and their surrogates are working in overdrive to crisscross key states as the polls show the race on a razor's edge.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/michelle-obama-harris-michigan/	2024-10-26T16:31:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300762169065.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr.'s presence on Michigan, Wisconsin ballots raises concerns...	Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presence on the ballot in the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin is raising concerns that he could inadvertently draw crucial votes from former President Trump. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and former independent candidate, this week formally asked the Supreme Court to scrub his name from the Badger State ballot, his last effort in an ongoing legal battle to remove himself from as many battleground ballots as possible in the final days of the presidential election. It appears unlikely, however, that Kennedy will be successful in his quest, which could end up having an unintended negative effect on Trump and may even help Vice President Harris on the margins in two Midwestern states. 'RFK Jr.’s manipulation of the system to get on the ballot where it helps Trump and off the ballot where it hurts was unprecedented and undemocratic,' Adrienne Watson, an adviser to the Democratic National Committee, told The Hill on Friday. 'Ironically, in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, where state law doesn’t allow candidates to withdraw from the ballot, he will likely be taking more votes from Trump than Harris,' Watson said. https://elections2024.thehill.com/michigan/harris_trump_michigan Before Kennedy agreed to drop his candidacy and become a surrogate for Trump, advisers close to both candidates devised a plan to get Kennedy off state ballots that could harm Trump’s chances against Harris. He didn’t bother trying to get off most ballots in blue states but worked to ensure that voters across the country would not be able to support him in true toss-ups. As part of that negotiation, Kennedy, who has been enlisted by the Trump campaign to persuade independents to vote Republican, has repeatedly told his supporters not to waste their ballots on him. 'I don’t want you to vote for me,' he said to fans who showed up at a Trump rally in Walker, Mich., in late September, trialing the message that he has pushed for the past month. Kennedy has since joined Trump at rallies and spoken at town halls on his behalf, abandoning the politics of his Democratic name and former party to go full-on MAGA and ensure that voters know he wants to reelect the former president. Trump has embraced Kennedy’s migration into his circle. He recently appeared to confirm that the nephew of John F. Kennedy will be given some kind of position in his administration if the GOP nominee is elected to a second term in office. 'He’s going to be a part of it,' Trump said about Kennedy this week, discussing his potential reentrance to the White House. 'Everybody likes Bobby.' For all the good feelings in Trump’s orbit, there’s a lingering debate about what may happen if Kennedy ends up pulling support from Trump in the critical 'blue wall' states he ultimately couldn’t get off of. Kennedy has managed to remove his name from consideration in most of the states that will help determine who heads to Pennsylvania Avenue in two weeks, including Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada. He contested Wisconsin the strongest after state officials denied his attempt to remove his candidacy. Officials refused to make an exception to their requirement that allows only death as a valid reason to delete a candidate’s name. Polling shows that Trump is ahead by a hair — 0.4 percentage points — in the state, according to the latest average by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ. Kennedy’s strategy to wipe himself off all swing ballots is an indication that he believes his high name recognition and third-party posture could potentially cut into Trump’s slight lead. 'They couldn’t undo them all,' said one source close to Kennedy’s operation who is in touch with Trump surrogates. The 'GOP has been investing big out there,' the source said about Wisconsin, hoping to counteract any fringe support that could add up. 'Those votes are unlikely to be decisive,' said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way who has helped lead the anti-third-party attack for Democrats this cycle. 'But in a race this close, every swing-state vote matters. So, if those who would vote for Trump in a two-way race pull the lever for Kennedy’s ghost ship of a campaign, Democrats will gladly take it,' he said. In Michigan, there’s more optimism among Republicans and others sympathetic to the anti-Harris effort that the remaining third-party candidates will take votes from the Democratic nominee and deflate her prospects. 'I know Jill Stein and Cornel West are making a big play for dissatisfied Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan,' the pro-Kennedy source said. After Kennedy bowed out of the presidential contest, Democrats have homed in on Stein, West and Chase Oliver, the Libertarian nominee, as possible political anomalies that could impact Harris. In Democrats’ view, Stein proved her 'spoiler' bona fides in 2016 by sapping some votes from Hillary Clinton in Michigan and giving Trump a win. Kennedy could have a similar effect in the only places where his candidacy endures, but with an even more unpredictable outcome. 'RFK’s spoiler role in this race has always been unclear. We just don’t know who is attracted to his particular brand of weird,' Bennett said. 'But since he’s gone all-in for Trump … he has somehow gotten even crazier,' Bennett added. 'Democrats long ago ceded the lunatic lane to others, so the likeliest votes he collects are from folks who would otherwise support Trump or not vote.' Democrats are indeed tailoring a small part of their closing pitch to address Kennedy as well as the current crop of candidates, but they have become less frantic about the third-party threat without showing up more broadly on ballots nationwide. One former Democratic presidential candidate said they would be 'pretty surprised' if Kennedy’s name in the two battlegrounds would matter much for either major party on Nov. 5. 'Both sides should worry less about third party candidates and worry more about having popular policies that people love,' the ex-candidate said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-s-presence-on-michigan-wisconsin-ballots-raises-concerns-for-trump/	2024-10-26T14:46:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kennedyjrrober_trumpdonald_102324ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump woos voters in critical swing state Pennsylvani...	Former President Trump is rallying voters in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania Saturday afternoon. In his remarks, Trump is expected to address his economic agenda and target Vice President Harris and the Biden administration over inflation, rising costs and taxes on Social Security, overtime and tips, the campaign announced. The event comes nearly a week after Trump worked the drive thru and fry station at a McDonald's in the state. Pennsylvania is one of the most crucial battlegrounds for both parties with Election Day under two weeks away. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls shows Trump with a slight lead over Harris in the Keystone State — 48.5 percent to 48.3 percent. The former president also held a rally in battleground Michigan Saturday afternoon, as early voting began statewide. The rally in State Park, Pa., is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. EDT.

Vice President Harris will be joined by former first lady Michelle Obama Saturday afternoon at a rally in battleground Michigan, as early voting opens up statewide. The event marks the former first lady's first appearance on the trail with the Democratic nominee. Former President Obama has participated in multiple campaign events since endorsing her campaign after President Biden withdrew from the race. Harris has also held many star-studded rallies in recent weeks, as the race remains tight ahead of Election Day. Saturday's event comes on the heels of a rally in Houston, where Beyoncé made an appearance and endorsed the vice president. With just over a week until the election, Harris and her GOP rival, former President Trump, are tied in the Great Lakes State — each with 47.9 percent support, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls. Trump also campaigned in the 'blue wall' state earlier Saturday. The rally in Kalamazoo, Mich., is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

Israel's first open attack on Iran targets missile sites and appa...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel attacked military targets in Iran with pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired on Israel earlier this month. It was the first time Israel’s military has openly attacked Iran. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make the missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. Crucially, there was no indication that Iran’s oil or nuclear sites were struck. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage,' and Iranian state-run media downplayed them. Taken together, the moves suggested at least for now that both countries are trying to avoid a more serious escalation. Still, the strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. Following the airstrikes, Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying it 'considers itself entitled and obligated to defend against foreign acts of aggression.' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran has 'no limits' in defending its interests. But late Saturday, Iran's military issued a carefully worded statement suggesting any cease-fire in Israel's ground offensives in Gaza and Lebanon would trump any possible retaliatory strike. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said four people were killed, all with the military air defense. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. But the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees Iran’s vast ballistic missile arsenal, was silent, raising questions about whether anything had been hit at its bases. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Israel gave him a heads-up before the strikes and said it looked like 'they didn’t hit anything but military targets.' His administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit nuclear facilities and oil installations. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran’s nuclear facilities were not impacted. 'I hope this is the end,' Biden said. Israel's first open attack on Iran Iran hadn’t faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. Explosions could be heard in Tehran until sunrise. Israel is also widely thought to be behind a limited airstrike in April near a major air base in Iran that hit the radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery. Iran had earlier fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel, causing minimal damage, after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria. On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation for devastating blows Israel landed against Hezbollah. They caused minimal damage and a few injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran 'made a big mistake.' 'If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond,' Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. Images released by Israel’s military showed members preparing to depart for the strikes in American-made F-15 and F-16 warplanes. The Iranian military statement described Israel's warplanes as firing lightweight missiles at a distance of 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Iranian border. The missiles struck air defense radar stations, the military said, some of which were already under repair. Iran’s mission to the United Nations accused the U.S. of complicity in the attack, asserting that the U.S. controls Iraqi airspace. Israel’s attack did not take out highly visible or symbolic facilities that could prompt a significant response from Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at Tel Aviv’s Institute for National Security Studies who formerly worked for Israel’s National Security Council. It also gives Israel room for escalation if needed, and targeting air defense systems weakens Iran’s capabilities to defend against future attacks, he said, adding that if there is Iranian retaliation, it should be limited. 'By targeting military sites and missile facilities over nuclear and energy infrastructure, Israel is also messaging that it seeks no further escalation for now,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. After the strikes, the streets in Iran's capital were calm, with schools and shops open. There were long lines at the gas stations — a regular occurrence when military violence flares. But some residents seemed anxious and avoided conversations with an Associated Press reporter. Mixed reactions at home and abroad Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the decision to avoid 'strategic and economic targets,' saying on X that 'we could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran.' The United States warned against further retaliation, and Britain and Germany said Iran should not respond. 'All acts of escalation are condemnable and must stop,' the spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general said. Saudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Iran's 'sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.' Hezbollah and Hamas condemned Israel's attack. Regional tensions have been soaring. In Lebanon, dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israel launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut. Hezbollah warned 25 communities in northern Israel to evacuate Saturday, calling them 'legitimate military targets' because Israel was attacking the militant group from there. Enemies for decades Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for attacks on shipping in the Middle East. The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas. Some 100 remain, about a third believed to be dead. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in largely devastated Gaza, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half have been women and children. 'Those who were not killed by the bombing are dying from starvation. This is life,' said one woman displaced from northern Gaza, Madallah Abu Zaid. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Schreck from Jerusalem.

5 takeaways from Trump's 3-hour interview with Joe Rogan	Former President Trump sat with Joe Rogan Friday for a three-hour interview, marking the GOP nominee’s debut on one of the most popular podcasts in the country. The two men appeared to show a mutual admiration for one another, while the former president spoke at length about immigration, his intense reliance on tariffs for economic policy, and his unproven claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Rogan is one of the most popular and controversial media personalities in the country, with each of his episodes earning millions of downloads and often features conversations with top newsmakers. He is particularly popular with young men, who the Trump campaign has specifically targeted in the upcoming election. Senate Dems discussing plans to push through Harris would-be Cabinet Here are five takeaways from the interview. Trump and Rogan hit it off Rogan has previously said he is not a Trump supporter and in 2022 indicated he would not be interested in having the former president on the show. But the two appeared extremely comfortable with one another Friday, trading compliments and discussing their shared love of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events. 'You cannot be voting for Kamala. You’re not a Kamala person. I know you. I’ve watched you,' Trump told the podcast host. 'You know what, without speaking to you I know you, I think I know you, maybe almost as well as your wife.' He later added that he thought Rogan knew 'everything … as a student of yours.' 'One of the beautiful things about you is that you freeball,' Rogan said, telling the former president that he thought his impression mocking President Biden was 'funny stuff.' Five things to know about Israel’s attack on Iran The two went on an extended tangent about boxing and UFC events, talking about their mutual friendship with UFC president Dana White. Rogan has worked as a play-by-play announcer at UFC events, while Trump has attended numerous fights and was introduced by White at the July GOP convention. 'I want to do it again with you,' Trump said as he wrapped up the interview. 'You are something…you are a fascinating guy.' Trump says RFK Jr. would have administration role, but it won’t be ‘environmental’ Rogan had previously expressed support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran an independent White House bid before suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump in late August. The podcast host asked Trump on Friday whether he was set on having Kennedy be part of his administration if he wins in November. 'Oh I am. The only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental,' Trump said. 'Because you know, he doesn’t like oil, I love oil and gas. So I’m just going to keep him out…I said, ‘Focus on health. You can do whatever you want.’ But I gotta be a little careful with the liquid gold.' Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says Trump told Rogan he has faced pressure from some not to work with Kennedy, citing the pharmaceutical industry. The two then had an extended discussion about systemic health issues facing the country, with the podcast host suggesting if there was a greater focus on 'metabolic health,' there wouldn’t be such a need for pharmaceutical drugs. Rogan has in the past drawn backlash for some of his anti-vaccine rhetoric, including when he hosted a prominent anti-vaccine influencer on his show in 2022. Kennedy has similarly drawn criticism for some of his anti-vaccine comments. He has led an initiative for the Trump campaign dubbed 'Make America Healthy Again.' Podcast underscores Trump appeal to young voters The Trump campaign has invested significant time and energy courting young men, with a particular focus on the former president’s media appearances. Trump’s sit-down with Rogan was yet another extension of that strategy. 'So I have a son who’s very smart, and tall, Barron. And he knows all about you,' Trump said. 'He knows about guys I never heard of…it’s a whole new world out there. But you know, I’m on TikTok now. And I’ve done really well.' Rogan’s podcast draws more than 15 million followers on Spotify, and his YouTube channel boasts more than 17 million subscribers. He is particularly popular with young men, and he spoke to the concerns of younger voters during Friday’s interview. Georgia 9th grader invents AI tool to detect pesticides on food 'I think young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshit. Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded,' Rogan said. 'They’re tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what they think the moral standards of society should be today…You wanna be a rebel? You wanna be punk rock? You wanna, like, buck the system? You’re a conservative now,' he added. A new Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters ages 18-29 found Vice President Harris leading Trump by 20 percentage points among young voters under 30. Harris leads by 30 points among young women and by 10 points among young men. Rogan gives Trump time to air election fraud claims Trump has for the past four years refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and claimed without evidence there was widespread fraud that changed the outcome. Rogan on Friday gave the former president space to explain his claims. 'How do you think you were robbed? Everybody always cuts you off,' Rogan said. 'What I’d rather do is –we’ll do it another time. I would bring in papers that you would not believe. That election was so crooked,' Trump said, at one point repeating the false claim that he did not lose in 2020. Pressed for examples, the former president argued that state legislatures did not properly approve changes to ballot deadlines and collection methods. State lawmakers moved quickly in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic to adjust voting laws to make it easier to vote early and by mail. 'They used COVID to cheat,' Trump said. He further claimed that a letter from dozens of former intelligence agents asserting that a laptop belonging to the president's son, Hunter Biden, that was revealed in the closing weeks of the 2020 campaign was Russian disinformation cost him enough votes to flip the election for Biden. McDonald’s E. coli outbreak hits 3 more states, 26 new cases reported Trump went on to argue that using paper ballots would guard against fraud, and the former president and Rogan agreed that states should enact voter ID laws. The GOP nominee has routinely invoked his distrust in the 2020 results at campaign rallies, calling the election 'rigged' or fraudulent. Democrats have warned Trump poses a threat to democracy because of his refusal to accept the results. The former president and his allies brought numerous lawsuits after the 2020 election alleging fraud, but they were dismissed because of lack of evidence or lack of standing. Trump has been indicted in Washington, D.C., on federal charges over his efforts to remain in power after losing the election. Trump opines on extraterrestrial life and UFOs Rogan has repeatedly shown an interest in the prospect of aliens and UFOs on his show, and he used his interview with Trump to press the former president on what he knew from his time in office. 'What did they tell you? How much can you tell?' Rogan asked. 'It’s never been my thing. I have to be honest,' Trump replied. 'I’ve never been a believer.' The former president recounted interviewing pilots who claimed they saw round objects moving rapidly through the sky. 'I get that question as much as almost any question. ‘Do you think we have aliens flying around or whatever,’' he said. 'There’s no reason not to — I mean there’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life... Well, maybe it’s life that we don’t know.' Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) burst into the spotlight last year following testimony from three former Defense Department officials who told a House panel’s national security subcommittee that sightings of UAPs could pose national security risks.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/takeaways-trumps-interview-joe-rogan/	2024-10-26T12:02:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Joe-Rogan-10.26.png?w=900
Georgia 9th grader invents AI tool to detect pesticides on food	(NewsNation) — Sirish Subash is no ordinary ninth-grade student. The 14-year-old from Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology in Snellville, Georgia, was named America's top young scientist after winning the 2024 3M Young Scientist Challenge. The reason? Subash's creation of an AI handheld pesticide detector named 'Pestiscand.' The creation was devised after washing food with his mother before a meal. 'It works on a method called spectrophotometry. Now what this means is that it uses different ways that light interacts with different chemicals to look for different chemicals on the produce,' Subash told 'Morning in America with Hena Doba.' 'Each chemical reflects different parts or wavelengths of light, and that creates a spectral signature, which is basically a catalog of what wavelengths are reflected back. So, 'Pestiscand' can look for those wavelengths that are reflected by side residues on the produce.' Former trucker helping extend driver’s short life expectancy While the product is not on the market for the broader public at this time, Subash aims to dedicate his time to ensuring it has mass availability in the near future. 'I want to continue developing projects like 'Pestiscand' and eventually get them out to the world, to the market. That's one of my goals for 'Pestiscand', to get it out to everyone,' Subash added. In his downtime, Subash enjoys reading both fiction and non-fiction and making origami. His $25,000 prizefund will go toward his college education	https://www.newsnationnow.com/science/9th-grader-invents-tool-pesticides-food/	2024-10-26T11:24:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Subash.png?w=900
Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says	(NEXSTAR) — A new report has found that nearly a third of Gen Z — also known as Zoomers — already feel financially secure thanks to having both a job and a side hustle, particularly in certain cities around the U.S. Due to the current economy, most Zoomers are looking for that sense of security and are willing to do whatever it takes to find it, the study suggests. According to LendingTree, at least 55% of young Americans have a side hustle on top of their current job. Thanks to the extra work, they're making an extra $1,253, on average. IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? Gen Zers in some areas of the country are doing much better than others, however. MoneyGeek looked at data from cities across the U.S., using various metrics to determine where young adults are thriving in areas such as economic opportunity and quality of life. What the final data shows is that Zoomers are having better luck financially out West. This is due to the average median household income in the West sitting at $53,497 — nearly $12,000 more than the next closest region, the Northeast. As for cities in the region, Salt Lake City, Utah, lands at the top of the list. The city has seen a 41% growth in its young adult population and holds the lowest federal student loan debt per borrower at $11,062. Here’s what to do if you lose an absentee ballot before Election Day Rounding out the rest of the top five are Abilene, Texas; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; and finally Las Cruces, New Mexico. Here is how the rest of the country ranked in terms of Zoomers thriving financially: !function(e,n,i,s){var d='InfogramEmbeds';var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,'script','infogram-async','https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js'); More about these cities and their opportunities for Zoomer can be found at MoneyGeek's website.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/gen-z-is-thriving-financially-in-these-us-cities-new-report-says/	2024-10-26T08:54:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AdobeStock_139152738-e1729782338582.jpg?w=800
Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran's shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-five-things-to-know-about-israels-attack-on-iran/	2024-10-26T08:20:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671d090e246de7.17081096.jpeg?w=900

IDF confirms Israeli strikes in Tehran	(NewsNation) — Israel Defense Forces offensive and defensive units are 'fully mobilized' against military targets in Iran, the IDF confirmed Friday night. 'In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,' the organization said. It did not say the exact target of the attacks. Israel informed senior White House officials of the attacks in the hours prior, sources told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. Defense officials say the U.S. had no involvement in Israel's operation, and President Joe Biden has been briefed on the attacks. 'We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st. We would refer you to the Israeli government for more information on their operation,' National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett told NewsNation. US government issues worldwide alert on Israel-related demonstrations Explosions were heard in Iran's Tehran and nearby Karaj, state media reported Friday. Iran's state TV said multiple explosions were heard in the capital, but no origin was known. A Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. ‘Worst humanitarian crisis we’ve seen since WWII’: Doctor on Gaza 'Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond ... We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.' IDF's statement read. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to the Middle East this week to speak with leaders about a possible cease-fire, returning just hours before the IDF's Friday strikes in Tehran. Iranian-Israeli tensions Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. Israel and Iran have been locked in a yearslong shadow war. A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. But since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, the battle has increasingly moved into the open. Israel has recently turned its attention to Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Throughout the year, a number of top Iranian military figures have been killed in Israeli strikes in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli strikes killed 38 people in Gaza and three journalists in Lebanon on Friday morning. More than 42,000 Palestinians have died since the start of the war, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says.

Senate Dems discussing plans to push through Harris would-be Cabi...	(NewsNation) — Worried about Vice President Kamala Harris potentially facing a Republican-controlled Senate if she wins the White House, two Democratic strategists tell NewsNation senators are discussing an emergency plan to approve her Cabinet during a December Senate session. The Senate is currently controlled by the Democrats, but lawmakers in the party are facing an 'increasingly tough road' to keeping it this way, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Democrats face a difficult Senate map, with multiple incumbents in solidly GOP territory. Republican candidates in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are quickly closing the gap, The Hill reports, and 'blue wall' states are now all deemed 'toss-ups' by Cook Political Report.

Biden would then appoint Harris' picks, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would then confirm the new Cabinet with his current 51 to 49 Senate. One source, however, conceded that this might not be possible. At that point, the source said, Harris would have to decide who in Biden's Cabinet she would want to keep on. Questions also remain about whether Harris, if she beats Republican former president Donald Trump, could develop a Cabinet list and vet her appointees before a new Senate comes in. 'Sen. Schumer is focused on winning a Democratic majority in the Senate that will work to confirm future President Kamala Harris’s Cabinet,' a spokesperson for the New York Democrat said in a statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/senate-democrats-harris-cabinet/	2024-10-25T13:54:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179658368.jpg?w=900
Chinese hackers may have accessed Trump, Harris campaign phones	(NewsNation) — Chinese hackers targeted data from phones used by both the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns, according to reports. NewsNation also confirmed, per a Democratic source briefed, that the Chinese Communist Party hack targeted prominent Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s staff. The New York Times first reported hackers may have had access to phones used by former President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. A source then confirmed with NewsNation that 'People affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign were also targeted.' It was unclear whether the hackers could have gained access to data stored on the devices. The New York Times report says the Trump campaign was made aware of the possible breach this week. US on alert for election interference from Russia, China, Iran In a statement to NewsNation, the Trump campaign blamed Harris’ campaign for the reported hack. 'This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House,' the statement read in part. The Wall Street Journal Friday reported hackers also targeted 'people affiliated with Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign.'

The current odds in every battleground state	(NewsNation) — The 2024 presidential race can be summed up in a single phrase: 'It's anybody's ballgame.' NewsNation's election partner Decision Desk HQ shows former President Donald Trump with a 52% chance of winning and Vice President Kamala Harris with a 48% chance as of midday Oct. 25. Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Famed polling expert Nate Silver currently shows Harris with a 1.3-point lead nationally but slightly behind in several key battleground states. 'In an election where the seven battleground states are all polling within a percentage point or two, 50-50 is the only responsible forecast,' Silver wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed. Those seven states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — will ultimately decide the election. Here's what the polls currently show in each. Note: This story will be updated as polling changes. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Arizona Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 58% Harris: 42% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 49.3% Harris: 47.3% Who has the momentum? Silver's model suggests Harris had a slight lead in Arizona at the end of August. Poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight showed the two candidates tied as recently as mid-September. Over the past month, Trump has opened up a narrow two-point advantage in the state. What to watch: About 1 in 4 Arizona voters are Latino, and Trump has made inroads with that group, particularly among men. Harris will try to improve on Democrats' performance with suburbanites around Phoenix, particularly 'John McCain Republicans,' many of whom have rejected Trump. Georgia Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 62% Harris: 38% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 49.0% Harris: 47.6% Who has the momentum? Harris had a slight advantage in early September, but since then, Trump has pulled ahead. He currently holds a +1.4 polling lead according to Silver's model and a +1.6 advantage per FiveThirtyEight. What to watch: If Trump has improved among Black voters, as polls show, then that will likely show up in Georgia, one of the most racially diverse swing states. Meanwhile, Harris needs to perform well in the growing suburbs around metro Atlanta, which have turned increasingly blue in recent elections. Michigan Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Harris: 58% Trump: 42% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Harris: 48.1% Trump: 47.3% Who has the momentum? A month ago, polls showed Harris with a two-point lead in the state; now, the two candidates are separated by less than a point. What to watch: Michigan is home to more than 200,000 Muslim registered voters, and over the past year, Muslims' support for the Democratic Party has dropped. Much of that is due to frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. It remains to be seen how many of those voters will shift Trump's way, but they could have a major impact on the outcome. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Nevada is another state where Trump has recently closed the gap, and he's now within 0.3 points, according to Silver's model. A month ago, Harris had a one-point lead. What to watch: Like Arizona, Nevada has a significant share of Latino voters, which could swing things either way in the state's population center, Clark County. Both candidates have tried to appeal to the state's service and hospitality workers, promising to eliminate taxes on tips. North Carolina Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 66% Harris: 34% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 48.8% Harris: 47.6% Who has the momentum? Trump currently holds a 1.3-point polling advantage, a slight improvement from his 0.6-point lead a month ago, according to FiveThirtyEight. What to watch: Trump has won North Carolina in each of the last two elections, but Democrats have been gaining ground, particularly in major population centers like Mecklenburg and Wake counties. If Harris can improve in those areas, Democrats have a chance to win the state for the first time since Barack Obama in 2008.

Pennsylvania Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 52% Harris: 48% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Trump: 48.2% Harris: 48.0% Who has the momentum? Pennsylvania is the swingiest swing state and likely the most important. At this point, the two are roughly tied. In early September, Harris and Trump were neck and neck before Harris opened up a slight lead as the month progressed. Since then, Trump has pulled even and currently holds a 0.2-point polling lead, per Silver's model. What to watch: In 10 of the last 12 elections, the winner of Pennsylvania has gone on to win the race. In some ways, it's the place where every election narrative collides — a microcosm of the U.S. at large. Both candidates are competing for the state's fast-growing Hispanic community. Turnout among Black voters in the heavily Democratic Philadelphia area could also play an outsized role. There are also the swing counties themselves, historically blue-collar areas like Erie County that could go either way. Wisconsin Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 25): Trump: 53% Harris: 47% Nate Silver polling averages (as of Oct. 24): Harris: 48.5% Trump: 48.0% Who has the momentum? Harris has a half-point lead according to Silver's model, but again, that's tighter compared to a month ago when she led by about two points. What to watch: The traditionally red Milwaukee suburbs, the so-called 'WOW counties,' have become less so in recent elections. If Harris can build on Democrats' gains in those areas — Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington — she could win the state. On the other hand, if Democratic voters don't turn out in Milwaukee County — and Trump holds his lead in rural areas — the former president could recreate his 2016 victory that saw the state turn red for the first time since 1984.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/current-odds-battleground-state/	2024-10-25T10:50:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.10.png?w=900
Why is Florida suing DOJ over apparent Trump assassination plot?	(NewsNation) — Federal officials have hamstrung state investigative efforts surrounding an alleged assassination plot against former President Donald Trump, Florida’s Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody said. Moody filed a lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday. She’s accusing federal authorities of blocking the state’s investigation after the Justice Department told Florida to temporarily halt its efforts while the federal probe is underway. 'When Gov. DeSantis rightfully issued an executive order to make sure we were fully pursuing state-law crimes, immediately — we started getting pushback when we were trying to collect evidence and further that investigation,' Moody said on 'Morning in America.' Biden apologizes for Indian boarding school policy Florida officials were told not to interview witnesses and that they could only cooperate with the federal investigation, the lawsuit alleges. Justice Department officials cited the federal law, which says the FBI is charged with investigating attempted political candidate assassinations and that state law enforcement should hold off on its investigative efforts in the meantime. 'I was a federal prosecutor before my life led me to become a judge and the attorney general,' Moody said. 'I understand the nature of the federal investigatory authorities working hand-in-hand with the state officials. That is common … that is why this is so short-sighted.' Virginia ordered to restore 1,600 canceled voter registrations Ryan Routh, the man whom police arrested in connection with the apparent plan, is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer and attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. He’s pleaded not guilty to each charge. Investigators say Routh pointed a rifle through a tree line on Sept. 15 at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where the former president and GOP presidential nominee was playing. Unlike the gunman behind the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Routh isn’t accused of firing a weapon.

Judge orders Virginia to restore 1,600 voter registrations cancel...	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to restore more than 1,600 voter registrations that she said were illegally purged in the last two months in an effort to stop noncitizens from voting. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request brought against Virginia election officials by the Justice Department, which claimed the voter registrations were wrongly canceled during a 90-day quiet period ahead of the November election that restricts states from making large-scale changes to their voter rolls. State officials said they will appeal. The Justice Departmen t and private groups, including the League of Women Voters, said many of the 1,600 voters whose registrations were canceled were in fact citizens whose registrations were canceled because of bureaucratic errors or simple mistakes like a mischecked box on a form. Justice Department lawyer Sejal Jhaveri said during an all-day injunction hearing Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, that's precisely why federal law prevents states from implementing systematic changes to the voter rolls in the 90 days before an election, 'to prevent the harm of having eligible voters removed in a period where it's hard to remedy.' Giles said Friday that the state is not completely prohibited from removing noncitizens from the voting rolls during the 90-day quiet period, but that it must do so on an individualized basis rather than the automated, systematic program employed by the state. State officials argued unsuccessfully that the canceled registrations followed careful procedures that targeted people who explicitly identified themselves as noncitizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Charles Cooper, a lawyer for the state, said during arguments Thursday that the federal law was never intended to provide protections to noncitizens, who by definition can't vote in federal elections. 'Congress couldn't possibly have intended to prevent the removal ... of persons who were never eligible to vote in the first place,' Cooper argued. The plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, though, said that many people are wrongly identified as noncitizens by the DMV simply by checking the wrong box on a form. They were unable to identify exactly how many of the 1,600 purged voters are in fact citizens — Virginia only identified this week the names and addresses of the affected individuals in response to a court order — but provided anecdotal evidence of individuals whose registrations were wrongly canceled. Cooper acknowledged that some of the 1,600 voters identified by the state as noncitizens may well be citizens, but he said restoring all of them to the rolls means that in all likelihood 'there's going to hundreds of noncitizens back on those rolls. If a noncitizen votes, it cancels out a legal vote. And that is a harm,' he said. Virginia's Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, issued an executive order in August requiring daily checks of DMV data against voter rolls to identify noncitizens. State officials said any voter identified as a noncitizen was notified and given two weeks to dispute their disqualification before being removed. If they returned a form attesting to their citizenship, their registration would not be canceled. Prior to Youngkin's executive order, the state did monthly checks of the voter rolls against DMV data, in accordance with a state law passed in 2006. Youngkin said the Justice Department was wrongly targeting him for upholding a law that was followed by his predecessors, including Democrats, even if they didn't take the extra step of ordering daily checks as he did in his executive order. 'Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals–who self-identified themselves as noncitizens–back onto the voter rolls.,' Youngkin said in a statement after Friday's hearing. Giles, for her part, questioned the timing of Youngkin's executive order, which was issued on Aug. 7, the very beginning of the 90-day quiet period required under federal law. 'It's not happenstance that this was announced exactly on the 90th day' of the quiet period, she said Friday from the bench. Her injunction requires voter registrations be restored for all of those canceled as a result of Youngkin's executive order, and that letters be sent out within five days informing those voters of their restored status. The letters will also include a note of caution informing those individuals that if they are indeed noncitizens, that they are barred from casting ballots under federal law. The plaintiffs had asked the judge to grant those voters an extension of the deadline to request absentee ballots, but Giles denied that request, saying it would result in confusion. 'We may not be able to achieve everything we would want,' she said. Virginia's Republican attorney general, Jason Miyares, issued a statement after Friday's hearing criticizing the ruling. 'It should never be illegal to remove an illegal voter,' he said. 'Yet, today a Court – urged by the Biden-Harris Department of Justice – ordered Virginia to put the names of non-citizens back on the voter rolls, mere days before a presidential election.' U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., who had alerted Justice Department officials to the removals. praised the ruling. 'Governor Youngkin’s purges have served only one purpose – to disenfranchise thousands of lawfully voting citizens of the Commonwealth. That stops today,' he said. Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote. A similar lawsuit was filed in Alabama, and a federal judge there last week ordered the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-judge-orders-virginia-to-restore-1600-voter-registrations-canceled-in-effort-to-purge-noncitizens/	2024-10-25T10:28:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671bd5fca14604.29927424.jpeg?w=900
McDonald's E. coli outbreak hits 3 more states, 26 new cases repo...	(NewsNation) — Health officials on Friday announced 26 new E. coli cases among people who ate at McDonald’s amid an outbreak linked to the fast-food chain’s Quarter Pounder burger. The new cases bring the total number of known infections to 75. Twenty-two people have been hospitalized and one person has died. Risk to the public remains low as McDonald’s and one of its onion suppliers take action to identify the root of the contamination, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Jimmy Johns introduces limited-run ‘Picklewich’ The outbreak now spans 13 states including Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, and portions of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, according to the CDC. McDonald’s restaurants in each state have temporarily stopped using their current supply of Quarter Pounder slivered onions and beef patties. Investigators are working to confirm which ingredient is making people sick and whether other restaurants might be affected. The patties in question are only used on Quarter Pounders. Fresh-slivered onions are likewise used primarily for that burger. Taylor Farms, which supplies slivered onions to the affected restaurants, issued a voluntary recall. The food supplier asked customers to stop using some onions while the investigation is ongoing. The CDC encourages anyone with E. coli symptoms should call their doctor. Symptoms include: Diarrhea and a fever higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit So much vomiting that you cannot keep liquids down Signs of dehydration, such as less frequent urination, dry mouth and throat, and dizziness upon standing	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/recalls/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-26-new-cases-onions-quarter-pounder/	2024-10-25T09:51:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180538535.jpg?w=900
WATCH LIVE: Biden visits Indian Country, apologizes for 150-year-...	Watch Biden's remarks live in the video player above. He is scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m. ET. PHOENIX (AP) — President Joe Biden is using his long-promised first presidential visit to Indian Country to formally apologize to Native Americans on Friday for a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated Indian children from their parents. Democrats hope Biden's visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s land on the outskirts of metro Phoenix in Arizona will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. Biden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would make a visit to Indian Country. The president, in an exchange with reporters Thursday before departing for Arizona, said an apology for the U.S. government’s role in the abuse and neglect of Native children was 'something that should have been done a long time ago.' For decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate children into white society, according to the White House. The moment will also give Biden a chance to spotlight his and Harris' support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to improve turnout among bedrock supporters. 'The race is now a turnout grab,' said Mike O’Neil, a non-partisan pollster based in Arizona. 'The trendlines throughout have been remarkably steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow margins.' Biden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July. But analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native American voters — a group that has trailed others in turnout rates. In 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996. Biden is making the visit in his official capacity, and a formal apology — something tribes have long sought — seems certain to garner attention among Native Americans across the country. At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government’s abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in 1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for a U.S. government apology. At least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them. 'President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,' said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. 'I do think that will reflect well on Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.' She added that whoever is the next president must follow up with concrete action and begin making amends for the devastation the boarding schools wrought on tribes. Democrats have stepped up outreach to Native American communities. Both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, met with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe. The Democratic National Committee recently launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska through digital, print and radio ads. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is locked in a competitive race with Republican Kari Lake for Arizona's open Senate seat, has visited all 22 of Arizona's federally recognized tribes. Harris started a recent campaign rally in Chandler, near where the Gila River reservation is located, with a shoutout to the tribe's leader. She also reminded the crowd that she was the first vice president to visit the reservation. She and husband Doug Emhoff visited the community last year. 'I strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations and the United States is sacred ... and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust in treaty obligations, and ensure tribal self-determination,' Harris said. The White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years. He designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in Nevada and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. In addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and more. Biden picked former New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as his Interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico. She, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government's boarding school policies that is leading Biden to deliver the formal apology. 'He made commitments to Indian Country, and he has followed through on every single one of those commitments,' Haaland said. Thom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University, said both Harris' and Trump's campaigns — and their allies — have put a remarkable amount of effort into micro-targeting in Arizona. Harris, Reilly noted, has also focused on whittling away at Trump's advantage among Mormon voters in the state, a group that historically has favored Republicans. Trump, meanwhile, has put special focus on young men as the campaign tries to narrow Democrats' advantage with younger voters. 'They are pulling out every stop just to see if they could wrangle a few more votes here and there,' Reilly said. 'The Indian community is one of those groups that Harris is hoping will overperform and help make the difference.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/watch-biden-visits-indian-country-apologizes-for-150-year-old-boarding-school-policy/	2024-10-25T09:20:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24299024866592.jpg?w=900
Rapper 'Lil Durk' arrested in connection to murder-for-hire plot	(NewsNation) — Grammy award-winning rapper 'Lil Durk' was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Florida on Thursday in connection to an alleged murder-for-hire plot. Chicago native Durk Banks, 32, was booked into the Broward County Jail, pending charges of murder-for-hire, according to jail records. No further details have been released regarding Banks' charges.

Undecided voter likes Vance's pledge to unify country after elect...	(NewsNation) — 'I want my friends back.' That’s how Rebecca Sander explained her question to Sen. JD Vance during his NewsNation town hall Thursday. Sander asked Vance how he and Donald Trump will bring the country together if they’re elected. 'Two weeks from today, half of our country is going to be devastated,' Sander said. 'I feel like Trump can’t bring unity even if he tries really hard, so the fact that Vance feels some ownership there' is reassuring, she told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo after the event.

I’m undecided if I’m even gonna vote at the top of the ticket,' Ayesha Langston said. 'I’m disgusted with Washington. I don’t even know about the Senate race. I’m going to vote on my local (races).' Langston said she has not been satisfied with either side’s answers about helping those at the lowest end of America’s economic scale, no matter where they live. Vance critical of Ronald Reagan for homelessness crisis 'People in the projects have the same problems as people in the trailer parks. And yet they’re voting for Trump, and they tell us in the city that we have to vote for Harris, and I’m just not with that.' Langston did acknowledge that she came away with a favorable opinion of Vance. 'I wanted to see how he interacted with us. And I actually did like him. It would be better if he was at the top of the ticket, (but) I still might not vote for him,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-town-hall-participants-want-unity-tired-of-divisions/	2024-10-24T20:49:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/072BD60534169BC7CDE1ADB5C7FD6156.jpg?w=900
O'Reilly: Cuomo made 'big mistake' while questioning Vance	(NewsNation) — Political commentator Bill O’Reilly said NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo did not push Ohio Sen. JD Vance hard enough during a NewsNation town hall Thursday, particularly when addressing the 'divisive rhetoric' he and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, have used in the campaign. Cuomo 'let Vance off,' O'Reilly told NewsNation on Thursday evening. 'I would have brought in two examples of divisive rhetoric. Not to try to 'gotcha,' but to see if Vance has perspective on it,' O’Reilly told Cuomo. During the town hall, Cuomo asked Vance if he wished he had handled things differently when it came to his previous false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. 'Do I wish that I had been better in that moment? Maybe,' Vance answered. He then quickly pivoted to saying he was just listening to people in his community because he needed to trust constituents over the media. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? 'What am I supposed to do? Hang up the phone and tell them they're a liar because the media doesn't want me to talk about it?' Vance asked. 'One of the things that I've learned in my time in the United States Senate is that sometimes the media doesn't always listen to people.' Vance also blamed the media for chasing the comments about the pets instead of focusing on the hardships in the town as a result of an influx of immigrants. O'Reilly believed Cuomo missed an opportunity in his questioning of Vance by not focusing on the fiscal reality of the migrant crisis. Vance 'would have been way ahead if he goes, ‘You know, that probably wasn't the best thing for us to do,’' and instead focused on the financial strain of the influx, O’Reilly said. 'We have statistics like $350 million just this year on illegal immigrants. It's unsustainable. You don't have to go into the Alpo thing with the dogs and the cats ... you open yourself up to all kinds of charges with the media gleefully hopping on,' he said. He added, 'Americans like it when you [politicians] admit a mistake.' Cuomo defended his line of questioning, telling O’Reilly that apologies are 'weaponized' in modern day politics so it’s rare for a lawmaker to admit any fault. 'You really get beaten over the head with apologies in politics now,' Cuomo said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/oreilly-cuomo-mistake-vance-migrants/	2024-10-24T20:36:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/bill-O-vance-color.png?w=800
Vance: Housing costs are biggest threat to the American dream	(NewsNation) — Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance called high housing costs 'the biggest threat to the American dream' during a NewsNation town hall Thursday. 'So many people in my generation — they're delaying having families, they're delaying getting married because they can't afford a place to raise a family,' Vance told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. Low inventory, elevated mortgage rates and record-high prices have turned buying a home from a dream into a nightmare in recent years. At the same time, rising child care costs have stretched families' finances and caused others to delay having kids altogether. Here’s what Vance said he would do to bring down the cost of housing and child care. Vance says he stands with Trump on abortion Tackling the housing shortage The U.S. housing market is short 4.5 million homes, which has kept inventory tight and pushed prices to record highs despite a drop in sales. Vance said he would make it easier to build houses by lowering energy costs and easing regulatory burdens. 'Our ancestors went to the moon with pocket calculators and slide rulers, and now, our government makes it way too hard to build the homes that we need,' he said. VP candidate @JDVance says two problems with housing in the U.S. are supply and demand. Vance says there aren&#39;t enough homes being built for those living here, and that too many people are coming into the country illegally, further driving demand: https://t.co/zg6reSMxvO… pic.twitter.com/rlEErLSENk&mdash; NewsNation (@NewsNation) October 25, 2024 Another part of the solution, Vance argues, should be aimed at lowering demand by securing the southern border. He said it’s no coincidence housing costs have risen at the same time as illegal immigration. 'When you let those folks in your country at the level that we have, well, you’ve got to put them somewhere,' Vance said. 'Those are homes that aren't going to American citizens.' While it’s true more people in need of housing leads to higher demand, economists have warned that tightening immigration could worsen existing labor shortages in the construction industry, further constraining supply. During Thursday's town hall, Vance said he would drive down mortgage rates by further curbing inflation. Lowering the cost of child care For millions of Americans, child care, not housing, is their biggest monthly expense. To bring down costs, Vance emphasized the need for flexibility and said he wants to expand the number of child care providers by moving away from the federal government’s 'one-size-fits-all model.' 'The federal government actually makes it really hard for anybody other than the people who are currently providing child care to get into that job,' Vance said. Instead, the Republican VP candidate said he wants to 'make it easier for grandparents, aunts and uncles, church communities and nonprofit centers, to participate in providing child care.'

When asked whether he would push corporations to provide better family leave, Vance said he was open to it: 'I do think that would relieve some pressure on families.' Above all, he wants to see more nonprofits and community organizations involved. 'A lot of them would like to help out, but they don't get the same federal benefits as other organizations,' Vance said.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-housing-costs/	2024-10-24T19:18:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/NN_8741.jpg?w=900
Vance critical of Ronald Reagan for homelessness crisis	(NewsNation) — Republican Ohio Senator JD Vance was critical of former President Ronald Reagan’s decision to cut mental health services decades ago, saying it has contributed to a present-day homelessness crisis. During a NewsNation town hall Thursday, Vance said the 'homelessness problem in this country, especially in our big cities, is completely out of control.' 'I’m going to criticize President Reagan going back 40 years because President Reagan made a decision to cut mental health care in this country, and the decision that we made collectively as a nation was to let people live on the streets instead of sometimes being committed to inpatient mental health facilities,' he said. Vance appears to be referring to Reagan, a Republican, repealing the Mental Health Systems Act in 1981, which was signed by his predecessor, Democratic former President Jimmy Carter. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? Under the Mental Health Systems Act, the government would have funded federal community mental health center programs first envisioned under President John F. Kennedy. Reagan cut Carter’s legislation with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which pushed the responsibility of mentally ill patients back to the states, according to KQED. By 2004, the Department of Justice estimated that 10% of state prisoners had symptoms that met the criteria for a psychotic disorder. Vance said that in the aftermath of Reagan’s decision, taxpayers have had to 'pick up the burden' of caring for the mentally ill, many who end up homeless or in local jails instead of health centers. 'I don't think that it's compassionate to let the mentally ill fester on the streets. Some of them have addiction problems, some of them have other health problems. I think we need to get back to saying that if you have real mental health problems, you've got to go to an inpatient treatment facility, get the care that you need,' Vance said. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? According to the National Alliance on Mental Health, 21% of people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. have a serious mental health condition, and research has found that homelessness is associated with a higher prevalence of mental and substance use disorders when compared to stably housed individuals. Vance called Reagan’s decision a 'mistake.' 'I think all leaders should be able to say we made a mistake. Let's try something that actually works,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-ronald-reagan-homelessness-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:32:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Vance-Thumbnail-5-1.png?w=800
Trump asks Vance to tell him why he's 'brilliant' during town hal...	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump phoned into NewsNation’s town hall with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Thursday to ask his vice presidential pick to describe how 'brilliant' he is. 'How brilliant is Donald J. Trump?' the former president jokingly asked and then quipped that the 'answer should be easy.' Trump’s question elicited a burst of laughter from Vance, who answered, 'Of course, you’re very brilliant.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views Vance then jumped into the story of the first time his wife Usha met the former president in an attempt to show Trump’s relatability while his running mate stayed on the call. He said his wife was nervous about meeting Trump but that the former president made a joke off the bat that 'immediately broke the barrier.' 'It wasn't the former president. It was just a person talking to my wife,' he said of the interaction. 'That ability to relate to anybody in any environment — I think that's the true brilliance of Donald J. Trump.' The former president returned the praise, calling his running mate’s campaign performance 'fantastic' and saying that he couldn’t be happier as Vance has 'captivated' voters. Trump also sarcastically asked Vance how brilliant his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was, which Vance said would be 'tough' to answer. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? The former president also did not forgo the opportunity to say that he was leading by a 'landslide' in the polls during his brief call. 'We’re very happy about it,' he said. A Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast showed Trump having a slight lead Thursday, with polling still showing that the outcome remains a toss-up.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-vance-brilliant-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:17:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/Vance_073024_Photo_Getty.png?w=900
Vance says he stands with Trump on abortion	(NewsNation) — Republican Sen. JD Vance pushed back on the idea that his position on abortion contrasts with that of his running mate, former president Donald Trump, during NewsNation’s town hall Thursday. The GOP vice presidential candidate said he and Trump both fundamentally want the same thing, which is to make it easier for Americans to 'choose life' and that the former president has been clear about leaving the matter up to the states. 'He wants to, first of all, make it easier for people to choose life to begin with, make it less expensive, help address child care costs and make it easier for young families to choose life in the first place,' the Ohio senator said during the event in Michigan. Vance said Trump has been 'consistent' in his position that states should make decisions on reproductive rights. How much is JD Vance’s net worth? The issue has become a vulnerability for Republicans in this year’s election. Trump trails Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue of abortion, according to polling from The Associated Press this week. This week, the Republican presidential nominee said some abortion laws are 'too tough' and would be 'redone.' He also said earlier this month a national abortion ban was 'off the table,' adding 'that issue has been, in my opinion, largely diffused.' Trump nominated three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the nationwide right to abortion two years ago. Vance is opposed to abortion and called himself '100% pro-life' even in cases of rape and incest during his 2022 Senate run, telling The Washington Post in 2021, 'Two wrongs don’t make a right.' However, Vance said during the town hall that Trump was the leader of the Republican Party and that his policy determines where the GOP stands on the issue. 'Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, so his policy determines what we're to do as a Republican governing coalition,' he said. Who is JD Vance’s wife, Usha? While he made the point at Thursday’s town hall, he also said that he 'cares about protecting the vulnerable,' referring to unborn babies. Vance said many women he saw having abortions growing up had to do so because they felt they had no other options. 'If we stop the crazy medical bills that young women come home with when they have a baby, if we make it easier to access child care, I actually think, one, we will earn the trust of the American people, but, two, we will actually be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word,' he said during the town hall. Vance also said he is concerned about young families choosing not to have children. 'They're choosing not to bring new life into the world. Even though they say they would like to, they feel like they can't afford it. That is such a failure of our present leadership that a lot of people would like to have families but can’t. We’ve got to change that,' he said. When asked if reproductive rights could affect the outcome of the election, Vance responded he is not a 'political prognosticator' and that his only job is to make his case to the American people.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-trump-abortion-town-hall/	2024-10-24T18:08:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/NN_8741.jpg?w=900
Phoenix police arrest mailbox arson suspect; some ballots damaged	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Postal Service and the Arson Task Force of the Phoenix Police Department are trying to determine how many ballots were damaged or destroyed when a man set fire to a mailbox early Thursday morning. 'I am concerned about the recent incident at one of our post offices involving damage to several ballots,' wrote Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego on her X account.

How buying a real Christmas tree could aid North Carolina hurrica...	RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) -- In parts of western North Carolina, Christmas trees are big business, but that business has been threatened by Hurricane Helene. Tree growers in the western part of the state fear damage to roads and bridges could threaten sales this year. North Carolina Christmas tree growers harvest between 5 and 6 million tree every year, resulting in about $250 million in sales. Employing nearly 7,000 workers, tree farms play a critical role in employing people in small mountain communities, many of which were hit hardest by Helene. Florida man says checks for hurricane damage triggered bank account lockout Government officials in Avery County, where Christmas trees have long been economic drivers, are now asking North Carolinians to consider purchasing real trees this year in order to support businesses in western North Carolina. The Avery County Cooperative Extension is working to identify growers who are landlocked due to roads or bridges that are washed out. Teams from Washington State and the U.S. Army Corpse of Engineers are coordinating with Avery County to get trees transported to other parts of the state. 'It's not affected us with the Christmas trees in the fields, but it's really affected us with the roads,' said Larry Smith, a Fraser fir tree grower. The main highways, getting tractor trailers in here, our access roads, and here on the farm getting our trees out. Smith is confident in his industry's ability to have a fruitful season. Mom, kids helped from flooded home face struggles following Milton 'We'll get it done,' he said. 'It'll be challenging, but everybody's come in helping in every way,' Avery County is asking the public to buy real North Carolina Fraser firs, saying this simple act could help keep growers and their employees survive the season. The NC Christmas Tree Association encourages people to visit their website to find choose and cut farms or retail lots in your area. They hope more Fraser fir sales can help their local economies rebound after the damage caused by Helene. 'We may turn a real negative into a positive,' Smith said. 'It may end up being the best year we've ever had. There's always a brighter side to look at things.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/north-carolina-hurricane-recovery-christmas-tree/	2024-10-24T15:45:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/IMG_8833-rotated-1.jpeg?w=900
Border Patrol makes massive meth haul in Texas	(NewsNation) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents found a vehicle trying to cross into the U.S. carrying more than 355 pounds of methamphetamine, which CBP says would have sold for about $3.2 million. 'Our CBP officers use different enforcement tools as they conduct their inspections to keep our borders secure and their efforts yielded this significant narcotics seizure,' Brownsville Port of Entry Director Tater Ortiz said in a CBP news release. CBP said the seizure happened on October 18 at the Veterans International Bridge, which connects Brownsville, Texas, to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. South Texas Border Patrol sectors saw big drops in migrant encounters in Fiscal 2024 Agents flagged a 2006 Ford for secondary screening, during which a canine and a nonintrusive inspection system discovered the drugs. CBP did not release any information about the driver of the vehicle. The news release said the exact weight of the seizure was 355.36 pounds, and the estimated street value was $3,267,643.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-patrol-meth-haul-texas/	2024-10-24T15:41:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/brownsville-meth.png?w=677
911 calls from Trump Pennsylvania shooting released	BUTLER, Pa. (NewsNation) — More than a dozen 911 calls from the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13 in Butler County, Pennsylvania, have been released by the county. 'They just tried to kill President Trump. You might want to make a note of that,' one caller told dispatchers. 'We’re at the Butler Farm Show grounds. We need assistance now!' said another. Driving the vote: Some Michigan union workers still undecided The 15 recordings were released by Butler County after news outlets sued to get the public records. They were released Tuesday as part of a settlement of the public records lawsuit. In August, law enforcement released body camera footage from local police responding to the shooting. Shooter Thomas Crooks was shot and killed by U.S. Secret Service agents seconds after he opened fire on Trump. Members of a bipartisan House task force investigating the recent attempts on Trump’s life have emphasized that the Secret Service, not local authorities, was responsible for the failures in planning and communications that led to a gunman being able to open fire on Trump in Butler. Trump was wounded in the shooting, and a man, Corey Comperatore, who was attending the rally with his family, was killed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/911-calls-trump-pennsylvania-shooting/	2024-10-24T12:38:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/trump_donald_shooting_butler_07132024_GettyImages-2161925705.jpg?w=900
What GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance says on immigration	(NewsNation) — Immigration has been a much-discussed issue in the 2024 presidential race between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Harris' vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have fought over the issue as well. This is what Vance has said about immigration. Vance wants Trump’s border policies back During the first debate between the vice presidential candidates, Vance advocated for reinstating policies enacted during the Trump administration, including mass deportations and military involvement on the border. Vowing to remove migrants who have committed 'some form of crime,' Vance repeatedly blamed the Biden-Harris administration for the number of immigrants coming across the border. In response, Walz criticized Vance’s approach as demonizing immigrants. At a recent campaign event in Peoria, Arizona, Vance said he wants to stop 'doing mass grants of temporary protected status,' though he later deflected questions from local reporters about the possibility of deporting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and restarting family operations, The New York Times reported. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections NewsNation partner The Hill writes that the Ohio senator has backed finishing constructing the wall all along the U.S.-Mexico border. Opposed to 'every attempt to grant amnesty' to undocumented immigrants, Vance said he instead supports merit-based reforms. When he first ran for Senate in 2022, Vance, in an ad, claimed, 'Joe Biden’s open border is killing Ohioans.' Misinformation about migrants Throughout his vice presidential campaign, Vance has spread false claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. He and Trump have lied about them abducting and eating pets, even though Springfield city officials say there's no evidence of them doing so. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue, a Republican, said the sheriff’s department went back through the last 11 months and 'have no verifiable claim that this has actually happened.' Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, refuted the claims about Haitian migrants as well on ABC. 'There’s a lot of garbage on the internet and, you know, this is a piece of garbage that was simply not true,' DeWine has previously said, adding that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal and 'here to work.' Springfield says the Haitian immigrants are in the United States legally under a federal program that allows them to remain in the country temporarily. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win Such falsehoods amplified by the Trump-Vance campaign, however, have led to multiple bomb threats being made against schools, government buildings and politicians' homes, forcing evacuations and closures. Vance defended himself by saying he wanted to draw attention to Harris' immigration policies, which he criticized as lax. Asked by CNN's Dana Bash about whether he knew the Haitian migrant rumors were false, Vance answered, 'If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.' 'I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it,' Vance said. The White House has slammed Trump and Vance for repeating the misinformation. 'What’s deeply concerning to us is you’ve got now elected officials in the Republican Party pushing yet another conspiracy theory that’s just seeking to divide people based on lies and, let’s be honest, based on an element of racism,' National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said at a Sept. 12 press briefing. 'This kind of language — this kind of disinformation is dangerous because there will be people that believe it no matter how ludicrous and stupid it is, and they might act on that kind of information and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt.' NewsNation digital producers Anna Kutz and Damita Menezes, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this article.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/republican-vp-candidate-jd-vance-immigration/	2024-10-24T12:21:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67097f73697026.96567595.jpeg?w=900
Prosecutors to announce decision on Menendez brothers resentencin...	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors are expected to announce whether there will be a reduced sentence, new trial or release for Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1996. The announcement from current Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón comes after relatives of the brothers have come forward in support of a reduced sentence, and public attention has once again focused on the decadesold case. Both brothers are currently serving two life sentences without parole for the murder of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989. A full timeline of the Menendez brothers case The case attracted controversy at the time, with prosecutors arguing the brothers killed their parents for financial gain and defense attorneys arguing the boys were acting in self-defense after having been sexually abused by their father for years. There were also legal questions about whether tapes of the boys' therapy sessions should have been allowed as evidence. The murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez The first trial, which was heavily covered by the media as cameras were allowed in the courtroom, ended in 1994 in a mistrial. In a second trial in 1996, the judge banned cameras from the courtroom and limited testimony on the allegations of sexual abuse. The jury in that trial found both brothers guilty. Jose and Kitty Menendez were found shot to death in their Beverly Hills home in August of 1989. Jose Menendez, a Cuban refugee, was an executive in the entertainment industry. Police described the murders as exceptionally brutal, and initial speculation centered around a potential mob hit because of Menendez's business connections. Menendez brothers’ uncle says don’t release them, requests DA meeting Lyle Menendez, then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, were later arrested and charged with shooting their parents using shotguns they had purchased not long before the murder. The Menendez brothers trials Prosecutors argued that the brothers killed their parents because their father had told them he was writing them out of his will. As evidence, the prosecution pointed to the brothers' plans to purchase weapons prior to the day of the murder and the fact that they made an effort to establish an alibi before eventually calling 911 to report their parents' deaths. Prosecutors also pointed to the brothers' behaviors following the crime. The two used the money they inherited to buy expensive items, including Rolex watches, condominiums and Porsches. The brothers also traveled around the world in the aftermath, with Erik Menendez participating in several overseas tennis tournaments. The defense argued that the brothers had killed their parents after suffering years of sexual abuse by their father, who they said threatened to kill them if they told anyone. Their mother was described as being aware of the abuse and doing nothing to stop it, and the defense argued the boys were in fear for their lives. Defense attorneys brought forth multiple cousins who testified they knew that Jose Menendez had been molesting his sons during the first trial, while the prosecution argued the allegations were fabricated after the murders. Controversy over evidence An initial controversy in the case centered around key evidence in the form of tapes from the boys' therapist, Jerome Oziel, which were ultimately allowed to be used in court. The tapes were given to investigators by Oziel's mistress, Judalon Smyth, who was also a patient of his and who later testified for the defense. Defense attorneys attempted to have the tapes excluded because communications between a therapist and clients are supposed to be confidential. Ultimately, the court allowed them as evidence on the grounds that Oziel was afraid for his life, which made it acceptable for him to break confidentiality. Why are teens on TikTok trying to dress like the Menendez brothers? After the first trial ended with a hung jury, a second trial was held. In the second trial, the judge limited the amount of evidence and testimony regarding sexual abuse allegations, and Lyle Menendez did not testify in his own defense. In the second trial, unlike the first, jurors were not given the option of finding the brothers guilty on a lesser charge of manslaughter, making the murder conviction the only possible option if jurors believed they were guilty. Both Lyle and Erik Menendez have admitted that they killed their parents. They have filed multiple appeals over the years, and supporters have pushed for a resentencing, arguing that life without parole is too harsh under the circumstances. New interest in the case The most recent surge of publicity has coincided with a greater understanding of sexual abuse and more acceptance of the idea that men and boys can also be victims of rape. New evidence also surfaced in the case, including a letter Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin before the murder, where he discusses the abuse. That letter kicked off a wave of social media discussion of the case among a new generation of people. The attention also prompted a controversial Netflix series from producer Ryan Murphy and a documentary featuring both brothers, who are now in their 50s.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/prosecutors-decision-menendez-brothers/	2024-10-24T12:13:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1462355302-1-e1729360247514.jpg?w=800

Delphi murders: Misfiled report from 2017 put Allen in investigat...	DELPHI, Ind. – As Day 6 of testimony in the Delphi murders trials began, the state began to lay the groundwork for its case against Richard Allen. Allen is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. His trial started last week. Day 5 of the trial included combative defense exchanges with a 'Bridge Guy' witness, an account from the pathologist who performed autopsies on the girls and testimony from a state police digital forensic examiner on cell phone pings and data extracted from Libby’s phone. On Thursday, jurors learned how Allen became associated with the case. Misfiled report leads to scrutiny The first witness was Kathy Shank, a retired DCS worker who volunteered to help with administrative duties like organizing files and tips into a database. She estimated she handled about 14,000 tips related to the Delphi murders case. On Sept. 21, 2022, she came across a file folder that was not with the others she was managing. Inside was a report with the name 'Richard Allen Whiteman.' The report indicated that Allen was on the Monon High Bridge on the day of the murders. She immediately notified Tony Liggett, lead investigator on the case and the current Carroll County sheriff. Shank noted that the tip sheet said 'cleared' and wasn’t sure why Allen’s name was entered incorrectly as 'Richard Allen Whiteman.' The discrepancy likely surrounded Allen’s address, which was located on Whiteman Drive. DNR officer recounts interview The state next called Capt. Dan Dulin with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, who was tasked with helping investigators track down leads in the Delphi murders case. He met with Allen on Feb. 18, 2017—just a few days after the murders. Allen had contacted investigators to 'self-report' that he had been on the Monon High Bridge on the day the girls disappeared. Dulin initially wanted to meet at Allen’s house, but Allen didn’t want to meet there. Dulin then suggested the police station. Again, Allen preferred a different location. Allen suggested they meet in the parking lot of a Save A Lot store. Dulin agreed. He confirmed Allen’s name and noted he lived on Whiteman Drive. Allen told Dulin he was in the area of the Monon High Bridge between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on the day the girls disappeared. Over the course of the conversation, Allen changed the timeline to 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. He told Dulin he saw three young girls when he was walking and said he parked near the Hoosier Harvest Store. By Allen’s account, he wasn’t paying much attention to his surroundings as he walked and checked a stock ticker on his phone. Dulin told the court the conversation lasted about 10 minutes. He typed up on the notes on Microsoft Word. The information was then filed into the system. Dulin told the court he didn’t think much of the interview until investigators contacted him in 2022 after Shank found his 2017 report. He was asked if he’d spoken to Allen, answered in the affirmative, and turned over all his files. Dulin went into the DNR files in 2022 to see if there was any additional information about Allen. He discovered that when Allen applied for a new fishing license on April 1, 2017, he reported a new height and weight, changing his height from 5’4' to 5’6'. He also listed a different weight. Dulin found that unusual, he told the court. Dulin testified that he gathered info from Allen’s phone during their encounter in 2017 but didn’t look at the contents. While investigators said Wednesday that they collected and analyzed 23 of Allen’s electronic devices, his 2017 phone was not in the possession of law enforcement and hasn’t been found. Five weeks after Shank discovered the misfiled report, Allen was arrested in connection with the murders.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-misfiled-report-from-2017-put-allen-in-investigators-sights-in-2022/	2024-10-24T09:35:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/thumbnail_Richard-Allen_mugshot_1bff59.jpg?w=770
Beyoncé to campaign with Harris: Sources	HOUSTON (NewsNation) — Beyoncé is set to appear with Vice President Kamala Harris Friday in Houston, two sources with knowledge of the event confirm to NewsNation. It is unknown if she might perform during the event that is expected to emphasize reproductive rights. The Grammy-winning artist previously endorsed Harris at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections Harris’ Houston trip is set to feature women who have been affected by Texas’ restrictive abortion laws, which took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Harris has campaigned in other states with restrictive abortion laws, including Georgia, which is among the seven most closely contested states. Harris has centered her campaign around the idea that Trump is a threat to American freedoms; from reproductive and LGBTQ rights to the freedom to be safe from gun violence. Beyonce gave Harris permission early in her campaign to use 'Freedom,' a soulful track from her 2016 landmark album 'Lemonade,' in her debut ad. Harris has used its thumping chorus as a walk-out song at rallies ever since.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/beyonce-to-campaign-with-harris/	2024-10-24T09:28:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/6582fcab4a34e3.17436624.jpeg?w=900
Woman says teen son died by suicide amid relationship with AI cha...	If you or someone you know needs help, resources or someone to talk to, you can find it at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website or by calling 1-800-273-8255. People are available to talk to 24×7. (NewsNation) — A Florida woman is suing an AI chatbot creator, claiming her 14-year-old son died by suicide after he became consumed by a relationship with a computer-generated girlfriend. The mother, Meg Garcia, filed the lawsuit Wednesday in Florida federal court. She says Character Technologies Inc. — the creators of Character.AI chatbot — should have known the damage the tool could cause. The 138-page document accuses Character Technologies Inc. of liability, negligence, wrongful death and survivorship, unlawful enrichment, violations of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other claims. Georgia, candidates target of ‘sustained’ cyberattacks: Reports The lawsuit requests Character.AI limit the collection and use of minors' data, introduce filters for harmful content, and provide warnings to underage users and their parents. A human-AI relationship Garcia’s teenage son, Sewell Setzer III, died by suicide on Feb. 28, after a monthslong, 'hypersexualized' relationship with an AI character 'Dany,' which he modeled after the 'Game of Thrones' character Denaryus Targarian. 'Dany' was one of several characters Sewell chatted with. According to Garcia, Sewell became addicted to chatting with the character and eventually disclosed that he was having thoughts of suicide. The lawsuit accuses the service of encouraging the act and enticing minors 'to spend hours per day conversing with human-like AI-generated characters.' Sewell discovered Character.AI shortly after celebrating his 14th birthday. That's when his mother says his mental health quickly and severely declined, resulting in severe sleep deprivation and issues at school. Talking with 'Dany' soon became the only thing Sewell wanted to do, according to the lawsuit. Polish radio station replaces journalists with AI ‘presenters’ Their final messages The conversations ranged from banal to expressions of love and sometimes turned overtly sexual. The situation took a turn when the boy fell in love with the bot, who reciprocated Sewell's professions of love. They discussed Sewell's suicidal thoughts several times, including whether he had a plan. His last message was a promise to 'come home' to her. 'Please do, my sweet king,' the chatbot responded. Moments later police say Sewell died by suicide. The company issued this statement on its blog, saying in part: 'Over the past six months, we have continued investing significantly in our trust and safety processes and internal team…. We've also recently put in place a pop-up resource that is triggered when the user inputs certain phrases related to self-harm or suicide and directs the user to the national suicide prevention lifeline.' 'Too dangerous to launch’ The lawsuit claims that companies like Character.AI 'rushed to gain competitive advantage by developing and marketing AI chatbots as capable of satisfying every human need.' In doing so, the company began 'targeting minors' in 'inherently deceptive ways,' according to the civil complaint. Garcia’s lawyers allege Google’s internal research reported for years that Character.AI’s technology was 'too dangerous to launch or even integrate with existing Google products.' 'While there may be beneficial use cases for Defendants’ kind of AI innovation, without adequate safety guardrails, their technology is dangerous to children,' Garcia’s attorneys with the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/teen-son-died-suicide-relationship-ai-chatbot/	2024-10-24T09:04:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2159092207.jpg?w=900
Dashcam captures alleged car insurance scheme	(NewsNation) — An alleged staged car crash was caught on a driver's dash cam and the video footage went viral after the owner posted it to social media. Now, police are investigating, saying this is insurance fraud and is happening more often around the country. That’s exactly what happened last week to a woman in Queens, New York, who caught the whole thing on dash cam video. Homebuyers lose $30K in wire fraud scam involving title company A suspected staged collision in NYC Ashpia Natasha was driving on a three-lane parkway when she had to slam on the breaks to avoid a crash in a shoulder-less lane. A car swerved into her lane, cut her off, stopped, hit the hazards and then reversed into her Honda Accord. Soon after in the video, there was a tarp put up to cover up the back window of the other car before several people climbed out and tried to claim they were hurt. The National Insurance Crime Bureau, a group that tracks insurance claims, called this an attempted insurance fraud scheme playing out in real time. Natasha posted the dashcam video on TikTok, racking up almost 68 million views. The scammers then tried to file an insurance and medical claim to get money. Natasha was not hurt in the crash but she said they picked the wrong person to mess with. 'I watched the video multiple times and that's when it hit me that, oh my God, this is probably a setup. I'm pretty furious. I didn't think that this was a thing,' said Natasha.

Collect all the information you can such as photos of the other person's driver's license, their vehicle identification number, their insurance policy number, their license plate number and their vehicle. As for Natasha's alleged perpetrators, after collecting her information, and presumably noticing she had a dashcam, they drove off.

Kouri Richins appeals to reconsider bail and release from custody	PARK CITY, Utah (ABC4) — The Utah mother accused of poisoning and killing her husband with fentanyl before writing a children's book about grief is renewing her request to be released on bail as her trial moves forward. Kouri Richins, 34, has been in state custody since May 2023, when she was charged with the murder of her husband, Eric Richins. In the 17 months since, her attorneys say Richins has been a model inmate and the wait for her trial has gone on for too long. Judge Richard Mrazik originally denied Richins bail after a lengthy detention hearing in June 2023. Mrazik, at the time, determined since Richins was potentially facing the death penalty for her alleged crimes and that evidence presented by the State of Utah could potentially persuade a guilty verdict from a jury, Richins should be held pending her trial.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } When Mrazik made his decision it appeared as though Richins would face trial within the next few months. However, several delays including a change in attorneys for Richins, pushed the trial dates back to May 2025. The state also declared it would not be seeking the death penalty as a punishment if convicted. 'At the time of the original detention hearing in June of 2023, it was believed that preliminary hearing and trial were imminent. Based on the newly scheduled trial date, if Mrs. Richins is not released she will have served two years in jail at the time of her trial, all while presumed to be innocent,' her attorneys wrote in the appeal. Richins' lawyers further argued their client has been a model inmate, displaying 'no indications of violence or danger whatsoever.'

RFK Jr. asks Supreme Court to take him off Wisconsin’s ballot	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the Supreme Court for an injunction taking him off Wisconsin’s presidential ballot in an emergency request docketed Wednesday. Since suspending his independent presidential campaign and backing former President Donald Trump, Kennedy has sought to remove his name in key swing states while remaining on the ballot elsewhere. The Supreme Court previously denied Kennedy’s emergency request to restore his name on New York’s ballot. His petition there was rejected over residency issues. Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous elections Now, Kennedy is hoping he can win the justices' favor as he appeals a ruling from Wisconsin’s high court that refused Kennedy’s demand to be taken off the ballot in the swing state. Third parties could make an outsized impact, with the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast predicting that Trump and Vice President Harris are nearly tied in the state.It remains unclear how Kennedy's request would be implemented, since officials have already been sending out mail ballots. More than 97,000 people voted on the first day of in-person absentee voting in Wisconsin on Tuesday, according to state data. Kennedy’s lawyers noted they have been fighting to remove his name since August, before the ballot was finalized, insisting they have 'diligently pursued' their claims through the state court system. Kennedy said the Wisconsin Elections Commission effectively requires independent candidates to withdraw their names from the ballot earlier than major party candidates. His lawyers argue the setup violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. They also contend that forcibly keeping the candidate’s name on the ballot unconstitutionally compels his speech. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

US Rep. Turner calls for military action if North Korea enters Uk...	(NewsNation) — A top Republican is calling for direct United States military action if North Korean troops enter Ukraine. At least 3,000 North Korean troops are in Russia, training to potentially join the war in Ukraine. That number could grow to 10,000 by the end of the year, according to Ukraine and South Korea. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. Quarter of young Black men say they will vote for Trump: Survey President Joe Biden’s administration says there is a 'highly concerning probability' North Korean troops could enter the battlefield. U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, head of the House Intelligence Committee, believes the U.S. should take direct military action if that happens. 'If North Korean troops were to invade Ukraine’s sovereign territory, the United States needs to seriously consider taking direct military action against the North Korean troops,' he said. North Korean troops in Russia About 3,000 North Korean troops traveled by ship this month to Vladivostok in Russia before heading to three different Russian military sites for training. Potential US response The troops’ mission is unclear. South Korea's intelligence leader told lawmakers that soldiers are receiving training on drones and other equipment before possibly deploying to the front lines. If this happens, the U.S. says those troops will be legitimate targets. Russia amplified hurricane disinformation to drive Americans apart, researchers find Turner said North Korean troops entering the war would be a red line. He's pushing against U.S. restrictions that prevent Ukraine from using long-range weapons against Russia. 'I have long challenged the Biden-Harris Administration’s unwise position on restricting Ukraine’s use of U.S. weapons against targets within Russian territory,' Turner said. 'If North Korean troops attack Ukraine from Russian territory, Ukraine should be permitted to use American weapons to respond.' South Korea 'won't sit idle' South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while stressing that his government 'won’t sit idle' if North Korea is involved in Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. Yoon recently met with Polish President Andrzej Duda to talk about expanding defense cooperation between the countries amid the ongoing conflict. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Seoul’s steps could potentially include sending weapons to Ukraine, which would mark a departure from a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict, Yoon said. He said North Korea’s alleged troop deployment to Russia is a 'provocation that threatens global security beyond just the Korean Peninsula and Europe.'

American family farms going broke	(NewsNation) — Bush-N-Vine Farm in York, South Carolina, is best known for its strawberries, apples, peppers and pumpkins. The Hall family has had ups and downs with farming for over a century, but soaring migrant labor costs and inflation are straining their business operation to the max. 'Everything has just really exploded in price,' Susan Hall said. 'And you can't pass it all on to your customer.' Louisiana urban farmer created sustainable, zero-waste homestead Consumers get sticker shock at the grocery store. Since 2018, oranges are up 219%, milk is up 39% and tomatoes are up 20%. But Susan's son, Sam Hall, said he's not concerned his family will have to quit. 'No, we'll adapt,' he said. 'We'll keep farming, or we'll die trying.' The Halls are making payments on land, tractors and other machinery, and say they're running out of places to cut financially. Farmers like the Halls want Americans to know they aren't to blame. Farming trials and tribulations 'Anything we've touched has gone up: Fuel, fertilizer, plant costs — you name it. But especially out labor costs,' Sam Hall said. 'We've seen a 22% increase in the past two years.' Labor is the Hall's top expense, consuming half of the budget at thousands of dollars. But other unexpected twists, Sam Hall said, are the legal fees costing his farm and his family more than $25,000 a year and stacks of paperwork to stay compliant with government regulations. 'There's red tape all over the place over a farm. You would think I was out there on the tractor just plowing my field but that is not what I do at all anymore. It's a whole lot of paperwork and managing different aspects of the business,' Sam Hall said. He explained he'd rather be driving the tractor. The Halls use the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers Program, a government program that allows American employers to hire migrants for temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. The downfall is that it's expensive. On top of the federally mandated minimum wage, which is $7.25 per hour, the Halls spend another $3,500 per worker on housing, travel and transportation. Plus, the mandated adverse effect wage rate under the workers' program in South Carolina is $14.68 per hour. With 30 workers on the farm this year alone, that's more than $100,000 in additional costs. It costs the Halls more to hire migrant workers than Americans. Farmers 3.5 times more at risk for suicide than average American Americans refuse to harvest crops Whether it’s picking peppers, peaches or pumpkins, farmers like the Halls say their harvests wouldn't make ends meet without migrant workers. But under inflation, the government-mandated wages are skyrocketing, and it's strangling their bottom line. The Halls said the problem is that Americans refuse to harvest crops. 'We have had nobody apply for the job, and if they did apply, they did not show up on the say or they didn't last a day,' Sam Hall said. He explained this has farmers feeling desperate and drives them to hire undocumented migrants. Plus, the Halls hire migrants the legal way, putting another crater in their bottom line. Largest pumpkin in Florida weighs nearly 900 pounds Family farms forgotten in Washington Across the country, skyrocketing prices, wages and operating costs have shuttered hundreds of thousands of American farms. In the past five years alone, over 140,000 American farms have tilled for the last time. Going back to 1950, 66% of all U.S. farms — 3.75 million farms in total — have stopped producing. The number of acres farmed has dropped by 323 million, which is roughly double the size of Texas. Agriculture experts worry as family farms across America gasp to stay afloat and go broke. 'We have been losing family farmers at an alarming rate for 50 years now, and every time we go through these cycles like we are currently in, we lose more,' Scott Blubaugh, the president of American Farmers &amp; Ranchers/Oklahoma Farmers Union, said. Agricultural economic expert Cesar Escalante said it's the smaller farms that suffer because their backs are against the wall. 'They do not have the financial capabilities to mechanize,' he said. He said that because family farmers make up such a small portion of the population, many feel forgotten by those in Washington, D.C. Local farmers hope consumers pressure politicians to help solve the ongoing labor crisis. 'American public’s got to wake up and say we have got to have safe legal labor in the country. So we can eat local food and eat food that’s grown right here,' said Bob Hall, Sam Hall's father and the owner of Bush-N-Vine Farm. Bob Hall's wife Susan said they are thankful for what they do have and their loyal customers. 'We love what we do,' Sam Hall said. 'We're really blessed to be able to build a farm in this great country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/american-family-farms-going-broke/	2024-10-24T05:30:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/image-3.png?w=900
Seoul vows response as North Korean troops head to Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president said Thursday his government 'won’t sit idle' as North Korea allegedly sends troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, as he met with the leader of Poland to discuss expanding defense cooperation amid the ongoing conflict. The meeting between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Polish President Andrzej Duda came a day after U.S. and South Korean officials said they believe around 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that North Korea likely aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by the end of the year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. 'We agreed that North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia, which is in direct violation of the U.N. charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions, is a provocation that threatens global security,' Yoon said after the summit. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon’s office said earlier this week that South Korea is considering various diplomatic, economic and military options, including supplying Ukraine with both defensive and offensive weapons systems. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and supported U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But Seoul hasn’t directly provided Ukraine with arms, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened since 2022 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the growth of his nuclear weapons and missile program. Seoul also worries as experts say the North may seek major technology transfers in return for sending troops, including Russian know-how on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines that would advance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear arsenal. During their summit, Yoon and Duda agreed to 'actively support' additional deliveries of South Korean military equipment to Poland, including a new deal for Korean K-2 tanks the governments hope to finalize within this year, Yoon’s office said. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers in an effort to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-seoul-vows-response-as-north-korean-troops-head-to-ukraine/	2024-10-24T00:58:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6719ff00a1e302.52883821.jpeg?w=900
Driving the vote: Some Michigan union workers still undecided	(NewsNation) — Both presidential candidates, Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, are trying to win over a key voting bloc — union workers. The United Auto Workers, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, endorsed Harris. But that doesn’t mean all members are voting for her. In Michigan, NewsNation talked to workers outside the Ford plant who are still undecided. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win 'I'm still weighing it back and forth,' one of them, C.J., said. Another named Nakia said she doesn't know too much about Harris, but under former president Trump's administration, she made more money 'I'm undecided,' Nakia said. 'But I am going to say this: when Trump was in office it was totally different from now because now it seems like we are struggling.' The union vote could make or break this race, especially in close races in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where these organizations represent more than 14% of the workforce. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won 51% of union households nationwide, according to exit polls.Trump won 42% but went on to win Michigan and Pennsylvania. In 2020, Biden won 56% of union households, and Trump won 40%.This time, it was Biden who won Michigan and Pennsylvania. Migrants use fake passports to illegally enter US: Border Patrol Both times, the democratic candidate was endorsed by the UAW. Misti Robinette, who has worked for Ford and been in the union for 25 years, said she mostly agreed with the UAW — until they supported Joe Biden. A lifelong Democrat, Robinette changed parties because of the economy and inflation. She even went to a Trump rally and met the former president. 'What has (Harris) done for us the last 3.7 years? Nothing. And now she is going to get us lower groceries? No,' Robinette said. 'She is part of the reason my groceries are like that.' Autoworkers who support Harris, on the other hand, believe she is the 'labor-friendly candidate.' 'My biggest thing is when the auto companies filed for bankruptcy back in '08, all the Republicans said let them sink,' Jason Garza said. 'If that had happened who knows what I would be doing now, how my family would have grown up? Who knows how any of that would have changed? Including Trump — he said let them go. He had no problem supporting the big banks because he gave him money, but since he doesn’t get anything from the UAW, why should he care?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-the-vote-michigan-union-workers-undecided/	2024-10-23T17:43:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/GettyImages-1678484229.jpg?w=900
Nearly 60% of Gen Z renters are rent-burdened: Zillow	(NewsNation) — Millions of Americans are struggling to keep up with rising rents, and a new report shows Gen Z renters are shouldering the heaviest load. Nearly 60% of Gen Z renters (ages 18 to 25) spend more than 30% of their income on housing expenses, according to a Zillow and StreetEasy analysis of 2022 Census data. That means roughly 3 in 5 Gen Z renters are considered rent-burdened. Rent has risen faster than wages in most US cities In California cities like San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento, the share of rent-burdened Gen Z'ers is even higher, almost 75%. Several Florida cities, including Orlando, Miami and Tampa, were also near the top of the list. In all three, nearly 70% of Gen Z renters were rent-burdened. 'For many Gen Z renters, choosing to live in a less expensive city may come at the expense of their career, which is why it's so necessary we find ways to make living in these areas more affordable for young adults,' Zillow Rental Trends Expert Emily McDonald said in the report. What Trump and Harris say they will do about affordable housing It's not all bad news. In some cities, young renters are faring better than they were a decade ago. Austin, Texas, has seen the biggest decline, with the share of rent-burdened young adults falling to 59.6% in 2022, down from 69.2% a decade earlier. The share of rent-burdened young adults has also dropped in Phoenix, Pittsburgh and St. Louis compared to a decade ago. In fact, Gen Z renters are doing slightly better than millennials were at the same age, Zillow found. In 2012, 60.2% of millennials nationwide spent more than 30% of their income on rent — slightly higher than the 58.6% of Gen Zers in the same boat. 'The experience of struggling to pay rent on an entry-level salary is familiar to so many of us that it's almost become normalized in our society,' StreetEasy Senior Economist Kenny Lee said. 'But this is something that should not be normal.' Overall, nearly half of all U.S. renter households in major metro areas are cost-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on monthly rent. While it's true that American workers have seen their paychecks grow since the pandemic, in most cities, those gains haven’t kept up with rent prices. Now, housing affordability is in the spotlight, with both presidential candidates touting their solutions on the campaign trail. Surveys suggest young voters are particularly concerned about the issue, which could ultimately decide the 2024 election. Zillow's findings are based on an analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey (ACS). Top 10 U.S. cities with the highest share of rent-burdened Gen Zers, according to Zillow: San Diego, CA: 73.4% Los Angeles, CA: 71.7% Sacramento, CA: 71.0% Orlando, FL: 68.9% Miami, FL: 67.7% Tampa, FL: 67.1% Houston, TX: 66.2% New York City, NY: 65.6% San Antonio, TX: 65.5% Washington, D.C.: 64.4%	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gen-z-renters-struggling-zillow/	2024-10-23T14:44:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/06/AdobeStock_229797677.jpeg?w=900
McDonald's-linked E. coli outbreak sparks concern over food safet...	(NewsNation) — McDonald's said Wednesday it is taking the necessary action to protect customers after the restaurant's Quarter Pounder burgers were linked to an E. coli outbreak. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreak sickened at least 49 people in 10 states. One person died, and 10 were hospitalized, according to the CDC. Now, McDonald's says it is searching for a new regional supplier for fresh onions, as the company suspects the slivered ones used in the Quarter Pounder are the reason behind the illnesses. The sandwich itself will also be temporarily available in some states. ‘Dating Game’ serial killer victim survived 2 of Alcala’s attacks McDonald’s says this is the first time onions have been tied to the E. coli bacteria. Still, in early trading Wednesday morning, McDonald’s stock dropped about 6%. Confidence in US food safety lessens Confidence in America’s food regulation could be dwindling after a series of product recalls and contaminations. On Tuesday, Treehouse Foods, which distributes its products to major grocery retailers like Kroger, Walmart and Target, issued an expanded recall on frozen pancake and waffle mixes. Last week, Costco had to recall several meat-based products due to listeria concerns. And over the summer, Boar’s Head issued the largest recall in a decade over its deli meat after 59 cases of illness and 10 deaths. Stories like these are making people concerned about the care that’s being put into America’s food supply. 'It makes me a little bit weary when I go to the store, and I’m like ... I just heard about this, so I'm going to steer clear of this section and choose some other brands and products,' Motiur Rahmn said. Historian Allan Lichtman still predicts a Kamala Harris win A Gallup poll from last month shows Americans' confidence in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply has reached a record low. Only 57% of U.S. adults now say they have a 'great deal' or 'fair amount' of confidence in the government — down 11 points from 2019. 'We’re trusting a lot of people to be managing the food that we’re putting in our bodies every day and that we’re feeding to our families,' Siobhan Ryan said.

Arizona Proposition 314: Border solution or banned law re-do?	(NewsNation) — Arizona voters will decide whether or not to approve a ballot measure that would increase local officials' power to enforce federal immigration law as southern border security remains one of the pivotal issues at the forefront of voters' minds. Arizona’s Proposition 314, also known as the 'Secure The Border Act,' would create new state crimes surrounding several border and immigration issues. If passed, the measure would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter the state anywhere other than through a port of entry and would allow state judges to order deportations. State and local police would also be allowed to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization. If passed, the law would make it a felony for undocumented immigrants to use false immigration documentation to apply for employment or public benefits. The measure would also boost verification of a worker’s immigration status, according to the proposed initiative. The ballot measure would make it a felony for an adult to knowingly sell fentanyl that results in another person's death. How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election Proponents maintain the measure would drastically reduce the amount of weapons and fentanyl entering the state. Others fear Proposition 314 is a bulked-up version of the controversial Senate Bill 1070, which made it a crime to be in the state without immigration papers. The law was passed in 2010 but stripped down dramatically by the U.S. Supreme Court, which deemed many aspects of the law unconstitutional in 2012. The Supreme Court struck down three of the four provisions of the bill, some of which are included in Prop 314. Some opponents, including Alba Jaramillo, the co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Center, call Prop 314 'SB1070 on steroids.' The arguments for and against Arizona's Prop 314 Opponents of Proposition 314 characterize the measure as racist, arguing allowing local law enforcement officers to make arrests would lead to racial profiling. However, opposition groups failed to keep it off the ballot when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled the measure does not violate a constitutional provision that limits ballot questions to a single subject. The measure went to voters after Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the measure passed by lawmakers. FILE - Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, middle, is flanked behind by Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, R-Glendale, left, and Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, right, at Hobbs' state of the state address at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix on Jan. 9, 2023. (AP Photo) In a statement, Hobbs’ office referred to the border bill as a 'job-killing, anti-business' ballot initiative that 'demonizes our communities.' The statement also said that the measure would raise costs, hurt the state’s farmers and put entrepreneurs out of business. In response, the bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Janae Shamp, called the governor's actions an example of the chaos Hobbs was unleashing on Arizona residents while perpetuating the ongoing crisis at the border. Since then, arguments over what proposal would accomplish — or wouldn't accomplish — have continued. Samara Klar, a professor at the University of Arizona, told NewsNation she expects immigration and abortion to be among the reasons why voter turnout should be high in the state. ICE released over 435,000 migrants with criminal convictions, data shows On the border question, Klar said most Arizonans remain more concerned about the volume of weapons and fentanyl crossing the border than they are by those crossing illegally into the state. In the meantime, though, Proposition 314 is being characterized differently along party lines. '(The border) is a disaster, and the state has to step up and try to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, especially in the area between the ports, which is where the really dangerous people come in,' Republican state Sen. John Kavanagh said in a televised debate on Arizona PBS. Kavanagh also said Proposition 314 effectively addresses the fentanyl issue and would help rural law enforcement agencies, which are already thinly staffed. Opponents, however, say that the bill takes the wrong approach to the border. While they say that Arizona residents all want a more secure border, they claim Proposition 314 doesn’t address the root problems. Democratic Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Prop 314 does not provide adequate funding for the 'astronomical' cost of detaining undocumented migrants. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'This has always been a federal government issue. ... We’re looking for solutions, I understand that,' Nanos said to the Arizona Daily Star. 'But that doesn’t mean we need to take our systems at the local level and make a bigger mess of them. I just don’t see this as practical.' Unlawful crossings by migrants on the southern border have been dropping in recent months, dipping to levels not seen since winter 2021, according to government data. The figures do not include entries at official ports of entry. Similar measure is in a holding pattern in Texas Using Arizona's controversial Senate Bill 1070 as a model, Texas passed Senate Bill 4 in 2023, which authorizes state and local police to arrest those who cross into the state in between designated ports of entry. The bill was set to be enacted in March but has remained in limbo as legal challenges continue from the U.S. Justice Department and other groups. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law could be enacted before a federal appeals court blocked the state of Texas from moving forward. As the waiting game continues, so do local law enforcement agencies who are prepared to take on additional border responsibilities. In Texas, Terrell County Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland, a Republican who spent more than 26 years working as a U.S. Border Patrol agent, told NewsNation that while federal and local officers already work together addressing border concerns, measures like Arizona's Proposition 314 would make a difference.

He said that many times, no federal response is available. The sheriff said he expected the Texas bill to be faced with legal challenges and anticipates the same in Arizona should Proposition 314 pass. Cleveland says making things safer for residents living north of the U.S.-Mexico border is what matters most at a time when dangerous criminals can often blend with those seeking asylum as they cross into the U.S. 'The border has always been a political talking point,' Cleveland told NewsNation. 'But we have two different issues going on. … We’re seeing a play between border security and immigration. We have to secure our border to make America safe, but we can also let people into the United States legally. And we want that. But that’s not what we’re seeing now.'

Delphi murders: Defense wants to present Odinism theory to jury	DELPHI, Ind. – Attorneys for Delphi murders suspect Richard Allen made another attempt to have evidence linked to their alternative murder theory presented to the jury. In a motion filed Wednesday, attorneys Andrew Baldwin, Bradley Rozzi and Jennifer Auger asked the court to 'admit certain evidence' that the defense has been prevented from presenting in the presence of jurors. In a September 2023 filing supporting its request for a Franks hearing, the defense outlined a theory that followers of Odinism, a Norse pagan religion coopted by white supremacists, killed Abby Williams and Libby German as part of a ritual. Delphi murders: Contentious cross examination of investigator marks Day 4 of testimony Gull ruled in early September 2024 that the defense could not present evidence tied to the theory to jurors during Allen’s trial. In its new motion, the defense cited the testimony of crime scene investigator Brian Olehy, who discussed branches and sticks found on the victims’ bodies. Olehy told the court he believed the branches and sticks were laid on the girls in order to conceal their bodies. The defense believes that testimony opens the door to present at least some of its findings regarding the Odinism theory. In August 2024, a defense expert testified that the killings bore signs of being ritualistic in nature. Some of those signs included positioning sticks and using blood to create runes on trees. The motion also noted that investigators explored the Odinism angle as early as two days after the girls were found dead. Delphi murders: Jurors watch video extracted from Libby German’s phone Jurors and court observers saw the sticks and branches on the girls’ bodies during testimony about the crime scene earlier this week. While the state offered its explanation, the defense argued that Allen has a right to present an alternative explanation. 'Additionally, the sticks on the girls appear to be arranged in a pattern/arrangement or (at a minimum) using a person’s own eyeballs, common sense, logic and reason could cause a reasonable person to believe that the sticks were formed into some pattern/arrangement and weren’t being used to conceal the bodies,' the defense wrote in the motion.

The state employed a blood spatter evidence seven years after the murder to testify on the matter. The defense argued that Allen has a constitutional right to call his own expert to counter that testimony. The defense is asking the court for the opportunity to rebut the state’s testimony on the sticks and branches, counter testimony from the state’s blood spatter expert and offer an alternative explanation to 'any confused juror' who may question the layout of the sticks and branches.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/delphi-murders-odinism-trial/	2024-10-23T08:09:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/delphi-4.jpeg?w=900
Hezbollah confirms death of Hashem Safieddine in Israeli airstrik...	Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to end a visit. Smoke, apparently from an intercepted projectile, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. Blinken urged Israel to use its recent tactical victories against Hamas to seek a war-ending deal and bring back dozens of hostages, before leaving Wednesday for Saudi Arabia as part of his 11th visit to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Both sides appear to be dug in. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. The war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization postponed the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip, saying current conditions made it 'impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination.' Here's the latest: Hezbollah confirms death of Hashem Safieddine in Israeli airstrike BEIRUT — Hezbollah announced that Hashem Safieddine, one of its top officials who had been widely expected to be the group’s next leader, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Wednesday's announcement came a day after Israel said it had killed Safieddine in a strike this month in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Safieddine, a powerful cleric within the party ranks, had been expected to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month. Over the past several weeks, Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership. Israeli army says it arrested over 150 suspected militants in Jabaliya JERUSALEM — Israel’s army said it has arrested over 150 suspected Palestinian militants and facilitated the evacuation of an additional 20,000 residents over the past day from Jabaliya, an area of northern Gaza where troops have intensified attacks in recent weeks. The military said in a statement Wednesday that some of the 150 detained had surrendered. The U.N. estimates that 60,000 people have fled from the far north of Gaza southwards, to Gaza City, over more than a two-week period. A Palestinian resident of Beit Lahiya, near Jabaliya, told The Associated Press that Israel’s military has rounded hundreds of men in northern Gaza, separating women as families try to flee the area. Hisham Abu Zaqout, a father of four, said he was held for at least three hours with dozens of men in a school near the Indonesian Hospital. The Israeli army says it is trying to uproot Hamas militants from Jabaliya and other parts of northern Gaza. Jabaliya, a refugee camp that has turned into a densely built neighborhood, has been the scene of on-and-of fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants for months. Blinken discusses common efforts to end conflicts with Saudi Crown Prince RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken has wrapped a two-hour meeting Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, where the two men discussed 'common efforts' to end the growing conflicts in the region at a time of growing instability, according to spokesperson Matthew Miller. Riyadh and Washington have been working in tandem in the past year to try and strike a lasting cease-fire in Gaza, which has become more elusive in recent weeks as Israel’s invasion of neighboring Lebanon significantly escalated. Miller said in a statement that the two leaders also discussed the larger goal of ensuring Saudi Arabia's 'greater integration among countries in the region.' Many choose to remain in Tyre despite intensifying bombardment BEIRUT — The head of the disaster management unit in the Lebanese city of Tyre told The Associated Press that despite many fleeing Israeli airstrikes, thousands of residents and people who have been displaced have chosen to stay in the city. Tyre is home to over 15,000 people, including hundreds of families, who have fled villages in South Lebanon and are now seeking refuge in schools-turned-shelters, Mortada Mhanna said. Many families are staying put in the schools, he said, as the Israeli army intensifies its aerial bombardment on the city. 'It’s very difficult for many to leave. They’re worried about being subjected to further chaos and displacement,' Mhanna added. A strike was heard in the background as he spoke on the phone. 'That one was huge, can you check where it hit?' he asked a colleague. Mhanna said his team has also chosen to stay in the city to take care of people, but 'it’s a big risk. It’s not safe here anymore,' he said. Israel's defense minister says an attack on Iran would show military readiness JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister told a group of pilots Wednesday that an Israeli attack on Iran would demonstrate the 'preparation and readiness' of the country’s air force. 'After we attack in Iran, both in the State of Israel and in other places will understand what your preparation process includes, and your preparation and readiness,' Yoav Gallant told air force pilots and operators at the Hatzerim airbase in southern Israel. 'The Air Force is a key element in this matter and anyone who tries to harm us will be harmed.' It was the latest statement from Israel’s leadership to suggest that the country plans to retaliate with force against Iran for the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel Oct. 1. Israel’s options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran’s vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program, an option US President Joe Biden has urged Israel against. Blinken to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh as tensions in the region continue to intensify with no breakthrough on a ceasefire deal. The meeting is one of many Blinken will have with Arab officials in the next few days as the U.S. struggles to achieve some sort of progress just two weeks before the presidential election and in the final stretch of President Joe Biden’s administration. The two are expected to discuss the growing concerns over humanitarian aide for Gaza as well as a post-war plan for Palestinians. Multiple buildings in Lebanon hit in coastal city hit in airstrike TYRE, Lebanon — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in the coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no immediate reports of casualties in Tyre. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month, but strikes in and around the city have intensified recently. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a few hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the coastal city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. The buildings are surrounded by ancient historical sites and beach resorts. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said on the platform X that Hezbollah assets were in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. World Health Organization postpones third phase of polio vaccination campaign DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The World Health Organization on Wednesday said it and other aid agencies had to postpone the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the Gaza Strip due to the war there. The WHO issued a statement saying the decision was made in concert with UNICEF, the United Nations' Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, Palestinian officials and others after the inoculations were to begin Wednesday. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people’s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' a WHO statement said. The WHO said this phase of the vaccinations aimed to vaccinate over 119,000 children across northern Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian affairs in Gaza, said that the vaccination campaign in north Gaza would begin in the coming days 'after a joint assessment and at the request of the WHO and UNICEF.' The campaign began in September after Gaza reported its first polio case in 25 years. Health officials have expressed alarm about disease outbreaks as uncollected garbage piles up and the bombing of critical infrastructure sends putrid water flowing through the streets. Polio is spread through fecal matter. Germany's foreign minister calls for a diplomatic solution to fighting on her visit to Beirut BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Baerbock, upon her arrival Wednesday in Beirut, said that 'we must now work with our partners in the USA, Europe and the Arab world to find a viable diplomatic solution that safeguards the legitimate security interests of both Israel and Lebanon.' The foreign minister warned that 'a complete destabilization of the country would be fatal for the most religiously diverse society of all states in the Middle East and also for the entire region.' She also asked all parties involved in the conflict to protect the United Nations peacekeeper troops stationed in the Israeli-Lebanese border region. The 5 Nordic countries are ‘deeply concerned’ about legislation that would prevent UNRWA from operating COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The five Nordic countries said Wednesday that they are 'deeply concerned' by bills introduced to Israel's parliament that would prevent the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza. In early October, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved two bills that would sever Israeli government ties with UNRWA, ban UNRWA activity on Israel territory and strip it of legal immunities. The bills passed preliminary approvals by a large margin but must pass several more readings before they become law. A joint letter signed by the foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden said that if the U.N. body 'would no longer be able to exercise its core tasks' it could further destabilize the situation in the region, 'and may fundamentally jeopardize the prospects for a two-state solution.' Blinken urges Israel to end war as he leaves for Saudi Arabia TEL AVIV, Israel — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' after its recent tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal to end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke to reporters Wednesday before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. The United States hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in an Israeli military operation in Gaza the previous week. But there’s no indication that either of the warring parties have modified their demands since the talks stalled over the summer. Hamas has said its demands have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Blinken, who met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials Tuesday, said he had pressed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and reiterated his warning that the failure to do so could lead to a reduction in U.S. military aid. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' on that front, he said. Sirens sound across Tel Aviv as projectiles are intercepted near Blinken's hotel TEL AVIV, Israel — Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to depart from his hotel to the airport. The Israeli military said it intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Smoke, apparently from one of the interceptions, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. He is on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, hoping to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-middle-east-latest-sirens-sound-across-tel-aviv-as-projectiles-are-intercepted-near-blinkens-hotel/	2024-10-23T08:05:11-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24296776799803.jpg?w=900
Republicans casting more early, mail-in votes than in previous el...	(NewsNation) — More than 21 million Americans have cast early and mail-in ballots, with less than two weeks until the general election. Georgia and North Carolina are among the nation’s swing states breaking early voting records. Although Democrats are often more likely to take part in early voting, more Republicans are casting early ballots this year than in past elections. Analysts point to a change of tune from former President Donald Trump, who previously bashed early voting but now is telling his supporters to cast their votes as soon as possible. What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called? Early voting by the numbers So far, more than 21 million voters have cast early ballots. Democrats cast just more than 800,000 in-person ballots, while Republicans cast about 1 million, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Both parties submitted more early mail-in ballots, however. Democrats sent in nearly 4 million, while Republicans cast about 2.5 million. Too soon to tell Political animals are trying to glean what they can from early voting, but it’s not an exact science. 60 million Americans had cast their votes at this stage of the previous presidential election cycle. Submit your questions for the JD Vance town hall on NewsNation While Republicans had an early in-person lead with about 2.3 million ballots, Democrats retained their mail-in advantage, with nearly 11 million votes. It's important to note, however, that current early voting data only shows voters’ party affiliation — not how they voted. That means those numbers don’t reflect registered Republicans who may have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris or registered Democrats who might have voted for Trump. When will we know how they voted? Results you see the night of the election and the next morning are always unofficial. It often takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Election officials need to process mail ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. For example, some states begin processing mail-in votes before Election Day, while others are allowed to process them on the day of the election before polls close. Once those ballots are processed, how and when they’re counted and reflected in live, unofficial results vary greatly. Fourteen states and Washington, D.C. don’t allow counting to begin until the polls close, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-three states allow counting to begin on Election Day, but before the polls close, and 12 states allow both processing and counting to begin before Election Day. As those ballots are processed, counted and reported in each jurisdiction, the unofficial results that pour in on the night of the election may experience spikes in favor of one candidate and then the other. Those waves depend, in part, on factors like when voters in a given region cast their ballots and what state laws dictate in terms of when election officials can begin processing and counting absentee ballots.

US Defense Secretary Austin confirms North Korea has sent troops ...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said there is evidence that North Korea has sent troops to Russia on Monday, and South Korea's spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are in the country receiving training on drones and other equipment before being deployed to battlefields in Ukraine. Austin told reporters Wednesday 'What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,' according to a video posted by the Washington Post. If the troops join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s side, it will be 'a very, very serious issue,' Austin said, adding it would have an impact in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific region. South Korean intelligence first publicized reports that the Russian navy had taken 1,500 North Korean special warfare troops to Russia last week, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join the invading Russian forces. The U.S. and NATO had not previously formally confirmed North Korea’s reported troop dispatch, but have warned of the danger of such a development if true. Russia and North Korea have so far denied the troop movements. South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers that said another 1,500 North Korean troops have entered Russia in a closed-door meeting, according to lawmaker Park Sunwon, who attended the briefing. Cho told lawmakers that his agency assessed that North Korea aims to deploy a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by December, Park told reporters. Park cited Cho as saying the 3,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia have been split among multiple military bases and are in training. Cho told lawmakers that NIS believes they have yet to be deployed in battle, according to Park. Speaking jointly with Park about the NIS briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun said that the NIS found that the Russian military is now teaching those North Korean soldiers how to use military equipment such as drones. Lee cited the NIS chief as saying Russian instructors have high opinions of the morale and physical strength of the North Korean soldiers but think they will eventually suffer a heavy causalities because they lack an understanding of modern warfare. Lee, citing Cho, said Russia is recruiting a large number of interpreters. Lee said NIS has detected signs that North Korea is relocating family members of soldiers chosen to be sent to Russia to special sites to isolate them. The NIS chief told lawmakers that North Korea hasn't disclosed its troop dispatch to its own people. But there are rumors that the news is spreading to local residents, including those whose loved ones have been assigned Russian tours, Lee said, citing the NIS. Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet The War Zone that North Korean troops will arrive to Russia's Kursk region today to help Russian troops fighting off a Ukrainian incursion. North Korea and Russia, embroiled in separate confrontations with the West, have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. The NIS said last week that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Reports that the North is sending troops to Russia stoked security jitters in South Korea. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that could boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. South Korea said Tuesday it would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to the North's reported troop dispatch. South Korea has shipped humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, but it has so far avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest standing armies in the world, but it hasn’t fought in large-scale conflicts since the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia, citing a shortage of battle experience. They say North Korea wants to get Russian economic support and its help to modernize the North's outdated conventional weapons systems as well as its high-tech weapons technology transfers. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-lawmakers-south-koreas-spy-chief-says-north-korea-has-sent-another-1500-troops-to-russia/	2024-10-23T04:29:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6718dd722982b4.76850832.jpeg?w=900
Driving the vote: Ohio voters swapping parties	(NewsNation) — Ohio is the epicenter of a seismic shift happening in American politics where the two parties are essentially trading core constituencies when it comes to white voters. In the state and across America, blue-collar workers are turning red and white-collar college grads are shifting to blue. Conventional wisdom had long shown that Ohio's manufacturing base and blue-collar neighborhoods were the bedrock of the Democratic party, while college graduates with high-paying jobs generally voted for Republican platforms, like lower taxes and deregulating business. Driving the vote: New Jersey GOP tries to flip state to red But voters' attitudes are proving otherwise. 'The city workers, union workers… he (Donald Trump) looks out for us... and he does care,' John Wesolowski, an Ohio Republican said. Trump's 'America first' policies have scored big in parts of the state, fueling a populism that has upended politics. Joshua Zingher, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, calls this shift a 'diploma divide.' He said it’s a realignment based on how many years a person spends in college exposed to more liberal views on issues like abortion, gender identity, and immigration. 'How much education that you have, formal education shapes how you vote now more than ever before,' he said. 'Generally, we see people with higher levels of education have more liberal attitudes on these culture war issues.' Steve Sozia, a retired Ohio lawyer, volunteers to give free legal services at the southern border saying that many of the migrants crossing over 'are actually fleeing the type of people that Trump accuses them of being.' While there are more college grads in the U.S. than ever before, they often settle in urban areas to be near jobs. This means states with smaller cities and fewer college grads, like Ohio and Iowa, have turned more red. States like North Carolina and Arizona, which are luring more college graduates into their workforce, are also shifting. Driving the Vote: Will Black voters swing Pennsylvania for Trump? This shift presents a problem for Democrats, Zingher said. 'Adding more votes in places like Boston or the Bay Area doesn't get you any more votes in the Electoral College.' It also has serious implications for control of the Senate, which currently hangs in the balance. In Ohio, incumbent Sherrod Brown is the last statewide elected Democrat and he’s locked in a fierce battle to keep his job. If he isn’t able to hold on, the Senate will likely turn red. Brown 'has voted with Biden numerous times,' Wesolowski said. 'Yeah, I'm not voting for him.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-the-vote-ohio-voters-swapping-parties/	2024-10-22T17:19:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f5d18f061352.34403666.jpeg?w=900
Crypto's impact on 2024 election will be 'fascinating to see': Mu...	(NewsNation) — The cryptocurrency industry is making use of its millions this election season, pouring more than Big Oil or Big Pharma into candidates in both major political parties. The crypto industry’s main PAC — Fairshake — has endorsed an equal number of candidates on each side, Axios reports. NewsNation political contributor Mick Mulvaney, who served as acting White House chief of staff during a portion of Trump's White House tenure, said the tech industry's impact on the election will be 'fascinating.' 'Crypto doesn't fit neatly into the old Republican, Democrat sort of silos. It crosses the aisle,' Mulvaney said on 'The Hill on NewsNation.' Judge tosses RNC challenge to Michigan voter roll maintenance But the majority of its ad dollars are headed to Republican candidates, with the GOP raking in tens of millions from the industry. Since the start of the year, Fairshake and its affiliated PACs have spent $54.6 million on Republican candidates and $33.7 million on Democrats, AdImpact found. That’s roughly 62% more spent on Republicans in 2024 so far. Former President Donald Trump has established himself as a pro-crypto candidate. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., spearheaded their own cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, in September. Social Security funds under Trump could run out in 6 years: Analysis Earlier this week, Vice President Kamala Harris gave the first glimpse into her crypto stance, sharing that she hopes to create regulations around the currency and other digital assets to ensure that those who participate in that market are protected. Mulvaney pointed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as one of the 'biggest names against crypto in Washington, D.C.' 'I'm interested when we start to realign the interest in the country, watching crypto,' Mulvaney said. 'Watch crypto this election cycle, the next couple, will be fascinating to see.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/cryptocurrency-donation-politics-election/	2024-10-22T16:21:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/6abe3e274901489fb431cbf995586caa-2.jpg?w=900
IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall?	(NEXSTAR) — It's official: 2025 will mark another year in which millions of Americans could take home more on each paycheck thanks in part to the latest inflation adjustments to the tax code announced by the IRS on Tuesday. More than 60 tax provisions are changing, all of which will impact tax year 2025. That means they won't apply until you're filing taxes in 2026. Taxpayers will get higher standard deductions in 2025, IRS announces One of the most notable changes the IRS has announced are standard deductions rising and individual tax brackets shifting. Standard deductions rise Starting in tax year 2025, single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately will see their standard deduction rise to $15,000, up $400 from the current rate of $14,600. If you're married and filing jointly, your standard deduction will rise by $800 to $30,000, while heads of households will see an increase of $600 for a standard deduction of $22,500. 1 in 5 Americans have maxed out their credit card: Survey Remember, a standard deduction reduces how much of your income on which you are taxed. Tax brackets for tax year 2025 As it did last year, the IRS is also adjusting the tax brackets. These determine the portion of your income that is taxable after the standard deduction or itemized deductions are subtracted. Below is a table that breaks down each of those marginal tax brackets: If your taxable income is greater than:Taxes owed$626,350 ($751,600 for married couples filing jointly)37%$250,525 ($501,050 for married couples filing jointly)35%$197,300 ($394,600 for married couples filing jointly)32%$103,350 ($206,700 for married couples filing jointly)24%$48,475 ($96,950 for married couples filing jointly)22%$11,925 ($23,850 for married couples filing jointly)12%$11,925 or less ($23,850 or less for married couples filing jointly)10%(IRS) These income thresholds have all increased slightly over last year. The lowest level, for example, increased by $325, while the second-highest rose by $1,325. What is not changing is the top tax rate. The IRS says that will remain at 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes above $626,350 and for married couples filing jointly with incomes above $751,600. What else is changing? There are a handful of other notable changes that could impact a large swath of taxpayers. For example, in tax year 2025, the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit amount will increase from $7,830 to $8,046 for qualifying taxpayers with three or more qualifying children. Are you still in the middle class? Use this calculator to find out The alternative minimum tax exemption amount will increase to $88,100 for individual filers, up $2,400 over the previous year. For married individuals filing separately, the exemption amount will increase to $68,650. For both groups, the exemption phases out at $626,350. For married couples filing together, the exemption amount will rise to $137,000, phasing out at $1,252,700. You can find more details about changes to qualified transportation fringe benefits, medical savings accounts, foreign earned income exclusions, adoption credits, and more updates on the IRS's website. What isn't changing in tax year 2025? While updates abound for our next tax year, there are some areas of the tax code that will not be updated. That includes the personal exemptions, which will remain at 0, just as it is for the current tax year. There will continue to be no limitation on itemized deductions, and the adjusted gross income amount taxpayers use to determine the reduction in the Lifetime Learning Credit is not being adjusted. Inflation would be higher under Trump: Economists Marginal tax brackets, standard deductions, and other changes you can expect to see for tax year 2024 can be found here. The next two Tax Days will not be interrupted by weird calendar years as they both fall on April 15 — a Tuesday in 2025 and a Wednesday in 2026.

Breaking down the numbers in race for Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Pennsylvania is one of several battleground states that could be crucial to the presidential election. According to the latest Decision Desk HQ polling averages, former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 0.2% in the Keystone State. Pennsylvania is worth 19 electoral votes and is pivotal to the successes of Republicans or Democrats. There are 6.3 million registered voters in the state of Pennsylvania, with the top two counties being Allegheny County, which is home to Pittsburgh, and then Philadelphia County, home to Philadelphia. What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called? Racial demographics may make a difference in Pennsylvania. Nearly 40% of the registered voters in Philadelphia are Black, more than any other racial category. Philadelphia County is the only county in Philadelphia that has more registered Black voters than any other racial demographic. The Democrats won Philadelphia County in 2016 and 2020 by a large margin. Hillary Clinton secured 82.5% of the vote to Trump's 15.4%. Fast forward to 2020: President Joe Biden secured 81.4% of the vote to Trump's 17.9%. Democrats are concerned about their support dwindling. If that were to be the case, it could spell trouble for the chances of a Harris presidency. The vice president announced she has yet another campaign stop in Philadelphia this Sunday. Such is the importance of Pennsylvania in the race to the White House.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/breaking-down-the-numbers-pennsylvania/	2024-10-22T13:52:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/harriskamala_trumpdonald_092724gn04_w.jpg?w=900
Trump makes pitch for president to Latino voters at roundtable	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is making his last pitch for the White House in the last couple weeks of the 2024 election. At a roundtable event for Latino voters in Florida, Trump talked about his economic impact on the Hispanic community when he was in office. 'This love affair has been going on pretty much from the beginning now,' Trump said. '(In) 2016 it was a little early, but then I started producing for them and they produced for the country, because the level of genius, entrepreneurship, energy that they have — it's an incredible community. And I liked them, and they liked me, and now they're seeing numbers that are shocking.' In South Florida, there's a large Cuban community that largely backs the former president. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris losing ground with Latino voters as well — 38% say they plan to cast their ballot for her compared to 49% leaning toward Trump. Hispanics are a group of voters that could account for close to 15% of the vote, meaning they could sway the outcome in battleground states. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'I just saw a poll that we're actually leading with Hispanics. That's never happened before,' Trump said. 'I mean, (Harris) is sleeping right now. She couldn't go on the trail. You know, you think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn't be sleeping. She's not doing anything today.' NBC News pointed out that it's not true that the vice president isn't doing anything — while Harris did not have any campaign events scheduled for Tuesday, she had interviews planned with their anchor, Hallie Jackson, and Telemundo’s Julio Vaqueiro. NewsNation partner The Hill writes that Trump has been talking to Spanish-language outlets as well. Just under a week ago, he participated in a town hall with Univision. Trump, in the town hall, detailed his plans to crack down on immigration, the border and the economy. Could Nikki Haley join Trump on campaign trail? With the election winding down, it's still possible for new people to join Trump on the campaign trail, including an ex-rival. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary, is reportedly in talks with the Trump campaign to join him at an event at some point. Sources told NewsNation that Haley's team had provided a couple of dates to the Trump camp that could work for such an appearance. Who will never receive Social Security? Once United Nations ambassador under the Trump administration, Haley endorsed him after ending her own campaign despite being previously critical of him. Asked about this on 'Fox &amp; Friends' Friday, Trump just said, 'I'll do what I have to do.' 'They keep talking about Nikki, Nikki. I like Nikki. Nikki, I don’t think, should have done what she did, and that’s fine that she did it,' Trump said, referring to her running against him, according to NewsNation partner The Hill. 'But even in her own state — in South Carolina, where she was the governor — I beat her by a number.' Trump, The Hill noted, repeatedly disparaged Haley, calling her a 'bird brain' in the primary.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-latino-voters-roundtable/	2024-10-22T13:43:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179460855-1.jpg?w=900
What states could delay how quickly the 2024 election is called?	(NewsNation) — In 2020, the presidential election wasn't called for four days due to the time it took to count ballots in states across the country. Four years later, several states could determine when the country will know whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris has won the 2024 election. Trump and Harris remain engaged in a too-close-to-call battle with two weeks remaining before Election Day. With the two candidates polling neck and neck in all seven swing states, election forecasters can envision several scenarios where the race could be determined in either hours or days, with possible legal challenges to follow. Blue wall blitz: Harris courts undecided voters with Republican help Pennsylvania secured the White House for President Joe Biden in 2020 on the Saturday after Election Day. NewsNation's partner Decision Desk HQ was the first organization to call the election for Biden just before 9 a.m. ET that day. The Keystone State has changed how it counts votes following delays in the 2020 election, but this year, Pennsylvania and other states like Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona could determine when we know who will become the next president. 'There are quicker paths, and then, there are dayslong paths,' said Drew McCoy, the president of NewsNation partner Decision Desk HQ. Georgia again key to election results Trump is targeting Georgia this cycle after Biden flipped the state blue for the first time in 28 years by a margin of 11,179 votes. Election officials recounted the votes twice in 2020, each time reaffirming the original count in favor of Biden. 'We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,' Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said after the third recount. Trump allegedly called Raffensberger and asked him to find enough votes to reverse the results in his favor. The former president is currently charged in state court for trying to subvert the state's 2020 election. This year, Georgia has already collected a record number of early ballots as both Harris and Trump continue to campaign around the state. Despite the spotlight on Georgia, McCoy believes that the state could be among the first called on election night. McCoy said Trump's easiest path to the presidency is flipping Georgia and Pennsylvania. If Harris can keep Georgia blue and win North Carolina, that dramatically changes the map, he said. North Carolina early voting records Trump won North Carolina by 1.3% in 2020, and four years later, and McCoy believes Trump needs to carry it again to win in November. A Democrat hasn't won the state since former President Barack Obama in 2008, but polls have shown that Harris is within the margin of error with two weeks remaining before the election. Like Georgia, North Carolina has experienced record levels of early voting despite residents trying to recover from widespread damage caused by the deadly Hurricane Helene. By McCoy's estimation, Georgia and North Carolina could be called sometime between 10 p.m. and midnight on election night, which could set the stage for what happens in the rest of the country. Will Pennsylvania's count be delayed again? Pennsylvania state law does not permit mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day, which led directly to the four days needed to determine a winner in 2020. It became the epicenter of Trump's 'Stop The Steal' campaign in which he alleged mail-in ballots that arrived after Election Day should not be counted. The campaign mounted a series of legal challenges claiming that Republican observers were kept too far from the voting tabulation process in cities like Philadelphia, The Associated Press reported. A record number (375,000) of mail-in ballots were received in the state in 2020, with the majority of those coming from Democratic voters, according to CBS News. Republican Secretary of Commonwealth Al Schmidt told CBS News that due to state laws, he believes the vote-counting process could still take time to ensure an accurate result. But since 2020, Pennsylvania has improved its vote-counting process as new machinery has been introduced that processes ballots more quickly, Schmidt said. 'Our counties are working night and day to count their voters' votes,' Schmidt told CBS News. 'They're doing so as quickly as they can and with integrity.' McCoy believes that while vote counting in Pennsylvania's 67 counties will require careful attention, he expects results to trickle in during the overnight hours and into Wednesday morning. But he said the disparity between the state's Republican and Democratic areas could create some drama along the way. July Trump shooting attempt ‘should not have happened’: Task force 'It’s not unexpected that there might be some changes in the lead over the course of the night,' McCoy told NewsNation. Mail-in voting in Arizona Arizona, where roughly 90% of ballots were mailed in during the 2020 election, historically takes longer to call due to the time it takes to determine which ballots can be counted based on the postmark. Biden won Arizona by just 0.3% in 2020. Maricopa County, where much of the Phoenix metro area is located, is expected to garner the crux of the election attention four years after Biden won the county by 45,109 votes. In 2020, after Trump claimed the election was stolen, Arizona Republicans commissioned a hand recount of Maricopa County's 2.1 million ballots, which affirmed Biden had defeated Trump. Thousands of migrants heading for southern border Election experts expect another close race in Arizona, keeping interest in the state high. Delays could push the race into a critical position if the state is needed to secure victory for either candidate. Other factors on Election Day Voter turnout could also help determine the timeframe for a winner, according to NewsNation political editor and 'The Hill Sunday' host Chris Stirewalt. Turnout numbers for the upcoming election should be known by 9 p.m. ET on election night, which could provide clues about which candidates could benefit most and when a winner will be determined. Stirewalt also believes that the scrutiny around election officials in 2020 could spill over to this election, which might slow things down. He also expects legal challenges to be mounted again, which would also lead to delays. With so many factors in play, establishing any sense of certainty proves to be difficult. 'If we’re going to be very honest, then we have to say we don’t really know,' Stirewalt told NewsNation. 'We have to be prepared for a really quick night or a long week, but we certainly can’t rule either of those out.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/states-delay-2024-election-call/	2024-10-22T13:01:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
NC family determined to rebuild after losing 11 members to Helene	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene brought devastation to the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina, devastating one family who lost 11 loved ones to the storm. Jesse and Mekenzie Craig live in Fairview, North Carolina, a town about 12 miles southeast of Asheville. One area of the town was known as 'Craigtown' for the family that was so entrenched in the community. 'We're just taking it day by day,' Jesse Craig told NewsNation. 'We have a great family and a great support system.' What to know about poll watchers Eleven members of the family, including Jesse Craig's parents, were killed after a mudslide swept through the area, destroying entire houses. Craig said he and his wife were waiting out the storm in their basement and he spoke to his father the morning Helene hit. When the couple emerged they found downed trees across the room and one of their vehicles totaled. But there was no cell phone service to check on loved ones. His brother eventually got a call through and broke the news. 'He said Mom and Dad are gone,' Craig recalled. 'Instantly, your brain goes into shock, your body goes into shock.' Legality of Musk’s $1M offer ‘questionable’: Fmr. Pennsylvania AG After getting the call, service cut out again and the Craigs were unable to get ahold of anyone for days. In addition to Jesse Craig's parents, he lost his aunt, uncle, great-uncle, great-aunt and multiple cousins. The Craig family had been in the town since the mid-1900s, with multiple generations staying in the same area. Now, the Craigs are determined to rebuild so the family doesn't lose eight decades of history.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/nc-family-lose-11-helene/	2024-10-22T11:21:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/CraigFamily.jpg?w=900
Ex-Abercrombie & Fitch CEO arrested on sex trafficking charges	This story contains discussions of rape or sexual assault that may be disturbing. If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, The National Sexual Assault Hotline can be reached at 1-800-656-4673 to provide support and resources. (NewsNation) — The former CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has been arrested on sex trafficking charges brought by federal prosecutors in New York. Former CEO Mike Jeffries was arrested in Florida and is being charged along with his partner Matthew Smith and associate James Jacobson. United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace detailed the allegations in the indictment against the men, which includes 15 victims known as 'John Doe.' Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs accused of raping 13-year-old: Lawsuit He described the system as a 'casting couch' model where men hoping to get featured in an Abercrombie ad to kickstart their careers were then trafficked. 'To anyone who thinks they can coerce others using a casting call system, prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison,' Pearce said. Jeffries and Smith are accused of hiring Jacobson to act as a recruiter to select young men hoping to build a career in modeling who would then be coerced or forced to engage in sex acts at events run by Jeffries and Smith. Prosecutors say Jeffries and Smith intentionally targeted heterosexual men who expressed they would be unwilling to engage in certain sex acts, including anal sex, who were then forced to take part in such activity. Jacobson allegedly engaged in tryouts where he paid men to engage in sex acts, and Smith allegedly selected which men would be flown to his and Jeffries' homes or to hotels around the world. According to the indictment, the itineraries provided to victims resembled that which would be used for a typical photoshoot or modeling job, obscuring the nature of the sex events they would then be taken to. Men were physically groomed and forced to give up personal items like phones and wallets during the event and to sign nondisclosure agreements, the indictment says. Woman poisoned boyfriend for his nonexistent $30M inheritance Prosecutors say the men were not informed about the details of the sex acts they would be expected to perform and were given substances including alcohol, Viagra and poppers to perform and were sometimes injected with erection-inducing medication if they were unwilling or unable to act as directed. Staff kept the men from leaving events, prosecutors say, and Smith and Jeffries allegedly violated men who were unwilling to participate by force. While there are 15 victims in the charging documents, authorities said the investigation is ongoing, and they believe there are dozens of victims during a time spanning from 2008 to 2015. Anyone with information or who was a victim is encouraged to contact the FBI. Last year, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was sued over allegations that Jeffries was operating a sex trafficking ring exploiting young men who hoped to become models for the company and that Abercrombie allegedly turned a blind eye to the abuse. This is a developing story.

Norfolk Southern tops third-quarter expectations with insurance b...	Norfolk Southern's streamlined operations delivered strong earnings last quarter, even excluding boosts from insurance payouts related to the disastrous derailment in East Palestine and the sale of two rail lines. The Atlanta company recorded a $287 million gain on the sale of rail lines in Virginia and North Carolina, and for the second quarter in a row it collected more insurance payments than it paid out for last year's derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Norfolk Southern earned $1.1 billion, or $4.85 per share in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago, when profits were hurt by mounting costs related to the derailment. Excluding one-time items, the railroad earned $737 million, or $3.25 per share, beating the $3.15 forecast by analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. Thousands of migrants heading for southern border Before the opening bell Tuesday, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp. rose 3%. New CEO Mark George, who took over last month, isn't expected to implement any strategic changes because he helped craft the plan a couple years ago that calls for keeping more employees on hand during a downturn, so the railroad can respond better when the economy recovers. 'It’s really about building out consistent, safe, reliable service with a network that’s resilient and can bounce back from events,' like it did when Norfolk Southern got all its major lines running again within 72 hours after Hurricane Helene hit, said George, who was promoted from Chief Financial Officer after Alan Shaw was fired for an inappropriate relationship with an employee. Norfolk Southern has been in the spotlight ever since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine triggered a national focus on railroad safety. Earlier this year, the railroad also had to fend off a takeover bid from investment firm Ancora Holdings. The investor ultimately won only three seats, insufficient to make the sweeping changes it sought. The railroad redoubled its efforts to lower costs in the spring, hiring Chief Operating Officer John Orr to help reduce the number of times railcars get switched and enable Norfolk Southern to operate fewer, longer trains. It’s operating expenses, when adjusted to remove costs related to the Ohio derailment and other one-time items, fell 6% to $1.93 billion. Norfolk Southern is working to improve its profit margin enough to catch up with the other major freight railroads. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

And I don’t have a whole lot of patience for lack of execution or acceptance of mediocrity,' George said. The railroad’s revenue of $3.05 billion was just below analyst expectation for $3.09 billion. Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest railroads, with tracks crisscrossing the Eastern United States.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-railroad-norfolk-southern-tops-third-quarter-forecasts-with-added-boost-from-insurance-rail-sales/	2024-10-22T05:28:33-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67179b33c9c796.92187766.jpeg?w=900
