Kamala Harris raised $1 billion-plus in defeat. She's still sendi...	ATLANTA (AP) — Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party's prodigious fundraising operation raised more than $1 billion in her loss to Donald Trump, but the vice president is still pushing donors for more money after the election. Democrats are sending persistent appeals to Harris supporters without expressly asking them to cover any potential debts, enticing would-be donors instead with other matters: the Republican president-elect's picks for his upcoming administration and a handful of pending congressional contests where ballots are still being tallied. 'The Harris campaign certainly spent more than they raised and is now busy trying to fundraise,' said Adrian Hemond, a Democratic strategist from Michigan. He said he was been asked by the campaign after its loss to Trump to help with fundraising. The party is flooding Harris’ lucrative email donor list with near-daily appeals aimed at small-dollar donors — those whose contributions are measured in the hundreds of dollars or less. But Hemond said the postelection effort also includes individual calls to larger donors. One person familiar with the effort and the Democratic National Committee's finances said the Harris campaign's expected shortfall is a relatively small sum compared to the breadth of the campaign, which reported having $119 million cash on hand in mid-October before the Nov. 5 election. That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the campaign's finances and spoke on condition of anonymity. But the scramble now underscores the expense involved in a losing effort and the immediate challenges facing Democrats as they try to maintain a baseline political operation to counter the Trump administration and prepare for the 2026 midterm elections. It also calls into question how Democrats used their resources, including hosting events with musicians and other celebrities as well as running ads in a variety of nontraditional spaces such as Las Vegas' domed Sphere. Patrick Stauffer, chief financial officer for the Harris campaign, said in a statement that 'there were no outstanding debts or bills overdue' on Election Day and there 'will be no debt' listed for either the campaign or the DNC on their next financial disclosures, which are due to the Federal Election Commission in December. The person familiar with the campaign and DNC's finances said it was impossible to know just where Harris’ balance sheet stands currently. The campaign still is getting invoices from vendors for events and other services from near the end of the race. The campaign also has outstanding receipts; for example, from media organizations that must pay for their employees’ spots on Air Force Two as it traveled for the vice president’s campaign activities. Within hours of Trump picking Florida Republican Matt Gaetz for attorney general on Wednesday, Harris' supporters got an appeal for more money for 'the Harris Fight Fund,' citing the emerging Trump team and its agenda. Gaetz, who resigned his House seat after the announcement, 'will weaponize the Justice Department to protect themselves,' the email said. It said Democrats 'must stop them from executing Trump’s plans for revenge and retribution' and noted that 'even his Republican allies are shocked by this' Cabinet choice. Another appeal followed Friday in Harris' name. 'The light of America's promise will burn bright as long as we keep fighting,' the email said, adding that 'there are still a number of critical races across the country that are either too close to call or with the margin of recounts or certain legal challenges.' The emails do not mention Harris' campaign or its finances. The 'Harris Fight Fund' is a postelection label for the 'Harris Victory Fund,' which is the joint fundraising operation of Harris’ campaign, the DNC and state Democratic parties. Despite the language in the recent appeals, most rank-and-file donors' contributions would be routed to the national party, unless a donor took the time to contact DNC directly and have the money go directly to Harris or a state party. The fine print at the bottom of the solicitation explains that the first $41,300 from a person and first $15,000 from a political action committee would be allocated to the DNC. The next $3,300 from a person or $5,000 from a PAC would go to the Harris for President 'Recount Account.' Anything beyond that threshold, up to maximum contribution limits that can reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be spread across state parties. Officials at the DNC, which is set to undergo a leadership change early next year, indicated the party has no plans to cover any shortfall for Harris but could not explicitly rule out the party shifting any money to the campaign. ___ Cappelletti reported from Lansing, Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-kamala-harris-raised-1-billion-plus-in-defeat-shes-still-sending-persistent-appeals-to-donors/	2024-11-16T08:09:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6738c448c4f191.09734884.jpeg?w=900
UAP whistleblower says they need greater protections	(NewsNation) — An unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) whistleblower is calling for greater protection for fellow whistleblowers so that there can be greater transparency on the issue. Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves, the first active-duty pilot to come forward publicly about regular sightings of UAPs, joined 'Morning in America' on Saturday to discuss the latest Congressional hearing. Several whistleblowers testified at a House of Representatives committee this week regarding the existence of UAPs or UAP-related government programs. '[They made] another major step forward in this conversation,' Graves said of the whistleblowers. UFO House hearing witness: Pentagon ‘clearly covering something up’ 'It's no longer just the last three witnesses that gave testimony last year. It's a continuing story that I think is prime for further conversation with the new administration coming in.' For a greater breadth of information, more security is needed according to Graves. 'I think we need to look to the Department of Justice, Congress, and the executive branch, to be able to provide those protections, so that these people that are willing to come forward have the ability to do so without fear of repercussions,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/uap-whistleblower-greater-protections/	2024-11-16T07:56:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2184177259.jpg?w=900
Progressive fault lines emerge after Harris's loss	Progressives are at odds with one another over how to hone their message to voters after losing the White House again to President-elect Trump. There’s little disagreement that things need to change. Democrats’ most recent electoral strategy has been rendered ineffective, delivering Trump back to Washington with his party’s full control of Congress. But there’s no consensus about what the left should do next. One camp says the future is with economic populists, a group that puts financially disadvantaged voters of all demographics at the forefront. They believe that if Democrats prioritize class struggles over culture wars on the national stage, they will alienate fewer people and have a shot at winning again. The other group of progressives sees room for several top-tier priorities, with shifting orders of importance. They believe their wing can emphasize all aspects of identity politics, while also standing up for democracy, the rule of law and a brighter economic future all at once. 'The idea of economic populism being the actual patriotic lane is really good,' said Pete D’Alessandro, a former senior campaign aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) from Iowa. The distinction, some argue, is very subtle. The progressive wing is in agreement that class and identity are intersectional and there’s a deep belief that no group should be sacrificed at the expense of another. However, fault lines are emerging within progressive circles over the order and magnitude of each topic, foreshadowing a debate that’s likely to play out as Trump is sworn into office and as Democrats prepare to govern and reshape their party in the minority. Progressives who came of age in the Sanders wing have started conducting their own autopsies post-Nov. 5, hoping to get out ahead of various narratives that place economic realities low on the list of reasons why Vice President Harris lost to Trump. A grassroots group formed after Sanders’s first presidential campaign, Our Revolution, polled 12,000 progressives and found that 91 percent said 'the party has long neglected the multiracial working class.' 'The neglect of working people, the failure of the Democratic Party, the late switch from Biden to Harris and the campaign’s misguided focus on Cheney Republicans and celebrities' were key reasons for defeat, according to their poll of progressive respondents. Sanders has been on his own path after Harris’s campaign loss, trying to steer the conversation among progressives back to economic strife that played out in exit polls explaining part of Trump’s victory. He’s taken to legacy media, from cable news to The New York Times, to explain why a working-class agenda should be core to Democrats’ DNA. In recent discussions, the senator has emphasized that identity is inherently tied to struggles of different diverse working-class segments. 'You can say, ‘We are going to fight for a bigotry-free America' — that’s an ongoing struggle. We made progress, got a long way to go,' Sanders told the Times’s podcast 'The Daily' this week. 'But at the same time we can stand up for the working class in this country, which by the way, happens to be significantly African American and Latino and women, who are the bulk of the working class,' he stressed. 'It’s going forward in both directions. That is a winner.' The ascendant Sanders wing — which progressives agree is in the talent search phase for new, younger leadership — is also sharply critical of the notion that the composition of voters who supported Trump are inherently prejudiced. 'Some of the Democrat pundits say, ‘Well the problem is all of these Trump people are racist and they’re sexist and they’re homophobes.' Well no doubt that some of them are, and that’s true. Most of them are not,' Sanders said. 'They are, in large numbers, working class people, and we’ve got to speak to them in an economic perspective that is clear and straightforward.' Stevie O'Hanlon, communications director for the Sunrise Movement, said a key problem is that 'most Democrats have failed to present themselves as a credible voice for working people.' 'For the first time in years, the Democratic nominee lost the votes of households making less than $100,000 and won those making more than that. This is the cost of decades of policy and rhetoric from Democratic leadership that has allowed Trump claim to be the champion for working class and middle-class people,' O'Hanlon told The Hill. While Sanders is making that case outwardly, others on the left who share his world view are tailoring the message to fit their personal brands. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a staunch Sanders ally and member of the 'squad,' removed her pronouns from her bio on the social platform X this week. 'I think it’s a small thing,' said one source familiar with Ocasio-Cortez’s messaging. Still, the use of pronouns as personal descriptors has been widely adopted among Capitol Hill progressives, who see issues of gender identity as critical to the Democratic Party’s bid for inclusiveness. Liberals have created space for communities that have faced disproportionate discrimination, including the LGBTQ population, to strike a contrast with the GOP. While losses for Democrats were widespread, progressives added their first openly transgender member of Congress to their slate with Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.), who offered a unique perspective in a press briefing with Congressional Progressive Caucus leadership. 'What I was hearing was that the American dream is increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible,' McBride said about running in Delaware’s only congressional district, which spans throughout major urban and suburban as well as rural areas and crosses into the Philadelphia media market. McBride said that being in that market exposed voters to Trump and Republicans’ attempt to divide over gender and identity, an approach that ultimately didn’t work. 'I didn’t run on my identity, but my identity was not a secret,' she said. The millennial congresswoman’s X bio simply reads: 'Delaware's Congresswoman-elect. Working to deliver for ALL Delawareans.' 'When people can't afford rent or food, they look for people to blame,' O’Hanlon said. 'Trump and far-right politicians have told people to blame immigrants or trans people or people of color. That was a core part of Trump's closing message: ‘Kamala Harris cares more about X group than you.’ Democrats need to stand up forcefully against these attacks and work overtime to show they are fighting to deliver for people.' As a growing group focuses on economic populism, others in the progressive movement are interested more immediately in issues that may arise under Trump. They see threats to the judicial branch on the horizon that some believe can be minimized before the president-elect reclaims the Oval Office. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who many college-educated and affluent liberals credit for emphasizing cultural issues, outlined her vision for Democrats rooted in bulletproofing democracy. 'While still in charge of the Senate and the White House, we must do all we can to safeguard our democracy,' Warren wrote in a new op-ed in Time. 'Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer must use every minute of the end-of-year legislative session to confirm federal judges and key regulators — none of whom can be removed by the next President.' The Warren-aligned Progressive Change Campaign Committee circulated a petition titled: 'Protect Democracy while you can,' asking for support for key legal structures. Warren is poised to take on an elevated role within the Senate minority, where she’s pledged to uplift 'working families' as the Banking Committee’s leading Democrat. While the Massachusetts senator also promotes an agenda for low-income Americans, her use of 'families' is another slight distinction from Sanders’s rhetoric about working class people, which does not necessarily specify a family unit. Some populist progressives say it’s an easy bridge between the two camps, which are already in agreement that the drivers of income inequality are mass concentration among the country’s wealthiest individuals and the dominance of corporate influence to keep the status quo intact. 'I’m not as worried about them,' D’Alessandro said about the two approaches. 'I’m more worried that the pendulum swings too far the other way and we get more of the Buttigieg, Ritchie Torres '70s Republican kind of politicians.' 'I think with the Warren folks it’s an easier discussion because it’s tactics. Nobody is saying don’t stand for those things,' he said. 'It’s more of what to lead with. If we fight each over tactics the corporate Dems like the guys I mentioned will just zip through the opening.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/progressive-fault-lines-emerge-after-harriss-loss/	2024-11-16T07:51:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Progressive-Battle_111624_AP_Brynn-Anderson.jpg?w=900
Israel's warfare in Gaza 'consistent with genocide:' UN special c...	(NewsNation) — Israeli actions in Gaza are 'consistent with the characteristics of genocide,' a United Nations Special Committee wrote in a report published this week that cited 'mass civilian casualties and life-threatening conditions intentionally imposed on Palestinians.' 'Since the beginning of the war, Israeli officials have publicly supported policies that strip Palestinians of the very necessities required to sustain life — food, water, and fuel,' the committee said. 'These statements along with the systematic and unlawful interference of humanitarian aid make clear Israel’s intent to instrumentalize life-saving supplies for political and military gains.' Israel's attacks on Gaza have killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to The Associated Press. The war started after Hamas militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage, the AP wrote. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The report covers the period from October 2023 to July 2024. Israel's 'indiscriminate bombing campaign,' the UN special committee wrote in it, resulted in the widespread killing of civilians and 'mass destruction of civilian infrastructure, raising grave concerns of violations under international humanitarian law.' Attacks on civilians the report brought up include those on schools currently acting as shelters. Targeting systems enhanced with artificial intelligence that are being used by Israel to direct military operations have exacerbated the problem, the report states. Israeli soldiers, because they were relying on AI-assisted targeting, accelerated their decision-making and authorized strikes in a matter of seconds, the report said. Home-tracking of targets and night strikes also have disproportionately increased civilian casualties, report authors added. 'The committee is profoundly concerned about the indiscriminate loss of life apparently caused by these artificial intelligence-enhanced targeting systems, especially when combined with the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects,' the report said. In addition, Israel's destruction of vital water, sanitation and food systems have created a 'lethal mix of crises that will inflict severe harm on generations to come,' the committee said.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) Earlier this week, the AP reported that the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians is at its lowest level of the 13-month war. Aid groups say the Israeli military has hindered or even blocked aid shipments to Gaza even amid food security experts warning that a famine may already be underway. The situation in the West Bank, which the committee said is an 'apartheid system,' has also dramatically worsened since Oct. 7, per the report. Report authors said there has been escalating violence there, including a dramatic rise in child casualties, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. The report is scheduled to be presented to the UN General Assembly on Monday. The United Nations’ top court in January demanded Israel try to contain death and damage as it continues its military offensive in Gaza, calling on the country to 'take all measures' to prevent a genocide of the Palestinians. South Africa brought the case accusing Israel of genocide to the International Court of Justice last year. Israel has denied allegations it is committing genocide.

Malcolm X's family alleges FBI, CIA played role in his death	(The Hill) -- The estate of Malcolm X is suing the federal government, accusing it of playing a role in the 1965 assassination of the civil rights leader. In a lawsuit filed against the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the CIA and the New York Police Department (NYPD), the estate alleges the agencies all played a significant role in the events leading to Malcolm X's slaying and then engaged in a decades-long cover-up of their involvement. The complaint says the DOJ, FBI, CIA and NYPD were aware of credible threats against Malcolm X’s life but failed to intervene. 'As a direct result of the Defendants' intentional, bad faith, willful, wanton, reckless, unreasonable and/or deliberately indifferent acts and omissions, Malcolm X was deprived of his federal constitutional rights, was robbed of his life and freedom, and sustained severe physical, emotional, and monetary damages, including conscious physical pain and suffering,' the lawsuit states. LAPD Chief says police aren’t called on enough Malcom X, who was born Malcolm Little, was gunned down at age 39 by three men on Feb. 21, 1965, at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, where he was set to deliver a speech. His pregnant wife, Betty Shabazz, and four daughters were in the front row. He was shot 21 times in the attack. The suit, brought by Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz and other family members, calls for $100 million in restitution. It also demands answers to questions still surrounding the assassination. Though three men were initially convicted for the killing, two were exonerated in 2021. That same year, a letter written by a former NYPD officer alleged that the NYPD and FBI covered up details of the assassination. Longest-waiting child in Arkansas foster care system finds forever family The officer, Raymond Wood, wrote that he was ordered to coerce members of Malcolm X's security team to commit felonious federal crimes 'so that they could be arrested by the FBI and kept away from managing Malcolm X's door security on Feb. 21, 1965.' The lawsuit alleges that under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, then-head of the FBI, the entities 'went beyond mere allegedly illegal surveillance of Malcolm X, actively conspiring to reduce his protection and leaving him vulnerable to an attack they knew was imminent.' 'For decades, these agencies viewed Black activism as a threat to national security, resulting in the unchecked targeting of prominent leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Marcus Garvey,' the family said in a press release. 'This lawsuit seeks accountability for the systemic negligence and intentional actions that deprived Malcolm X's family and the world of his life and legacy.' In total, the lawsuit lists nine causes of action, including excessive use of force against Malcolm X, deliberate creation of danger, failure to protect and the denial of access to the courts for his family. The suit also charges the defendants with conspiracy, fraudulent concealment and wrongful death. 'This cover-up spanned decades, blocking the Shabazz family's access to the truth and their right to pursue justice,' said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family in the suit. 'We are making history by standing here to confront those wrongs and seeking accountability in the courts.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/malcolm-x-federal-government-assassination-lawsuit/	2024-11-15T10:58:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/malcolmx_05161963ap-e1731695895630.jpg?w=800
Steven Chueng to serve as White House communications director	Steven Cheung, who has served as a top press aide on the Trump campaign for the past two years, will join the incoming administration as White House communications director, President-elect Trump announced Friday. While Cheung was not a regular presence on television like some of Trump's other aides, he has worked with the former president in a communications role for years, having served on Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Cheung also did a stint as a top communications official for The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a league headed up by Trump ally Dana White. The campaign spokesman is known for his combative presence on social media. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? The president-elect has yet to name a press secretary, which is a more forward-facing role in the White House. Campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt is widely viewed as the front-runner for that position. Politico first reported on Cheung's expected role. Cheung becomes the latest long-time campaign aide to secure a role in Trump's White House. Trump announced earlier this week that Dan Scavino, Stephen Miller, James Blair and Taylor Budowich would all take senior staff roles in the White House after playing prominent roles on the campaign trail.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/steven-chueng-white-house-communications-director/	2024-11-15T10:43:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/CheungSteve_052824_APPhotoSethWenig.jpg?w=900
Speaker Johnson urges Ethics panel not to release Gaetz report	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is urging the House Ethics Committee to not release its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), as pressure mounts on the panel to publish its findings about the Florida Republican who resigned from Congress immediately after President-elect Trump selected him to be attorney general. 'I do not, no,' Johnson told CNN and Politico reporters when asked if the panel should release its findings about Gaetz. 'I think it’s a terrible breach of protocol and tradition and the spirit of the rule.' 'I’m going to strongly request the Ethics Committee not issue the report because that is not how we do things in the House and I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.' The Speaker said he planned to talk to House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) about the matter. Johnson later warned that issuing the report after Gaetz resigned Wednesday — and thus removed himself from the committee's jurisdiction — would 'open a Pandora's box.' Johnson’s lobbying for Gaetz is a striking break from the hands-off way House leaders have typically approached issues before the Ethics Committee in the past — and from what Johnson had said about the issues just two days prior. Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP senators 'As far as the timing of a release report or something, I don't know. The Speaker of the House is not involved in that — can’t be involved in that,' Johnson said Wednesday, shortly after he announced Gaetz had resigned from the House. The Speaker argued Friday that the 'House's tradition' on the matter is the panel not issuing reports after members leave the chamber. That move, however, is not entirely unprecedented; in 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Asked about that example, Johnson said it reflected precedent being broken. 'I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing Ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress,' the Speaker said. 'I think it would open a Pandora's box. It's a very important rule that should be maintained — if it's been broken once or twice, it should not have been.' 'If someone is no longer a member of Congress, we're not in the business of investigating and publishing a report of people who are not in this institution,' he later added. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has repeatedly said Gaetz forced a vote to oust him because he refused to get involved in the Ethics Committee investigation. Gaetz denied that, citing strategy and policy disagreements as why he led the charge to remove the Californian. The Ethics panel has for years been investigating Gaetz, exploring whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. He has vigorously denied allegations of wrongdoing, and the Department of Justice, which previously investigated whether he had sex with a 17-year-old, declined to charge him with a crime. That Ethics Committee investigation, however, came to an abrupt end Wednesday, when Gaetz resigned from the House shortly after Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general. The Ethics panel does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress. Pressure mounts on Ethics Committee to release Gaetz report Johnson declined to say if he has spoken with Trump about his stance on the release of the report. 'I'm not talking to anybody about what I said to Trump,' the Speaker said. It remains unknown what path the panel will follow with its Gaetz report. The committee was initially scheduled to meet Friday to vote on whether to publish its findings — a vote that had been on the calendar before Wednesday's developments — but the huddle was later canceled, two sources told The Hill. It remains unclear when the panel will meet next. 'It’s very fluid,' one of the sources said. Johnson said Gaetz abruptly resigned his seat in order to quickly start the process of electing a replacement and lessen his departure's impacts of the slim majority. Lawmakers have speculated Gaetz resigned his seat in an attempt to keep the report from coming out. Senators in both parties have said they want to see the Ethics panel’s findings before voting on his confirmation to the Cabinet position.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/johnson-panel-not-release-gaetz-findings/	2024-11-15T10:29:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_111224gn17_w.jpg?w=900
American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump	(NewsNation) — With President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, his promise of increased tariffs is becoming closer to reality. On the campaign trail, Trump proposed at least a 10% tariff on all goods entering the U.S., with a 60% tariff on all imports from China. While these costs are attached to goods being imported to the country, they will likely also affect exports. During Trump's first term, a trade war over tariffs with China impacted key American crops, like soybeans and corn. The USDA said the dispute led to more than $27 billion in U.S. agricultural losses. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Farmers Ted Winter and John Fleming joined NewsNation's 'Morning in America' on Friday to share how these tariffs could impact the farming community and agriculture in the U.S. Winter, a Minnesota farmer and member of the Minnesota Farmers Union Executive Committee, said the tariff would impact farmers by reducing the amount of export sales they have to China and other parts of the world. 'That will impact our income and our bottom line for our farmers and our families,' Winter said. 'We need all the income we can right now because we're still suffering from the tariffs that were put on in his last term. Fleming, a North Carolina farmer and director of the American Soybean Association, agreed with Winter, saying farmers could lose about 14 to 16 million metric tons of soy export to China if the retaliatory tariffs were reinstated. 'We can look for other markets but there are no buyers in the marketplace big enough to absorb that volume,' Fleming said. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security During the first Trump administration, Fleming said the American Soybean Association did recognize that soybean farmers were impacted by the tariffs and issued some tariff offsets to farmers that were helpful. However, Fleming said they are hoping they don't have to go down that road again. President Joe Biden kept most of Trump's China tariffs in place and increased them on China's electric cars and solar panels. Last year, U.S. soybean exports to China fell to around 26.4 million metric tons, which was down from 36.1 million in 2016. Winter said they haven't been able to regain the market and have lost more in the process since. 'China went to other places to buy their needs,' Winter said. He continued, 'If we can be in good trade relationships with China, and they buy our products, that gives us a market to move our crops into the marketplace. We don't need to have tariffs put on or increased by anyone.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/american-farmers-tariffs-trump/	2024-11-15T07:07:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2166486728.jpg?w=900
Here's how much White House Cabinet members make	(NewsNation) — A president's Cabinet is an advisory group of people who make up the heads of the 15 executive departments. Each is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. President-elect Donald Trump has announced some of his Cabinet picks, which include Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as the proposed secretary of state and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as the proposed Homeland Security secretary. If they pass the Senate's confirmation, their Cabinet salaries will be more than their previous compensations. Presidential appointments: How do they work? Average salaries for Cabinet members As of January, the annual rate of pay for Level I Executive positions is $246,400, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. These positions include all 15 Cabinet roles. Departments with leaders in the Cabinet include: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, Veterans Affairs and the Attorney General. In comparison, the salary for most U.S. senators and representatives is $174,000, which has remained unchanged since 2009. Exceptions include speaker of the House, president pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders of both chambers, all of which are paid more. What is the net worth of Trump’s administration picks? Federal employee benefits As a federal employee, Cabinet members receive a generous employee compensation package beyond salary. Although many of Trump's picks are financially established and well off already, they can receive student loan forgiveness as a person in public service. They get 11 paid holidays, child care and commuter subsidies, paid parental leave up to 12 weeks, health and life insurance, retirement benefits and more.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/white-house-cabinet-members-salary/	2024-11-15T06:23:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1237563607.jpg?w=900
What is the net worth of Trump's administration picks?	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump’s proposed advisers for his second presidential administration comprises politicians, a TV news host, tech entrepreneurs – and billionaires. A billionaire himself, Trump is the richest American president in history, accounting for inflation, with a $5.2 billion estimated net worth as of Nov. 15, which is down from $6.7 billion on Oct. 31. His proposed Department of Government Efficiency would be led by billionaire friend Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump's Cabinet during his first term was considered to be the wealthiest Cabinet in previous administrations. While the DOGE position is not technically a Cabinet post, Trump's picks so far include plenty of wealthy individuals.

Live: Murder trial underway in Laken Riley's death	(NewsNation) — Opening statements will begin Friday in the trial of the man prosecutors say killed 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. If convicted, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors have said they won’t pursue the death penalty. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial earlier this week and instead opted for a trial by judge. Cigarette leads to man’s arrest in 1981 Indiana cold case: Documents The case became fodder for the national debate over immigration, but Riley’s family has said they don’t want her death exploited as a political wedge. The trial is expected to continue into next week. What we know about the case The investigation into Riley’s death began when a friend reported her missing on Feb. 22 after she didn’t return home from a run. Soon after, officers discovered her body on the University of Georgia campus in a forested area. The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Prosecutors allege he beat the Augusta University student with an object and dragged her body to a secluded area off the jogging path. Police say the attack was random. People gather to mourn the loss of Laken Riley during a vigil for the Augusta University College of Nursing student at the Tate Plaza on the University of Georgia campus in Athens, Ga., Monday, Feb. 26, 2024. Riley, a nursing student at Augusta University's Athens campus, was found dead Thursday, Feb. 22, after a roommate reported she didn't return from a morning run in a wooded area of the UGA campus near its intramural fields. Students also gathered to pay tribute to a UGA student who committed suicide last week. (Joshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP) Fueling immigration concerns Riley’s death sparked widespread outrage over immigration policies in the United States. Immigration and customs enforcement quickly revealed that Ibarra and his brother were living in the country without proper documentation. Politicians and media outlets used Riley’s death to bolster false claims of a 'migrant crime wave' — an alleged phenomenon that statistics don’t support. 'I’d rather her not be such a political, how you say — it started a storm in our country,' Riley’s father Jason Riley told NBC News in March. 'And it’s incited a lot of people.' Multiple studies, including one published by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest U.S. citizens are more than twice as likely to be arrested for violent crimes, compared to the arrest rate of people in the country illegally. 'It makes me angry,' Jason Riley said. 'I feel like they’re just using my daughter’s name for that. And she was much better than that, and she should be raised up for the person that she is. She was an angel.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-opening-statements-laken-riley/	2024-11-15T04:51:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/snapshot-2024-08-02T091926.846.jpg?w=900
Gaetz nomination to head Justice Dept. in serious trouble: GOP se...	(The Hill) - Republican senators are warning that Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) nomination to serve President-elect Trump’s attorney general is in serious trouble, even though Republicans will control 53 seats next year. Gaetz will get a chance to make his case for why he should lead the Justice Department, but Republican senators warn he faces an 'uphill' path to confirmation. In addition, Republican senators are supporting the call made Thursday by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) for the House Ethics Committee to release the findings of its investigation of Gaetz for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) questions Attorney General Merrick Garland during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Department of Justice, June 4, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin, Associated Press) Two moderate Republican senators, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), have already expressed strong reservations about Gaetz’s nomination to serve as attorney general. Four Republicans would need to vote against Gaetz to sink his nomination, and GOP members warn he is likely to encounter resistance from other members of their conference. 'He’s got an uphill climb,' Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said when asked about Gaetz’s nomination. Other GOP sources say Gaetz’s nomination is in serious trouble. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who has a number of friends in the Senate GOP conference, told Bloomberg Television that Gaetz won’t secure the 50 votes he needs to become attorney general. 'Look, Gaetz won’t get confirmed,' he told the outlet. 'Everybody knows that.' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told The Hill that McCarthy’s dire prediction is probably spot on. 'I think he’s pretty right, actually,' he said. But he said Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz may have a strategic value that his GOP colleagues in the Senate — and political pundits — can’t understand at the moment. 'Donald Trump is a savvy guy. You never know his motivations,' he said. Cramer said, 'Gaetz is more than capable of litigating the case for why the [Department of Justice] should be turned on its head' but he added that Gaetz 'just doesn’t have the moral authority' to shake up the department after being embroiled in a federal sex trafficking investigation. 'I’m glad I'm not on Judiciary, put it that way,' he said, alluding to what is expected to be a fierce fight on the committee level over Gaetz. Some Senate Republican sources are speculating that Trump’s choice of Gaetz to head the Justice Department may be intended to draw scrutiny and opposition away from other controversial nominations. Two other controversial nominees are Pete Hegseth, the Fox News anchor Trump picked to head the Pentagon, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), Trump’s choice to serve as Director of National Intelligence despite her past statements defending Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another bombshell dropped on Senate Republicans on Thursday afternoon, when Trump said he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has raised concerns about the safety of vaccines as well as fluoride in tap water. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Thursday that his panel should have access to the findings of the House Ethics Committee investigation of Gaetz. Cornyn said if the House panel found evidence of a crime, 'it would certainly be relevant.' 'I’m not going to speculate what the report shows, but that would certainly be a concern,' he said of evidence of sexual misconduct or illicit drug use.' Murkowski said Wednesday that Gaetz doesn’t pass muster with her. 'I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general,' she said. Collins said she was 'shocked' to learn of Gaetz’s nomination. 'I'm sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr. Gaetz's hearing, if in fact the nomination goes forward,' she said. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who was elected to take over as Senate majority leader next year, told reporters Wednesday that he won’t know whether Gaetz has the votes for confirmation until the Senate formally receives and begins to review his nomination. 'I don't know until we start the process, and that's what we intend to do with him and all the other potential nominees,' he said. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Gaetz has 'got some work cut out for him' to get enough votes to pass the Senate. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said his Republican colleagues' jaws dropped 'to the floor' when they learned of Gaetz's nomination. 'They're going to be faced with a very difficult decision. Many of them know Matt Gaetz. They know the investigations he's been under,' he told CNN in an interview. 'Matt Gaetz is being nominated because he will be and is today a political agent of Donald Trump. The ramifications of this pick, this particular pick, are stunning.' Trump’s controversial choices to head the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, the nation’s intelligence agencies, and the Department of Health and Human Services are already causing tension among Senate Republicans. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a loyal Trump ally, warned fellow Republican senators that they should get in line and vote for Trump’s nominees or face political consequences. 'Republicans if you’re not on the team, get out of the way,' Tuberville told Fox Business Network in an interview. And he suggested that Republican colleagues who vote against Trump nominees would face primary challengers. 'If you want to get in the way, fine. But we’re gonna try to get you out of the Senate too if you try to do that,' he said. He urged his GOP colleagues to let Trump fill his Cabinet with the people he wants and not to interfere, even though the Constitution provides the Senate with the role of providing advice and consent on executive and judicial branch nominees. 'Everybody’s got an opinion up here, but at the end of the day President Trump was elected by an enormous vote and he deserves the team around him that he wants,' he argued. 'It’s not us to determine that.' Those statements didn’t sit well with Murkowski, who as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, will vote on Kennedy’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services. She said senators have a duty to carefully evaluate nominees and judge their fitness to serve in key positions and not let worries about potential political reverberations drive their decisions. 'There is a process; it’s not discretionary,' she said of the Senate’s duty to provide advice and consent on nominees. She disagreed with Tuberville’s claim that 'it’s not us to determine' whether Trump’s nominees should serve in his Cabinet. 'It’s in the Constitution. It says, ‘This is the role of the Senate,’' she said. 'So I feel pretty strongly as a member of the Senate that we have our job to do just as the president has his authorities. 'I will not accept that the United States Senate should just be an extension of the White House. We are our own separate but equal institution,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/gaetz-nomination-gop-senators-reaction/	2024-11-15T04:45:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24156540230773-e1731668801536.jpg?w=900
Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’	(NewsNation) — The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is preparing for surges at the southern border as people try to enter the U.S. before Donald Trump returns to the White House. 'We still want to maintain a proactive posture. We don’t want to be reactive,' said Lieutenant Chris Olivarez of the Texas DPS. 'We want to be ready for anything, for any possible surge.' To that end, Texas DPS officers have been conducting 'mass migration response' exercises along the border. Among the strategies is stationing DPS officers in their vehicles, with flashing red and blue lights, every few hundred feet along the border. Agents rescue 4-year-old girl, baby from smugglers near border DPS said that strategy is in place in the Rio Grande Valley, Del Rio and El Paso Border Patrol sectors. Officers have also placed loudspeakers along the border that play back a short, pointed message that can be heard across the Rio Grande in Mexico. 'Atención, atención. Es ilegal cruzar aquí. Hay una cerca aquí. Este no es un puerto de entrada,' the message says in Spanish, translated as, 'Attention, attention. It is illegal to cross here. There is fencing here. This is not a port of entry.' While the Texas DPS and the U.S. Border Patrol prepare for a possible surge ahead of President Trump’s January 20 inauguration, it’s possible the surge might not happen thanks to Biden administration policies that have significantly slowed illegal crossings. 'We’ve seen a significant decrease in illegal border crossings, especially in Texas, where numbers are down nearly 86%,' said Olivarez. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ The Biden policies include denying the right to asylum to anyone who arrives at the border away from an official port of entry and without an asylum appointment with Customs and Border Protection. But while individuals may think twice about illegally entering the U.S., the cartels are working harder than ever to smuggle people across. Two recent examples of the cartels’ desperation were the discovery of someone hiding inside the gas tank of a semi-tractor and people 'welded' into the body of a pickup truck. Border Patrol agents had to pry the sides of the truck to reveal people inside the body.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-pre-trump-immigration-surge/	2024-11-14T15:30:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Horse-patrol-wall-arrest-101024.jpg?w=900
What did Pete Hegseth say about women in combat roles?	(NewsNation) — Comments on women in the military made by President-elect Donald Trump's choice to head the Department of Defense, Pete Hegseth, have garnered criticism. 'I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,' Hegseth said during an appearance on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' last week. 'It hasn’t made us more effective, it hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While Hegseth said he’s served with women, and they’ve been 'great,' institutions shouldn’t have to 'incentivize' that in positions where 'men are more capable.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? While Hegseth cited a 2015 U.S. Marines Corps report that stated all-male units were faster and more lethal than mixed-gender units, critics said it was biased. Newsweek notes that the lobby group Women in International Security called its research methods 'fundamentally flawed.' After it came out, then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said he had problems with the study: namely, that 'it started out with a fairly large component of the men thinking this is not a good idea.' 'When you start out with that mindset, you're almost presupposing the outcome,' Mabus said. The 44-year-old current co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend' served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois took Hegseth to task over his remarks on women in combat roles. 'We can't go to war today without our women military members,' Duckworth said. Duckworth is an Iraq war veteran and Purple Heart recipient who was one of the first women to fly combat missions as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot. When her helicopter was hit by a grenade in 2004, she lost both legs and some mobility in her right arm, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. If she could talk to Hegseth, 'I would ask him, 'Where do you think I lost my legs, in a bar fight?'' Duckworth said in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday. Homan outlines enforcement priorities as Trump’s ‘border czar’ Women in the military Overall, the number of service numbers dropped 2.7% in 2022, though the percentage of women in the military inched upward, according to a Department of Defense report from 2023. Women, the Defense Department says, make up about 17.5% of the active-duty force. The number of uniformed women serving in special operations, including those in operator and support roles ― has increased significantly in recent years. The overall proportion of women in special operations forces went up from 7.9% in 2016 to 12% in 2023. More than 2 million of the veterans currently living in the United States are women. They are the fastest growing group of veterans as well — by 2040, women are projected to make up 18% of all veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs said.

'The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!'

Presidential appointments: How do they work?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has until his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day to build out his administration and fill thousands of roles. That means assigning leaders to oversee every executive department, including national security, public health, labor, and the Justice Department among others. A president typically appoints about 4,000 positions across the federal government. Of those, about 1,200 appointments require Senate approval, according to Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition estimates. Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOGE Common appointments that require Senate approval include cabinet secretaries, agency heads and ambassadors. Other roles, like advisors, aids, and senior officials in various agencies, are also filled by presidential appointees but don’t require Senate approval. Trump has announced the names of several people he hopes to appoint to serve in his administration. You can track his selections here. How does a nominee get appointed? The president-elect's transition team is busy identifying possible candidates for each role and making recommendations to the incoming president. For roles that require approval, the incoming president's formal written nomination for an appointment will trigger Senate scrutiny. The vetting process varies by position. Cabinet nominees are generally subject to FBI background checks, financial disclosure reviews and pre-Senate hearings. Trump has pressured lawmakers in the Senate to allow him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote while the chamber is on recess. That would be considered a recess appointment — something the Senate hasn’t allowed presidents to make since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling made it more challenging. Which positions does Trump need to fill? Trump will need to appoint people to leadership roles within his Cabinet and elsewhere in his administration. The heads of 15 executive departments make up the Cabinet and are often considered the president’s closest advisors. Departments with leaders in the Cabinet include: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Attorney General. What are Trump’s plans for Medicaid? The Cabinet also includes the White House Chief of Staff, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, the Director of National Intelligence, and the US Trade Representative, and the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Small Business Administration. Cabinet members guide the president and keep him informed about each respective office. They also play a role in the line of succession, should the president no longer be able to serve. The president also appoints the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions. Those include the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, federal judges, ambassadors and other officials.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/presidential-appointments-work/	2024-11-14T11:28:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182353743.jpg?w=900
How will Trump's tariffs impact everyday Americans?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to impose sweeping tariffs in his second term, but following through on that promise could come at a high cost for everyday Americans. 'If we were to see the full panoply of tariffs that candidate Trump proposed, you would see a substantial increase in the price of almost everything we buy every day,' said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Trump hasn't been shy about his love for tariffs — which are a tax on goods imported from other countries — calling them 'the greatest thing ever invented' on the campaign trail. But economists warn those taxes, which are almost always paid by the importer, largely get passed onto consumers. As a candidate, Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China as well as a 10% to 20% 'universal' tariff on all imports, arguing his plan would reduce the trade deficit and protect American jobs. Frustrated Americans await the economic changes they voted for with Trump The president-elect has also threatened a 25% tariff on Mexico, the United States' top trading partner, if the country doesn't do more to stop what he described as an 'onslaught of criminals and drugs' coming into the U.S. If that happens, shoppers can expect to pay more at the grocery store, particularly for items like fresh produce, much of which gets imported from abroad, Lincicome pointed out. The Tax Foundation — a nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit — recently looked at a dozen estimates analyzing Trump's proposed tariffs, and every study consistently found his proposals would negatively impact the U.S. economy. Other commentators are less worried, arguing that Trump's tariff threats are merely a negotiating tactic to gain leverage. 'He has talked about using those as a negotiating tool to keep China from stealing our technology, to get China to allow our goods and services to go into China … we need to have more pressure on China to have them accept American goods and services, which they’re not doing now,' Grover Norquist, the Republican founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, told 'NewsNation Prime' this month. During a recent NewsNation town hall, now Vice President-elect JD Vance defended his running mate's tariff policies, pointing out that inflation was low during Trump's first term despite aggressive tariffs. How would tariffs be different in a second Trump term? Trump's new tariffs are expected to have far greater consequences than his previous ones because of the sheer magnitude of the proposals. 'Because we're talking about a wider range of products and a higher level of tariffs and consumer-facing goods, the direct price pain would be more obvious and significant this time around,' Lincicome said. Items like smartphones and laptops, which weren't subject to previous tariffs, could be hit especially hard. Under Trump's proposed tariffs, consumers could see laptop and tablet prices rise 46%, and smartphone prices jump 26%, according to a Consumer Technology Association report. The 60% tariff on Chinese goods alone would represent a near tripling of the current tariffs on imports from China, economist Pierre Lemieux noted in a report. 'Trump claims the tariffs would boost the economy and working-class families. In fact, they would hit hard the American economy and lower-income families,' Lemieux wrote. Retaliation is also a concern. China and Mexico would likely respond with tariffs of their own, which could hurt American exports. 'What we saw during the first Trump term was a lot of actual tariffs imposed, and almost no governments backing down in response to those tariffs,' Lincicome said. Mexico's government has already signaled it could hit back with its own trade restrictions — a move that would have serious consequences for American farmers, chemical manufacturers and other sectors. Altogether, U.S. exports to Mexico were $362 billion in 2022 and accounted for almost 16% of all American exports that year, according to the most recent figures from the Office of the United States Trade Representative. How much could Trump's tariffs push prices up? An analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates Trump's proposed tariffs would cost a typical U.S. household more than $2,600 a year. 'High tariffs also imply a massive shifting of the tax burden from richer taxpayers toward lower-income Americans,' the report said. A separate estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale estimates Trump's tariffs could raise consumer prices by 1.4% to 5.1%. That's the equivalent of $1,900 to $7,600 per household. The uptick in prices would likely show up at the grocery store. That's because much of the food consumed in the United States — about 60% of fresh fruit and 38% of vegetables — is imported, according to Department of Agriculture data. Consumer products like apparel, toys, furniture and footwear, are also expected to get more expensive with new tariffs, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said earlier this month. The NRF warned the proposed tariffs would have a 'significant' and 'detrimental' impact on a wide range of items and reduce Americans' spending power by $46 billion to $78 billion each year they're in place. A $90 pair of athletic shoes is expected to jump to $106-$116, the NRF estimated. Meanwhile, an $80 pair of men's jeans would cost $90 to $96. It's also worth mentioning: Trump's first-term tariffs didn't send prices skyrocketing across the board, but they did come at a cost. After accounting for direct costs and efficiency losses, economists estimate the tariffs increased costs for average American households by about $830 per year. For example, Trump imposed a tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018. Researchers estimate the price of washing machines increased by around 12%, about $86 per unit. Do tariffs protect jobs? One of Trump's main arguments in favor of tariffs is that they prevent American businesses from offshoring jobs, but it's not that simple. Workers who produce the specific goods covered by tariffs often benefit, but tariffs can also hurt workers in other industries that rely on those imports. 'You can protect the steel industry with tariffs, but higher steel prices are going to harm manufacturers that need steel in the United States and are going to harm all those workers,' Lincicome said. In other words, a government tariff may be trading jobs in one industry at the expense of jobs in another. Going back to the washing machine example, researchers determined the policy created about 1,800 new jobs, but at a steep cost of as much as $817,000 per job. The Tax Foundation estimates Trump's proposed tariffs would bring down total employment by 684,000 jobs — an estimate that doesn't include the effects of retaliation. A 2024 paper by a group of top economists looked at Trump's 2018 tariffs and found that 'import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered US employment in newly-protected sectors.' However, retaliatory tariffs had 'clear negative impacts,' primarily in agriculture.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-tariffs-prices/	2024-11-14T10:45:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/6550cf841f1d47.44211312.jpeg?w=900
Examples of government waste, inefficiency as Trump announces DOG...	(NewsNation) — Tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending and 'wasteful expenditures.' NewsNation compiled a list of existing wasteful and inefficient government spending examples. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? Congressional funding for expired programs The Congressional Budget Office recently found that Congress provided $516 billion in appropriations this fiscal year to programs that had expired under federal law. The funds were associated with nearly 500 expired authorizations, according to the CBO's July report. 'Nearly two-thirds ($320 billion) of that $516 billion was provided for activities whose authorizations expired more than a decade ago,' the report said. According to CBO's estimates, about half of the authorized appropriations in the report expired at least 10 years ago, and the oldest expired in 1980. In 2023, the amount of funding for expired authorizations was $519 billion. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Payment errors The federal government made $247 billion worth of payment errors in fiscal year 2022 and $236 billion in 2023, according to the Government Accountability Office. These errors, also known as improper payments, include overpayments or payments that should not have been made, such as to someone who died or someone no longer eligible for government programs. Estimates show the federal government spent $2.7 trillion in payment errors since 2003. In 2022, the majority of improper payments spanned across 82 programs, a majority coming from Medicaid ($81 billion) and Medicare ($47 billion). 'Improper payments and fraud are long-standing and significant problems in the federal government,' said House testimony from GAO in September. What Kristi Noem’s DHS appointment could mean for the border Maintaining empty buildings Federal government agencies are using just 12% of the space in their headquarters buildings on average, according to the Public Buildings Reform Board, which is an independent federal agency focused on recommending the disposal of underutilized federal properties. 'Even before the pandemic, of the federal properties analyzed, federal occupancy was low, particularly in Washington D.C.,' the board's report to Congress in March said. These spaces must be furnished, which also costs money. The House Oversight Committee spent $3.3 billion on furniture over the past few years. Apparently, to furnish office spaces left mostly empty under maximum telework. Some agencies spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on updating empty conference rooms 'Hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds are spent annually just to maintain government-owned properties that should be sold off,' said Chairman Rep. James Comer of the House Oversight Committee in a hearing last year. 'A billion dollars or more could be saved annually by terminating unneeded federal office space leases. Unused federal space was an issue prior to the pandemic — federal property management has long been on GAO’s High-Risk List — but it’s now become one that is simply too big — and too costly — to ignore.' Kamala Harris campaign now millions in debt Producing pennies A penny may cost one cent for people using it to pay for goods and services, but it costs triple that for the government to produce it. For 19 years, the cost of producing pennies has surpassed the value of the coin. The same is true for nickels. Though valued at five cents, a nickel costs 11.5 cents for the government to produce one. Producing these two coins last year cost the U.S. Mint $179 million. Federal agency recommendations The Government Accountability Office reports more than 5,300 open recommendations for federal agencies to make the government work better. In July, GAO estimated taxpayers could save between $106 billion and $208 billion if the recommendations were implemented.

Trump's Rubio pick divides Republicans	Tensions are brewing over President-elect Trump’s move to tap Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to serve as secretary of State, with some of the president-elect’s allies voicing concerns about the pick. The choice has already set into motion the process of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) choosing a replacement for Rubio in the Senate, and some senators have already said they would vote to confirm Rubio. But while Trump’s choice of Rubio received praise from various Republicans and Democrats, those in the so-called MAGA wing of the GOP have expressed a mix of surprise and disappointment about the pick, with many hoping Trump would choose former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. 'I’ve been most surprised with the Rubio pick,' said one source close to the transition, who described the Florida senator as 'not that MAGA.' The delay in formally announcing Rubio raised questions about whether Trump was navigating how to move forward amid the internal disagreement, but Trump’s announcement came shortly after Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) was elected Senate majority leader. 'To me what that looks more towards was making sure that Rubio was being able to be a part of the Senate majority leader elections,' said Alex Stroman, Trump’s 2017 inaugural spokesperson and a personal friend of Grenell’s. Stroman said Rubio is someone Republicans are happy about and the kind of person Trump wanted from the outset. 'Anytime that you have nominations for a president’s Cabinet, there are discussions that play out both publicly and privately,' he said. The source who expressed surprise about Rubio suggested the pick may have been influenced by Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff who has worked for decades in Florida politics. The New York Times first reported late Monday that Trump was expected to name Rubio as his secretary of State nominee, and Trump on Wednesday confirmed the choice in a statement. 'He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,' Trump said. On Monday, following reports that Trump would pick Rubio, conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk warned his followers to not 'jump to conclusions.' 'If Trump hasn’t confirmed it on Truth, don’t jump to conclusions and don’t believe everything you see,' Kirk wrote. And earlier this week, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had expressed opposition to the prospect of Rubio being nominated for the position. The decision to make Rubio secretary of State is far from the most controversial choice Trump has made during his transition so far. Shortly after announcing his intention to nominate the senator, Trump also announced he had picked another Florida Republican, Rep. Matt Gaetz, to be attorney general, a move that drew stunned responses from many Republicans on Capitol Hill. While many in MAGA world have expressed displeasure at the idea of Trump appointing Rubio, others seem to be on board with the scenario if it means Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, will fill his Senate seat. On Tuesday, Maye Musk posted on the social platform X that Lara Trump should be Rubio’s replacement and called the upper chamber 'an old man’s club.' Elon Musk reposted his mother’s post, writing that 'Lara Trump is genuinely great.' Elon Musk’s approval of Lara Trump in the position is notable given his recent close proximity to President-elect Trump. Musk has been a constant presence around Mar-a-Lago and even appeared in Trump’s family photo following his election win. Several other Trump allies have weighed in to support the idea of Lara Trump being the pick, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who argued in a post on X that appointing the president-elect’s daughter-in-law would help avoid a 'messy primary' in 2026. With the president-elect's decision to nominate Rubio, the choice of his replacement in the Senate will fall to DeSantis. A source familiar with the matter told The Hill that DeSantis’s chief of staff was favored for the position and that the other candidates include Florida’s lieutenant governor and attorney general. The source said that the president-elect may push for his daughter-in-law, but later added 'our governor has not gotten a call about appointing Lara.' Sources have been reluctant to openly discuss the dynamics surrounding the nomination and the subsequent domino effect on Florida politics and in MAGA world. Rubio has had something of a winding journey to become one of Trump’s closer allies. He and Trump were fierce rivals during the 2016 GOP primary, with the two exchanging insults about their manhood. But the senator became an informal adviser to Trump during his first term, and Rubio was one of three finalists considered to be Trump’s running mate this year before Vice President-elect JD Vance got the nod. To be sure, the Rubio pick has gotten a warm reception from members of both parties. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said he would vote to confirm Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) praised the choice. But Rubio has also faced criticism from some Trump allies for being too much of a foreign policy hawk, a term Trump has used disparagingly to talk about rivals like former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). However, his tough approach to China and Iran largely aligns with Trump’s talk on the campaign trail, and Rubio has in recent weeks argued the Ukraine-Russia conflict will need to end through a negotiated agreement, something that also echoes what Trump has said on the topic. Grenell, comparatively, has been one of Trump’s staunchest allies dating back to the start of his first term, and he had been something of an envoy for the president-elect while he was out of office. Grenell previously served as ambassador to Germany and acting director of intelligence during Trump’s first term. He joined Trump during a recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and he was an active presence on the campaign trail. In what could be seen as a tacit acknowledgment of the divisions over Trump's choice, Grenell congratulated Rubio on X on Wednesday night. The Florida senator promptly responded. 'Thank you! Kind words from a great American who will be a vital part of protecting America and Americans in the years to come!' Rubio tweeted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-rubio-pick-divides-republicans/	2024-11-14T03:31:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/rubiomarco_011824gn02_w.jpg?w=900
Trump 'border czar': Cartels need terrorist label due to death co...	(NewsNation) — Former ICE Director Tom Homan, tapped to lead border enforcement in President-elect Donald Trump's administration, says he will prioritize deporting criminals and national security threats while pushing to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. 'There's more than one priority,' Homan said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'CUOMO,' revealing that authorities have identified more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions and final deportation orders who remain in the United States. The incoming border chief outlined three major policy changes he believes Congress should implement: Reform the Flores Settlement Agreement to allow longer detention of migrant families Modify the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to enable faster processing of unaccompanied minors Overhaul asylum laws and reinstate the 'Remain in Mexico' program Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Homan defended Trump-era policies, saying border crossings dropped to historic lows under the previous administration's approach. He criticized the policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, saying they led to record-high encounters and overwhelmed Border Patrol resources. 'If we don't secure the border, more migrants are going to die. More women are going to be raped. There's no downside in securing the border,' he told NewsNation. 'Congress needs to fix this. Immigration enforcement is very controversial, is very emotional. I get it, but we have to secure the border because a secure border is going to save lives,' Homan said. Tom Homan: Cartels should be labeled as terrorist organizations Homan, who served under six presidents and faced recent death threats from cartels, strongly backed Trump's plan to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, noting they have 'killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in the world combined.' Democratic Party has 'lost touch': Rep. Seth Moulton 'The criminal cartels in Mexico is like a Fortune 500 company,' Homan said, describing their expansion into 42 countries and growing control of drug distribution networks within the U.S. Tom Homan pledges to find missing migrant children Homan revealed plans to launch a major initiative to locate approximately 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children who entered the U.S. but cannot be accounted for by authorities. 'Some are going to be in forced labor. We already found some in forced labor ... Some are gonna be sex trafficking. Some are living with pedophiles,' Homan said, pledging to make finding these children a top priority. 'Border czar' Tom Homan: All we want to do is enforce the law When pressed about the potential economic impact of mass deportations, particularly on industries heavily reliant on immigrant labor, Homan said that enforcement would focus on criminals and security threats rather than indiscriminate roundups. Trump accused of avoiding press after controversial admin appointments 'If you're in the country illegally, you're in violation of law, so you're not off the table, but we're going to prioritize what we do,' Homan said. Homan pushes for asylum system reforms Homan cited data showing about 85% of asylum claims at the southern border are ultimately rejected, arguing the system needs significant reform. He said the current process allows too many migrants to enter the U.S. based on an initial screening with a 'very low' threshold of proof. 'They learned a few key phrases from the cartels of what to say to make yourself pass that first interview,' Homan said. He advocated for raising the standard of proof in initial screenings to match the higher burden required in court hearings. 'If you're really escaping fear and persecution from your home government, you're going to wait in Mexico to escape that fear and persecution,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-border-czar-tom-homan-priorities/	2024-11-13T20:03:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_6d5094.jpg?w=900
Democratic Party has 'lost touch': Rep. Seth Moulton	(NewsNation) — Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., is critical of his party and the role it played in losing the 2024 election. 'We need to look ourselves in the mirror as Democrats and ask, 'How do we reconnect with the majority of American voters?'' Moulton said Wednesday on 'CUOMO.' 'We've clearly lost touch.' Democrats’ election reckoning pits liberals against centrists Moulton was recently quoted in a story from The New York Times about Democratic finger-pointing after Vice President Harris lost the 2024 election, saying his party had leaned too heavily into identity politics, forging a path for President-elect Trump and Republicans to a decisive victory. He has faced backlash from his party, with Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair Steve Kerrigan, for example, telling the Boston Globe that Moulton’s comments 'do not represent the broad view of our party.' Moulton responded to backlash about his transgender athlete comments, saying the response to them proves his point. 'I was just speaking authentically as a dad about one of many issues where I think we’re just out of touch with the majority of voters, and I stand by my position,' Moulton said during an MSNBC appearance. 'The backlash I’ve received proves my point that we can’t even have these discussions as a party.' Moulton told 'CUOMO' that if his party doesn’t 'come up with a new strategy, a winning strategy going forward, then we're never gonna be able to stop Trump.' Matt Gaetz is Trump’s pick for attorney general Moulton doesn’t oppose transgender rights, but says the party has been too focused on that cause and similar social issues. He was first elected to Congress in 2015 and is a member of the Congressional Equality Caucus. The caucus promotes LGBTQ equality in the House and has strongly opposed efforts to bar trans athletes from sports teams that best align with their gender identity. His 2024 reelection campaign was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group. Twice in the past, Moulton co-sponsored House Democrats’ Transgender Bill of Rights, which included protections for transgender athletes to participate on sports teams that match their gender identity. Even last spring, Moulton voted against passing a Republican-backed bill to bar transgender student-athletes from sports.

UFO House hearing witness: Pentagon 'clearly covering something u...	(NewsNation) — Independent journalist Michael Shellenberger testified Wednesday at a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. 'The Pentagon is clearly covering something up,' Shellenberger said Wednesday on 'Vargas Reports.' 'The Pentagon is treating us like children. It's a very paternalistic attitude. They just need to release the information, obviously make sure that nothing gets out to our enemies. But we're long overdue for this sort of disclosure and transparency.' What is Donald Trump’s position on UFOs? Shellenberger, who has written extensively about a program called 'Immaculate Constellation,' testified during Wednesday’s hearing that members of Congress have expressed growing frustration since 2021 over the military and intelligence community’s refusal to reveal 'concrete' information. What is Immaculate Constellation? Shellenberger detailed his reporting on the alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied the existence of records regarding the program. Shellenberger highlighted the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs. Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, outlined new ways for the space agency to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently chief growth officer at Redwire Space, Gold stressed in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf and not for any other organization. 'Agencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,' Gold's prepared testimony read.

Trump accused of avoiding press after controversial admin appoint...	(NewsNation) — Unlike his most recent predecessors, President-elect Donald Trump has not answered questions explaining his key and at times controversial appointments or explaining his priorities now that he has been elected. Trump transition officials are not providing details about when he will have a general news conference. Trump has had two limited exchanges with reporters — one-on-ones with NBC and the New York Post. 'President Trump was the most press-accessible candidate in the race, by far,' Trump spokesman Steve Cheung told NewsNation. 'He will continue to engage with the press regularly and his team will remain committed to providing timely answers on a wide range of inquiries. Stay tuned!' Trump, Biden meet to discuss peaceful transfer of power Political analyst Chris Cillizza calls the decision not to hold forth before the cameras 'UnTrumpy.' In 1992, Bill Clinton held his first formal news conference eight days after being elected. In that event, Clinton announced some of his first appointments, but his Cabinet picks came later in a series of news conferences. Clinton did answer some questions two days after the election as he was leaving the Arkansas State Capitol. And Clinton held a news conference three days after defeating Robert Dole in 1996, in which he announced a change in his chiefs of staff. FBI should probe Gabbard, Gaetz before confirmation: John Bolton The election of 2000 was different because both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush answered many media questions in various forums as the election outcome and the various court fights dragged on until Dec. 12. When he was reelected in 2004, Bush held a formal news conference with White House reporters two days later — Nov. 4. Barack Obama was quicker to face the press after he won in 2008. He talked to reporters three days after the election and announced his chief of staff selection. After his reelection, Obama waited eight days later before holding a news conference to talk about his second term. Joe Biden held his first news conference as president-elect a week after his 2020 election. While Trump held news conferences during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and criticized both of his general election opponents for the lack of media accessibility, he also did not face reporters for six weeks (Dec. 19) after winning in 2016. What Kristi Noem’s DHS appointment could mean for the border? Since his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, all of Trump’s personnel announcements have been made through prepared statements released in his name. Cillizza argues that 'providing statements is the not the same as taking questions at a press conference.' Also: the Trump transition team is not holding regular briefings to discuss appointments or what policies the new administration will pursue.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-media-appointments/	2024-11-13T18:34:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e356c4c660d2.57860006.jpeg?w=900
FBI should probe Gabbard, Gaetz before confirmation: John Bolton	(NewsNation) — John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under George W. Bush and a former national security adviser in the first Trump administration, said President-elect Donald Trump’s intention to nominate former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Rep. Matt Gaetz to his Cabinet shows Trump is not serious about intelligence gathering. 'With his (Trump) announcement of Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence, he’s sending a signal that we’ve lost our mind when it comes to collecting intelligence,' Bolton told NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' But Bolton says Gabbard isn’t the worst pick Trump has made. Trump names top campaign aides as senior White House staff 'Up until a few hours ago, I would have said that (Gabbard) was the worst Cabinet appointment in recent American history. Since Matt Gaetz’s nomination (to be attorney general), he clearly has taken the lead on that score,' Bolton said. Gaetz, who said Wednesday he is immediately resigning from Congress after being nominated to be attorney general, faced a yearslong Justice Department investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction of justice. Last year, the department said it would not bring charges. Gaetz is still the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation as well as a civil lawsuit involving allegations of a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives 'I don’t think either she (Gabbard) or Matt Gaetz ought to have a confirmation hearing until they have both had full-field FBI investigations,' said Bolton. 'Given the Russian propaganda that she (Gabbard) has espoused … I think she’s a serious threat to our national security. I think Republican senators should reject both of them.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/gabbard-gaetz-need-fbi-probes-bolton/	2024-11-13T17:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/image_a7cc50.png?w=900
House Republicans strike deal to make it harder to oust Speaker	Hard-line conservatives have struck a tentative deal with House Republicans concerned about chaos in the chamber, agreeing to raise the threshold to force a vote to oust the Speaker in exchange for concessions on rule changes — potentially putting Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on a glide path to keep the gavel come January. The deal — which multiple sources confirmed to The Hill — would significantly weaken the House 'motion to vacate' rule, eliminating the threat of any one member triggering the kind of snap vote that resulted in the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). That historic ouster has loomed over Johnson’s tenure in the top job. Under the agreement, hard-line conservatives would agree to raising the threshold to force a vote on ousting the Speaker from one member to nine members. The mechanism has been a key point of contention within the House GOP conference since McCarthy’s ouster. Hard-line conservatives were adamant about keeping it to one lawmaker before Wednesday. In exchange for that concession, other members would drop the proposed rules changes — spearheaded by those in the Main Street Caucus — that aimed to punish members for rebelling against the majority of the party in ways that risked grinding legislative activity to a halt. Proposed penalties included removing members from committees if they support a motion to vacate against a Republican Speaker. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who has been a vocal opponent of the rule changes, called them a 'nonstarter.' 'All of the targeting amendments and stuff, those are all gone. And that was, as I tweeted out earlier, those were a nonstarter,' he said. 'Those were a deal-killer.' The deal was hatched shortly before Republicans voted on a nominee for Speaker, and after President-elect Trump threw his support behind the Louisiana Republican. Johnson, members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and those in the self-described pragmatic Main Street Caucus were involved in the discussions. Johnson met members and allies of the Freedom Caucus minutes before Wednesday’s internal election, two sources told The Hill. Conservatives who balked at the proposed changes — many of whom are members of the Freedom Caucus — had plotted to oppose Johnson’s nomination to the Speakership in Wednesday’s internal GOP elections as a form of protest. First they planned to nominate a last-minute protest candidate, then they planned to force a recorded vote on Johnson’s nomination to showcase opposition. But after the agreement, Johnson was nominated to remain Speaker by unanimous voice vote. No member voiced opposition, according to multiple sources in the room. That is good news to the Speaker, who will have another slim majority and will need near unanimity to be elected Speaker on the House floor when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Speaker Johnson appeared with Main Street Caucus Chair Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) to confirm the deal later on Wednesday. Dusty Johnson said that Harris had reached out to him earlier in the day to strike the deal. 'That motion to vacate will be set at nine in return for getting rid of some amendments that probably would have divided this conference,' Dusty Johnson said. 'Andy did a good job of explaining to Main Street leadership why those amendments would have divided the republican conference.' Harris noted that Trump had visited the conference earlier in the day and asked for Republican unity. 'We've been able to work across the conference to eliminate the controversial issues that could have divided us and move forward together to deliver on the President's agenda,' Harris said. Some lawmakers, however, are warning that the situation is tenuous. Roy, a leading voice on the Speakership talks, wrote on the social platform X that there is 'much more work to be done' when discussing the agreement. 'For now - those offering the retaliation amendments agreed to set aside ALL of them while conversations continue about organization, so @SpeakerJohnson was chosen as Speaker,' he wrote. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), meanwhile, told reporters 'they are still going to be negotiating that as we get to January.' Proponents of the 'accountability amendments' in question were bitter about the chaos that plagued the House GOP over the last two years, not only from the weeks of standstill after McCarthy’s ouster, but from legislation that hard-liners blocked by tanking procedural votes. They worried such actions could impede President-elect Trump’s agenda as he takes office, and pointed to the rebellions as a reason why Republicans did not win more House seats. But the hard-line conservatives balked at the proposals, which were antithetical to their goals of further democratizing power. Such punishments for breaking from the party would prevent members from representing their constituents, they argued. An internal memo circulated among conservatives before the deal was struck Wednesday said that the amendments would be 'sowing seeds of division' when Republicans will have 'no room for error in the next Congress,' and argued the rules would 'punish those who fought for President Trump and his agenda for years and provide excuses for those who will likely obstruct it.' One proposed amendment from Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) would have consequences for members who support a 'motion to vacate' the Speaker, removing them from committees. 'We need to have cohesion and unity. We need to have parameters set,' Van Orden told The Hill in an interview on Wednesday morning, before the deal was struck. Van Orden said that if unified Republican control of government does not change how the House GOP operates, 'then Republicans don’t deserve the majority.' 'If we don't act boldly and decisively, then we have no business governing. And that is a flag that I'm planting in the ground. So we've got the House, we've got the Senate, got the White House, and if we don't act on the mandates that were given by the American people, we don't deserve it.' Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) proposed two rules changes, the first of which would remove members from committees if they voted against the 'rule' — procedural votes that govern debate and consideration of legislation on the House floor that are considered tests of party loyalty. His second proposal would have imposed similar consequences for those who vote for the party’s 'Speaker Designate' on the House floor, a scenario that led to the House taking days to officially elect McCarthy as Speaker in January 2023, preventing the House from conducting any legislative activity. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), too, had an amendment to remove members from committees if they defy the party on a procedural vote. Johnson told Politico on Tuesday that he was not in favor of those rule changes, saying he was 'not in favor of punitive measures and rules.' But the hard-liners had wanted to see him explicitly advocate against the proposed rule changes. 'He can say he opposes them, but he's not going to try and stop them or whip against them,' Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) said. Johnson, according to Crane, told House Republicans that he would not put his thumb on the scale and that it would be up to the House GOP to decide on the rules. That fueled the risk of a formal show of opposition to Johnson. But the brokering of a deal, which caused a slight delay to the start of leadership elections as it was negotiated on Wednesday, ended with unanimous approval for the Speaker in a massive win for him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-republicans-strike-deal-to-make-it-harder-to-oust-speaker/	2024-11-13T16:44:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_091824gn19_w.jpg?w=900
Gaetz resigns from Congress after AG nod	Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) will resign from Congress 'effective immediately' after being nominated to serve as attorney general by President-elect Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) announced on Wednesday. The news came hours after Trump sent shockwaves throughout Washington with his pick of Gaetz — a staunch ally of the president-elect — for attorney general. Gaetz still faces Senate confirmation. Johnson postulated that the Florida Republican decided to leave the House early to speed up the process to replace him, with hopes that his successor can be decided by the time the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. 'I think, out of deference to us, he issued his resignation letter effective immediately, of Congress. That caught us by surprise a little bit, but I asked him what the reasoning was and he said, well, you can’t have too many absences, so under Florida state law there’s about an eight-week period to select and fill a vacant seat. And so by doing so today that allows me, I’ve already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said let’s start the clock,' Johnson said.

(NewsNation) — Experts and former military officials who testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee exploring unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday admit that there is a heightened sense of awareness about the possible existence of unidentified technology, which some people fear could be threatening American airspace. Former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo, retired U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet, independent journalist Michael Shellenberger and former NASA official Michael Gold all testified before the committee. The experts were questioned by committee members on a number of topics surrounding UAPs and what many lawmakers consider a lack of transparency by the federal government on the subject. What is the Langley AFB Incident? Security around Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia was increased after a Wall Street Journal report detailed more than a dozen cases of drones flying over the military installation in late 2023. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action The report suggested that the cases took place over a 17-day period when unidentified drones flew over the base where F-22 Raptor stealth fighters are based. The report indicated that at this time, it remains unknown whether the drone presence equates to a threat to the nation’s security. That led committee members to ask experts Wednesday to link the presence of UAPs and military installation sites like Langley. 'There’s definitely enough data out there to suggest that there is certainly some sort of relations between sensitive U.S. military installations and also our nuclear equities and also some of our Department of Energy sites,' Elizondo testified when asked about the 2023 incident. 'There is a long historical record … that demonstrates this. This is not a new trend. This has been going on for decades, and this information has been obfuscated, unfortunately, from (lawmakers). 'I think that’s problematic because ultimately, at the end of the day, we have a significant situation here. We have something that can enter into U.S. airspace completely with no attribution.' Gallaudet said there were other instances of drones over Langley before the Wall Street Journal brought the details of the 2023 activity to light. In addition, he said there is evidence to suggest other incidents took place in and around other U.S. military installations over the past 50 years. Elizondo added that he believes that while UAPs may be targeting U.S. military installations, it is possible there is also greater technology being used to monitor the presence of UAPs. He said that there is a program within the Department of Defense and intelligence committee called IPB (Initial Preparations of the Battlespace) and that specific technologies are being used to prepare those locations. Elizondo added that there is a calculus of capabilities versus the intent of whether something rises to the level of a threat to national security that must be figured out. 'Certainly, if I were wearing my national security hat, even if there were a 2% chance that there was some sort of hostile intent here, that’s 2% higher than we can really accept,' Elizondo told committee members. Why was the 'Tic Tac' video not released? House committee members also questioned experts about the 'Tic Tac' incident that took place in 2004. On Nov. 14 of that year, U.S. Navy aviators were sent to intercept a UAP that resembled the popular breath mint due to its shape and color. Pentagon officials have since struggled to explain what happened. What is the Pentagon’s alleged ‘Immaculate Constellation’ program? When asked why video of the incident was not released, Gallaudet testified he does not believe there is 'any good reason' for the Department of Defense to withhold important information and data from Congress. He said that is especially the case when matters of national security are involved. 'I will speculate that they don’t want to share that kind of information because it reveals weaknesses in our ability to monitor and protect our airspace,' Gallaudet said. Gallaudet testified Wednesday that earlier this year, he met with the Department of Defense’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office in what he said turned out to be an hourslong influence operation on the retired U.S. Navy rear admiral. Gallaudet said the committee attempted to convince him of the validity of the 'very flawed and error-ridden' historical records report. The group also attempted, he said, to have the former Navy officer question incidents like 'Tic Tac' and to get him to admit 'Tic Tac' was American technology. What are the threats UAPs could pose? As the House committee exploring UAP continues to push for transparency and answers, the biggest question surrounding the phenomena is what kind of threat they pose to national security and if foreign countries could be behind them. Gallaudet said during his testimony that he believes Wednesday’s hearing should be used as a catalyst 'to improve and bolster' the country’s air defense capabilities as well as its maritime awareness capabilities. He said that between 2020 and 2022, a government task force that investigated UAPs in the Department of Defense was active, but it is now inactive. During their testimony, the group of experts all called for more whole-of-government efforts that could provide answers about the origins of UAPs and the threat they may pose to national security. 'Obviously, there’s holes in it,' Gallaudet said. 'Whether it be UAP of nonhuman (intelligence) direction or China or any other adversary.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/uap-threat-national-security-airspace/	2024-11-13T14:24:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/AARO-UAPS-sighting-Nexstar-4212023.png?w=900
Pete Hegseth: What to know about Trump's pick for Defense Secreta...	(NewsNation) — Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Pete Hegseth as the next Secretary of Defense has gotten a lot of attention. While some praised the 44-year-old current co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' others criticized Hegseth as lacking experience. If confirmed by the Senate, Hegseth would be the second youngest Secretary of Defense, after Donald Rumsfeld, who was confirmed in 1975 at the age of 43. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,' Trump said in a statement Tuesday. 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our military will be great again, and America will Never back down.' Pete Hegseth’s time in the military, Fox News Hegseth served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq after graduating from Princeton University in 2003. He earned two Bronze stars. Formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, which the Associated Press writes is backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, Hegseth ran for U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012, but lost his race. Hegseth has been contributing to the Fox News Channel for a decade. A Fox News spokesperson. to the AP, said Hegseth's 'insights and analysis especially about the military resonated deeply with our viewers.' DNC staffers resign with Kamala Harris campaign $20M in debt He is an author of books including, 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Pete and his wife Jenny live in Middle Tennessee and have seven children, according to his website. Pete Hegseth on women in military Comments Hegseth made on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' about women in combat are getting a lot of attention. 'I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,' Hegseth said. 'It hasn't made us more effective, it hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.' While Hegseth said he's served with women and they've been 'great,' institutions shouldn't have to 'incentivize' that in positions where 'men are more capable.' Pete Hegseth walks to an elevator for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, Dec. 15, 2016. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Pete Hegseth criticizes 'woke' military In his book, Hegseth wrote that the next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. 'Lots of people need to be fired,' Hegseth wrote, according to Reuters. Trump in June told Fox News he would fire generals he called 'woke.' Hegseth has decried so-called programs that promote equity and inclusion, and previously accused the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, of 'pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians.' Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump When Trump was creating his first cabinet, he reportedly considered Hegseth to be head of the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016, the AP wrote, and then again in 2018 when Secretary David Shulkin faced criticism before being ousted. Hegseth confirmed on a podcast last week that he was interviewed multiple times for the VA position in 2016. 'Ultimately I think (Trump) thought I was a little young,' Hegseth said during his appearance on 'The Shawn Ryan Show.' In 2019, Hegseth encouraged Trump to pardon U.S. service members accused of war crimes on his Fox News show, and said on social media that the President-elect doing so 'would be amazing.' This was despite warnings from U.S. officials and organizations that it would damage the military justice system's integrity. Trump ultimately pardoned a former U.S. Army commando set to stand trial in the killing of a suspected Afghan bomb-maker and a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire upon three Afghans, killing two. Years before that, on a 2015 'Fox &amp; Friends' segment on the 240th anniversary of the Army’s founding, Hegseth went viral when he struck a master sergeant in the arm with an ax. Both he and Fox News were named in a lawsuit that was discontinued in 2019, according to the AP. UFOs ‘enigmatic and frustrating:’ witness says in House hearing Reactions to Hegseth’s appointment Sources NewsNation has spoken to are shocked at his being tapped by Trump to lead the Department of Defense, echoing criticisms that he is inexperienced. Retired Army Major General William Enyart told NewsNation that if Hegseth is confirmed, U.S. adversaries will view Hegseth as a 'pretty boy from TV.' 'Trump picking Pete Hegseth is the most hilariously predictably stupid thing,' Former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said on X. Speaking on CNN’s Anderson Cooper, though, Kingziner called Hegseth 'very smart when it comes to things like defense policy.' Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's concerned Hegseth won't be able to tackle Pentagon bureaucracy. Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist 'I confess I didn’t know who he was until 20 minutes ago,' Smith told reporters, according to POLITICO. 'And he certainly doesn’t seem to have any background whatsoever in DOD policy.' Speaking to The Hill, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass, a former Marine Corps officer said he believes Hegseth is 'going to try very hard to politicize the military.' 'That’s been his MO at Fox News and in his variety of positions since he got out of the National Guard as well, and so that’s not going to be a good influence,' Moulton said in an interview with The Hill. However, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla, who will also become a new member of Trump's administration as national security adviser, said Hegseth is going to be a leader who has the grit to bring 'real reform' to the Pentagon. 'Congratulations to my friend @PeteHegseth — a combat decorated veteran — and let’s re-establish deterrence through America’s strength,' Waltz said. NewsNation reached out to Trump's team for comment on the backlash Hegseth has gotten. In response, they sent back Trump's initial statement announcing the pick, in which the President-elect says Hegseth will be a 'courageous and patriotic champion' of his 'Peace through Strength' policy. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pete-hegseth-trumps-pick-defense-secretary/	2024-11-13T12:14:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318018188628.jpg?w=900
What is Elon Musk's plan for DOGE?	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk has been tapped to lead a new advisory group on government spending in Donald Trump’s second administration, and the tech entrepreneur has been dropping breadcrumbs on what he plans to do. President-elect Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, would lead his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an initiative meant to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? There is still little known about DOGE, but in a statement shared by Trump, Musk said it will 'send shockwaves through the system and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!' What is DOGE or Department of Government Efficiency? The Department of Government Efficiency is a new initiative put forth by Trump once he takes office in January. Trump said that DOGE would 'provide advice and guidance from outside of government' and partner with the White House Office of Budget and Management (OMB) to drive large-scale structural reform. 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of 'DOGE' for a very long time,' the president-elect added. The Manhattan Project was a secret World War II government program to develop and deploy the world’s first atomic weapons. The idea appeared to have come from Musk, who discussed the need for a 'government efficiency commission' while campaigning alongside Trump. The president-elect said DOGE’s work will 'conclude' no later than July 4, 2026, in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. What are Elon Musk’s plans for DOGE? Musk has provided some tidbits on what could be in store for DOGE since Trump’s announcement on the agency. 'Incentives matter. There should be rewards for wise spending, but those who waste taxpayer funds cannot be allowed to keep doing so without consequences,' Musk posted on X of DOGE on Wednesday, hinting that cuts will be imminent under his guidance. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security He also said the department would provide 'maximum transparency' and that all of DOGE’s actions will be posted online. 'Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!' Musk posted. Musk also said that DOGE would create a 'leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending' of tax dollars, which he said would be 'extremely tragic and extremely entertaining.' While Trump has given DOGE less than 18 months to complete its work, Musk said Wednesday that it 'will be done much faster.' One item that might be on Musk’s chopping block is the defense budget, which the billionaire called 'pretty gigantic' in a video posted on the X account of a PAC founded by Musk that he reshared on Tuesday. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks during an interview. (Czarek Sokolowski, Associated Press) 'It's a trillion dollars. The interest we owe on the debt is now higher than the defense budget. This is not sustainable. That's why we need the Department of Government Efficiency,' he said in the video. Musk had floated the idea of a government efficiency department before Trump’s win while on the campaign trail, telling voters it was time to 'drain the swamp.' During an October Trump rally in Pennsylvania, Musk said, 'We're going to bankrupt the country' without lowering government spending, adding that it would take 'some pretty big moves.' What Trump’s administration could mean for education Musk also spoke at the controversial Madison Square Garden rally in New York leading up to the election and told crowds there that he wants to cut at least $2 trillion in federal spending. 'All government spending is taxation ... your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that,' Musk said What is Vivek Ramaswamy's role in DOGE? Pharmaceutical entrepreneur Ramaswamy, who was one of Trump's most vocal supporters, was tasked to run DOGE alongside Musk. 'DOGE is ready to help the U.S. government conform to the U.S. Constitution once again. @elonmusk and I are ready to serve,' he posted. He added, 'We will not go gently @elonmusk.' Vivek Ramaswamy speaking during the second day of the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) During his own unsuccessful bid for the presidential nomination, Ramaswamy campaigned on eliminating federal agencies, including the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Education Department; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the Food and Nutrition Service within the Agriculture Department. What to know about Trump’s inauguration On Wednesday, he posted on X that 'DOGE will soon begin crowdsourcing examples of government waste, fraud, &amp; and abuse. Americans voted for drastic government reform &amp; they deserve to be part of fixing it,' on X. Is there a connection between DOGE and Dogecoin? Cryptocurrency dogecoin has been surging in value since Trump named Musk as one of the heads of DOGE, as the acronym plays on the same word usage as the memecoin and is also the ticker symbol under which dogecoin trades. The close word association has generated increased excitement around the cryptocurrency, which Musk has promoted in the past. Dogecoin was trading at $0.4006 on Wednesday, an increase of more than 15% in the past 24 hours and 121% over the last week, reported Quartz. The cryptocurrency became associated with Musk after he played a character on 'Saturday Night Live' who went by the nickname the 'Dogefather.' He has also called it his favorite cryptocurrency. In 2022, Musk became more closely associated with dogecoin after he suggested Twitter should perhaps accept it as payment for subscriptions. He continued promoting dogecoin on various platforms, leading to its inclusion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, the outlet reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musks-trump-doge-ramaswamy/	2024-11-13T11:24:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2176138679.jpg?w=900
What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation’s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C today following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. Shellenberger will join Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5p/4C to recap today’s hearing. Find out how to watch at JoinNN.com. (NewsNation) — The four witnesses who testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on unidentified anomalous phenomena, aka UFOs, all presented possible solutions as federal lawmakers search for answers about the government’s role in providing more transparency in the possible existence of UAPs. The witnesses took part in a hearing entitled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,' which is part of the committee’s ongoing efforts to provide more information about what the government knew or didn’t know about UAPs. Lue Elizondo Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, testified during the hearing that the following recommendations need to be made moving forward. Scientists hunt for signs of life beyond earth The former Pentagon official said that America’s greatness depends on three elements: a watchful Congress, a responsive executive branch and an informed public. He proposed the three principal actions: Congress and the president should create a single point of contact responsible for a whole-of-government approach to the UAP issue. He said that the White House, CIA, NASA, the Pentagon, the U.S. Department of Energy and others currently play a role, but no one seems to be in charge. This, he said, has led to unchecked power and corruption. A national UAP strategy needs to be developed to promote transparency and help restore the American public’s trust at a time when trust is at an all-time low, he said. He said the strategy should include a whole-of-government approach, including the academic and scientific communities, the private sector and international partners and allies. Congress should create a protected environment so that whistleblowers, who he said are desperate to do the right thing, can come forward without fear. Elizondo said that whistleblowers suffer because of stigma, a code of silence and concerns over forms of retaliation. He said policies and procedures should ensure protection for whistleblowers. For those who refuse to cooperate, lawmakers should wield subpoena power against hostile witnesses and prevent additional funding to those UAP efforts that remain hidden from congressional oversight. Timothy Gallaudet The retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and former acting undersecretary and assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere testified in the hearing that he wants Congress to take the following action: Establish proper oversight of the executive branch’s management of UAP programs, information and materials Pass provisions of the UAP Disclosure Act involving the UAP Records Review Board into law After the UAP Disclosure Act is passed, Congress should consider strengthening it in a future reauthorization with additional provisions to establish a whole-of-government approach to UAP. Michael Shellenberger The independent journalist, who has written extensively about 'Immaculate Constellation,' testified during Wednesday's hearing that members of Congress have expressed growing frustration since 2021 over the military and intelligence community’s refusal to reveal 'concrete' information. The ‘tic tac’ incident: Inside one of the most consequential UFO encounters of all time Congressional leaders are seeking to expand upon the UAP transparency legislation that was passed in 2023. The UAP Disclosure Act would force the military, intelligence community and any private entity to turn over recovered 'technologies of unknown origin' and associated 'biological materials' and provide all UAP records to an independent review board for potential public disclosure, he said. The legislation would also expand protections for whistleblowers and require the Government Accountability Office to review the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office's work. He added that while it is clear UAPs remain mysterious, it’s clear that the U.S. government is not being straight with the American people. He also called on Congress to work with President-elect Donald Trump to make government more transparent and release long-held secrets on everything from COVID origins to files associated with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and UAPs. Michael Gold The former NASA official testified that his former organization could assist in the process of providing more information about UAPs by doing the following: Review archival data Combat the stigmatization of UAP Reach out to international partners Solicit, archive, review and release civil and commercial UAP data 'In much as the same way that AARO is responsible for collecting UAP data for the national security community, NASA could serve a similar role for civilian and commercial operators,' Gold testified Wednesday. 'Of course, a dramatic difference would be the data collected by NASA would be open to all, and the agency would continue its historic dedication to transparency and sharing scientific discoveries with the nation and world.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/uap-witnesses-congressional-action/	2024-11-13T10:52:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/snapshot-2024-01-09T183232.833.jpg?w=900
Jack Smith expected to resign ahead of Trump inauguration	(The Hill) -- Special counsel Jack Smith plans to wrap up his work and resign from his post before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump has boasted that he plans to fire Smith 'within two seconds' of taking office and has also made other threatening remarks about the special counsel, including that he should be arrested. The New York Times first reported the development. Smith on Friday asked for a suspension of deadlines in Trump’s election interference case, noting both the unprecedented nature of a president entering office while facing charges as well as a Justice Department (DOJ) memo barring the prosecution of a sitting president. As Smith winds down Trump cases, GOP eyes its own probes The government needs 'time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy,' the department wrote. DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) advises against the criminal prosecution of a sitting president, concluding in 1973 that 'criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.' Smith’s office declined to comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/jack-smith-expected-to-resign-ahead-of-trump-inauguration/	2024-11-13T05:49:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23213812288789-e1731505415939.jpg?w=800
Senate GOP set to vote on Mitch McConnell's replacement	(NewsNation) — Senate Republicans will elect a new leader to replace Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, stepping aside after 17 years at the top of the Senate GOP. Three candidates are vying to replace McConnell: South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Florida Sen. Rick Scott. The race will largely come down to who will do the most to achieve President-elect Donald Trump's agenda. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Trump is expected to meet with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill on Wednesday before meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. It's unclear if the incoming president has a favorite for Senate majority leader. While Thune — currently the No. 2 Republican in the Senate — would appear to be the favorite in the race, staunch Trump ally Scott seems to be the front-runner. Scott — the most aggressively reform-minded candidate — has received endorsements from several MAGA figures, including Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson and Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donalds. Utah Sen. Mike Lee endorsed Scott on Tuesday, saying he believes Scott is the most closely aligned with Trump’s priorities. Scott has said he'd push the Trump agenda through Congress, including plans to allow the president-elect to make recess appointments to his cabinet. That would allow Trump to add members to his administration without Senate confirmation. The secret ballot vote is expected at 9:30 a.m. ET. This story is developing.

Trump to meet with Biden at White House	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump heads to the White House on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden for a high-profile transition of power meeting. Biden will welcome Trump to the Oval Office at 11 a.m., a traditional part of the peaceful handoff of power and a ritual that Trump himself declined to participate in four years ago. Trump skipped Biden's inauguration in January of 2021 and Biden recently called Trump's supporters 'garbage,' which could set the stage for an awkward interaction. Bill O'Reilly: Admin picks will be Trump's 'eyes and ears,' not leaders The president-elect also planned to meet with Republicans from Congress as they focus on his Day 1 priorities and prepare for a unified government. His arrival amid GOP congressional leadership elections could put his imprint on the outcome. Ahead of the visit, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans are 'ready to deliver' on Trump’s 'America First' agenda. Planning for a peaceful transfer of power Biden has insisted that he’ll do everything he can to make the transition to the next Trump administration go smoothly. That’s despite having spent more than a year campaigning for reelection and decrying Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation’s core values. Biden then bowed out of the race in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him. Wednesday’s visit is more than just a courtesy call. 'They will go through the top issues — both domestic and foreign policy issues — including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East,' Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS of Wednesday’s meeting. 'And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things … and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes office.' Biden called to congratulate Trump on his victory last week and expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition, emphasizing the importance of working to bring the country together, according to the White House. DNC staffers resign with Kamala Harris campaign $20M in debt Trump's new administration Trump has been busy over the past week, announcing his picks for his next administration one after the other. He has turned to loyalists and government outsiders to shape his cabinet. Most recently, Trump tapped tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an initiative meant to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. He said they'll advise the White House and work with other offices to drive large-scale reforms. Trump also nominated Fox News weekend anchor Pete Hegseth to serve as the nation's secretary of defense. Hegseth, 44, an army veteran and author, would be the second-youngest head of the Department of Defense if he's confirmed by the Senate. Others who have been nominated for Trump's administration include Susie Wiles for White House chief of staff, Stephen Miller for deputy chief of policy, Tom Homan as the new 'border czar,' New York Rep. Elise Stefanik for U.N. ambassador, Lee Zeldin for EPA administrator, Florida Rep. Mike Walz for national security adviser, Florida Rep. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and South Dakota Gov.

How will new Trump administration staff picks reshape the US?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has started rapidly filling his administration, with familiar names including Susie Wiles, Tom Homan, Marco Rubio and many more potentially snagging top spots come January 2025. The plethora of Republicans joining Trump's team will serve to diversify his policies, former White House chief of staff under Trump and NewsNation contributor Mick Mulvaney told 'The Hill on NewsNation.' 'It sort of brings some balance. What have we said before? Donald Trump likes to have differing opinions. He likes loyalty,' Mulvaney said. 'But that's not the same as saying you can't have your own opinions.' Mulvaney noted that some choices — like tapped CIA Director John Ratcliffe and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz — are more 'hawkish' than Trump when it comes to policy, while others back him wholeheartedly. A diversified Cabinet could also lead to conflicting opinions about some of the United States' most important policies, despite loyalty to Trump. Bill O'Reilly: Admin will be his 'eyes and ears,' not leaders President-elect Donald Trump’s administration nominations are carefully selected to serve his centralized idea of a second term, Bill O’Reilly tells 'CUOMO.' O’Reilly adds that 'those who burned him are not going to reappear' in the White House, and true power will be among Trump’s top advisers rather than department heads. Some with true power include Wiles and Rubio, who O'Reilly says will help the 47th president make most of his political moves this term. Meanwhile, people like nominated Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, will simply monitor people Trump finds suspicious. 'It's a top-down on Trump. Trump is going to run everything, and he wants eyes and ears in all of these areas reporting back to him,' O'Reilly said. 'That's how this country is going to be run.' Elon Musk, Ramaswamy land Trump admin roles Panel says Trump Cabinet will shift foreign policy Other experts, including Michael Allen, the former national security council senior director, and Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, discussed the president-elect's choices on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' Here's what they're saying about Trump's picks, and how it will impact America's place overseas: Middle East 'I think in the Middle East, you're going to see Netanyahu with a longer leash. I think you're going to see an Iran that ought to be more worried about enforced sanctions, particularly in their oil sector,' Allen said. Rubio, who was tapped by Trump as secretary of state, has talked extensively about America's relationship with Iran and called for harsher action to be taken. 'What everyone has looked for and has not seen for several years is peace through strength rather than accommodation,' Volker said.

Elon Musk, Ramaswamy land Trump admin roles	President-elect Trump has tapped tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead an advisory group focused on cutting federal spending and reducing the size of the government Trump announced Tuesday that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead his 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), an initiative meant to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Trump said that DOGE would 'provide advice and guidance from outside of government' and partner with the White House Office of Budget and Management (OMB). Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of 'DOGE' for a very long time,' the President-elect added. It was not immediately clear whether DOGE would be an official part of the Trump administration or advise the White House from outside the government. 'To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &amp; Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.' In a statement shared by Trump, Musk said DOGE will 'send shockwaves through the system and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!' Tulsi Gabbard: ‘I’d be honored to serve’ in Trump’s cabinet The announcement of DOGE and Musk’s role in it comes after months of floating the idea and Trump’s rising alliance with the tech entrepreneur. Ramaswamy briefly ran in the Republican presidential primary before suspending his bid at the beginning of this year and backing Trump. 'I look forward to Elon and Vivek making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency and, at the same time, making life better for all Americans. Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5 Trillion Dollars of Government Spending. They will work together to liberate our Economy, and make the U.S. Government accountable to 'WE THE PEOPLE,' Trump wrote. The President-elect said DOGE’s work will 'conclude' no later than July 4, 2026 in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-ramaswamy-trump-doge/	2024-11-12T17:19:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24279824699291-e1731459405275.jpg?w=900
Trump to nominate Kristi Noem to lead Homeland Security	President-elect Trump on Wednesday announced he has selected South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). A source familiar confirmed the news earlier Tuesday to The Hill. Trump made it official in an announcement later that day. 'Kristi has been very strong on Border Security,' Trump said in a statement. 'She will work closely with 'Border Czar' Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Noem was previously floated as a possible running mate for Trump, but her consideration fizzled after the release of her autobiography, in which she described having killed a dog that was 'untrainable.' Instead, the Republican governor is tapped to lead the sprawling agency tasked with protecting the U.S from terror threats, securing the borders and enforcing U.S. immigration law. Trump has also tasked DHS with carrying out the 'largest deportation operation in American history.' The pick of Noem is the latest sign of Trump's intention to take a hard line on immigration policy, with an agenda he has said will represent the largest deportation in U.S. history. If confirmed, Noem would work closely with Stephen Miller, whom Trump tapped to serve as his deputy chief of staff for policy. Miller was instrumental in shaping many of Trump's toughest immigration policies in his first term. Trump also selected Tom Homan as his 'border czar,' welcoming back an early proponent of child separation under the first Trump administration who, in discussing the forthcoming Trump administration's immigration plans, recently said 'families can be deported together.' Tulsi Gabbard: ‘I’d be honored to serve’ in Trump’s cabinet Noem has little national security experience, but she did send the South Dakota National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border and has been vocal on immigration issues. 'South Dakota won't be taking any illegal immigrants that the Biden Administration wants to relocate. My message to illegal immigrants... call me when you're an American,' Noem wrote on social platform X in 2021, shortly after President Biden took office. She also supported Trump’s Muslim travel ban while serving as a member of Congress and also supported pausing some refugee screening. 'I share the President's concerns about our ability to screen refugees—especially those from terrorist hotbed areas,' Noem said in 2017. 'I support putting a temporary pause on accepting refugees from terrorist-held areas—at least until the administration can certify that asylum-seekers do not present a safety threat to the U.S.' Noem was also previously floated as a possible Interior secretary. Kamala Harris campaign now millions in debt 'I love being Governor of South Dakota, and President Trump knows that I’ll help him however I can,' Noem said at the time. Noem was a regular with Trump on the campaign trail, including at one event that turned into a music listening session after multiple medical emergencies among attendees. DHS contains a number of key public safety agencies. Beyond its immigration duties, it also contains the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It also contains the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is tasked with helping companies prevent cyberattacks as well as attacks on physical infrastructure. The Hill has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Brett Samuels contributed.

Trump taps Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary	President-elect Trump on Tuesday announced he was choosing Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and a Fox News host, to serve as Defense secretary. Hegseth served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and did tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, earning two Bronze Stars. He is currently a co-host for 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.' 'Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The president-elect also used his statement to promote Hegseth's new book, as well as his work with veterans advocacy groups. 'Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our 'Peace through Strength' policy,' Trump added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-taps-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-for-defense-secretary/	2024-11-12T16:30:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/hegseth_pete042921.jpg?w=900
Speculation swirls over Rubio's Senate successor	The impending vacancy in the Senate following President-elect Trump’s planned nomination of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R) for secretary of State is already sparking speculation about who will be his successor. If Trump goes forward with nominating Rubio as the U.S.’s top envoy, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) would be tasked with appointing a replacement for him in the upper chamber. There will then be a special election for the seat in 2026. A number of names have already been floated, including DeSantis’s chief of staff, the state’s lieutenant governor, the state’s attorney general and even Florida first lady Casey DeSantis. The move to replace Rubio could have a chain reaction in the state’s political circles as Republicans, including DeSantis, keep their own political futures in mind. 'Honestly, I just don’t see how a succession plan does not involve a DeSantis, particularly Ron DeSantis,' said one Republican strategist. On Tuesday, Capitol Hill was abuzz with a number of different names. Alabama Sen. Katie Britt (R) floated Trump’s daughter in-law and Republican National Committee co-Chair Lara Trump to fill the role. A source familiar with the matter told The Hill that DeSantis’s top aide, James Uthmeier, is favored for the position. Other candidates include Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and state Attorney General Ashley Moody. The source added that President-elect Trump may push for his daughter-in-law for the position. One of the big questions surrounds DeSantis and what he plans to do next after his term as governor ends in 2026. While he did not clinch the Republican presidential nomination this cycle, the 46-year-old governor is still seen as a rising star within the GOP. A second presidential run is not out of the question, and the Republican strategist argued that they could see the Senate as a launching pad for DeSantis. 'You’ve got to have a perch,' the strategist said. 'Remember, people forget about you real quick.' 'What, are you going to walk out of the governor’s mansion and start running for president?' the strategist added. 'How are you going to get oxygen? Because the day after the midterms, what happens? Everyone starts running for president.' Sources who spoke to The Hill think the governor will name his own chief of staff to be a placeholder for him before 2026. If DeSantis were to appoint Uthmeier, DeSantis would have a strong loyalist in the seat until 2026, when a special election would take place. DeSantis could then theoretically run for a full term that year. There could also be a scenario where DeSantis appoints himself to the Senate seat. In order to do so, he would have to resign as governor and appoint Nunez to the governor’s mansion. Nine former governors have taken this route, including former Minnesota Gov. Wendell Anderson (D), who replaced former Vice President Walter Mondale in the upper chamber after he was elected in 1976. It could be a risky move if DeSantis follows that route. Out of the nine governors who have essentially appointed themselves to the Senate, only one won a later election. Others argue that DeSantis does not need to be in the Senate in order to launch a 2028 presidential bid, noting that the next presidential campaign will kick off right after the 2026 midterms. DeSantis launched his presidential bid in May of 2023, while former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley launched her bid in February 2023. Additionally, DeSantis would likely want to emphasize his executive role as governor of Florida. But with Trump only being able to serve one more term, it’s unclear what a 2028 Republican primary would look like with Vice President-elect JD Vance as the heir apparent. 'JD Vance may honestly be the first Republican vice president since George H. W. Bush who may actually have a credible chance at the way things are going,' the Republican strategist said. Other Republicans throw cold water on the notion that a potential Vance presidential bid would hinder other figures, like DeSantis, from launching their own bids in 2028. The speculation comes as Florida has played a central role in the second Trump transition after significant gains for the GOP in 2022 and 2024. In addition to Rubio appearing on track to be nominated for secretary of State, Trump also nominated Florida Rep. Mike Waltz (R) to serve as his national security adviser. Additionally, Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach has served as the center of the transition, with veteran Florida political operative and incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles at the reins. Meanwhile, Rubio’s colleague Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is launching his own bid for Senate majority leader, receiving support from a number of Trump allies, including Elon Musk. 'The only thing we don’t have is a House Speaker from Florida,' the GOP strategist quipped.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/speculation-swirls-over-rubios-senate-successor/	2024-11-12T15:18:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/rubiomarco_071024gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Who is Michael Gold? Ex-NASA official to testify at UAP hearing	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation's YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C Wednesday following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA admin Michal Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. (NewsNation) — Former and current industry officials will discuss unidentified anomalous phenomena, aka UFOs, at a House of Representatives hearing Wednesday. Held by the House Oversight Committee, the hearing, titled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,' will begin on the 13th at 11:30 a.m. ET Sparked by whistleblower David Grusch's claims about an alleged UFO retrieval program, the hearing will feature testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. NewsNation has spoken exclusively to three of the four. Who is Michael Gold? Gold is NASA's former associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the organization's independent UAP study team. He's also worked in the private sector as an executive at the now-defunct Bigelow Aerospace, headed by Robert Bigelow. Currently, he works as chief growth officer at Redwire, an American aerospace manufacturer and serves as treasurer for the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. He was awarded NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal in 2021. UFO House Hearing: What witnesses plan to say Why is Michael Gold testifying at UAP hearing? As a member of NASA's independent UAP study team and the aerospace community's commercial sector, Gold has a stake in the UFO game. According to testimony published the day before the hearing, Gold is expected to urge cooperation between NASA and those investigating UAPs in order to 'combat the stigmatization' of the research. What could Michael Gold say Wednesday? Gold's testimony is expected to focus on NASA's ability to aid in UAP research. 'I believe NASA would be effective in collecting and disseminating data on UAP due toits successful track record of collating information on aviation safety issues,' his testimony reads in part. He'll outline multiple ways NASA can help: Combat stigmatization of UAP Review archival data Reach out to international partners Solicit, archive, review and release civil and commercial UAP data What is Donald Trump’s position on UFOs? 'In much the same way that AARO is responsible for collecting UAP data for the nationalsecurity community, NASA could serve a similar role for civilian and commercial operators,' Gold's testimony reads. He's also expected to call for an increase in NASA funding so that the organization can 'successfully execute the Artemis program and all of its other vital scientific and exploratory activities.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/michael-gold-nasa-uap-ufo-hearing/	2024-11-12T15:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/MikeGold_crop-scaled-1-800x731-1.jpg?w=788
John Ratcliffe chosen as Trump’s pick to lead CIA	President-elect Trump announced Tuesday that he will nominate John Ratcliffe, his former head of intelligence, to lead the CIA. Ratcliffe, a former Texas representative, was critical of investigations into Trump while in Congress and later served as a member of his impeachment team during Democrats’ first effort to boot Trump from office. A statement from Trump praises Ratcliffe for 'exposing fake Russian collusion to be a Clinton campaign operation,' being a critic of a national security program that greenlights foreign surveillance, and for criticizing those who first called into question the legitimacy of a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden. 'John Ratcliffe has always been a warrior for Truth and Honesty with the American Public,' Trump said in a statement.' 'I look forward to John being the first person ever to serve in both of our Nation’s highest Intelligence positions. He will be a fearless fighter for the Constitutional Rights of all Americans, while ensuring the Highest Levels of National Security, and PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.' Ratcliffe served as one of Trump’s Directors of National Intelligence, but faced a rocky path to the position. Trump in 2019 withdrew his nomination after pushback over concerns that Ratcliffe did not have a sufficient security background or relevant experience to lead an office that coordinates all U.S. intelligence agencies. He also faced questions over whether he had embellished his experience working terrorism cases as a former prosecutor on his resume. 'Our great Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the LameStream Media,' Trump wrote at the time. Trump nominated him again just a few months later, prompting backlash from Democrats. Then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called him a 'highly partisan operative' while then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) complained he 'has shown an unacceptable embrace of conspiracy theories.' He was ultimately confirmed in a party-line 49-44 vote. Ratcliffe was a regular critic of the FBI and Justice Department before entering the intelligence community. Trump’s nod to Ratcliffe’s position on foreign surveillance, governed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), comes after the then-lawmaker was a vocal critic of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into Trump, including the FBI’s flawed process for securing a warrant to wiretap Carter Page. On Tuesday, Trump credited Ratcliffe with 'catching the FBI’s abuse of Civil Liberties at the FISA Court.'

UFO House Hearing: What witnesses plan to say	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation’s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C Wednesday following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. (NewsNation) — At a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday, lawmakers will hear from a number of witnesses about what they have seen and heard about UFOs. Held by the House Oversight Committee, the hearing, titled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,' will begin at 11:30 a.m. ET. Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, veteran and investigator; retired Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet; journalist Michael Shellenberger and Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, are scheduled to give their testimony. This hearing is the first since the summer of 2023, which was sparked by career intelligence official David Grusch's allegations that the Pentagon has been operating a secret UFO retrieval program. 'If the UFO hearings catch on with the public, we could be in for quite a ride,' Bryce Zabel, UFO author and cohost of the podcast 'Need to Know' with Ross Coulthart, told NewsNation. 'Back in 1973, all of America was riveted to the Senate Watergate hearings, and the cover-up Nixon orchestrated will seem small compared to the one that would have been necessary to hide the truth about alien contact for nearly eight decades now.' ‘We’re gonna learn some things’ about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett What will UAP witnesses say at hearing? Elizondo's book 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon’s Hunt for UFOs' alleges that the United States military has been running a UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program for years, even recovering nonhuman specimens. 'Let me be clear: UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our Government – or any other government – are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,' Elizondo will say, according to testimony published the day before the hearing. He will talk about what actions the government should be taking regarding the UAP issue. Gallaudet, in his testimony, plans to repeat a claim he's made before to NewsNation: that an email that contained what is known as the 'Go Fast' video, disappeared from his and his colleagues' email servers. 'Go Fast' shows a fighter pilot’s encounter with a UAP. Shellenberger will detail his reporting on the alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied records of the program. The 'tic tac' incident: What we know about the UFO encounter Shellenberger will highlight the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs. Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, will outline new ways for NASA to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently Chief Growth Office at Redwire Space, Gold stresses in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf, and not for any other organization. 'Agencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,' Gold's prepared testimony reads. UFO Whistleblower Sparks Conversation Much of the current conversation surrounding UFOs started when Grusch came forward last year with his claims that the government was operating a secret program dedicated to retrieving crashed UAPs and was in possession of nonhuman craft and biological remains of nonhuman beings. The Defense Department has denied these allegations. Still, they sparked the 2023 congressional hearing on the subject — the first in more than 50 years —where Grusch testified with former Navy pilot Ryan Graves and Navy Commander David Fravor. Fravor talked about his experience encountering a UAP. Both Graves and Fravor said they were concerned about the risks UAPs pose to the military, regardless of origin. Netflix faces lawsuit over ‘The Manhattan Alien Abduction’ Lawmakers asked about the secret program referenced by Grusch, and eventually, the hearing led to the formation of a bipartisan UFO Caucus, informally led by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. An official report issued by the Pentagon from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office found no evidence of a secret program. Furthermore, it said the government has no evidence that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin. However, the Department of Defense did admit to a proposed program known as Kona Blue, which was developed to reverse-engineer any alien technology recovered by the government. This never got off the ground, the DOD said, as no such technology was ever located. NASA, in a report of its own, said there's no evidence for extraterrestrial contact with Earth, though the agency said there needs to be more rigorous research in the area and less stigma around the topic as a whole.

What is Donald Trump's position on UFOs?	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A at 4p/3c this Wednesday following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. NewsNation has talked exclusively with three of the four witnesses. (NewsNation) — Lawmakers are holding a new public hearing on UFOs on the heels of the election of President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he supports UFO disclosure. Trump has said he supports transparency on the subject of UFOs but has not necessarily expressed deep interest in the subject. Wednesday's hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers has pushed for answers in the wake of whistleblower allegations the Pentagon is operating a secret UFO retrieval program. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs UFO whistleblower allegations Former Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch came forward last year with allegations about such a program and suggested the government may even have the remains of nonhuman entities. Following Grusch's revelations, others have come forward with similar allegations, including former Pentagon employee Lue Elizondo and former Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet. Recently, independent journalist Michael Shellenberger revealed another whistleblower report, which he claims documents a program called 'Immaculate Constellation' that collected intelligence information on UAPs. It is the first time any whistleblower has ever given a specific name to a program. Pentagon denies secret UAP programs The Pentagon has responded with denials of any programs and said there is no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. A report from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UAP reports for the Defense Department, said most UAP sightings were misidentifications of drones, natural phenomena or classified technology. Close encounters: America’s UFO fascination The agency did admit to plans for the Kona Blue program, which would have reverse-engineered UAP technology. However, the program was never put into practice because no such technology has ever been recovered. NASA also issued a report saying there was no evidence so far to support extraterrestrial involvement, though the agency also called for the destigmatization of the subject and stronger data collection on UAPs. Presidential interest in UFOs Presidential interest in UFOs is not a new concept. In 1948, following a wave of sightings, including the famous 1947 Roswell incident, President Harry Truman pushed for more investigation into UFO sightings, though his concern was likely as motivated by the arms race of the Cold War as interest in alien contact. At least one president has had an even closer encounter with unexplained objects. President Jimmy Carter observed something unidentifiable in the sky one night in 1969. Carter documented the incident just before he ran for president. Most dismissed the sightings, and Carter himself did not necessarily believe the object was alien. In 2016, a researcher explained the sighting as a barium cloud from a high-altitude rocket. Did the government confirm aliens exist? President Ronald Reagan also had an unexplained encounter with an object spotted trailing his plane in 1974. He would go on to ask the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, if the country would support the U.S. in the event of an attack from outer space. Will Trump bring transparency on UAPs? Of course, a president can only be transparent if they are aware of what is going on. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all admitted to being briefed on the subject of UFOs. Clinton and Obama had specifically expressed interest in the topic and requested information on alleged recovered UFOs or aliens that some insist the government possesses. Later, they would say there was no evidence to support the decadeslong rumors. 'Multiple presidents have promised over many, many decades to get to the bottom of the UAP mystery, and all of them have failed miserably,' said NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. The ‘tic tac’ incident: Inside one of the most consequential UFO encounters of all time There is a chance those presidents were withholding information because of national security concerns. However, some have suggested the presidents themselves were lied to by officials intent on maintaining the secrecy of any information or technology the U.S. has on UAPs. In one conversation with his son, Donald Trump Jr., Trump suggested that he did have knowledge about UFOs supposedly recovered from Roswell in 1947 but declined to share what he knew. It's possible Trump would not be given full information on UFOs, particularly given his history in handling classified information and fears he would breach national security. 'We should take what former President Donald Trump is saying with a grain of salt,' Coulthart said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/trump-position-ufos/	2024-11-12T14:14:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24303574162285.jpg?w=900
Conservatives plot challenge against Johnson in internal Speaker ...	Hard-line conservatives are plotting to challenge Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) for the gavel during Wednesday’s internal House GOP elections, four sources familiar with the matter told The Hill. The sources — who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations — said the conservatives are planning to nominate an alternative candidate to Johnson for Speaker during Wednesday’s internal GOP elections. The sources said they are still discussing whom to nominate, and one source cautioned that the opposition could fall apart. 'There will be a nomination,' one of the sources said. The intent is to show opposition within the House GOP to Johnson’s bid to continue as Speaker, one of the sources said. The House GOP is set to consider Johnson for Speaker during internal GOP elections on Wednesday. Johnson has been bullish on his chances of retaining the gavel, especially with President-elect Trump — who has spoken highly of him in the past — on his way to the White House. On Tuesday, Johnson said he is confident that he will win the gavel on the first ballot in January. 'I am [confident]. I’m talking with everyone,' he said. 'I think you’ll have total unity in the party.' Johnson must only win a majority vote in the internal elections. On the floor, when Democrats would be expected to vote for their own Speaker, he would have less leeway and would only be able to afford a few defections. Decision Desk HQ projected Monday night that the House GOP would retain its majority. Its margin is expected to be very narrow, with Johnson perhaps only able to afford a handful, assuming Democrats are united. The Speaker does face some resistance in his conference. During an interview on Fox News over the weekend, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said there are 'a lot of Republicans' who are concerned with Johnson’s leadership effort. 'Mike Johnson is going to have to demonstrate that he can corral this Republican conference to deliver for the American people and deliver for President Trump. That needs to happen over the next several weeks,' Roy said. 'And I’m gonna be sitting down with Mike this week, sitting down with other members of the conference, but we have no choice but to deliver.' 'We’ve got to deliver, no more excuses. That’s what I want to hear out of the Speaker. But he’s got a lot of Republicans who are still concerned,' he added. 'We’ve got to figure out how to get everybody on the same page.' Johnson faced an ouster threat in May — led by Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) — which failed overwhelmingly after Democrats and Republicans joined forces to kill the effort. A total of 11 GOP lawmakers, however, voted against tabling the measure, a sign of some resistance to the Speaker’s leadership. Those talking about backing an alternative to Johnson likened the situation to what occurred in November 2022, when Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) challenged then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the Speakership nomination. That effort failed but highlighted opposition to McCarthy’s leadership, and foreshadowed his later struggles to officially secure the gavel and his eventual ouster. The final vote was 188-31, and McCarthy went on to face opposition on the House floor in January, which forced the Speaker race to run for 15 rounds over several days.

What is the Pentagon's alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' program...	Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&amp;A on NewsNation’s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C today following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet. Shellenberger will join Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5p/4C to recap today’s hearing. Find out how to watch at JoinNN.com. (NewsNation) — Independent journalist Michael Shellenberger told NewsNation a whistleblower has revealed the existence of an alleged Pentagon UFO program called 'Immaculate Constellation.' Shellenberger told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart about the whistleblower report, which comes on the heels of similar allegations from former Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch and former Pentagon employee Lue Elizondo. Here's what we know about the program so far. What is 'Immaculate Constellation'? According to the whistleblower, the Pentagon program collects and quarantines information on UFO (also commonly known today as 'UAPs,' or 'unidentified anomalous phenomena') sightings and encounters. The program allegedly includes information from different types of intelligence, including high-quality image intelligence and measure and signature intelligence. What is Donald Trump’s position on UFOs? Who is the whistleblower? Shellenberger did not reveal the whistleblower's precise role or whether they were employed as a Defense Department employee or as a contractor. He did tell NewsNation that he met with the whistleblower and verified their credentials and also independently confirmed the existence of the program with unrelated sources. How was the program discovered? According to Shellenberger, the whistleblower discovered the program by accident after stumbling upon a database containing UFO information. What kind of UAP incidents were described in the report? In one encounter reportedly detailed by the whistleblower, a group of orbs surrounded an F-22 and forced it out of its designated patrol area.

Has the Pentagon responded to the allegations? Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough denied records of the alleged program in a statement to NewsNation Tuesday evening. 'The Department of Defense has no record, present or historical, of any type of SAP called ‘IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION,'' she wrote. Has the Pentagon acknowledged any UAP programs? The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is a publicly-known Pentagon program that collects and investigates reports of UAPs. In a report, AARO denied any evidence that UAPs are alien in nature. The report did acknowledge the existence of the Kona Blue program, which was intended to reverse-engineer any recovered UAP technology. The report said the program never went into effect because no such technology was ever recovered. What's next for UAP disclosure? A bipartisan group of lawmakers has already pushed for more disclosures around UAPs. While nothing specific has been announced in relation to this report, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has announced plans for a UAP hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee following the election, and Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., announced plans for a UAP hearing in the House set for Nov. 13.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/what-is-immaculate-constellation/	2024-11-12T13:40:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/02/AP21154653187711-e1709218226777.jpg?w=800
Trump picks Mike Huckabee as US ambassador to Israel	President-elect Trump announced Tuesday he will nominate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) to serve as ambassador to Israel, a major diplomatic role that will take on added importance amid heightened tensions in the Middle East. 'Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years,' Trump said in a statement. 'He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!' For over a year, Israel has carried out war against Hamas following the terrorist group's attacks in October 2023 that killed more than 1,000 Israeli citizens. Trump has urged Israel to 'finish the problem,' even as he has been critical of how it has carried out its military campaign. Tensions have also been on the rise between Israel and Hezbollah, the militant group with a major presence in Lebanon. Huckabee served as governor of Arkansas from 1996-2007, winning two full terms after taking over for then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (R), who resigned. He ran unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2016. Huckabee has sometimes weighed in on the current war in Gaza, telling NewsNation in June that he did not see a reason to support an Israel-Hamas cease-fire, maintaining that the terrorist group should not be negotiated with and that the only way to end the war was their complete surrender. The former governor has not held a diplomatic post previously. His nomination, which will require confirmation by the Senate, comes as Trump will face pressure to quell tensions in the Middle East. He was reportedly offered the role of ambassador to Israel during Trump's first term in office, though he denied those reports. He did not serve in the first Trump administration, though his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, did a stint as Trump's White House press secretary. Trump's ambassador to Israel during his first term was David Friedman, who worked on brokering the Abraham Accords to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-picks-mike-huckabee-as-us-ambassador-to-israel/	2024-11-12T11:12:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1175377257-2-e1721419621962.jpg?w=900
Judge delays ruling on whether to scrap Trump's conviction in hus...	NEW YORK (AP) — A judge postponed a decision on whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case, after his lawyers called for freezing and ultimately dismissing the case so he can run the country. New York Judge Juan M. Merchan had been set to rule Tuesday on their earlier request to throw out his conviction because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling this summer on presidential immunity. Instead, he told Trump's lawyers Tuesday he'd delay the ruling until Nov. 19. According to emails filed in court, Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked for the delay over the weekend, arguing that putting the case on hold — and then ending it altogether — is 'necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.' Prosecutors agreed to the delay. Trump won back the White House a week ago but the legal question concerns the Republican's status as a past president, not an impending one. A jury convicted Trump in May of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016. The payout was to buy her silence about claims that she had sex with Trump. He says they didn’t, denies any wrongdoing and maintains the prosecution was a political tactic meant to harm his latest campaign. Just over a month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can’t be prosecuted for actions they took in the course of running the country, and prosecutors can’t cite those actions even to bolster a case centered on purely personal conduct. Trump’s lawyers cited the ruling to argue that the hush money jury got some evidence it shouldn't have, such as Trump’s presidential financial disclosure form and testimony from some White House aides. Prosecutors disagreed and said the evidence in question was only 'a sliver' of their case. Trump's criminal conviction was a first for any ex-president. It left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal attorney for the Daniels payment. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it through a series of payments that Trump’s company logged as legal expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks himself. Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first campaign. Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and that Daniels’ story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump’s family, not to influence the electorate. Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office. Trump has been fighting for months to overturn the verdict and could now seek to leverage his status as president-elect. Although he was tried as a private citizen, his forthcoming return to the White House could propel a court to step in and avoid the unprecedented spectacle of sentencing a former and future president. While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also has been trying to move the case to federal court. Before the election, a federal judge repeatedly said no to the move, but Trump has appealed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/ap-judge-set-to-rule-on-whether-to-scrap-trumps-conviction-in-hush-money-case/	2024-11-12T07:09:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673370293fadb2.00180565.jpeg?w=900
Trump administration picks may limit House majority	(NewsNation) — The GOP has resumed control over the House, which added to the list of political wins for Republicans. However, that could change depending on the president-elect's administration picks. Almost a full week after Election Day, NewsNation's partners at Decision Desk HQ made a pair of critical calls in House races, officially declaring Republican Gabe Evans the winner in Colorado’s 8th District. Just hours later, the race for Arizona's 6th District was called in favor of incumbent Rep. Juan Ciscomani. Those two race wins for Republicans were enough for the party to claim the House majority and complete control of the federal government — at least for now. 2024 Election results Trump's cabinet could impact majority As it stands right now, at least three of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet picks impact the GOP majority in the Senate and in the House. Trump's choices of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as secretary of state, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as UN ambassador and Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for national security advisor will leave immediate openings on Capitol Hill for Republicans. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would appoint a replacement for Rubio until a special election can be held during the 2026 midterms. However, voters will elect replacements for Stefanik and Waltz. Americans should not expect a dramatic change in the balance of power with both lawmakers having handily won re-election. Stefanik won by nearly 25% and Waltz won by more than 30%. The timing of these appointments and when their replacements get sworn in could mean a slimmer majority in the House for Republicans, which could make it tough for the House speaker to navigate between meeting demands from moderates and hardliners. Allan Lichtman explains why he didn’t predict Donald Trump’s win Race for leadership roles in Congress Plus, there's been some rumblings about a potential challenge to House Speaker Mike Johnson. However, the race getting the most attention right now involves the next Senate majority leader. For the first time in nearly two decades, Sen. Mitch McConnell is stepping down from the role. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas; and Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., are all vying for the position. Florida Rep. Byron Donalds told NewsNation why he believes Scott is the best candidate for the role. 'He's going to work tenaciously every single day, use every piece of the rule structure here in the Senate to accomplish an agenda for the American people. That matters more than any one senator or any one member of Congress to be frank with you. Number two, look, no disrespect to the two Johns, but they've been at this for quite some time. We might need some fresh blood here in the senate to lead the senate forward,' Donalds said. Trump has not endorsed a candidate for Senate majority leader yet, but that could change.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-administration-picks-limit-house-majority/	2024-11-12T04:55:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214745-1.jpg?w=900
Trump transition 'already breaking the law': Senator Warren	(The Hill) - Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said on Monday that President elect-Trump 'and his transition team are already breaking' a law on presidential transition. 'Donald Trump and his transition team are already breaking the law,' Warren said in a post on the social platform X. 'I would know because I wrote the law. Incoming presidents are required to prevent conflicts of interest and sign an ethics agreement.' 'This is what illegal corruption looks like,' she added. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks to reporters as she arrives to the Capitol for a procedural vote regarding a judicial nomination on Wednesday, September 11, 2024. (Greg Nash/The Hill) Warren was responding to a report from CNN on Saturday that said a conflict of interest pledge included in the Presidential Transition Act was, in part, keeping multiple transition agreements from being submitted by president-elect's team to the Biden administration. The Presidential Transition Act instructs candidates from major parties to join in memorandums of understanding (MOU) with the current president as well as the General Services Administration (GSA) so staff may get their hands on relevant resources like facilities, documents, executive branch employees and national security information in the period between the election and the inauguration. Those agreements also feature an ethics plan. Last month, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), raised concerns in a letter to Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance over their campaign’s failure to go into presidential transition agreements with the federal government. Raskin warned that the hold up could have an unfavorable impact on the transfer of power in the upcoming year. 'Breaking the precedent set by every other presidential candidate since 2010, you have rejected these resources and refused to commit to a smooth transition,' Raskin wrote. 'Your actions depart from well-established norms of the federal government and demonstrate a spectacular disregard for the successful continuation of the essential institutions of American democratic government,' he added. The Hill has reached out to a spokesperson for Trump, the White House and the GSA for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-transition-already-breaking-the-law-senator-warren/	2024-11-12T04:55:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/warrenelizabeth_091124gn01_w-e1731408767919.jpg?w=900
DNC staffers resign with Kamala Harris campaign $20M in debt	(NewsNation) — Following the vice president’s Election Day loss, the Kamala Harris campaign is now $20 million in debt, per a source familiar with the campaign. Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee, tells NewsNation’s Rich McHugh the internal strife and monetary confusion at the center of the party have led some staffers to leave altogether. Li says she helped raise millions for the campaign, much of which went to digital media, polling, advertising and travel. She says she was told this was an 'eminently winnable race,' but she says it wasn't. 'We lost all the swing states. We lost in every county in America,' Li said. 'This is just astounding. This is not some like blip. This is an avalanche.' Republican former President Donald Trump won the 2024 race with 312 electoral votes. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Kamala Harris campaign’s $20 million debt A source familiar with the campaign confirmed to NewsNation that the campaign is $20 million in the hole after Nov. 5, even though the campaign took in at least $1 billion and reported $118 million in the bank as of Oct. 16. Li, on behalf of confused voters and disappointed donors, has been speaking out about the party's financial woes. 'It's been tumultuous, to say the least, but I'm so glad I did, because if we don't correctly diagnose the problem, we're never going to change,' Li said. 'If we don't make drastic changes to the party, there are a number of things, not only on the finance side, but also if we don't recognize that America is fundamentally shifting to the right, we're going to keep losing.' Party leadership in the Democratic National Committee is 'absolutely in turmoil,' Li says. 'People are stepping down,' Li said. 'And there are going to be elections.' Asked about DNC leadership, Li said: 'Almost everyone's going to be gone.' Li believes the Democratic Party needs a 'postmortem' to assess its problems rather than relying on election fraud narratives that have circulated on social media in the days since Trump’s victory. 'This wasn't a loss. This was a shellacking,' Li said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Even with all the chaos, Li says there's one person she doesn't blame: Harris. 'She was handed this,' Li said. 'She did the best she could under the circumstances. She had 107 days. I love her; maybe she's upset with me. I love her.' Harris is a good person, Li said. However, 'the way that the campaign was run and the way that the finances were handled — it left much to be desired,' Li added. 'Top donors have not gotten any sort of briefing or an apology or any sort of explanation as to where our money went,' Li said. 'We haven't gotten any sort of follow-up other than her concession speech. Does that count?' Former staffers who have called Li for help say they have not gotten paid for work done from August. Campaign debts The Harris campaign can still raise money to recoup some of these debts and pay those who still need it. According to the Federal Election Commission, some House and Senate campaigns end with outstanding debts, such as those owed to campaign vendors. Roll Call, in March 2023, reported that 18 members of the House and Senate started the year with campaign committees with at least $100,000 in unpaid bills. Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives Campaigns must report these debts, the FEC said, and when raising funds to retire them, certain rules must be followed. These rules include one stating that contributions designated for a particular election cannot exceed the campaign’s net outstanding debt. Donald Trump weighs in on Kamala Harris campaign debt Trump seized on reports about the Harris campaign being in debt on X. 'I am very surprised that the Democrats, who fought a hard and valiant fight in the 2020 Presidential Election, raising a record amount of money, didn’t have lots of $’s left over,' Trump said. Trump went on to say that the campaign is 'being squeezed by vendors and others.' 'Whatever we can do to help them during this difficult period, I would strongly recommend we, as a Party and for the sake of desperately needed UNITY, do,' Trump wrote. 'We have a lot of money left over in that our biggest asset in the campaign was 'Earned Media,' and that doesn’t cost very much.'

(NewsNation) — With 49.3% of the vote, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for Arizona’s District 6 seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in favor of Juan Ciscomani. See the results of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate races around the nation here. Incumbent Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani sought a second term after being elected in 2022 as the first naturalized American citizen from Mexico ever to be elected to Congress from Arizona. Since being elected, Ciscomani has served on the House Appropriations Committee and has focused on fiscal responsibility. He was challenged by Democrat Kirsten Engel, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Engel lost the 2022 U.S. House race to Ciscomani by less than 5,300 votes. She previously served in the Arizona state legislature before resigning in 2021 to seek election to the U.S. House. Engel is also a professor at the University of Arizona’s School of Law. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. During the lead to Tuesday’s election, Ciscomani and Engel clashed on several issues, including abortion, which was among the ballot initiatives facing voters in Arizona. Engel supports a woman’s right to make decisions about her reproductive health and said that there should be no 'artificial time limits' when it comes to ending a pregnancy. Arizona’s law bans abortion after 15 weeks. Ciscomani said that he supported the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade and agreed with former President Donald Trump that abortion should be an issue decided at the state level. He said that he rejects the idea of a federal abortion ban and that he trusts women, cherishes life and rejects 'the extremes' when it comes to abortion.

During his first term, Ciscomani focused largely on immigration and border security and supported building a border wall. Heading into Tuesday’s election, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives were up for election. Republicans control the chamber with a narrow majority of 220 seats, while the Democrats occupy 212 with three vacancies.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/juan-ciscomani-projected-to-win-arizona-congressional-district-6-race/	2024-11-11T16:15:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Thumb-Arizona-Juan-Ciscomani.jpg?w=900
Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives	(NewsNation) —The Republicans have won control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the party took 218 seats in national elections, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ called. Click on the map to see results from your state. All 435 House seats were up for reelection leaving the chamber’s balance of power up for grabs. House members are elected to two-year terms. Going into the election, the GOP had a narrow majority in the House with 220 seats over the Democrats, who held 212, and three seats being vacant prior to Tuesday’s election. In taking the House, Republicans have solidified total control of Congress and the White House, which will create a smoother path for the GOP to lay down its platform. How often does the US see a unified government? Republicans took back the House by a slim margin during the 2022 midterm elections, flipping key seats in Washington, New York and California. In 15 House races in 2022, winners came out on top by fewer than 2 percentage points over their opponents, and this year, seven of those races were rematches between incumbents and the same challengers. In California’s 13th District, Republican freshman Rep. John Duarte faced Democratic challenger Adam Gray once again, while in the state’s 22nd District, Republican Rep. David Valadao and former California Assemblyman Rudy Salas also met in a rematch. While there were hundreds of races, just a tenth were deemed 'competitive' by the Cook Political Report. Twenty-five were considered toss-ups, and 18 races were rated as either leaning Democratic or leaning Republican. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Much of the lack of competition has been attributed to redistricting that took effect this year. Five states changed their congressional district lines since the 2022 midterm elections. Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia were mandated to redraw their lines by federal courts, which found that the old lines violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. North Carolina and New York had their old maps thrown out by their state supreme courts, which allowed each state legislature to redraw the lines. Republican Rep. Barry Moore left Alabama’s 2nd District to run in the 1st District to give himself a better shot at reelection. In Louisiana, freshman Democrat Rep. Don Davis was challenged by Republican and retired Army Col. Laurie Buckhout in the 1st District, which was redrawn in hopes of giving Republicans a better chance of winning.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/house-balance-of-power-2024-republicans/	2024-11-11T16:15:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HOUSE-THUMBNAIL-1.png?w=900
Trump 'border czar' says administration will conduct workplace im...	(The Hill) – Incoming 'border czar' Tom Homan said Monday that President-elect Trump's administration will crank up workplace raids as part of its broader immigration crackdown. Speaking on 'Fox &amp; Friends,' the former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said workplace raids would address labor and sex trafficking. 'Where do we find most victims of sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking? At worksites,' Homan told Steve Doocy. Who is Trump’s new border czar Tom Homan? But advocates say that approach is unlikely to help combat trafficking. 'He’s conflating the traffickers with the people being trafficked,' said Heidi Altman, director of federal advocacy at the National Immigration Law Center. 'Tom Homan is skilled at using public safety rhetoric to justify vicious tactics that tear families apart.' Homan, an early proponent of the 'zero tolerance' policy that separated more than 4,000 children from their parents in the first Trump administration, said he will prioritize 'public safety threats and national security threats' for deportation as border czar. But Homan said foreign nationals with orders of deportation 'became a fugitive,' suggesting immigrants without criminal records but with final orders of deportation would be high on the list of deportation priorities. Homan told Doocy that the Biden administration 'has lost over 300,000 children that were smuggled in this country by criminal cartels,' a reference to a debunked campaign claim voiced both by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance regarding a report published by the Homeland Security Office of Inspector General in August. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? According to the report, 291,000 unaccompanied children had not received a notice to appear in court as of May 2024, and a further 32,000 received a notice but did not appear. Those figures related to nearly 450,000 unaccompanied children released by ICE to the Department of Health and Human Services between October 2018 and September 2023, meaning a number of them were released by the first Trump administration. 'This is not a ‘missing kids’ problem; it’s a ‘missing paperwork’ problem,' Jonathan Beier, associate director of research and evaluation for the Acacia Center for Justice’s Unaccompanied Children Program, told The Associated Press in October.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/trump-border-czar-workplace-immigration-raids/	2024-11-11T15:49:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP18080757487453.jpg?w=900

See the results of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate races across the country here. In one of a host of congressional races that could determine control of the U.S. House, Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo was looking to secure the seat against Republican challenger Gabe Evans. Caraveo entered the race seeking a second term after winning the seat in 2022 against Republican Barbara Kirkmeyer.

Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Evans received endorsements from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson given his chance to flip a seat for the Republicans. The race was pegged by the Cook Political Report as the lone toss-up in Colorado’s congressional representation. District 8, which is the state’s newest drawn district, covers a large swath of north Central Colorado and is heavily Hispanic.

Donald Trump's new administration: Who has he chosen so far?	(NewsNation) — Republican President-elect Donald Trump has made several announcements in the last 24 hours about the members of his new administration. On Sunday, Trump posted that former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan would be joining as the 'border czar,' and the next day, he said his former adviser, Stephen Miller, would be deputy chief of policy. Trump is set to meet Wednesday with President Joe Biden at the White House to discuss the transition of power.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Sen. JD Vance was chosen to be Trump’s running mate in July, with Trump announcing him as the Republican National Convention kicked off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Republican from Ohio gained national prominence through his bestselling memoir, 'Hillbilly Elegy.' During his time in the Senate, Vance, who was once one of Trump's biggest critics, later became one of the fiercest defenders of Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' agenda, especially when it comes to foreign policy, trade and immigration. In 2021, he secured Trump’s endorsement during the Senate primary to fill the vacancy left by retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Vance then won the general Senate race against Democratic candidate Tim Ryan and took office in January 2023.

Wiles will be the first woman to be a White House chief of staff. Since her start as a scheduler for Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign, she's also worked for Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. She is the daughter of the late NFL player turned broadcaster Pat Summerall.

'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.'

A senior adviser in Trump's first term who crafted many of the president-elect's speeches, The Associated Press reports Miller's been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, including the move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018. After Trump left office, Miller became president of America First Legal, which the AP says was fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union that challenged the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others.

At the Republican National Convention, he said that he had a message to the 'millions' of undocumented migrants in the country: 'You better start packing now.' As acting director of ICE from January 2017 through June 2018, Homan backed Trump's zero tolerance policy at the border in his first term, which resulted in thousands of families being separated at the southern border. He's previously said that workplace raids would resume in the Trump administration. Before joining ICE, Homan was a police officer in West Carthage, New York, and later had positions as a Border Patrol agent, investigator and supervisor. Former Democratic President Barack Obama appointed Homan to be the executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013. Homan retired as acting ICE director in 2018 and joined the Heritage Foundation, where he contributed to its Project 2025.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Trump's pick for ambassador to the United Nations, was elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 30 in 2014, making her the youngest woman elected to Congress in United States history at the time. She currently serves as chair of the House Republican Conference, a position she was chosen for when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Trump said in a statement. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.' Stefanik said she had a conversation with Trump where she told him 'how deeply humbled' she was to accept the nomination. 'I stand ready to advance President Donald J. Trump’s restoration of America First peace through strength leadership on the world stage on Day One at the United Nations,' Stefanik said on X Monday.

From 2015 to 2023, he served New York’s 1st Congressional District as a U.S. representative, and he ran for governor of the state in 2022, losing to current Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. Zeldin was on active duty in the United States Army for four years and is currently a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. 'Lee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies,' Trump said in a statement. 'He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.' Zeldin said on X that 'it is an honor' to join the administration. 'We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,' Zeldin said. 'We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.' What to know about Trump’s inauguration Who won't be on Trump's team As he's been talking about who will be in his next administration, Trump has also highlighted who won't be. One of them is former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who held the role of ambassador to the United Nations during Trump's first term, and the other is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In a tweet, Trump said he won't be inviting them back, though he 'very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously.' 'I was proud to work with President Trump, defending America at the United Nations,' Haley said in response on X. 'I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years.' Pompeo also said that he was proud to work in that previous administration and that it was time to put America first.

What to know about Trump's inauguration	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump will regain control of the White House in January, four years after he lost the presidency to President Joe Biden. In this election cycle, Trump won the popular vote and the Electoral College. Biden and Democratic nominee Vice President Harris both vowed a 'peaceful transfer of power,' with the president inviting Trump to a meeting at the Oval Office. Biden's inauguration in 2020 was on the heels of the Jan. 6 riots and Trump refusing to concede the election, claiming election fraud. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security Here's what we know so far about Trump's impending second inauguration: Trump's Inauguration Day logistics Trump will be sworn into office as the 47th president of the U.S. on Jan. 20 at U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. The inauguration is planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and events include the swearing-in ceremony, the inaugural address, and the pass in review. Around noon, he will recite an oath in accordance with Article II, Section I of the U.S. Constitution. He is also expected to give an inaugural address where most incoming presidents highlight their goals and vision for the next four years in office.

Trump's decision to skip the ceremony is a notable break from recent precedent as we look back on Trump's own inauguration 4 years ago on Jan. 20 2017. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images There will also be an honorary departure where the outgoing president and first lady leave the Capitol to begin their post-presidential lives. There is also a pass in the review where the new president stands on the East Front steps of the Capitol to review military troops before leading a procession of ceremonial military regiments, citizens’ groups, marching bands and floats down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The day will also include a luncheon and photo opportunities. Trump's inauguration day security Capitol police have warned of post-election violence and protests. In a Capitol Police intelligence assessment report released earlier this month, obtained by ABC News, authorities expect the trend of 'civil unrest' seen in 2020 to repeat in 2024. They noted there have been fewer threats to members of Congress this go around. What happens after Election Day? Key dates to know Police expect demonstrations on the electoral certification process and protests related to the war in Israel. What happens before Trump's inauguration? State executives must certify their presidential electors by Dec. 11, and the Electoral College will convene Dec. 17. They must submit their votes officially by Christmas Day. The incoming Congress members will be sworn in on Jan. 3 and will count electoral votes three days later. The winner, presumably Trump, will take the oath of office Jan. 20. Selecting an administration is a top priority for Trump as he prepares to take over the White House.

Diddy's ex-bodyguard sues rape accuser for defamation	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ ex-bodyguard has filed a lawsuit against a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her with the music mogul in 2001, calling her accusations 'outrageous and disgusting.' Joseph Sherman filed a lawsuit alleging defamation and emotional distress in New York federal court Friday against Thalia Graves, who named him in a lawsuit along with Combs in September, USA Today reported. Sherman called Graves’ allegations of rape 'utterly false and untrue' and that she and her lawyers 'made outrageous, disgusting, and life-altering statements … without any regard for the truth,' the outlet reported. He also says Graves is trying to 'blackmail him' and that she had messaged him to see if he would provide 'false testimony against Sean Combs' in exchange for being left out of the legal proceedings, the outlet reported. What we know about the Diddy investigation 'Joseph Sherman has never met Thalia Graves, let alone raped her,' the filing stated, according to USA Today, and he 'continues to suffer severe reputational harm, emotional distress, and financial damages.' Graves filed a lawsuit in September alleging that Combs and Sherman 'viciously raped her' at the Bad Boy Records studio in the summer of 2001, according to court documents obtained by NewsNation local affiliate KTLA. She also alleged that the assault was filmed and then shared without the victim’s consent — including selling it as pornography.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) 'By raping the plaintiff and recording it, the defendants caused the plaintiff to be depicted in a video image unclothed and with intimate body parts exposed and engaged in sexual conduct with another person,' her attorney, Gloria Allred, said at a news conference in September. Court documents show that Graves didn’t report it for decades out of fear they 'would use their power to ruin her life, as they had repeatedly, explicitly threatened to do.' The incident left her traumatized and contemplating suicide, according to the filing. Diddy case: Rappers, stars and more are worried over ‘Diddy Files’ 'The trauma of the assault has taken a toll on my mental health. I’ve had PTSD, depression and anxiety,' she said at a September news conference. 'It has been hard for me to trust others, create relationships or even feel safe in my own skin. The combination of physical and emotional pain has created a cycle of suffering from which it is so hard to break free.' Combs is accused of using his music empire to engage in sex trafficking and accused of having a pattern of abusing women. He was arrested Sept. 16 after months of allegations and a federal raid on two of his properties. He pleaded not guilty in New York court the next day. The music producer was indicted last month on three felony charges after months of speculation surrounding a possible federal investigation that could be connected to a slew of civil lawsuits that allege abuse and sexual assault by multiple victims spanning over 30 years. A May 5 trial date was set on Oct. 10 for him to face sex trafficking and racketeering charges. One week after his indictment, Combs and Sherman were both named in a lawsuit by Graves, making her the 11th accuser to file a suit against him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-bodyguard-sues-rape-defamation/	2024-11-11T10:57:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1771555002.jpg?w=900
Dry weather fuels wildfires on both coasts	(NewsNation) — Fire crews are battling a wildfire on the New York-New Jersey border that has already resulted in the death of one volunteer firefighter and prompted air quality alerts in the region. The fires in New Jersey are in a densely wooded area where around 3,000 acres are burning, and the fire is only 10% contained as of Sunday. Smoke has diminished in the area after it rained Sunday night, but the amount of rainfall was not enough to make a dent in the fire. How could Trump influence military policies? One aspect that complicates the fire is the underground root systems, which are dry, decayed, and rotting. That means the fire is also burning underground, which is hard to capture. 'Make no mistake, though precipitation is forecasted, that's not going to solve the problem we have here with this wildfire,' said New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief Bill Donnelly. 'It's inevitable that this fire is going to continue to burn until it reaches our control line.' Donnelly told NewsNation they are hoping to secure control lines and contain the fire by the end of the week. But it's a difficult task, with New Jersey not well equipped to handle something that is very out of the norm for the region. Volunteer firefighter Dariel Vasquez, 18, died when a tree fell on him as he was trying to fight the Jennings Creek fire in New York. That fire straddles two states. It began in New York and has spread thanks to drought and high winds. At one point, there were around 11 burning across New Jersey, with the cause for all of them under investigation. In one case, an arrest has been made. A man in Ocean County, New Jersey, allegedly fired a shotgun and sparked a fire with an ember from the shotgun shell. Jury deliberations resume in Delphi murder trial against Richard Allen Other fires, which are at various stages of containment, are also being investigated. One fire was 100% contained on Sunday, but others are still spreading in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Even New York City has been affected, with a brush fire breaking out in Brooklyn's Prospect Park on Friday. On the opposite coast, Southern California is also battling wildfires that have resulted in thousands of evacuations and more than 100 destroyed structures. Wetter weather is in the forecast there as well, which could aid firefighters in their efforts to contain the blazes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/dry-wildfires-both-coasts/	2024-11-11T10:36:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182629589.jpg?w=900
Who is Trump's new border czar Tom Homan?	(NewsNation) — Tom Homan has been announced as the incoming Trump administration's 'border czar,' overseeing America's border sovereignty. President-elect Donald Trump announced the appointment via Truth Social on Sunday. 'I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation’s Borders,' Trump wrote. How could Trump influence military policies? Here's what you need to know about Homan. Who is Tom Homan? Homan, 62, has extensive experience in law enforcement and politics, previously serving in the Obama and Trump administrations and as Trump's acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). A New York native, Homan began his career as a police officer in his hometown of West Carthage before moving into border enforcement. Homan was a border patrol agent, later ascending to supervisor before former President Barack Obama appointed Homan to Executive Associate Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013. Homan will be charged with overseeing the United States' borders. Obama gave Homan a Presidential Rank Award in 2015, which recognizes 'extraordinary achievements by career executives in Federal service,' according to the Chief Human Capital Officers Council. Trump previously made Homan a senior immigration official in his last administration. He served as the acting director of ICE. What will Homan's role be as border czar? Trump outlined some of Homan's responsibilities in his Truth Social post on Sunday, reflecting what one may imagine for a border czar. They include but are 'not limited to the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,' according to the president-elect. 'Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,' Trump added. Homan joined Fox News on Monday morning to discuss his new role, suggesting he would be a 'hypocrite' if he did not accept Trump's offer after repeatedly criticizing the Biden administration's border policies. Jockeying kicks off to fill Vance vacancy in Senate 'I'm honored the president asked me to come back and help solve this national security crisis, so I'm looking forward to it,' he said. 'Public safety threats and national security threats will be the priority,' Homan told Fox of his and Trump's vision. 'Another priority, this administration has lost over 300,000 children that were smuggled into this country by criminal cartels... we need to save these children,' Homan added. 'Some of these children are in forced labor, sex trafficking, some of these children are living a life of hell every day. We need to save these children and get them back with their families.' Homan's view on border, deportation Homan recently solidified his position on deportation, as he readies to follow through on Trump's pledge for the largest deportation of migrants who entered the country illegally. 'You have a historic illegal immigration crisis where you have numbers we’ve never seen before, in the millions and millions, of illegal aliens released in this country [and] we know the vast majority will not get asylum, so they don’t qualify,' Homan told The Times. 'The ideal success is: Crime rate goes down, illegal immigration goes down, lives are saved. That’s the ideal outcome,' Homan added. Who is Susie Wiles, Trump’s WH chief of staff? As for mass deportation, Homan rebuked the idea that the Trump administration is heavy-handed by enforcing the law upon those who break United States law by entering the country illegally. 'You have a right to claim asylum,' Homan told Fox on Monday. 'You have a right to see a judge, and we make that happen. But, at the end of that due process, if a judge says 'You have to go home,' then we have to take them home. 'What is the option? Let them all stay? If that's the option you want, you're never going to fix the southern border, because you send a message to the whole world; 'Come to the United States, enter the country illegally - which is a crime - but you still get to stay. That doesn't work.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/tom-homan-border-czar-trump-adminstration/	2024-11-11T09:48:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-886264880.jpg?w=900
Delphi murder trial verdict is in, in case against Richard Allen	(NewsNation) — Jurors have reached a verdict in the trial against Delphi murder suspect Richard Allen. Jurors began their fourth day of deliberations and will consider the evidence against Allen, 52, who is accused of killing Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, in February 2017 after allegedly luring them to their deaths while they were on a hike not far from their home. The girls’ deaths had gone unsolved for more than five years when Allen, then a pharmacy worker, was arrested in the case that has drawn attention from true crime enthusiasts. State police announced his arrest in October 2022. Sex trafficking allegations close Texas massage parlor After an evidence leak, several legal filings, the removal and reinstating of the original court-appointed defense team and other delays in the Delphi murder case, Allen’s trial is nearing its end. Allen faces four counts of first-degree murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping in the killings of Williams and German. If convicted of both killings, Allen could be sentenced to up to 130 years in prison. Delphi murders trial against Allen The jury, consisting of seven women and five men, began deliberations Thursday afternoon after hearing closing arguments in the weekslong murder trial. Over three days, jurors met for 14.5 hours before standing down Sunday. Saturday’s session lasted 4.5 hours and included viewing of videos previously entered into evidence. The state made its case: A crime lab technician matched a bullet found at the crime scene to Allen’s gun; a camera captured Allen’s car near the murder scene; he admitted he was on the bridge on the day of the murders and confessed to the crime dozens of times, including in jail phone calls to his wife and mother. Wife of Illinois judge charged with his murder The defense countered: The state had no DNA, social media or digital forensic evidence linking Allen to the crime; his time in solitary confinement warped his mind and led to false confessions; the state’s investigation was bungled from the beginning; and the bullet evidence was inconclusive at best. The trial started with jury selection on Oct. 14 in Allen County. Due to the high profile of the case and its prominence in central Indiana, Special Judge Fran Gull decided to pull jurors from Allen County. Since the murders happened in Carroll County and a number of key witnesses and investigators lived near or around Delphi, the trial itself was held at the Carroll County Courthouse. The prosecution and defense delivered closing arguments on Nov. 7, 2024 — seven years, eight months and 25 days after the girls’ bodies were found.

Southern border towns brace for migrant influx	(NewsNation) — With January’s presidential inauguration nearing, Texas authorities are bracing for a potential migrant surge and an increasing number of unaccompanied children making the journey alone. In Eagle Pass, Texas, migrant encounters are rising. Over the weekend, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers encountered 116 migrants, including 11 children traveling alone — some as young as seven years old. These children often rely on strangers or pay smugglers to guide them through cartel-controlled areas, adding extreme risks to their journey. Donald Trump names Tom Homan ‘border czar’ Texas DPS has reported a surge in unaccompanied minors, with over 100 children arriving alone in the first half of October, many marked with colored wristbands by cartels, signaling payment for crossing through dangerous areas.

Recently, a group of unaccompanied minors was found with addresses to sponsors in states like New York, California, Colorado and Florida. As of Nov. 1, there were 6,100 unaccompanied children in the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. The average stay per child lasts about 34 days and the department said it is focused on reducing the stay time while ensuring the child's safety. As more children cross alone, the surge is already a reality in Eagle Pass — even before the election results were known. Now, authorities are preparing for what could be an even bigger influx as January’s inauguration approaches. Nearly 50 migrant deaths at border in first 40 days of FY2025 With the anticipated surge before January’s inauguration, Texas has ramped up security under Operation Lone Star. In Brownsville and El Paso, National Guard soldiers, alongside local law enforcement, are running intense, battle-ready drills. Captain Daniel Mannon of Task Force East said these exercises keep teams prepared for swift, coordinated action if large groups arrive. In Eagle Pass, National Guard soldiers from Texas and Louisiana are fortifying key sections with razor wire and expanding the border wall in Cameron and Maverick Counties. Officials believe these measures can help manage the surge, but the pressure is building, and they’re staying on high alert as January draws closer.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/southern-border-towns-migrant-influx/	2024-11-11T08:21:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Texas-DPS.jpg?w=900
Jockeying kicks off to fill Vance vacancy in Senate	Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) is facing a key decision on whom to tap to fill the term of Vice President-elect Vance as jockeying among Ohio Republicans for the coveted appointment is set to become a knife fight. Vance will be departing the upper chamber only two years after winning his seat, creating a vacancy that will have ramifications both immediately and down the line. The appointed senator would be staring down back-to-back campaigns: a high-stakes special election in 2026 and a race in 2028. With a rare opening, Republicans are expecting an intraparty battle in a state that has become increasingly red in recent years. '[The] jockeying will be intense,' Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio) said. Discussions are still in their infancy, but speculation is running rampant over whom DeWine may pick, with the governor’s office already receiving a steady stream of outreach from interested parties. 'A lot of people are calling,' DeWine told reporters Thursday. 'We’re just going through the process of starting to think about this and see who would be the best person.' DeWine also acknowledged that whoever is chosen must be ready to hit the ground running and have the ability to run and win the pair of coming Senate races, much like what Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) is trying to accomplish. The senator is also expected to be a consensus pick, rather than someone either purely in the mold of DeWine, a moderate GOP governor, or cut wholly from MAGA cloth. 'I suspect that DeWine is going to pick someone that's broadly acceptable to the whole party,' a Trump World source told The Hill. 'I don't expect him to pick some crazy MAGA person, but also he won't pick someone who will anger Trump and his supporters.' According to a handful of GOP sources, Jane Timken is widely believed to be among the leading early contenders for the appointment. The former Ohio GOP chair finished in a disappointing fifth place during the 2022 GOP Senate primary that Vance emerged from, but she has put herself in a solid position for an appointment due in part to her close relationship with DeWine. She ran the Ohio GOP during the opening years of his gubernatorial stint. Timken was also a top ally of Vance leading up to the 2022 the general election. One Ohio GOP insider described her as a 'bridge builder,' something that would likely appeal to DeWine. But she is also known for her cautious approach and would have to instill confidence that she can win back-to-back Senate bids, especially after the failed primary run. 'Jane makes all the sense in the world. ... But that's also why she maybe won't get it,' one GOP operative with Ohio ties said. 'She makes sense as the favorite on paper.' DeWine also has a history of appointing women to open posts and positions, multiple operatives noted. But after Timken, there is little consensus. Among the smattering of Republican names being mentioned are Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy and Rep. Mike Carey (Ohio). Sources also noted that DeWine may opt to use the appointment as an opportunity to cull the herd of potential opponents in the state’s looming GOP gubernatorial primary. Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted (R) is DeWine’s favored choice as successor, but he could square off against the likes of Yost or Vivek Ramaswamy, the former presidential candidate and a favorite of President-elect Trump. This could lead DeWine to pick either of the two possible challengers, operatives believe, though Yost would be the more likely of the pair. Strategists are also quick to note that DeWine, a former two-term senator himself, is sure to take the selection process particularly seriously — something the governor acknowledged while discussing the heightened importance of the role, especially given the double dose of elections the pick will face. 'It has to be someone who will serve well in the Senate. I think I have a pretty good idea of what it takes,' DeWine said, adding that he’s looking for someone who will focus on both Ohio and national issues, show strong work ethic and wants to 'get things done.' 'These are qualifications I think that are very important.' 'This is not for the faint-hearted,' he continued. 'This is not for someone who just wants to get a seat. This has to be someone who really wants to do the job and do the work and who we think has the ability to do that.' Two names that are considered unlikely to receive DeWine’s call from the bullpen are state Sen. Matt Dolan (R) and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R), both of whom lost the Senate primary to Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno (R) in the spring. Dolan is unlikely to fall into that boat of being a consensus pick because he is widely viewed as a moderate who would upset Trump and his backers. His selection would also likely prompt a contentious primary challenge — something Republicans of all stripes would like to avoid. As for LaRose, he put up an underwhelming performance during the Senate run, having led at stages before ultimately finishing behind Moreno and Dolan. He also struggled on the fundraising side, especially against two self-funders. It also remains to be seen what role Vance plays in who succeeds him. Multiple sources noted that Vance and DeWine have a strong personal relationship despite their political differences, with the Trump World source pointing to the lack of a response from Vance after DeWine called him out for his comments about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. While the vice president-elect is likely to have conversations with the governor, DeWine is also expected to lean on counsel of advisers and keep the selection process close to the vest. Trump's role in selecting Vance's successor is also unclear at this point, but sources say he will have some level of influence. But one thing that’s universally agreed on is that this is the governor’s choice, no matter how much Vance and others weigh in. 'At the end of the day, it’s a DeWine thing,' the Trump World source said. The timing of filling the vacancy remains unclear because it is unknown when Vance will officially resign from the upper chamber. According to a DeWine spokesperson, the governor is mindful of appointing someone as early as possible, especially in order to give the new senator seniority over the incoming class of members who will be inaugurated on Jan. 3.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jockeying-kicks-off-to-fill-vance-vacancy-in-senate/	2024-11-11T06:58:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/vance-seat_weaver_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
How could Trump influence military policies?	(NewsNation) — Republicans are poised to win full control of Congress and, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in January, that could mean some changes for the United States military. Among those possible changes is a renewed ban on transgender service members. Trump announced the ban during his first term but President Joe Biden lifted that restriction. Other possible changes under Trump Another policy that’s potentially on the chopping block provides paid leave and reimbursements for service members who travel to another state for an abortion. The U.S. military implemented that policy last year. The Defense Department says it was used 12 times across all military branches between June and December, costing $45,000. Trump nominates Stefanik for UN ambassador Trump has pushed to cut back wasteful government spending, which could potentially lead to cuts in defense spending. The official 2024 Republican platform includes plans to invest in military research and advanced technology and supports higher pay for troops. Military recruitment The Army, Air Force, Marines and Space Force all met their recruitment goals during the previous fiscal year. Live results: Balance of power in Congress One of the top Pentagon leaders for personnel says a recruitment crisis is the biggest challenge the military has faced since its inception. The Defense Department recently reported that the armed services recruited 12.5% more people in the past fiscal year, compared to the year prior. Challenges, however, have included a low unemployment rate, competition from private companies that can offer better pay and benefits, and the eligible public’s fewer ties to friends and family members who have served. ‘We’re gonna learn some things’ about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett Before this past cycle, the Army fell short of its recruitment goals for two consecutive years, including a 25% shortfall in 2022. New enlistments have also declined. 2023 saw about 30,000 fewer enlistees than 2019.'We need to remain cautiously optimistic about the future recruiting operations as we continue to recruit in a market that has low youth propensity to serve, limited familiarity with military opportunities, a competitive labor market and a declining eligibility among young adults,' the Director of Military Accession Policy Katie Helland said in an official statement last week. The Defense Department has touted the success of a training program that gives low-performing recruits 90 days to get up to standards for basic training.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/how-trump-influence-military-policies/	2024-11-11T05:54:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2178633197.jpg?w=900
Trump to nominate Stefanik for UN ambassador	President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) as his choice to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, choosing one of his staunchest allies in the House to take on a top diplomatic post. Trump confirmed the choice in a statement to The New York Post late Sunday. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,' Trump said. CNN first reported that Trump had offered Stefanik the role. The congresswoman, who is likely to get confirmed by a majority GOP Senate, is expected to be a combative presence at the United Nations and an outspoken advocate for Trump’s 'America First' foreign policy, which pushes allies to contribute more to shared defense efforts and takes a critical approach to major institutions like the U.N. itself. Stefanik has limited foreign policy and diplomatic experience. She has served on the House Armed Services Committee and on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. She is an outspoken supporter of Israel and has previously decried the United Nations as 'antisemitic.' Stefanik addressed the Knesset in Jerusalem in May to pledge continued U.S. support for Israel. The choice of Stefanik could have repercussions for Trump’s efforts to get his agenda through the House. Republicans are expected to have an extremely narrow majority, and that margin will temporarily become slimmer if Stefanik vacates her seat to join the administration. Stefanik, 40, had long been considered a GOP rising star, and she has broken through in recent years as she became an outspoken Trump ally. She fiercely defended Trump during his first impeachment in 2019, joined GOP leadership in 2021 and sharply questioned Ivy League presidents about campus antisemitism after the October, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel. She has served as chair of the House Republican Conference since 2021 and has represented an upstate New York congressional district since 2015. She was 30 when she first won election, making her the youngest woman elected to Congress at the time. She previously worked in the George W. Bush White House. The role of ambassador to the United Nations was held during Trump’s first term by Nikki Haley and later by Kelly Craft. Trump announced Saturday Haley would not have a role in his second administration. The congresswoman had publicly spoken about her willingness to serve in the Trump administration, including immediately after Trump’s election victory last week. 'He needs strong allies. I’m honored to have my name in the mix, but I’m focused on serving the president however he sees fit, whether that’s passing the agenda in Congress or serving in his administration,' Stefanik said last week on a New York City radio show.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador/	2024-11-11T04:28:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24020104266726-e1719023126539.jpg?w=900

Donald Trump names Tom Homan ‘border czar’	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to appoint Tom Homan, who was acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term, to be his 'border czar.' 'I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation’s Borders ('The Border Czar'), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,' Trump posted on his Truth Social platform late Sunday. 'I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders. Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job,' Trump added. Trump: Senate GOP leader candidates must agree to recess appointments Homan served as acting director of ICE from January 2017 through June 2018. He oversaw the early stages of the Trump administration’s controversial family separation policy, in which migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without permission were criminally charged or referred for prosecution. Last year, Homan defended the controversial policy of separating family members of those who entered the U.S. illegally. 'I’m sick and tired hearing about the family separation,' Homan told the Conservative Political Action Conference last year. 'You know, I’m still being sued over that, so come get me. I don’t give a s***, right. Bottom line is, we enforced the law.' Oklahoma superintendent issues memo on dismantling US education dept. 'When I was a cop in New York and I arrested a father for domestic violence, or someone for [driving under the influence], I separated that family,' he continued. 'When you violate the law with a child, you’re going to be separated.' Homan voiced an equally strong message at the Republican National Convention in July. 'I got a message to the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden has released into our country in violation of federal law: You better start packing now,' he said. Fact check: Both Harris, Trump won states with no voter ID laws Homan’s career began in West Carthage, New York, where he was a police officer. Later, he joined what was then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service. After positions as a border patrol agent, investigator and supervisor, he was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to be the Executive Associate Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013. Since retiring as acting ICE director in 2018, Homan joined the Heritage Foundation, and was a contributor to its Project 2025, the purported blueprint for Trump’s second term.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/donald-trump-names-tom-homan-border-czar/	2024-11-10T21:06:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/03/HomanTom_061322_AP_Matt-York.jpg?w=900
Trump: Senate GOP leader candidates must agree to recess appointm...	President-elect Trump demanded on Sunday that the next Senate GOP leader allow him to make recess appointments, which would effectively let him fast-track his nominees and appointments without needing Senate approval. Recess appointments, which are intended for emergencies, can last for up to two years, without the Senate ever giving their advice and consent. Trump on Sunday suggested using the practice as a way to avoid facing opposition in the Senate to his picks. 'Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,' Trump wrote in a post on the social platform X. Tariffs a ‘helpful’ negotiating tool for Trump: Grover Norquist 'Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!' Trump’s post comes as attention centers on the three-way race to succeed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The race is set between Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who served as Senate GOP whip during Trump’s first two years in the White House. Scott, whose bid to replace the outgoing Senate leader has long been seen as a long-shot, has gained momentum in recent days among some allies of President-elect Trump’s, after his victory helped boost GOP chances in the upper chamber. Scott immediately embraced Trump’s view on recess appointments, writing on X, '100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.' Former Harris aide calls for Biden to resign so she can be president briefly Thune and Cornyn took a more measured approach but still stressed the importance of getting Trump’s picks confirmed and installed in their offices. 'We must act quickly and decisively to get the president’s nominees in place as soon as possible, &amp; all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments. We cannot let Schumer and Senate Dems block the will of the American people,' Thune wrote on X. 'It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump‘s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments,' Cornyn wrote on X, before citing the section of the constitution granting the president to fill vacancies while Congress is in recess. Trump also called for Republicans to try to block judges appointments for the remainder of the year, until Republicans retake control of the White House and Senate. 'Additionally, no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THANK YOU!' Trump wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-senate-gop-leader-candidates-must-agree-to-recess-appointments/	2024-11-10T20:55:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zoom-in-Trump_110624_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=900
We’re gonna learn some things' about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett	(NewsNation) — It may not be 'total disclosure,' but one lawmaker who has advocated for UFO whistleblowers is optimistic that some significant information will come from Wednesday’s House hearing on UFO/UAP. 'I think we’re gonna learn some things. It’s peeling back the layers of an onion,' said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. 'The best pilots in the world, that are our pilots, are telling us that these things are flying in close proximity to their aircraft,' Burchett told 'NewsNation Prime.' What is the Pentagon’s alleged ‘Immaculate Constellation’ program? One expert from Great Britain who will be watching the hearing believes that we will learn something, but not everything. 'Disclosure is a process, rather than a single event. So I don’t think we’re going to see on Wednesday a sort of parting of the curtains ‘this is it’ definitive explanation,' said Nick Pope, UFO expert and retired U.K. Defense Ministry official. Also appearing on 'NewsNation Prime,' Pope said he’s especially looking forward to the testimony of former U.S. Navy Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who knows about a part of the UFO/UAP issue that many people have never heard about: underwater phenomena. 'This … is extremely sensitive because some of these things have apparently been tracking our ballistic missile nuclear submarines,' he said. Mystery drones flew over US base Burchett agrees, adding that Gallaudet 'has very compelling evidence' Two subcommittees of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee are holding the Nov. 13 hearing titled 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.' Many advocates of disclosure have high hopes for the new Trump administration when it comes to releasing files that have been secret for decades. 'He’s dropped heavy hints that he knows something,' said Pope. 'He’s been pressured … to release the rest of the JFK files, which he says he’s going to do early in his second term. Clearly in President Trump’s mind, he links the UFO issue to the JFK issue – perhaps just in terms of public interest and the suggestion that there’s a coverup and a conspiracy,' Pope added. Netflix faces lawsuit over ‘The Manhattan Alien Abduction’ Burchett is also optimistic that Trump wants to share more of what government agencies have compiled over the decades. 'I hope so. That’s the signals I’ve been given. I’m convinced that that’s what he wants, and that he trusts the American public,' he said. 'President Trump will move towards total disclosure.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/were-gonna-learn-some-things-about-ufos-rep-tim-burchett/	2024-11-10T20:47:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1813803078.jpg?w=900
Tariffs a ‘helpful’ negotiating tool for Trump: Grover Norquist	(NewsNation) — Grover Norquist, the Republican founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, tells 'NewsNation Prime' he believes President-elect Donald Trump’s tariffs and tax cut plans will help America’s deficit decline. Trump has pledged to implement several economic initiatives, including a plan to eliminate personal income taxes in exchange for at least a 10% tariff on all important imported goods and a 60% tariff on products imported from China. 'He has talked about those using those as a negotiating tool to keep China from stealing our technology, to get China to allow our goods and services to go into China ... we need to have more pressure on China to have them accept American goods and services, which they're not doing now,' Norquist said. These stocks have soared since Trump’s victory 'As a negotiating tool, tariffs can be helpful,' he added. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s plan to expand his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would, in 2024 dollars, cost $3.2 trillion over 10 years and $10.3 trillion over the next 30 years. If the cuts aren't expanded, taxes could rise as much as 4% for certain income brackets, while the child tax credit could be cut in half. According to the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics, if these tariffs were enacted, a typical middle class family would see $1,700 in additional costs yearly. 'Free market economists recognize that Trump's pro growth policy is the way to keep the deficit down. Economic growth is the most important thing we can do to bring the deficit and the debt down,' Norquist said. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, shows that the Trump tax proposal benefits American workers in various income brackets following an election in which many voters considered the economy their top concern. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security The Wharton project also estimates that the Trump tax plan would increase the nation’s primary deficits by $5.8 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis and by $4.1 trillion on a dynamic basis, the report finds.

Sanders: Sotomayor stepping down not 'the sensible approach'	Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stepping down is not the 'sensible approach' as Democrats float the idea of packing the court before President-elect Trump takes office. Sanders joined NBC’s 'Meet the Press' host Kristen Welker on Sunday, where he was asked for his thoughts about the idea. Former Harris aide calls for Biden to resign so she can be president briefly 'Is that something you would support, do you think she should step down?' Welker asked. 'No, I don’t,' Sanders replied. Welker continued, asking if he had 'heard any talk' about the idea. 'A little bit, yes,' Sanders said. 'I don’t think it’s a sensible approach.' Sotomayor has made it clear she has no plans to step down from the Supreme Court, CNN reported Sunday after speaking with people close to the justice. Some on the left have called for President Biden to name a successor — someone younger — to serve a lifetime appointment before Trump enters office. Trump in phone call advised Putin not to escalate in Ukraine: Report Sotomayor, 70, is in 'great health, and the court needs her now more than ever,' one person close to the justice told CNN. With 71 days until Trump’s inauguration, there are concerns that a Supreme Court nomination would take too long, and Sotomayor’s hypothetical open seat would allow the president-elect to nominate a conservative.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sonia-sotomayor-stepping-down/	2024-11-10T15:09:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24172679018758-e1720523163554.jpg?w=900

(The Hill) -- San Francisco 49ers star defensive end Nick Bosa was fined by the NFL after he crashed a postgame interview wearing a MAGA hat. The league fined Bosa $11,255 after he crashed the live interview after his team’s win against the Dallas Cowboys late last month, a league source told CNN and The Associated Press. Bosa spoke with the media after it was announced the presidential race would go for President-elect Trump. He said if the NFL fined him for jumping into the interview, it wouldn’t matter much to him. 'I don’t know,' he said Wednesday when asked if he thought he would get a fine. 'I haven’t gotten one yet, but if it comes, it comes.' He added that he knew he could get a fine from the NFL, but it was 'well worth it' to wear the hat.

These NFL teams eat the most Uncrustables in a week, report finds Bosa said his position supporting Trump is not going to change, saying the 'nation spoke' in the election. After he crashed the postgame interview, he was asked during a press conference about his political statement. He said he wasn’t going to speak too much on the topic but called it an important time. Bosa was also asked whether he was tempted to show support for Trump in the past. He said it’s 'definitely a little easier nowadays,' but he doesn’t feel 'too inclined' to publicly support the president-elect. Bosa and Trump met at the UFC fight in Miami earlier this year and took a picture with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/49ers-star-nick-bosa-fined-for-crashing-interview-wearing-maga-hat/	2024-11-10T15:00:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/64f8f1f390df08.02103318-e1731279346984.jpeg?w=800
Mpox vaccine’s high cost concerning: Health experts	(NewsNation) — Finding the vaccine to prevent the spread of mpox is not difficult. But paying for it could be very difficult in the U.S., especially for those at the highest risk of contracting what used to be known as monkeypox. Private insurance companies in the U.S. aren’t required to cover the cost of the mpox vaccine Jynneos, which costs $270 a dose. The firms will be required to cover the vaccine starting on Jan. 1. 'This is a massive bump in the road, and especially because it’s happening in the middle of deep concern about another outbreak,' Dr. Stacey Trooskin told The New York Times. Trooskin is the executive medical officer of the Mazzoni Center, a large sexual health clinic in Philadelphia. Standing desks aren’t making you healthier: Study Along with the high cost, privacy may also be a factor in some reluctance to seek out the vaccine. Health professionals say that gay and bisexual men, those living with HIV and sex workers should seek out the vaccine. However young gay men may not have health insurance, and others may be reluctant to get the Jynneos vaccine because they are not out to their families. Last month, the city of El Paso, Texas confirmed two cases of mpox. The latest iteration of the virus is responsible for thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths in central Africa. Cases have also been confirmed outside of Africa, including Sweden and the U.K. Ozempic can lead to muscle mass loss: Study Earlier this year, the White House announced that it would donate one million doses of the mpox vaccine to the Central African countries at the center of the deadly outbreak. There may be some alternatives, however. Some local health departments, such as Chicago, Los Angeles County and the state of Virginia, are offering the mpox vaccine for free.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/mpox-vaccine-high-cost/	2024-11-10T14:55:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2181249026.jpg?w=900
Former Harris aide calls for Biden to resign so she can be presid...	Jamal Simmons, a former aide to Vice President Harris, called for President Biden to resign so that the vice president can have his role for a short amount of time. 'Joe Biden’s been a phenomenal president, he’s lived up to so many of the promises he’s made. There’s one promise left that he could fulfill, being a transitional figure,' Simmons said on CNN’s 'State of the Union' on a panel featuring anchor Dana Bash, in a clip highlighted by Mediaite. White House says Biden will continue push for Ukraine aid, cease-fire 'He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris president of the United States,' he continued, drawing shocked reactions from others. President Biden dropped out of this year’s race for the White House in late July, following a rising tide of concern about his age and mental fitness that came in the wake of a rough debate performance against President-elect Trump a month before. Harris then took his position at the top of the ticket, but eventually lost to Trump a few months later. Simmons said Harris stepping into her boss’s role 'would make sure that it would dominate the news, at a point where Democrats have to learn drama and transparency and doing things the public will wanna see.' Harris’s loss to Trump and the loss of control of the Senate in the 2024 elections has rattled Democrats, many of whom view the president-elect as a threat to democracy. Trump in phone call advised Putin not to escalate in Ukraine: Report Democrats have also taken to infighting in the wake of the election, with those on the left saying their party didn’t go far enough in their direction to excite the party’s base, while centrists have said the party went too far left and frightened moderate voters. 'We are out of touch with the crisis of meaning/purpose fueling MAGA,' Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Sunday in a thread on the social platform X. 'We refuse to pick big fights. Our tent is too small.'

Immigration advocates brace for Trump: 'Buckle up'	Immigration advocates are bracing for Trump 2.0, whose pledge of mass deportation is sending waves of panic and anger throughout the movement. Even before President-elect Trump’s resounding victory on Tuesday, immigration advocacy was facing an identity crisis after decades of relying on Hispanics as their primary voting constituency and with neither political party fully embracing their priorities. 'I think that part of the challenge … has been the movement has been very insular. The movement has been focused on undocumented immigrants,' said Marielena Hincapié, a scholar at Cornell University's Immigration Law and Policy Program. 'When I was heading up the National Immigration Law Center, I would be the person to be like, 'I'm a Latina, and this is so much more than just about [Latinos],' right? It's about Asian Pacific Islanders. It's about Black immigrants. But it also has to be like, when we talk about — or the directly impacted, the directly impacted by immigration is not just someone who is undocumented, right? It's about the U.S. citizen spouses. It's the U.S. citizen children. It's the business owners that are relying on them. It's the homeowners whose houses are being rebuilt in, you know, Asheville, North Carolina, or Florida after Milton.' The immigration advocacy umbrella has grown since the first Trump administration, notably with the elevation of Haitian American civil rights groups and closer ties between advocacy and business through organizations such as the American Business Immigration Coalition. In 2023, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called on Congress to move forward a series of bipartisan bills directed toward border security and immigration reform. 'The antiquated legal immigration system and its woefully insufficient supply of worker visas have for years significantly hindered the ability of companies to meet their workforce needs. In addition, the vast shortcomings of the legal immigration system are a significant contributing factor to the continuing challenges at the southern border,' wrote Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the Chamber, in a letter to Congress. But neither the outgoing, divided Congress nor the Democratic-controlled Congress of the first half of the Biden administration made any headway on immigration — a pattern that’s held for nearly four decades — or on border security, a government duty that’s been institutionally stagnant but consistently growing in scope and cost over the past two decades. That’s a painful bottom line for a movement whose main goals are to modernize and humanize the immigration system and to curb the growth of the detention-deportation industrial complex. 'When you look beyond the binaries served up to American voters this election cycle — a felon or democracy, toughness or chaos, a ban or a welcome — you see them as false choices that overshadow real, necessary and in many cases broadly supported policy solutions. The pressures of irregular migration and the recycling harms of crime and incarceration will not go away on their own, nor can they be blotted out by sheer bravado. They must be reckoned with in ways that create lasting change,' said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an organization that bridges big tech and immigration advocacy, in a statement. Trump’s victory sent private prison operator stocks soaring. Investors are betting on his promises of mass deportation and mass internment coming true, funneling millions in tax dollars to those companies. As of midday Friday, the GEO Group’s stock grew nearly 75 percent over five days, and CoreCivic stock went up nearly 68 percent. But some remain skeptical that Trump will be able to — or truly want to — build the infrastructure needed to carry out millions of deportations. 'Is he going to deport 20 million people? I really don't think so. That's unrealistic,' said Rob Wilson, president of Employco USA, a national human resources firm. Still, Wilson said companies should prepare for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids by screening for proper work authorization. 'The good thing is unemployment — it's turned back to an employer market versus an employee market so the employers can be a little bit more selective. A couple of years ago, when people still weren't working coming off of COVID, it was the employees who were really running the marketplace. And now those have flipped. So as an employer, I just think you've got a little bit more flexibility,' said Wilson. That flies contrary to two central tenets of the immigration advocacy world: belief in Trump’s threats and that the U.S. economy is dependent on undocumented labor. According to Hincapié, Democrats have historically missed the opportunity to communicate the latter. 'You can just do three bullets and say that message time and time again to shift the conversation away from just the border to human beings who everybody in the United States relates to in one way or the other,' she said. 'If you eat in this country, you owe that to immigrants. If you go to a restaurant. You go to, you know, shopping. You have children who need to be taken care of. You have an elderly or a family member who is ill, guess what? Who is taking care, who is rebuilding our cities after climate disasters, is immigrants, and so they just haven't done that, right? They haven't told the stories of who we are and who will be impacted by Trump's agenda.' Though Trump’s immigration message has been the through line of his political career, his pledge to fix economic woes is what most resonated with voters; according to NBC News exit polling, 32 percent of voters in key states named the economy as their top issue, while only 11 percent pointed to immigration. 'While the dust is still settling on how Latinos actually voted in this election, it's clear that our community is primarily concerned with the economy and the same pocketbook issues as other Americans, such as the rising costs of food, housing and other essentials. Deep concerns with inflation and making ends meet almost singularly drove how Hispanics voted in this election,' said Janet Murguía, president of UnidosUS, in a postelection statement. Of the 11 percent of voters who prioritized immigration, 90 percent voted for Republicans and only 9 percent for Democrats, showing that Vice President Harris’s immigration pitch resonated much less than her positions on abortion or on defending democracy, the top issue for 34 percent of voters in the poll. 'In a year where the stakes could not be higher, young, Black, Brown, queer, and working-class communities urged Vice President Harris and Democrats as a whole to embrace pro-immigrant policies that resonate with the majority of young people,' Michelle Ming, political director of United We Dream Action, said in a statement. 'By refusing to run on a bold, progressive agenda, Democrats failed to lead with the message voters needed to stop an authoritarian from taking back the White House. We demand the Biden-Harris Administration, Congress, and state and local officials across the country leave no stone unturned in delivering vital protections for immigrants at this moment. No matter what, we are ready to put our bodies on the line to protect our communities.' For decades, advocates have fought an uphill battle to keep immigration a priority for Latino voters, many of whom have never seen Congress pass significant legislation on the issue. Though the dispersion of the Latino vote — gender, national origin, age and geographical gaps tell the story of the 2024 Hispanic electorate — makes it a precarious constituency, in poll after poll large majorities of Latinos say they favor a path to citizenship. 'The obligatory question is what could Democrats have done to stop the erosion among the voters that comprise their base, like Latinos. For decades, Democrats have been told they cannot assume they have absolute support among specific sectors. They have to invest and court that vote and not only go out looking for it during election season. The Democrats knew about the erosion of support among Latino men. Still, they didn't have a sense of urgency, perhaps thinking they would win the Hispanic vote at any rate, even with a lower percentage,' wrote Maribel Hastings, a senior adviser for America’s Voice, in an op-ed widely distributed throughout Spanish-language media. America’s Voice is a leading progressive immigration advocacy group, formed by longtime advocate Frank Sharry in 2008, amid comprehensive immigration reform negotiations that momentarily brought the far sides of the political spectrum to the same table. Even before Trump’s first term, lines of communication between immigration advocates and restrictionists had been severed, and there will be little motivation to mend that rift in a second Trump administration. But immigrant advocates have been laying the groundwork for advocacy on economic terms, highlighting immigrants, documented and undocumented, as a force in both the labor and consumer markets, and they see an opening to engage a broader electorate concerned with civil rights under Trump. 'I know that there is a broader political constituency that we haven't been tapping into, and that that is who we need to build with. And frankly, I would say that there are a lot of people that supported Trump, that voted for Trump, that voted because of the economic issues or for other issues, or because, you know, strong man attitude, like whether it was machismo that led that, whatever, for whatever reason, we need to bring them back. We need to get them to understand,' said Hincapié. The prevailing frustration and anger in the immigration advocacy world is not only directed at Trump, but at those voters. 'Despite everything, people in the United States gave him a second term,' wrote Hastings in her Spanish-language op-ed. 'Buckle up because there is a lot of turbulence ahead.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/immigration-advocates-brace-for-trump-buckle-up/	2024-11-10T13:08:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/migrants_mexico_11072024ap.jpg?w=900
Trump in phone call advised Putin not to escalate in Ukraine: Rep...	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. Trump advised Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of 'Washington's sizeable military presence in Europe', the Post reported. White House says Biden will continue push for Ukraine aid, cease-fire During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war 'within a day,' but did not explain how he would do so.

Trump's win cements Florida as deep-red state	Former President Trump cemented Florida’s status as a deep-red state on Tuesday, flipping multiple counties up and down the state. Miami-Dade County saw a Republican win at the presidential level for the first time in 36 years, while the greater Tampa area also went red. Trump also flipped Jacksonville’s Duval County and large swaths of blue-leaning Central Florida. South Dakota Republican says Thune will ‘be a great leader’ for Senate Trump carried the state by 13 points on Tuesday, dramatically improving on his roughly 3-point margin in 2020 and his 1-point margin in 2016. While Florida has been on a GOP trajectory for nearly ten years, Trump’s victory and Vice President Harris’s underperformance underscores the degree to which he has tightened his political hold on the state and is also emblematic of the former president’s over-performance on election night. 'I looked at Duval and I said Duval is a microcosm of Georgia,' said Florida Republican strategist Ford O’Connell. 'He wins this by five, he’s going to win Georgia for sure.' The economy and immigration reigned supreme for voters’ top issues in Florida, like in much of the country. According to the AP VoteCast, 41 percent of voters said the economy was their most important issue, followed by immigration at 23 percent and abortion at nine percent. Trump’s GOP skeptics in Congress face lonely path forward 'Now we have Trump crushing it by 13 points. Part of that is kind of an affirmation of [Trump’s] agenda on issues like immigration, economy and inflation,' said Justin Sayfie, a Florida-based Republican strategist. Other Republicans have attributed the increased success in the state, in part, to a conservative populist message on issues like immigration and the economy. 'What Trump helped add to the conversation is he helped a lot of Florida politicians speak populist conservatism. I mean, that’s how you win Miami Dade,' O’Connell said. The messaging played well with the state’s Latino population, particularly in South Florida’s Miami Dade County and Central Florida’s Osceola County. Trump notably flipped Osceola County, which was carried by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden by double digits, by just over one point. Miami Dade is home to a large Cuban American population, while Osceola County is home to a sizable Puerto Rican population, Sayfie and other Florida Republicans argue that Tuesday night’s results were the culmination of a number of factors, like over 10 years of population growth in the state, Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) widely praised handling of the coronavirus pandemic and a strengthened GOP infrastructure. Trump notably made Florida the center of the Republican universe when he became a resident of the state in 2020. Trump resistance rises in states led by Democratic governors 'This didn’t happen overnight,' O’Connell said. 'Mechanically it started with Rick Scott,' he continued, referring to Scott’s first gubernatorial victory in 2010. 'After that first one, the Florida Republican Party really started the voter registration drive,' O’Connell said. There are currently over one million more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state. Scott, who served two terms as governor, won reelection to the Senate on Tuesday, improving on his past statewide margins of victory in Florida. The senator in the past had narrowly won his election and reelection bids in the state, but defeated former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel Powell (D-Fla.) by over 12 points on Tuesday. Chris Hartline, a senior adviser to the Scott campaign, attributed much of the victory to Republicans’ voter registration advantage in the state. 'It’s really hard to compare Florida to what’s happening in other places in the country,' Hartline said. 'We won Hillsborough, we won Pinellas, we won Seminole, we performed better in Orange. Is that because of a failure of Harris with suburban voters or is it because we have more registered Republicans in the state than we used to?' 'And it’s hard to not completely ignore the tactical side of it, which is Florida Democrats do not have a functioning party,' he added. Florida Democrats argued that there were bright spots on Tuesday, including a 25-percent increase in turnout from 2022, and the fact that a majority of voters favored legislation that would have enshrined abortion rights in the state. The measure ultimately failed because it did not meet the 60-percent threshold. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

But like Democrats across the country, the party in Florida is grappling with what went wrong nationally and within their home state. 'Democrats had a disaster at the top of the ticket, which I publicly stated at the beginning of the race,' said John Morgan, a prominent Central Florida-based attorney and Democratic donor. 'Florida is officially Texas and Pennsylvania is officially Florida,' he continued. However there are Florida Republicans that are urging their colleagues to not get too comfortable in the state, warning that the same conditions that helped Republicans in the state could help Democrats down the road. 'At this moment, Florida is a red state, but I don’t think the Republicans can get cocky and the reason is simple. You have a very transient population and things change and eventually the Democrats may get it together,' O’Connell said. 'Parties are set up in our two-party system so they can reinvent themselves. That’s why you can’t get cocky.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-florida-deep-red-state/	2024-11-10T12:02:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/florida_manchester_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
South Dakota Republican says Thune will 'be a great leader' for S...	Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said Sunday that Sen. John Thune (R-S.C.) will 'be a great leader' for the Senate as Republicans in the upper chamber prepare for a return to power. 'I’ve known John Thune since the 1980s, he's gonna be a great leader,' Rounds told NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt on 'The Hill Sunday.' Ruben Gallego projected to win Arizona US Senate seat 'But the nice thing for Republicans is we've got three really quality individuals that are vying for the top office as the majority leader, and so, I've got nothing bad to say about any of the other two candidates, but I think we've got a real winner in John Thune,' he added. Thune is facing off against Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for long-serving Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) position. Republicans are also set to take control of the Senate in January due to the results of Tuesday’s election. 'And here's part of the deal,' Rounds said in his 'The Hill Sunday' appearance. 'He wants change in the Senate. He wants the Senate to actually get back and actually work. Let's actually try to get some things done on time for a change.' Thune has recently been pushing President-elect Trump to not intervene in the race for leadership of the Senate Republicans, and has said that it is in the president-elect’s 'best interests' to not take a side.

Dog the Bounty Hunter expands search for Tennessee teen missing s...	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — It's been roughly nine months since Sebastian Rogers, 15, disappeared from his Hendersonville, Tennessee, home, launching extensive search efforts by several law enforcement agencies. A celebrity bounty hunter, who recently joined the search for Sebastian, says it may be time to expand it internationally. In the first few months after Sebastian's February disappearance, agencies continued to actively search for the teen but never came across any sightings of him. Law enforcement has since pulled back to focus on the 'investigative side.' However, Seth Rogers, Sebastian's biological father, never stopped searching. In September, Duane Chapman, also known as Dog the Bounty Hunter, joined the search efforts. His first act was to raise the reward money for information from $50,000 to $100,000. PREVIOUS | Bounty hunter Duane ‘Dog’ Chapman joins search for Sebastian Rogers 'This is one of the most horrendous cases of missing children that we’ve ever, ever worked on,' Chapman, well-known for his TV show, 'Dog the Bounty Hunter,' previously explained. Last week, Chapman raised the reward amount for information again to $175,000 after his team said he received 'valuable' information and leads in Oregon and New York. Bryndis Davis, the lead high-task force investigator for AtNight Intelligence Agency and Dog the Bounty Hunter, told Nexstar's WKRN she hopes the increase in reward money will develop further assistance from the public. 'We want to motivate anyone with information to please step forward and potentially help break the case wide open,' Davis expressed. 'We are signaling to the public that help is crucial right now.' Father of missing teen, Dog the Bounty Hunter file lawsuit against influencers However, investigators with Chapman's team are not ruling out any possible leads in Canada and along its border. According to the AtNight Intelligence Agency, two notifications were issued requesting immediate awareness on ports of entry into the United States and Canada. 'We have pinpointed some credible leads in Oregon and New York, near the Canadian border,' Davis said. 'There are several active investigation zones where we are working on the case closely with locals and initiated a rapid reach notification to all U.S. towns that border Canada.' The documents request vigilance from national law enforcement agencies with specific attention to motels, hotels, bus stations, and similar public facilities. 'It's about how seriously we take these new leads and our dedication to using every tool at our disposal to find answers,' Davis concluded. In the meantime, the investigative group is looking to add more team members by February and March. Anyone who has any information concerning Sebastian's whereabouts can call Chapman’s tip line at 833-835-5364, call the Sumner County Sheriff’s Office at 615-451-3838, or contact the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation at 1-800-TBI-FIND or TipsToTBI@tbi.tn.gov.

NY forest ranger dies fighting fires; air quality warnings are is...	POMPTON LAKES, N.J. (AP) — A New York forest ranger died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday. The Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue said the New York state forestry service reported that the forest ranger, whose name was not released, died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, officials said. 'Rip brother your shift is over job well done,' the post said. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to more than 3 square miles (about 8 square kilometers) near the border in Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New York. Dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, it was threatening two homes and eight buildings in the Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. Health advisories were issued for parts of New York and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 175-acre (70-hectare) fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre (142-hectare) Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of 'incendiary or tracer ammunition' was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ap-ny-forest-ranger-dies-fighting-fires-air-quality-warnings-are-issued-in-new-york-and-new-jersey/	2024-11-10T08:15:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6730dc787aaa26.84095364.jpeg?w=900
Young Black, Latino men say they chose Trump because of the econo...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Brian Leija, a 31-year-old small-business owner from Belton, Texas, was not surprised that a growing number of Latino men of his generation voted for Donald Trump for president this year. Leija had voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020. Leija's rationale was simple: He said he has benefited from Trump’s economic policies, especially tax cuts. 'I am a blue-collar worker,' Leija said. 'So, tax breaks for small businesses are ideal for what I do.' For DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for Trump was rooted in what he saw as Democrats' rhetoric not matching their actions. 'It’s been a very long time since the Democrats ever really kept their promises to what they’re going to do for the minority communities,' he said. Gallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This year, he said, he thought the former president’s 'minority community outreach really showed up.' Trump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters. Even as Democrat Kamala Harris won majorities of Black and Latino voters, it wasn’t enough to give the vice president the White House, because of the gains Trump made. Economy and jobs made men under age 45 more open to Trump Voters overall cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue the country faced. That was true for Black and Hispanic voters as well. About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden. Juan Proaño, CEO of LULAC, the nation’s largest and oldest civil rights organization for Hispanic Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trump's messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos. 'I think it’s important to say that Latinos have a significant impact in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald Trump,' Proaño said. '(Latino) men certainly responded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues, inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform.' The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trump's hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color. 'I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective amongst the young men, Black, white, Hispanic,' Harkins said. 'And I think unfortunately, even if it’s a very small percentage, you know, when you’re talking about an election like we just had it can be very impactful.' Black and Latino voters’ priorities changed from 2020 While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue. A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as 'not so good' or 'poor,' compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in bad shape. That belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress. This is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he said. 'Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me,' Uscanga said. 'Gas, grocery shopping even as a college student, everything has gone up in price and that is a big concern for me and other issues like immigration.' Having grown up selling tamales and used cars, and washing cars, Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said. 'Under the Trump presidency more opportunities were abound,' Uscanga said. 'I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016 but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019, I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media was saying and that’s why I started supporting him after that.' Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of white voters. 'Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing voters,' said Terrance Woodbury, co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling and research firm that conducted studies for the Harris campaign. 'For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing either between parties or in and out of the electorate,' Woodbury said. Desire for strong leadership made Trump more appealing A majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Hispanic voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%. Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strong leader. David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the election did not disappoint him. 'I’m satisfied with the result. I don’t feel slighted. I wasn’t let down. I wasn’t pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman in that position, he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said, 'I’d rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy.' ___ Figueroa reported from Austin, Texas.

The Army's answer to a lack of recruits is a prep course to boost...	FORT JACKSON, S.C. (AP) — Index cards taped to a large board on the wall at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, reveal the sometimes blunt and gritty reasons that new recruits took a chance at a last-ditch program to get into the Army. 'Eviction notices motivate me,' one said. Others talked about getting free college, a good job and a way to better themselves. Known as the 'Why Wall,' the board is meant as an inspiration for the recruits who could not meet the Army's physical and academic test standards, so they went into the Future Soldier Prep Course. It provides weeks of instruction to help them bring up their scores. Started as a trial program two years ago to help boost dismal recruiting numbers, the prep course is fueling the Army’s enlistment comeback. Recruiting has suffered for all the military branches in recent years coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, amid low unemployment and stiff competition from private companies able to pay more and provide similar or better benefits. By the end of this budget year on Sept. 30, the Army had made its recruiting goal of 55,000, and service leaders said more than 13,000 of those recruits — or 24% — came into active duty through the prep course. Army leaders increased the goal to 61,000 for this year and are relying on the prep course to provide a significant chunk again. During a recent visit to Fort Jackson, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth spoke with recruits and program leaders to see how the course is going and what changes may need to be made. She said the successful program, which more than 31,000 trainees have gone through since it started, deserves to be made permanent. Wormuth said the Army may make adjustments based on a long-term study on the recruits coming out of the course, including looking at how well they did in their first enlistment and whether there were behavioral or disciplinary problems. 'We really want to see what kind of soldier kind of comes out at the back end of that first term, how do they do in terms of discipline,' Wormuth said. Drill sergeants have expressed concerns that they are seeing more discipline issues, disrespect and complaints from trainees in the academic course. And they say trainees whose first language is not English have a more difficult time understanding orders and dealing with computers. While they see fewer discipline issues from recruits in the fitness section, they do see more injuries, including ankle, knee and hip problems. Those trainees, they say, may need to be brought along even more slowly, to increase their strength and conditioning, rather than moving them to basic training the minute they hit the minimum level of requirements. Commanders told Wormuth that the fitness program aims to give trainees a healthy foundation in eating and working out. Instructors said they do not want to break the recruits before they get to basic training, so they do a lot of yoga, stretching and other exercises to help avoid injuries. In the classrooms, they are learning basic math, English and other academic skills. The bulk of recruits going through the program are in the academic course. So far, Wormuth said, the data does not reflect some of the concerns expressed by drill sergeants and commanders. Instead, she and other Army leaders said that on average, the graduation rate from basic training is a bit higher — about 94% — for those who went through the program versus those who did not, which is about 92%. But so far, they are taking inspiration from the thoughts scrawled on the 'Why Wall.' Company commanders came up with the idea last year, to let recruits lay out their goals in their first few days so they can go back every week to get motivated or see their progress. A bright yellow sign atop the board tells recruits: 'Your WHY will keep you going even when you want to QUIT the most.' The answer for many was they had something to prove — to themselves and others. 'I joined the Army because my family thought I couldn’t accomplish anything in life. So I had to prove them wrong,' one said. Another wrote: 'I wanna show my family I’m worth something.' Others said they wanted to 'be a better man,' 'gain my independence' and 'prove to myself that I can accomplish something and I'm not a quitter.' One recruit was blunt: 'To prove to her I’m not gonna turn into who she said I’d become.' Recruits lined up near the wall told Wormuth that the physical fitness program is working for them. Couper Godleski, from Pennsylvania, said that in 10 weeks he had lost 20 pounds. Britney Vaughn, from Louisiana, said she had lost 30 pounds in six weeks. And while she said she is missing her 3-year-old daughter, 'I feel like everything will be worth it.' On the academic side, recruits told Wormuth that even as they struggle with math or English comprehension, they are getting help from instructors while learning the structure and discipline of the Army. A key goal, said one female recruit, is 'to be a role model to my nieces and nephews' and get money for college so she doesn't have to be in debt. For Wormuth, the visit confirmed Army leaders' intention to keep the program going. Recruiting challenges are not going to end, she said. 'I think we’re going to probably continue to see pretty low unemployment. We’re still going to see 60% go to college. It’s a more competitive labor market,' she said. 'So we’re going to have to keep fighting hard for our new recruits.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/ap-the-armys-answer-to-a-lack-of-recruits-is-a-prep-course-to-boost-low-scores-its-working/	2024-11-10T04:48:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6730ac696fc928.12210338.jpeg?w=900
Ruben Gallego projected to win Arizona US Senate seat	(NewsNation) — NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for the U.S. Senate seat for Arizona in favor of Ruben Gallego. See all Arizona race results here. The race between U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Republican Kari Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for Arizona governor two years ago, was one of the closest watched Senate races this election cycle. The battle to replace outgoing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who decided not to seek reelection, has been a critical race for Democrats to maintain their razor-thin majority in the U.S. Senate. Arizona has also been a battleground state that is critical for Democrats to win in order to stay in the White House. Gallego, a Marine combat veteran once serving in the Iraqi invasion, received endorsements from dozens of Republicans, including former aides to the late Republican Sen. John McCain, who was also a veteran. He was also endorsed by the Arizona Police Association, a blow to Lake who’d been backed by the group in 2022. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Lake, a former news anchor, has been a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, vehemently repeating his unfounded claims that he won the 2020 election. Her support was reciprocated with endorsements from the former president in both 2022 and 2024. 'If you want to get to President Trump, you have to get through me,' her Senate campaign website reads. Lake narrowly lost her 2022 gubernatorial bid to then-Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs but refused to accept the results, falsely blaming election fraud and voter disenfranchisement. Gallego’s campaign centered around raising the federal minimum wage, reinstating abortion rights and improving veterans' rights. The son of a single, immigrant mother, Gallego has voted for funding to hire and deploy thousands more Border Patrol agents and says he supports border security. Lake’s campaign also focused on increased border security, along with making America energy-dominant, reducing inflation and returning abortion policy decision-making to the states. See NewsNation’s election live blog with real-time analysis from our political experts and the latest race calls nationwide powered by Decision Desk HQ. Watch live results from the presidential election, important swing states and the balance of power in Congress. NewsNation will also be tracking your local state elections and impactful ballot initiatives around the country. As of late September, Gallego held a 3-1 fundraising advantage and a double-digit polling advantage over Lake. This was one of eight open Senate races where the incumbent did not run for re-election. A total of 34 Senate seats are up in 2024 with 23 being held by Democrats and independents. Republicans can retake control of the upper chamber of Congress by stealing two seats from Democrats or by winning the 2024 presidential election and stealing just one other seat. As a result, the outcome of this race will affect the balance of power within the Senate in 2025.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/arizona-senate-results-lake-gallego/	2024-11-09T18:04:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Thumb-Arizona-Ruben-Gallego.jpg?w=900
Qatar suspends its mediation efforts on Gaza and the Hamas office...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Qatar has suspended its key mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel, it said Saturday, after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal for Gaza. It wasn't immediately clear whether the remaining Hamas leadership hosted by Qatar must leave, or where it would go. Hamas has good relations with Iran and Turkey, and some of its leaders are now in Lebanon. However, Qatar is highly likely to return to mediation efforts if both sides show 'serious political willingness' to reach a deal, according to an official with Egypt, the other key mediator. Qatar told Israel and Hamas it can't continue to mediate 'as long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith' and 'as a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose' in Qatar, a diplomatic source briefed on the matter said. Qatar told Hamas it will have to leave if it isn't ready to engage in serious negotiations, the source said. In Washington, a U.S. official said the Biden administration informed Qatar two weeks ago that the Hamas office's continued operation in Doha was no longer useful and the Hamas delegation should be expelled. A senior U.S. official said that after Hamas rejected the last proposal for a cease-fire, Qatar accepted the advice and informed the Hamas delegation of the decision 10 days ago. A senior Hamas official said they were aware of Qatar’s decision to suspend mediation efforts, 'but no one told us to leave.' Hamas has repeatedly called for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as a condition for any cease-fire deal. Israel seeks the return of all hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and insists on a presence in Gaza. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Israeli prime minister’s office had no comment. Late Saturday, the state-run Qatar News Agency published comments attributed to Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, confirming that Doha informed parties in the talks 10 days ago that it 'would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round.' 'Qatar will resume those efforts with its partners when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians,' the report said. There continued to be no end in sight to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon, where Israel’s military said it struck command centers and other militant infrastructure in Beirut’s southern suburbs and elsewhere. An Israeli airstrike on the southern port city of Tyre late Friday killed at least seven, officials and a resident said. Hezbollah 'should continue (the fight) and we will continue to back them up even if we lose our families, our homes, and end up in the dirt,' said one Beirut resident, Mohammed Mekdad, as people searched the smoking rubble. In Gaza, Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said, while Israel announced the first delivery of humanitarian aid in weeks to the territory's hungry, devastated north. One strike hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City’s eastern Tufah neighborhood, killing at least six people, the territory's Health Ministry said. Two local journalists, a pregnant woman and a child were among the dead, it said. Israel's army said the strike targeted a militant belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, offering no evidence. Another Israeli strike killed seven people, including two women and a child in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Israel's army didn't respond to a request for comment. And an Israeli strike hit tents in the courtyard of central Gaza’s main hospital, killing at least three people and wounding a local journalist, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said. It was the eighth Israeli attack on the compound since March. Israel says aid trucks reach northern Gaza The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said 11 aid trucks containing food, water and medical equipment reached the enclave's far north on Thursday. It's the first time any aid has reached there since Israel began a new military campaign last month. But not all the aid reached the agreed drop-off points, according to the the U.N. World Food Program. In the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, Israeli troops stopped one convoy bound for nearby Beit Lahiya and ordered the supplies to be offloaded, WFP spokesperson Alia Zaki said. Israel’s offensive has focused on Jabaliya, where Israel says Hamas had regrouped. Other areas affected include Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun just north of Gaza City. U.S. deadline is looming for Israel The aid announcement came days before a U.S. deadline demanding that Israel improve aid deliveries across Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, issued Thursday said there's a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza, the territory's most isolated area. COGAT rejected those findings and said the report relied 'on partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.' No emergency services functioning north of Gaza City The U.N. estimates that tens of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza. Earlier this week, the Health Ministry said there were no ambulances or emergency crews operating north of Gaza City. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to U.N. figures. More than a year of war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They don't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. 'It has been 400 days and the hostages are still in Gaza. There is a war without a direction. It’s so sad,' said Eial Tiskim, who attended the latest protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand a cease-fire deal. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Lee from Washington.

Trump names inaugural committee co-chair, rules out Haley and Pom...	Former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler will co-chair President-elect Trump’s inaugural committee alongside Steve Witkoff, Trump's campaign announced Saturday. The Republican leader said the committee will 'honor' his victory in the 2024 election. 'The Trump Vance Inaugural Committee will honor this magnificent victory in a celebration of the American People and our nation,' Trump said in a statement. 'This will be the kick-off to my administration, which will deliver on bold promises to Make America Great Again,' he added. 'Together, we will celebrate this moment, steeped on history and tradition, and then get to work to achieve the most incredible future for our people, restoring strength, success, and common sense to the Oval Office.' Trump resistance rises in states led by Democratic governors Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in 2019 by Gov. Brian Kemp (R) due to a resignation from former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). While in office, she was a staunch supporter of Trump and supported a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 election results but spoke out against the measure after the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The selections come after Trump tapped longtime senior advisor Susie Wilkes to serve as chief of staff. She will be the first woman in history hold the position. A guide to key figures in Donald Trump’s orbit On Truth Social, the incoming president also mentioned two people who won't be joining his administration: former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' the president-elect said in the Saturday post. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,' he continued. 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' While campaigning, Trump's opponents alleged he did not like to be 'challenged by women' and Trump received flack for telling people he’d protect the demographic whether they 'like it or not.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-names-inaugural-committee-co-chair-rules-out-haley-and-pompeo/	2024-11-09T16:59:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP21005187029238-e1694210693733.jpg?w=900
Jury convicts two men accused of plotting to kill Border Patrol a...	(NewsNation) — A jury in Missouri has convicted two men on a long list of charges stemming from their alleged conspiracy to murder U.S. Border Patrol agents, and for shooting at FBI agents when the two men were captured. The federal court jury in Jefferson City, Mo., on Thursday found Jonathan S. O’Dell, of Warsaw, Mo., and Bryan C. Perry, of Clarksville, Tenn., guilty in connection with what prosecutors said was a plan to recruit members to their group called the '2nd Amendment Militia' in 2022. American woman, 3 migrants charged with running Texas migrant stash house 'Perry posted a video on TikTok in which he discussed illegal immigrants coming into the United States from Mexico,' said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri. 'Perry stated that the U.S. Border Patrol was committing treason by allowing these illegal immigrants to enter the United States, and that the penalty for treason was death,' the statement added. In later posts, Perry said he was 'ready to go to war against this government,' and that 'we were going out huntin’'. On Oct. 7, 2022, the day before the men said they were going to travel to the border, FBI agents raided O’Dell’s home. After an exchange of gunfire, O’Dell and his girlfriend surrendered, but Perry aborted his apparent surrender and fought with agents who eventually subdued him. El Paso Sector sees people trying to cross border before Trump win Between their capture and their trial, O’Dell escaped from a county jail and was on the run for three days before being recaptured in Ray County, Mo. According to the U.S. Attorney’s statement, both Perry and O’Dell face mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum sentence would be life without parole. There is no word yet on when the two will be sentenced.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/militia-convicted-border-patrol-agents/	2024-11-09T14:39:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-57610138.jpg?w=822
FEMA employee fired for directing team to avoid homes with Trump ...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A FEMA employee was terminated over the weekend after reportedly advising her survivor assistance team not to go to Florida homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Donald Trump. In a statement sent out Saturday afternoon, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell confirmed that the employee had been fired, adding that her actions were 'reprehensible.' Judge agrees to pause Jan. 6 case after Trump’s election win 'This is a clear violation of FEMA's core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,' Criswell said. According to FEMA, the matter was referred to the Office of Special Counsel, and officials have been working to ensure similar acts do not happen again. The agency did not specify which neighborhoods in Florida were being canvassed by the employee's team. However, the incident comes as relief workers have been aiding those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in several parts of the state. 'I want to be clear to all of my employees and the American people, this type of behavior and action will not be tolerated at FEMA, and we will hold people accountable if they violate these standards of conduct,' Criswell added in her statement. Hurricanes, storms cost US $500 billion this year: Analysis FEMA did not provide any additional details on how officials were notified of the employee's actions, nor the exact circumstances surrounding the incident. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took to social media to comment following initial reports of the alleged misconduct. In a post on X, DeSantis said he had directed state officials to investigate the matter further. 'The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,' the governor wrote. 'At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government’s targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/fema-employee-fired-trump-sign/	2024-11-09T13:31:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/YardSignsHarrisTrumpGettyImages-2174737008-e1730401432832_4af2cd.jpg?w=800
Diddy files for bail for 4th time, judge rejects gag order reques...	(NewsNation) — The last 24 hours for Sean 'Diddy' Combs has been a period of denial, developments and details. Diddy's lawyers filed a fourth request for bail in a Manhattan federal court Friday, citing new evidence in his case on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Also on Friday, a judge rejected his 'unprecedented' gag order request, filed last month, that would bar victims and their lawyers from speaking publicly about the case. The rapper's attorneys claimed 'inflammatory extrajudicial statements' were impeding his right to a fair trial. But Judge Arun Subramanian contended implementing a gag order would violate the victims' free speech under the First Amendment. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline 'The unprecedented relief that Combs seeks on this motion is unwarranted,' the judge wrote in his ruling. One of the alleged victims' lawyers, Ariel Mitchell, has been granting interviews to NewsNation for several months, revealing shocking details about what happened to her client. Mitchell told NewsNation's 'Banfield' Thursday that her client, Courtney Burgess, was given 11 flash drives containing at least eight sex tapes involving eight celebrities. Diddy’s team 'is pissed, to say the least,' she said. Diddy’s lawyer: ‘Improper pretrial publicity’ preventing fair trial In September, Mitchell told NewsNation that another client of hers was contacted about the sale of one of the musician's alleged sex tapes. 'I can tell the video was pornographic. This was in his Atlanta home, and it does seem like the person isn’t looking into the video,' Mitchell said. To me, it doesn’t seem like that person knows they’re being videotaped.' 'These prospective witnesses and their lawyers have made numerous inflammatory extrajudicial statements aimed at assassinating Mr. Combs’s character in the press,' said Diddy's attorney Marc Agnifilo in the Oct. 20 motion. His lawyers have persistently requested the release of their client since his September arrest, proposing a $50 million bail package on four occasions. The previous three requests were denied. Diddy’s team ‘pissed’ about flash drive video claims: Lawyer In their fourth request, the proposed bail package updated its conditions, suggesting Diddy undergo 'strict 24/7 security monitoring' and 'near-total restrictions on Mr. Combs’ ability to contact individuals other than counsel' during at-home detention. This 'will reasonably assure the appearance of [Mr. Combs] as required and the safety of any other person and the community,' the motion said. It also calls the government's case 'thin.' The defense claims to have received 23.5 terabytes of new material that was unknown at the time of previous hearings. 'The new material demonstrates that the government previously misrepresented the weight of the evidence. And it undermines the government’s claim that Mr. Combs presents a danger,' the motion said.

US will appeal judge's ruling that 9/11 defendants can plead guil...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department will appeal a military judge's ruling that plea agreements struck by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and two of his co-defendants are valid, a defense official said Saturday. The ruling this past week voided Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's order to throw out the deals and concluded that the plea agreements were valid. The judge granted the three motions to enter guilty pleas and said he would schedule them for a future date to be determined by the military commission. The department will also seek a postponement of any hearing on the pleas, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss legal matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rear Adm. Aaron Rugh, the chief prosecutor, sent a letter Friday to the families of 9/11 victims informing them of the decision. The ruling by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, allowed the three 9/11 defendants to enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and would spare them the risk of the death penalty. The pleas by Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi would be a key step toward closing out the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense lawyers under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo had approved the agreements. But the deals were immediately slammed by Republican lawmakers and others when they were made public this summer. Within days, Austin issued an order saying he was nullifying them. He said plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary. The judge had ruled that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals. The agreements, and Austin’s attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants, given their torture in CIA custody. While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it is not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals. The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin’s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by 'clean teams' of FBI agents that did not involve violence.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-us-will-appeal-judges-ruling-that-9-11-defendants-can-plead-guilty-and-avoid-the-death-penalty/	2024-11-09T09:43:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672fa00ce1a564.94459298.jpeg?w=900
Biden, Trump to meet Wednesday at Oval Office: White House	(NewsNation)— Since Election Day, President-elect Donald Trump's phone has been ringing, and one of those calls was from President Joe Biden: an invitation to the Oval Office.

What a Trump administration could mean for education	(NewsNation) — 'Save American education' is one of President-elect Donald Trump's pillars to his approach in reforming the American school system. What does that look like? From changing Title IX to eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, Trump's proposed policies will affect the future of curriculum in public schools. Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here’s what he’s proposed Trump's main education policies In the early stages of the presidential race, Trump laid out 10 principles for his education policy plan. 'Rather than indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material, which is what we're doing now, our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world of work,' President Trump said in September 2023 address. He pledged to eliminate the Department of Education and to return school choice to the states. He vowed to 'restore' parental rights, meaning parents would know what their children are taught in the classroom, be able to openly communicate concerns with teachers and principals, protect children's privacy, be updated on acts of violence at schol, allow them to inspct professional development materials and be notified before an out-of-school guset speaks in class. They would also be able to review the budget and spending of the school, have the right to opt out of school healthcare services and be immediately notified if a teacher has 'worekd to change their children's name, pronouns or understanding of his or her gender.' Some of the proposed policies are already in place; parents can often have meetings with school staff, federal laws protect the privacy of children and schools notify parents through various channels of communication about violence or other concerning events that may occur. Trump also supports the election of principals by parents and will adjust increase or decrease funding to schools based on their policies. The future of the Department of Education Trump has voiced his desire to abolish the Department of Education since his first term in office. Under new proposed policies for his second term, Trump said he would remove 'the radicals who have infiltrated the federal Department of Education, and get to Congress reaffirm the president’s ability to remove recalcitrant employees from the job.' He also promised to cut federal funding for any school or program that pushes 'Critical Race Theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.' Critical race theory is defined as an academic field focused on the relationships between social conceptions of race and ethnicity, social and political laws and media. Trump said he would direct the DOE to open civil rights investigations into school districts engaging in 'race-based discrimination, including discrimination against Asian Americans.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security What will happen to Title IX? Keeping men out of women sports has been a pillar to Trump's and other Republicans' education policies. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funding. Transgender athletes are in jeopardy of being able to play in sports that are in line with their gender identity. For example, a transgender girl who wants to play on a girl's softball team would be required to play boys' baseball under Trump's policies, which violates Title IX under its current directions. Will student loans be forgiven under Trump? Student loan forgiveness was not a focus of the Trump campaign, unlike Biden's promise to cancel student loan repayment during his run for president. Trump largely has not addressed this topic, but some of his other policies, such as aboloshing the DOE, may impact student loans. What will Trump do on immigration, foreign policy? Trump's policies at a glance In summary, these are Trump's main education policies: Eliminate the Department of Education Cut federal funding for schools that promote critical race theory Bar transgender girls from playing in sports designated for boys Adjust funding for schools based on their policies 'Drastically' cut the number of school administrators including Diversity, Equity and Inclusion departments Adopt a 'Parental Bill of Rights' Implement a voting process to elect principals Allow parents to choose which public school their children attends Create a credentialing body to certify teachers Enhance discipline for students engaged in drug involvement Support concealed carry of weapons by teachers Protect the right to pray in schools Reinstate the 1776 Commission, which would adjust the history curriculum in schools	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-administration-education-policy/	2024-11-09T08:43:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24081507390710-e1719339224991.jpg?w=800
Your paycheck may be larger in 2025, even if you don't get a rais...	(NEXSTAR) — While there's plenty of time left in November, you may already have something exciting to look forward to in 2025: a slightly larger paycheck, even without a raise. Why? Thank the IRS. As it does every year, the agency recently announced roughly five dozen changes to various tax provisions that will impact 2025 (and when we file taxes in 2026). Among the notable changes were standard deductions rising by 2.7% and individual tax brackets shifting. Will you have a three-payday November? How to tell Like others before it, the IRS's changes are meant to combat inflation. They are, however, smaller than we saw in 2024 and much smaller than in 2023. Those changes may have an impact on your paycheck, putting more money in your pocket — unless you got a raise of more than 2.7%, then that will also give you a boost. IRS tax provision updates can help cut back on 'bracket creep,' which occurs when inflation moves you into a higher income tax bracket or reduces how beneficial credits, deductions, and exemptions are, according to the Tax Foundation. Say, for example, you are making $101,000 this year. You fall into the third tax bracket, meaning you're taxed 10% on the first $11,600 you earn; 12% on the chunk between $11,601 and $47,149; then 22% on what you earn between $47,150 and $100,524; and 24% on every dollar above that. IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? If you don't get a raise going into 2025, and remain at $101,000, you would not reach the 24% tax bracket. Instead, you would be taxed 10% on the first $11,925 you earn; 12% on the income between that threshold and $48,475; then 22% on the rest. (This is a simple example that did not take into account the standard deduction and other tax-related aspects.) If the brackets did not adjust, you would be stuck with a higher tax liability, despite your $101,000 salary having less buying power in 2025 because of inflation, the Tax Foundation explains. But, because the tax brackets are adjusting, you stand a chance of seeing less money withheld from your paycheck for federal taxes (your employer is able to calculate how much is withheld using your W2 and IRS documents). Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says Even though your paycheck may grow in 2025, financial experts say it's important to remember you aren't exactly receiving 'extra' funds — they are intended to offset inflation. Inflation is down slightly in 2024 to 2.4%, U.S. Labor Department data from the previous 12 months, ending in September, shows. That's an improvement over 2023's 3.4% and 6.5% in 2022.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/your-paycheck-may-be-larger-in-2025-even-if-you-dont-get-a-raise/	2024-11-09T08:15:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1164644813-e1704995059280.jpg?w=800
Hurricanes, storms cost US $500 billion this year: Analysis	(The Hill) - Hurricanes and tropical storms have caused economic losses of nearly $500 billion as they have ravaged the country this year, according to analysis by AccuWeather. Experts estimated that the economic loss and damage from Hurricane Beryl, which hit the Gulf Coast in July, was between $28 billion to 32 billion. Hurricane Debby, which hit the Carolinas hardest a month later, imposed some $28 billion in damages, while Hurricane Francine cost about $9 billion. But the biggest economic trauma was delivered by hurricanes Helene and Milton, which swept through the South in late September in October, according to the AccuWeather experts. Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of North Carolina, was estimated to have inflicted between $225 billion to $250 billion in total damage and economic loss — flooding homes, destroying roads, ripping up trees and leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power, in some cases for weeks. To assist the state’s population, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dished out more than $194 million to individuals and households in the Tar Heel State, according to the agency’s data released late last month. Hurricane Milton, which ripped through Florida in early October, has caused between $160 billion and $180 billion in economic loss and total damage so far, according to the analysis. The storm intensified quickly, tearing through communities, destroying homes and filling the streets with mud as more than 3 million people were without power at one point. 'Our hearts go out to everyone impacted this hurricane season. This has been an incredibly costly and destructive hurricane season,' said AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter. But he noted the pain is far from over. 'It will take years for many of these communities, families and small businesses to recover. It could take a decade or longer to recover in some of the towns hit hardest by Helene,' he said. 'Some communities may never fully recover from the catastrophic inland flash flooding we witnessed this year.' The analysis comes as job growth in the month of October stalled at 12,000, according to data released by the Labor Department earlier this month. Some large strikes impacted the figure, but impacts from hurricanes Helene and Milton also played a role as forecasters had projected that the country would add around 115,000 jobs. 'The business and tourism losses are adding up quickly. Our estimates also consider the long-term healthcare costs,' Porter said. 'Hurricanes can take a tremendous toll on the health and well-being of people who survived these storms and were exposed to hazardous flood waters, toxic mud and dust, as well as mold and mildew inside damaged homes and apartments.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/climate/hurricanes-storms-cost-us-500-billion-this-year-analysis/	2024-11-09T05:55:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24287115642437-e1731096285758.jpg?w=900
Democrats' election reckoning pits liberals against centrists	The Democrats’ shellacking at the polls this week has triggered a feisty battle between the ideological wings of the party about what went wrong — and who bears the blame. Some liberals say the party didn’t tack far enough to the left to animate the base. Many centrists say it tacked too far to the left and scared away moderate voters in key battleground states. And Democratic leaders are now faced with the difficulty of working to ease the tensions and ally the feuding factions in order to form a unified front against President-elect Trump as he prepares to enter the White House for his second term. 'It will be a big challenge,' said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), former chair of the House Democratic Caucus. The debate is hardly new. Democrats have repeatedly clashed over the party’s strategy after tough election cycles, and the battle lines are the same now as then, pitting liberals vs. moderates. But this year the stakes were higher. Heading into the polls this week, Democrats had warned that Trump was an existential threat to the nation’s democratic foundations, and their fight to keep him from regaining power was was framed as nothing less than an effort to rescue the republic and the institutions that sustain it. Following Trump’s runaway victory over Vice President Harris on Tuesday, the internal dispute over the party’s strategy, message and direction has taken on a new level of urgency and intensity. For some, the party’s woes revolve around mis-messaging on kitchen-table economic issues, like inflation, wages and the accelerating trend of wealth inequality. For others, the trouble stems from the explosive debate over the Israel-Hamas war. For still others, the problems relate to culture war battles, including that over transgender rights. Whatever the issue, Tuesday’s election results — and the subsequent reckoning that’s shaking the Democrats — is sure to consume all the oxygen in the party for some time to come as leaders, lawmakers, donors and strategists sift through the ashes in search of answers for why so many voters left them for Trump this year. The early stages of that process are spilling into public view. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a liberal icon who has built a career around issues of economic justice, made waves this week when he said there was 'no great surprise' that working class voters had fled the Democrats because the party establishment had 'abandoned' them in favor of moneyed interests. 'The American people are angry and want change. And they’re right,' he said. Moderates countered that it was, in fact, the progressive movement that had doomed Harris and the Democrats on Election Day. Many of them singled out the issue of transgender rights as the culprit — an issue the Trump campaign had put under a bright spotlight with tens of millions of dollars in spending on late-campaign, anti-trans ads. Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who won by 2 points this week in a battleground Long Island district, told The New York Times that the Democrats are struggling because they are 'pandering to the far left.' 'I don’t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don’t think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports,' he said. Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) told CNN's Kasie Hunt that 'there are folks on the far left who alienate a ton of people,' pointing to the transgender debate as an example. And Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) echoed those warnings, telling the Times that Democrats are too concerned about offending the transgender community at the expense of addressing 'the challenges many Americans face.' 'I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,' Moulton told the Times. The comments sparked some pushback from other Democrats on Capitol Hill, who accused the culture war critics of scapegoating. 'The Democratic Party needs to do some serious introspection to understand what went wrong and why our message isn’t resonating or reaching people,' Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) posted on social platform X. 'But one thing’s for sure — blaming trans kids isn’t the answer.' Other lawmakers noted that virtually no Democrats had focused their campaigns on the transgender issue this cycle. It was Republicans, they said, who exaggerated the Democrats’ support for trans rights in order to sow division and win votes. 'That's the problem. The Republicans created this strawman and then beat the shit out of it,' a Democratic lawmaker said. 'I just don't think any Democrats I know were out there rooting for biological boys to compete with biological girls in high school sports. This is just not something that we were talking about or prioritizing. But to hear Republicans, that was like our whole agenda. 'Trump, literally, was telling people that your child is going to come home from school one day with a gender reassignment.' Democrats are hardly the only party facing internal divisions. Since House Republicans took control of the lower chamber last year, their time in power has been practically defined by clashes between far-right conservatives, many of them in the Freedom Caucus, and party leaders and their more moderate allies. The divisions have prevented GOP leaders from passing even the most basic legislation, like bills to fund the federal government, without significant Democratic support. In the midst of their internal policy fights, Republicans toppled a sitting Speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), for the first time in the nation's history and expelled another member of their conference, former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), over corruption allegations that are expected to land him in prison early next year. Still, for all the chaos, Republicans were able to flip control of the Senate and White House, and they have the edge in the battle for the House, although it remains too close to call as the last ballots are counted and the last races are formalized. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a centrist Washington Democrat representing a Trump-won district, is leading in her race for a second term. She told the Times this week that her party is struggling because too many lawmakers fail to grasp the hardships facing working class voters — and talk down to them as a result. 'No one is listening to anything else you say if you try to talk them out of their lived experiences with data points from some economists,' she told the Times. As Congress prepares to return to Washington next week, Larson emphasized the difficulty facing Democrats as they seek to be a welcoming 'big-tent' party that can appeal to a broad array of voters without offending others. He warned against abandoning party values in the quest for that broader appeal, but acknowledged that the message probably needs some work. 'In the case of all 435 districts, you're going to hear different things — both culturally, and also in terms of economics,' he said. 'It doesn't mean you abandon the ideas and the sense of equality for all Americans. But there are perhaps better ways to state it, and show it, and demonstrate it, instead of having it perceived by the other side that this is all that we stand for.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-election-reckoning-pits-liberals-against-centrists/	2024-11-09T05:46:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/supporters_harris_110424gn03_w.jpg?w=900
North Korean GPS manipulation disrupted dozens of planes and vess...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said North Korea disrupted GPS signals from border areas for the second-straight day on Saturday, affecting an unspecified number of flights and vessel operations. Tensions between the rival Koreas have escalated as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program and engages in electronic and psychological warfare, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash and anti-South Korean propaganda leaflets in the South. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels. While warning aircraft and vessels near western border areas, South Korea’s military did not specify how North Korea was interfering with GPS signals or detail the extent of disruptions. 'We urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,' the South’s joint chiefs said in a statement. North Korea’s GPS signal disruptions and balloon campaigns highlight the vulnerability of South Korea’s Incheon International Airport, its main transportation gateway, analyst Sukjoon Yoon recently wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website. The airport, which carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo annually, is less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from North Korea. 'No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety,' Yoon wrote. He said that in 2024, North Korean trash balloons halted the airport’s runway operations 12 different times for a total of 265 minutes. Kim has shown more hostility this year toward Seoul’s conservative government — which maintains a hard line on Pyongyang — with the North abandoning its long-standing goals of reconciliation with its war-divided rival and rewriting its constitution to cement South Korea as a permanent adversary. North Korea also blew up sections of its unused road and rail routes linked with the South in October in a symbolic display of anger toward Seoul, and opened November with a flight-test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile to dial up pressure on Washington. South Korean officials say North Korean activities to disrupt GPS signals from western border regions increased as the country began launching trash-carrying balloons toward the South in late May, which the North described as a retaliation against South Korean civilian activists flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Aside from North Korea’s weapons demonstrations and non-conventional provocations, there’s growing concern over its reported provision of military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. South Korean officials say the deepening military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang could possibly result in Russian technology transfers that increases the threat posed by Kim’s military nuclear program.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-north-korean-gps-manipulation-disrupted-dozens-of-planes-and-vessels-south-korea-says/	2024-11-08T20:50:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672edb3214a837.35204222.jpeg?w=900

Dr. Mark Hyman: RFK Jr. on Trump Cabinet could improve health car...	(NewsNation) — A prominent physician and wellness expert says President-elect Donald Trump's expected health care appointee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., could help address what he calls 'the greatest epidemic of chronic disease in the history of humanity.' Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and chief medical officer of Function Health, said Friday that chronic disease transcends political divisions and requires urgent national attention. 'Six in 10 of us have chronic illness. Fifty-one percent of children have some type of chronic illness, including obesity,' Hyman said on NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' RFK Jr. wants to remove fluoride from water systems: What is it? The doctor emphasized that recent years have seen dramatic increases in various conditions, citing a 50% rise in heart disease, 30% increase in cancer and 150% surge in Alzheimer's cases alongside a 200-300% increase in pharmaceutical use. While acknowledging concerns about Kennedy, who is not a doctor and has expressed controversial medical opinions, Hyman argued for systemic changes to America's food and health policies. He criticized the current system, noting that 'ultra-processed food is the No. 1 killer in the world' and claiming it causes 11 million global deaths annually. Kennedy has been openly angling for a lead position in one of several public health agencies, hoping to make his 'Make America Healthy Again' platform a reality, especially around immunizations. How much of the vote did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receive? The former presidential candidate said Wednesday there are 'entire departments' within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that 'have to go.' 'In some categories … there are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA … that have to go, that are not doing their job. They’re not protecting our kids,' Kennedy said during an interview on MSNBC. Kennedy allies and members of Trump’s close circle have started discussing a variety of places for the former independent candidate to have influence in a second Trump term, most recently around vaccine data, and are even floating workarounds to the confirmation process on Capitol Hill if he faces pushback. However, many public health experts have expressed opposition and are growing increasingly alarmed at the prospect of Kennedy holding any kind of senior position with influence over the U.S. health system. Some have sought to draw attention to his more controversial claims about the science of vaccinations and an unverified link between children, autism and shots as well as his founding of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? Another leading health expert, Georges Benjamin, who serves as executive director of the American Public Health Association, said people in the public listen to Kennedy, even if he has no credibility in the public health sector. Amplifying Kennedy’s voice could lead to distrust of scientific experts and undermine important messaging. Kennedy became particularly critical about vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, when over 1.1 million people died, according to U.S. health records, and partisan fights broke out over things like mask requirements and vaccine mandates in the workplace and public. 'I’m not going to take away anybody’s vaccines,' Kennedy told NBC News when asked whether there were specific vaccines that Kennedy would want to remove from the market. When asked if he would eliminate any health agencies, Kennedy told MSNBC, 'To eliminate the agencies, as long as it requires congressional approval, I wouldn’t be doing that.' 'I can get the corruption out of the agencies,' he added. Ozempic can lead to muscle mass loss: Study Dr. Mark Hyman says Ozempic is not the solution Addressing the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic, Hyman cautioned against viewing it as a comprehensive solution to America's health crisis. He estimated that providing such medications to all overweight Americans would cost approximately $5.1 trillion, arguing instead for dietary and systemic changes to the nation's food system. 'The problem is we live in a toxic food environment where the bad choice is the easy choice, and the healthy choice is the hard choice,' Hyman said. 'That needs to stop, and that can be stopped with policy.'

'We’ve applied safety measures to ChatGPT to refuse requests to generate images of real people, including politicians,' the company wrote. 'These guardrails are especially important in an elections context and are a key part of our broader efforts to prevent our tools being used for deceptive or harmful purposes.' Meta rolls out new feature in hopes of protecting users Instead, ChaptGPT directed election related questions to CanIVote.org through a partnership with the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) in an effort to remain politically neutral. The platform is directing inquiries about the election results to news outlets like the Associated Press and Reuters. In recent weeks, OpenAI had to ban a foreign influence operation known as Storm-2035 which was pushing out influential Iranian political content.

Amsterdam violence against Jews ‘horrifying’: US diplomat	Warning: This video contains images of violence some may find disturbing. (NewsNation) — The top U.S. government antisemitism watchdog said she is horrified by Thursday night’s violence in Amsterdam in which roving gangs attacked people leaving a soccer match involving a team from Tel Aviv. 'There seemed to be a serious breach of security and response,' said Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, the U.S. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism. Lipstadt told NewsNation’s 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that while Amsterdam authorities appeared to do very little during the violence, they are now taking it 'very seriously.' 'Today, the Dutch government is responding strongly,' she said. Racist text messages sent to Black Americans may be from Poland Lipstadt would not directly compare the violence to the infamous Kristallnacht, the November nights in 1938 in which Nazis targeted Jews in several cities in Germany and Austria. That, she said, was government-organized terror. 'It (the Amsterdam violence) was a pogrom, but not in the sense of it being government-organized. I think we have to make that distinction,' Lipstadt added. Antisemitic attacks have been increasing for some time, she said, but they have been 'surging' since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israelis. Australia’s prime minister proposes social media age restriction 'This has been going on in many places, including the United States. We’ve seen it in London. We’ve seen it in Berlin. We’ve seen it in many places. The protestors feel that it’s open season and that nothing is going to happen to them. Unless there is consequences — unless there is enforcement — not only is this going to continuem but it’s going to get worse,' Lipstadt said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/amsterdam-violence-jews-us-diplomat/	2024-11-08T16:38:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ams.png?w=652
GOP inches closer to retaining House majority	Control of the House has yet to be determined, as a number of critical races remain too close to call, leaving lawmakers — and voters — waiting to see which party will hold the majority next year. The sprint to 218 seats, however, is nearing the final stretch, after a handful of additional races were called in the days following election night. Republicans had secured 216 seats in the lower chamber as of Friday morning, with Democrats trailing at 204 seats, according to Decision Desk HQ. A total of 15 races have not yet been called: Democrats are leading in eight of the contests, while GOP candidates are ahead in the other seven. Republicans, nonetheless, are wasting no time in claiming victory even as the final tally remains unclear. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said the House is poised to remain in GOP hands, and he has already launched his bid to retain hold of the gavel. Democrats, meanwhile, are holding out hope that they could eke out a razor-thin majority. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Thursday it 'has yet to be decided who will control' the House next year, pointing to ongoing ballot counting in Oregon, Arizona and California. Several competitive House races have been called in the past couple days, including Rep. David Schweikert's (R) reelection in Arizona's 1st Congressional District; Rep. David Valadao's (R) reelection in California's 22nd Congressional District; April McClain Delaney's (D) election in Maryland's 6th Congressional District; Rep. Andrea Salinas's (D) reelection in Oregon's 6th Congressional District; Rep. Julia Brownley's (D) reelection in California's 26th Congressional District; and Rep. Linda Sánchez's (D) reelection in California 38th Congressional District. Here are the uncalled races to watch in the quest for control of the House. California’s 21st Congressional District Rep. Jim Costa (D) is fighting for his political life in California’s 21st Congressional District in a race that surprisingly emerged as a nail-biter this cycle. Costa, a 10-term lawmaker, was leading Republican Michael Maher, a former FBI agent, by 1.1 percentage points — or 1,476 votes — at the time of publication, according to Decision Desk HQ, with 62.7 percent of the vote in. The race was never expected to be close. The district broke for President Biden by 20.3 percentage points in 2020, and Cook Political Report rated the seat 'solid Democrat.' A victory by Maher would flip the district red. The current margin contrasts with that from 2022, when Maher challenged Costa for the seat and lost by 8.4 percentage points. California’s 9th Congressional District Rep. Josh Harder (D) is locked in a tight race against Stockton Mayor Kevin Lincoln (R) in California’s 9th Congressional District, a contest that is threatening to end the incumbent’s tenure on Capitol Hill. Harder, who was first elected to the House in 2018, was leading Lincoln by 1.4 percentage points at the time of publication, with 56 percent of the vote reported. A victory by Lincoln, who has served as mayor of Stockton since 2021, would be a boon for Republicans: Biden won the district by 12.6 percentage points in 2020, making the district reliably blue. Cook Political Report had rated the district 'likely Democrat.' California’s 47th Congressional District The race to succeed outgoing Rep. Katie Porter (D) in California’s 47th Congressional District is coming down to the wire, with Republican Scott Baugh, a former Assembly member, and Democratic state Sen. Dave Min running neck and neck for the seat. Baugh, who previously served as the state's Assembly minority leader and Orange County GOP chair, was leading Min by 0.2 percentage points — or 616 votes — as of publication, with 78.7 percent of ballots reported. A Baugh victory would flip the seat red and mark the first time the district has a GOP representative since 2003. Biden won the district by 11.1 percentage points in 2020; Cook Political Report rated the district 'lean Democrat.' Porter opted against running for reelection to vie for the Golden State’s Senate seat, which opened up after Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) died last year. Sen. Laphonza Butler (D) is temporarily filling the seat but elected not to run for a full term. Porter, though, lost to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) in the Democratic primary. Alaska’s at-large Congressional District Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola (D) is fighting for political survival in Alaska’s at-large Congressional District, where she is currently trailing Republican entrepreneur Nick Begich in the ranked-choice-voting state. Begich was leading Peltola 49.6 percent to 45.5 percent with 74 percent of the vote in at the time of publication. Alaskan Independence Party candidate John Howe secured 3.9 percent, and Democrat Eric Hafner pulled in 1 percent. The lone Alaska district is one of a handful that President-elect Trump won in 2020, making it a key pickup target for Republicans. That year, Trump beat Biden in the state by 10.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' Arizona’s 6th Congressional District The race in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District has become as close as it can be. Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), a first-term lawmaker, was leading former Democratic state lawmaker Kirsten Engel by just 435 votes — or 0.1 percentage points — with 82 percent of ballots tallied. The district is as purple as any can get: In 2020, Biden won the area by 0.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' The race is a rematch from last cycle, when Ciscomani narrowly edged out Engel by 1.4 percentage points. California’s 13th Congressional District Rep. John Duarte (R) is leading former Democratic state Assembly member Adam Gray in California’s 13th Congressional District, but the closely watched race remains uncalled. With 58.4 percent of the vote in, Duarte — a first-term lawmaker — was ahead of Gray by 2.3 percentage points. The race has been one of the most closely watched contests this cycle, with Democrats hoping to pick off Duarte in the district after it broke for Biden by 10.9 percentage points in 2020 — a feat the party failed to achieve in 2022. That year, Duarte beat Gray by 0.42 percentage points — just 564 votes. Cook Political Report rated this year’s race a 'toss up.' California’s 27th Congressional District Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) is slightly ahead in his race against Democrat George Whitesides, the former Virgin Galactic CEO who also served as NASA chief of staff during the Obama administration — but the numbers are tight. Garcia is leading Whitesides by 1.4 percentage points — or 3,240 votes — with 76.1 percent of the vote in. A win by Garcia would let out a sigh of relief among Republicans, who were under pressure to defend the seat amid a strong Democratic effort. Democrats consider the district a top pickup opportunity, citing the fact that it broke for Biden by 12.4 percentage points in 2020. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' California’s 41st Congressional District Rep. Ken Calvert (R) is fighting tooth and nail to hold his seat in California’s 41st Congressional District. Calvert — a 30-plus year veteran of the House who is a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee — was leading Democrat Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, by 3 percentage points with 71.2 percent of the vote in. The district has emerged as a key battleground. In 2020, it broke for Trump by 1.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated this year’s race a 'toss up.' Calvert is currently running ahead by a smaller margin than his victory against Rollins in 2022. That year, he beat the GOP challenger by 4.6 percentage points. Colorado’s 8th Congressional District Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D) is hanging on in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District by a slim margin against Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans. Caraveo, a first-term lawmaker, led Evans by 0.4 percentage points — or 1,321 ballots — with 85.5 percent of the vote in. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.' Oregon’s 5th Congressional District Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R) is in danger of being defeated in Oregon’s 5th Congressional District, where Democratic state Rep. Janelle Bynum is leading the incumbent. Bynum was ahead of Chavez-DeRemer by 2.5 percentage points with 84.4 percent of the vote in. Independent Brett Smith earned 4.6 percent of the vote, Libertarian Sonja Feintech notched 1.5 percent, and Andrea Townsend secured 1 percent. A Bynum victory would flip the district blue in a huge success for Democrats, who zeroed in on the area after it broke for Biden in 2020. Chavez-DeRemer was one of the most vulnerable Republicans on the ballot this cycle. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.' Washington’s 3rd Congressional District Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) looked poised to squeak out a victory against Republican Joe Kent, staying on despite being one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection this cycle. Gluesenkamp Perez, a first-term lawmaker, was leading Joe Kent, a retired Green Beret backed by Trump, by 3.1 percentage points with 94.5 percent of the vote in. Republicans had their eyes on the district after it broke for Trump by roughly 4 percentage points in 2020. In 2022, however, Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Kent by 0.82 percentage points. This year’s race was rated a 'toss up' by Cook Political Report. California’s 49th Congressional District Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) is close to securing another two years in Congress, though the race has not yet been called as more ballots are counted. Levin, a three-term lawmaker, was leading Republican business owner Matt Gunderson by 2.2 percentage points as of publication time, with 77.4 percent of the vote accounted for. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'lean Democrat,' which sits in a district that Biden won by 11.4 percentage points in 2020. California’s 6th Congressional District Rep. Ami Bera (D) is poised to win another term representing California’s 6th Congressional District, as he is leading Republican Christine Bish by a healthy margin. With 45 percent of the vote in, Bera, a six-term lawmaker, was leading Bish, a small business owner, by 13.7 percentage points, though the race had not yet been called by Decision Desk HQ. California’s 39th Congressional District Rep. Mark Takano (D) is likely to win another term on Capitol Hill, though votes are still being tallied in California’s 39th Congressional District. As of Thursday evening, Takano led Republican business owner David Serpa by 10.6 percentage points with 60.8 percent of the vote reported. California’s 45th Congressional District Rep. Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) has a healthy lead against Democrat Derek Tran, though the race has not yet been called. With 74.7 percent of the vote in, Steel, a two-term lawmaker, was ahead of Tran, a consumer rights attorney, by 3.8 percentage points. The district is one of the 17 areas Biden won in 2020 that are currently represented by a Republican, making it a top pickup target for Democrats. Biden won the area, which includes Orange and Los Angeles counties, by 6.1 percentage points in 2020. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/gop-inches-closer-to-retaining-house-majority/	2024-11-08T16:19:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GOP_061824_Photo_GregNash.png?w=900
Kristi Noem: Democratic governors should work with Donald Trump	(NewsNation) — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that Democratic governors who have pledged to resist President-elect Donald Trump's immigration policies are being 'extremely irresponsible' and should instead seek dialogue with the incoming administration. 'If I had a new president in the White House, and even if he wasn't from my political party, the first thing I would do would be call him up and see if I could get a meeting,' Noem said on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' The Republican governor, who is reportedly being considered for interior secretary in Trump's cabinet, dismissed early opposition from Democratic governors like Illinois' JB Pritzker and California's Gavin Newsom as 'not a mature response' to Trump's election victory. Judge agrees to pause Jan. 6 case after Trump’s election win Newsom, a fierce critic of Trump, called on lawmakers Thursday to convene a special session later this year to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration ahead of another Trump presidency. The move — a day after the former president defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race — effectively reignited California’s resistance campaign against conservative policies that state Democratic leaders started during the first Trump administration. The move is also part of a growing discussion among Democratic state officials across the country seeking to protect policies that face threats under Trump’s leadership. Kristi Noem on interior secretary rumors: 'I will help Trump however I can' Regarding her own potential cabinet position, Noem deflected questions about reports she's being considered to lead the Interior Department, saying only that 'the only person who will make that decision is President Trump' while noting she 'love[s] being governor of South Dakota.' Charges brought in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Trump The governor also expressed support for the Justice Department's decision to suspend investigations into Trump, saying it was 'a good first step' toward restoring faith in federal law enforcement agencies. She said Trump had assured her he did not plan to pursue political prosecutions once he was in office. 'Trump ally and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is a possibility for Interior Secretary, according to a person familiar with the matter,' a Wall Street Journal story published Thursday that looked at a variety of potential cabinet appointments said. She was the only one mentioned for the Interior Department slot. If chosen and confirmed, Noem would replace the Biden administration’s Interior secretary, Deb Haaland, who, according to the department’s website, 'made history when she became the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary. She is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a 35th-generation New Mexican.' Among the U.S. Department of Interior’s official responsibilities are federal relationships with tribal governments, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Indian Education. Who is Susie Wiles, Trump’s WH chief of staff? Noem, as governor, has faced ups and downs with tribal governments in South Dakota. She offered emergency assistance after flooding in 2019, moved the state Office of Indian Education from the state Department of Education to the state Department of Tribal Affairs, has been banned from many of the nine reservations at different times and shifted funding so the state’s law enforcement training program could conduct the first-ever class for tribal officers this year. Trump’s little-noticed campaign promise to shift thousands of federal employees who are in Washington, D.C., to ‘patriot-led states’ also points to a potential gain for South Dakota. Trump has won South Dakota all three times in his presidential bids. On Tuesday, he received 272,000 votes vs. 146,837 for Harris. That 63% was slightly more than the 62% Trump received from South Dakota voters in 2020 and 2016.

Who is Susie Wiles, Trump's WH chief of staff?	(NewsNation) — Trump has selected Susie Wiles — a longtime Republican strategist and the leader of president-elect's 2024 campaign — as his chief of staff. The announcement makes Wiles the first woman to fill the role. It comes about two weeks after Wiles fired back at billionaire Mark Cuban, who claimed Trump doesn’t typically surround himself with 'strong, intelligent women.' Harris loss: Democrats ask what went wrong 'I’m told @mcuban needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump,' Wiles wrote on X — her first post in about two years. 'Well, here we are! I’ve been proud to lead this campaign. Complimented by @Linda_McMahon ,Chair for Transition Policy and @LaraLeaTrump, RNC Co-Chair.' The account Wiles posted from no longer appeared active as of early Friday afternoon. Who is Susie Wiles? Wiles, 67, is a longtime Republican strategist and the leader of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. She also worked alongside Trump in 2016. Some lawmakers describe Wiles as someone who can handle egos and strong opinions. Her political career spans several decades and began as a scheduler for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. GREENSBORO, NC - June 10 : Susie Wiles stands by as former president Donald Trump speaks to staff and reporters aboard his airplane, known as 'Trump Force One,' as he travels home after speaking in GA to NC on Saturday, June 10, 2023, in Greensboro, NC. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Although she’s now in the limelight for her association with Trump, Wiles has worked with politicians who tout more moderate views, Reuters reported. She’s also worked for Trump allies such as Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Wiles was pivotal to DeSantis’ success in Florida’s 2018 gubernatorial race. DeSantis dismissed her after his win, leading Wiles to join Trump’s orbit and help the now-president-elect defeat DeSantis in the Republican primary election. Her relationship with Trump Wiles has a reputation for remaining loyal to Trump. She’s considered a trusted adviser who can help manage the president-elect and his impulses. Some have joked that Wiles is the only person Trump listens to. 'Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected,' Trump said. 'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.'

No two relationships between a president and their chief of staff are identical, but chiefs often become integral members of the president’s inner circle of advisors, according to the Chief of Staff Association. They may also be tapped to stand in for the president to negotiate with Congress, speak to the media or meet with constituency groups.

Infighting, finger-pointing: Dems look inward after shellacking	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Democrats are still reeling from their Election Day loss, trying to figure out where it all went wrong and where the party goes from here, leading to infighting, finger-pointing and Monday morning quarterbacking. Team Biden advisers are pointing the finger at Team Harris advisers and vice-versa, going from blaming President Biden for running at all, to Vice President Harris for how the campaign was run. According to Axios, there was an all staff call Thursday evening where leaders pleaded with staffers not to talk to reporters. Harris, who was on the call, and told staffers, 'This sucks, and there's also so much good that has come from come of this.' One staffer reportedly said the message was detached from reality of what happened, saying, 'We are told the fate of democracy is at stake. And then the message was, we'll get them next time.' Justice Department brings charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Trump Biden will leave office after leading the United States out of the worst pandemic in a century, galvanizing international support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion and passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will affect communities for years to come. But having run four years ago against Trump to 'restore the soul of the country,' Biden will make way after just one term for his immediate predecessor, who overcame two impeachments, a felony conviction and an insurrection launched by his supporters. Trump has pledged to radically reshape the federal government and roll back many of Biden's priorities. Only about 4 in 10 voters in the 2024 presidential election approved of how Biden handled his job as president, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Roughly 6 in 10 disapproved, and Donald Trump won a strong majority of those voters who were dissatisfied with Biden. Some high-ranking Democrats, including three advisers to the Harris campaign, expressed deep frustration with Biden for failing to recognize earlier in the election cycle that he was not up to the challenge. The advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Thune urges Trump to stay out of race to replace McConnell Biden, 81, ended his reelection campaign in July, weeks after an abysmal debate performance sent his party into a spiral and raised questions about whether he still had the mental acuity and stamina to serve as a credible nominee. But polling long beforehand showed that many Americans worried about his age. Some 77% of Americans said in August 2023 that Biden was too old to be effective for four more years, according to a poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs. The president bowed out on July 21 after getting not-so-subtle nudges from Democratic Party powers, including former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Biden endorsed Harris and handed over his campaign operation to her.

Jack Smith asks for pause in Jan. 6 case after Trump's election w...	(NewsNation) — Special counsel Jack Smith asked the federal judge in the Jan. 6 case against President-elect Donald Trump to pause any further proceedings while the Department of Justice considers its next steps after he won the 2024 election. 'As a result of the election held on Nov. 5, 2024, the defendant is expected to be certified as President-elect on Jan. 6, 2025, and inaugurated on Jan.20, 2025,' a filing from Smith said. 'The Government respectfully requests that the Court vacate the remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.' Smith said he will give an update to the court on the status of these deliberations by Dec. 2. Smith charged Trump with four felonies, accusing him of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election results. Trump has pleaded not guilty.

Justice Department brings charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with assassinating the Republican president-elect. Investigators learned of the plot to kill Trump while interviewing Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national identified by officials as an Iranian government asset who was deported from the U.S. after being imprisoned on robbery charges. He told investigators that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to put together a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan. Two other men who the authorities say were recruited to participate in other assassinations, including a prominent Iranian American journalist, were also arrested Friday. Shakeri remains in Iran.

The plot, with the charges unsealed just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, reflects what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil.

Thune urges Trump to stay out of race to replace McConnell	Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) is urging President-elect Trump not to put his thumb on the scale in the race to elect a successor to outgoing Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), putting a new wrinkle in the high-stakes contest. Thune in recent days has declared his preference that Trump give Republican senators space to make their own decision about who should lead the new Senate GOP majority, arguing it would be in Trump’s 'best interests' to stay neutral. That argument has been echoed by Thune’s allies, such as Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who told CNN earlier this week that Trump should 'stay out of the race.' Thune’s comments are creating a stir among Senate insiders two days after Trump won a resounding victory over Vice President Harris and helped Republicans regain the Senate majority. Allies of Thune’s two rivals in the leadership race, Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), say that calls for Trump to stay out of the leadership race indicate that Thune is nervous that the president-elect would endorse either Cornyn or Scott — which would be a serious setback. 'He’s terrified. He knows that Trump won’t endorse him. If he knows that, then Trump getting involved hurts him,' a Senate Republican aide said. Thune’s rivals have a better relationship with Trump, especially Scott, who’s the closest to the president-elect of the three. Scott represents Trump’s adopted home state of Florida, and as National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman traveled to Mar-a-Lago in April of 2021, when Trump was still something of a pariah among GOP senators, to give him a 'Champion of Freedom' award. Scott was later challenged about it in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, who asked if he was endorsing Trump’s 'lies' about the 2020 election. Trump on Thursday named Susie Wiles, who ran Scott's first campaign for governor in 2010, as his White House chief of staff. She served as his presidential campaign manager. He was also the first senator to travel to New York to attend Trump’s criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records. Scott and his allies are hoping that Trump will weigh in strongly on his behalf in the leadership race. Without Trump’s enthusiastic endorsement, he probably does not have a viable path to becoming majority leader, Senate Republican sources say. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has endorsed Scott, called on Trump Thursday to intervene in the leadership race. 'Jesse, if you’ve got any influence with President Trump, ask President Trump to come out publicly and say he wants to work with someone as accomplished as Rick Scott to accomplish his agenda,' Johnson asked conservative podcast host Jesse Kelly in an interview. Cornyn, who served as Senate GOP whip during Trump’s first two years in the White House, doesn’t have as good a relationship with Trump as Scott but his supporters argue he’s closer to the president-elect than Thune. Cornyn spent time with Trump in recent weeks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, and a meeting in Austin, Texas. He was also a special guest at fundraisers for the Trump-Vance campaign in Laredo, San Antonio and Houston in August. The Texas fundraising swing raised 'well into the seven figures' for the Trump campaign, according to a source familiar with Cornyn’s political operation. Cornyn has reminded Trump of their accomplishments working together when he served as the No. 2-ranking Republican in 2017 and 2018, including passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and confirming conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 'As I told President Trump, I’m interested in getting the band back together again,' Cornyn told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. Thune has had rockier relationship with Trump in the past. It hit a low point after Thune opposed an effort to object to the certification of electoral votes for Joe Biden after the 2020 election. Trump got so made about Thune’s pledge to defeat objections to Arizona’s and Pennsylvania’s electoral slates four years ago that he called for the amiable South Dakota Republican to face a primary challenger in 2022. 'South Dakota doesn’t like weakness,' Trump tweeted in December of 2020. 'He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!' Thune, nevertheless, cruised to an easy reelection. Thune has since tried to mend fences with Trump. He visited the president-elect at his Mar-a-Lago home in March and spoke to him on the phone Wednesday. The No. 2-ranking Senate GOP leader has pledged to work closely with Trump to pass his legislative agenda in 2025 and 2026 if he is elected to become the next Senate majority leader. But he advised Trump on Wednesday to let Senate Republicans make their own decision about who should lead the conference next year, defending what Republican senators have long viewed as their prerogative to run their own conference. 'I’m staying in regular contact with him and with his team and, obviously, if he wants to, he could exert a considerable amount of influence on that but, honestly, I think my preference would be and I think it’s probably in his best interest to stay out of [the race,]' Thune told CNBC’s Joe Kernen. 'These Senate secret-ballot elections are probably best left to the senators and he’s got to work with all of us when it’s all said and done,' he said. Thune made similar comments in a Fox News interview, acknowledging that Trump could swing the race one way or another. 'The president obviously has tremendous influence if he chooses to use it. I think in leadership elections, particularly in the Senate … it is a very sort of inside baseball thing,' he said, arguing that Senate Republicans will be able to find the right person for the job without outside influence. 'I think if he lets it play out, we'll get the right person. I've had conversations with him and have told him that we want to get his team in place so that he can hit the ground running and get to work on an agenda to make sure that he and our team succeeds,' he said. The last time a president played a major role in picking a Senate majority leader was in late 2002. Sen. Bill Frist’s (R-Tenn.) close relationship with then-President President George W. Bush was a big reason why he was elected to succeed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who resigned from the leadership after making controversial remarks at late-Sen. Strom Thurmond’s (R-S.C.) 100th birthday party. Frist had previously served as NRSC chairman but he didn’t work his way up the leadership ranks as other GOP leaders have done, and his management style as well as his deference to the Bush administration rankled some GOP senators.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/thune-urges-trump-to-stay-out-of-race-to-replace-mcconnell/	2024-11-08T09:06:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/thunejohn_070924gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Baja officials brace for 'elevated' deportations under Trump	SAN DIEGO (Border Report) -- Officials in Baja California expect a high increase in the number of deportations by the U.S. government once Donald Trump returns to office. Throughout the campaign, Trump promised to deport large numbers of migrants should he regain the presidency. Trump’s return to White House sets stage for far-reaching immigration crackdown 'Every time there are changes in the United States, it directly impacts us especially when people are being returned,' said Jorge Rivera Manzo, director of governmental migrant affairs with the state.. 'Some will go directly back to their countries, others will arrive in Mexico depending on agreements made with each country, but we are getting ready for elevated returns.' Rivera Manzo stated that right now, shelters are relatively quiet with 60% vacancy rates in Tijuana and 70% in Mexicali. Migrants urged to get legal aid as Trump promises mass deportations José María García Lara, who is in charge of a shelter called Movimiento Juventud 2000, said he is worried about the expected migrant traffic in the city with people deported through Tijuana as a result of Tuesday's election. 'When people are waiting for asylum, hoping the United States will help, it leads to a lot of uncertainty among the migrants we have here at the shelter,' he said. One of those migrants, Emir Garcia, says they are here out of necessity and not by choice. She remains hopeful Trump will decide to help the migrants. Texas’ border takeover a factor in migrant, US citizen deaths, activists say 'We're all afraid, all the migrants, we need his help,' Garcia said. 'We know he has to take care of his country, but he also needs to help others around the world.' Lucia Chique with her two children at the Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana. (Jorge Nieto/Special for Border Report) Others like Lucia Chique, from Mexico, aren't expecting much from the incoming Trump administration. 'Donald Trump doesn't want us, he doesn't want Latinos, he doesn't want Mexicans,' she said. 'There are going to be a lot of deportations of those seeking asylum, it's going to get very complicated.' Chique also worries the CBP One app, which helps migrants land appointments to lawfully cross the border and ask for asylum, will be discontinued once Trump takes over. Right now, the app is providing 1,450 daily appointments to migrants.

(Jorge Nieto/Special for Border Report) 'We're using the application, but you hear rumors that he's going to eliminate it, it's going to get harder for migrants.' Other CBP One users, like Jesus Ramos, want Trump to continue the program. 'I've been waiting three months for an appointment, I just want to get to the U.S. to see my grandparents one more time,' he said. Ramos believes if Trump cuts access to CBP One, migrants will be forced to use smugglers.

What happens between now and inauguration?	(The Hill) — President-elect Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 election Wednesday, unlocking a path to the White House that involves a series of key events required to ratify the results. This process is outlined in the Constitution. The steps ensure an election is fairly processed and ballot counts are properly documented. Officials craft paperwork that records the presidential ballot totals from Election Day, the first Tuesday in November, to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. Certificate of Ascertainment Each state must first submit its Certificate of Ascertainment, which lists the names of all the individuals on the slates for each candidate and the number of votes each individual received. It also shows which individuals were appointed as the state's electors, according to the National Archives. These documents must be sent to the Archivist of the United States by Dec. 11. They are the country’s official election record. Trump starts planning for second administration Certificate of the Vote Electors will meet in their respective states on Dec. 17. Each person casts a vote for president and vice president on separate ballots. Electors record their votes on six Certificates of Vote, which are paired with the six remaining Certificates of Ascertainment, according to the National Archives. Next, they sign and seal six copies of both the Certificate of Vote alongside the Certificate of Ascertainment. The documents are sent to Congress, where the votes are counted, and to the National Archives and Record Administration, as part of the official records of the presidential election. Every state will also receive a copy for its permanent records in addition to three backup sets. New Congress members instated The new Congress will convene at noon Jan. 3, as outlined in the Constitution, and lawmakers will be sworn in. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the meeting as Senate members take their Oath of Office, as well as the House Speaker for House members. 2024 Election results Congress counts electoral votes Congress will count electoral votes on Jan. 6. Harris will be the first sitting vice president to oversee the counting of her own electoral loss since Al Gore in 2002. The states' election results will be brought into Congress in two wooden boxes. Harris will hand sealed certificates to tellers, who will tally the votes. This is the first time a new process outlined under the Electoral Count Reform Act will be in place. The law confirms the vice president cannot change the election outcome on Jan. 6 and helps to resolve legal challenges swiftly, according to the Associated Press. The law was passed after the Capitol attacks on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of the election. Biden: Trump win lays to rest question of election ‘integrity’ Inauguration President-elect Trump will be sworn in on Inauguration Day at noon on Jan. 20, as laid out in the Constitution. He will also provide an address to the nation.

Harris loss: Democrats ask what went wrong	(NewsNation) — Democrats are grappling with Vice President Kamala Harris' defeat to Donald Trump in Tuesday's presidential election, and blame is being cast. Democratic strategist Joshua Doss and left wing political commentator Cenk Uygur joined NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo to discuss what went wrong for Kamala Harris and the Democrats. Doss argued that Harris ran a good campaign, focusing on working-class policies, while Uygur argued Harris was a bad candidate, only caring about donors. Chris Cuomo said the results should tell Democrats they need to focus 'less on who is woke' and more on 'who is broke.' For the most part, Democrats did not direct arrows toward Harris, who many say ran the best campaign she could have given the circumstances of her 100-day sprint following President Biden’s withdrawal from the race. But there was some second-guessing on Harris’ running mate pick of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who one operative said 'ultimately offered next to nothing.' There also was some griping about how Harris’ economic message largely fell flat. And there are larger discussions about the campaign’s polling and how it missed Trump’s growing coalition of Latino voters. Leader of the free world has never been a role Trump has embraced. The world has gotten the message Some of the vice president’s backers are also expressing frustration that Biden’s decision to seek reelection until this summer — despite long-standing voter concerns about his age and unease about post-pandemic inflation as well as the U.S.-Mexico border — all but sealed his party’s surrender of the White House. 'The biggest onus of this loss is on President Biden,' said Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden in 2020 for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Harris’ unsuccessful run. 'If he had stepped down in January instead of July, we may be in a very different place.' NewsNation’s 'The Hill' and Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/harris-loss-democrats-ask-what-went-wrong/	2024-11-07T21:47:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24312026609813.jpg?w=900
Many obstacles to Trump’s mass deportation promise: Ex-ICE offici...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to deport 11 million migrants in the U.S. illegally has more than a few obstacles, according to a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director. The first is staffing and funding from Congress, according to John Sandweg, who worked in the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. 'Trump is going to need a lot more ICE agents. That's going to require a lot of appropriations from Congress,' he said. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security The administration would also need a massive number of 'detention beds,' something Sandweg told NewsNation is far easier said than done. The main thing, according to Sandweg, is the state of the existing U.S. immigration system. 'There are backlogs in the immigration courts. The Supreme Court has said that migrants are entitled to due process before they’re deported,' said Sandweg. 'That means Trump is going to have to find a way to bypass those immigration courts. I think during the campaign, just in all candor, I don't think they had a clear road map for how they're going to kind of overcome those challenges.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/obstacles-trump-mass-deportation/	2024-11-07T16:17:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66bfeaba4bd428.13636202.jpeg?w=900
Trump picks Susie Wiles for White House chief of staff	Susie Wiles, who led President-elect Trump’s campaign for the past two years, will serve as his chief of staff when he takes office in January. 'Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,' Trump said in a statement. 'Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,' he added. 'It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.' The chief of staff pick was the first administration post Trump has announced since he clinched the presidency in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Wiles is a widely respected GOP operative from Florida who has avoided the spotlight even as she steered Trump’s third White House campaign alongside Chris LaCivita. She navigated the largely male-dominated campaign without making enemies, and Trump allies were quick to congratulate her on the role. 'This is great news. Susie was a huge asset to President Trump on the campaign and will be a huge asset in the White House. She's also just a really good person. Onward!' Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social platform X. Trump called on Wiles to speak during his victory speech Wednesday morning, but, as evidence of her tendency to avoid the spotlight, she declined. 'We call her the ice baby,' Trump joked. 'Susie likes to stay in the background. She's not in the background.' Prior to serving as a top Trump adviser in the 2024 election, Wiles led his Florida operations in the 2016 campaign. She went on to work with Ron DeSantis (R) on his gubernatorial campaign in Florida, but she left DeSantis’s team amid rising tensions. Chief of staff is seen as the most influential job in the White House, aside from the presidency itself, and Wiles will be tasked with managing Trump and his team of at-times competing factions — a job that proved difficult and thankless during his first term. Trump went through four chiefs of staff during his first term in office. His first pick, Reince Priebus, lasted six months before being replaced by John Kelly, who has since become an outspoken critic of Trump. Wiles is the daughter of former NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall.

Powell says he won't resign for Trump, can't be fired	Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a clear, direct response when asked during a press conference Thursday if he would step down if asked to do so by President-elect Trump. 'No,' said Powell, whose term as chair ends in 2026 Trump starts planning for second administration When asked to elaborate and if he would be legally required to leave, he again said, 'No.' Powell later said it is 'not permitted under the law' for the president to fire or demote him or any of the other Fed governors with leadership positions. Trump appointed Powell during his first term in 2017 but repeatedly and publicly criticized the Fed and its chair for not cutting rates fast enough throughout his tenure. Powell also said in 2019 that he would not resign if asked by Trump. President Biden reappointed Powell in 2021 — despite objections from progressives who have criticized the chair — saying he has burdened the average American by keeping rates too high for too long. Trump suggested earlier this year that Powell, a lifelong Republican, was 'political' and would cut rates ahead of the 2024 election to help Democrats. While the Fed did cut rates in September by a whopping 50 basis points, Trump handily defeated Vice President Harris this week. The Fed is a politically independent agency and closely guards its reputation. But in August, Trump suggested he should 'have at least a say' in monetary policy, including interest rates, because he has 'made a lot of money.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security Trump later walked back his comments during an interview with Bloomberg. 'I think it’s fine for a president to talk,' he said. 'It doesn’t mean that they have to listen.' What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes 'A president certainly can be talking about interest rates, because I think I have very good instincts,' he said. 'That doesn’t mean I’m calling the shot, but it does mean that I should have a right to be able to talk about it like anybody else.' Trump also said over the summer that he would let Powell serve out his term, 'especially if I thought he was doing the right thing,' but that he would not reappoint him for another term.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/jerome-powell-donald-trump-federal-reserve-chair/	2024-11-07T15:00:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/powelljerome_070924jg09_w.jpg?w=900
Voters approve abortion-rights measures in 7 states	(NewsNation) — Abortion-rights measures passed in 7 states and have failed in at least 1 thus far, as voters in nearly a dozen states were asked to decide whether reproductive rights should be guaranteed. A record 10 states had abortion rights measures on their ballots this year in response to restrictions and bans on reproductive rights across the country. Abortion measures on state ballots Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and New York approved the abortion rights measures, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has projected. Florida voters are projected to reject an abortion access measure, leaving the state's bans intact. The measure passed in Missouri with support from more than 74% of voters, according to Decision Desk HQ. The state will now have a constitutional amendment protecting abortion until fetal viability, with the exception when a health care professional determines it’s necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant woman. States that voted on ballot measures to provide abortion access. (Green: Approved, Red: Rejected) Voters in Nebraska approved a ballot measure limiting abortion to the first trimester. Nebraska's competing measure to solidify abortion access appeared to fail with more than 95% of the vote counted. Fifty-eight percent of voters in South Dakota voted 'no' to abortion rights being added to the state constitution, with 95% of votes in, according to NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ. Once called, the state would preserve a near-total ban there. Which states voted to protect abortion and elect Trump? Most measures gave voters a choice to solidify the right to abortion in state constitutions. All but two of the measures were citizen-led, meaning they were written by citizen groups and placed on ballots after getting enough signatures. Trump and abortion rights Several of the states that passed measures also voted for President-elect Donald Trump, indicating a disconnect between voters’ values on a central issue and those of their preferred party. Alternatively, protecting abortion access may be a comfort to voters who support Trump but aren’t clear on his views about abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, launching a national push to have voters decide abortion laws at the state level. Since then, a number of states have tackled the issue, with the last big wave of ballot measures taking place in 2022 when six states put abortion to a vote. A June Gallup poll revealed a record-high 32% of America’s voters would only vote a candidate into a major office if their opinions on abortion aligned, up 8 points from 2020. The number of U.S. voters who advocate for abortion rights is holding historically high at 54%. That percentage hit a fever pitch after the Roe ruling, and since then, the percentage of those supporting the right to an abortion has never dropped back below 50%, according to the poll. What’s involved in Donald Trump’s border security plan? Abortion legal battles The efforts were an uphill battle for many states where reproductive rights advocates faced legal fights in courts brought by anti-abortion groups seeking to remove measures from ballots. Abortion rights activists and Women's March leaders protest as part of a national day of strike actions outside the Supreme Court, Monday, June 24, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) In Arizona, anti-abortion groups sought to block the measure from getting on the state's ballot by legally challenging a handful of words that were left out of the description and argued the 'primary thrust' of the amendment was a 'wholesale dismantling of existing law related to abortion in Arizona.' Their lawsuit was dismissed by a judge who said there’s no legal reason to prevent it from being considered by voters, reported the Arizona Mirror. The measure passed with 61% approval. Legal battles are expected for the approved measures, and some anti-abortion groups say they will continue to fight against the laws. 'These ballot initiatives are vague and undefined,' Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy at Students for Life, told The Washington Post. The vagueness, she added, opens the door for legislation more tightly regulating medication abortion. Abortion's importance to the election Like in 2022, abortion continued to be a motivating factor for a notable share of voters in 2024, according to nonprofit KFF. About 4 in 10 voters said abortion had a major impact on their decision about whether to turn out, and over half said it had a major impact on which candidates they supported, the group found. Abortion was a major issue central to driving voters to the polls in the 2022 midterm elections, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In polling leading up to Election Day, abortion had surpassed inflation to be the top issue in the presidential election for young women. Abortion-rights ballot measure supporters across the country raised nearly eight times as much money as groups campaigning against the amendments on ballots across the country. 'This shows overwhelmingly that voters believe in abortion access, and it disputes all the misinformation and disinformation that we’ve been hearing about abortion access and belief that people do not care about it,' Christian F. Nunes, the president of the National Organization for Women, which advocates for women’s rights, told NewsNation prior to Election Day. Missouri reverses abortion ban Under current Missouri law, abortion is nearly completely banned, with exceptions for medical emergencies, making the state one of the most strict in the country. Under the newly passed amendment, the state will now guarantee people’s right to make decisions about their reproductive health, such as whether to get an abortion, take birth control or get in vitro fertilization. 'Tonight, through the sheer will and power of the people, Missouri becomes the first state to end a total abortion ban at the ballot box,' Mallory Schwarz, Abortion Action Missouri executive director, said in a statement after the vote. Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state’s abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care. The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional. Mike Kehoe, the governor-elect of Missouri, vowed to continue fighting the law. 'Well we’re going to have to work with our legislators to find out what are any other options to protect innocent life, you’re right once it’s in the constitution it’s not an option, so we’ll have to look to what all the avenues are available,' Kehoe said, reported WDAF-TV. 'Life supporters will not sit back and watch as Big Abortion works to dismantle all the health and safety protections put in place to protect women and babies,' Missouri Stands with Women spokesperson Stephanie Bell said in a statement. Nebraska's competing abortion ballot measures Nebraska gave voters two competing measures on abortion rights, where one asks voters to enshrine the right to an abortion until fetal viability or later to protect the health of the pregnant woman in the state constitution. The other sought to amend the state constitution to keep the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman. With 92% of votes in, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ projects voters have approved Initiative 434, which prohibits abortion after the first trimester and keeps the state’s current law. The race had not been called for the measure solidifying rights, but 51% of voters have voted against it so far. Several lawsuits were filed in an effort to block one or both of the initiatives, but the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that both measures could appear on the ballot because each side had enough signatures. Florida votes no on abortion access ballot question In Florida, voters had the opportunity to amend the state constitution to protect the right to abortion until fetal viability or when necessary to protect the pregnant person’s health. The measure garnered support from 57% of voters, falling just short of the 60% it needed to pass, according to DDHQ totals. The state’s six-week abortion ban will continue to be in place. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and other GOP leaders had repeatedly tapped into taxpayer-funded resources to fight the ballot initiative, according to Politico reporting. Kamala Harris vows peaceful transfer of power in concession speech State police in Florida also allegedly visited the homes of voters who signed a petition to get an abortion-rights amendment on the ballot as part of a state probe into alleged petition fraud.

Here's what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump vowed to end taxes on Social Security retirement benefits on the campaign trail, but as he heads into his second term that promise could be hard to keep. 'You would have to have bipartisan buy-in to do that and it's hard for me to imagine that happening,' said Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who specializes in Social Security. Today, individuals who earn above $25,000 pay income tax on up to 50% of their Social Security retirement benefits. For seniors who earn above $34,000, an additional 35% of benefits are taxable. Nine states also collect taxes on Social Security. Can you live on Social Security alone in 2024? Trump pledged to end those taxes at the federal level: 'Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security, and they won’t,' he said at a July rally in Pennsylvania. But that could be a tall order. Any changes to Social Security's taxation structure would require 60 votes in the Senate, meaning Republicans and Democrats would have to work together to make it happen, Blahous pointed out. Even if retirees on both sides of the aisle support Trump's idea, there's a major reason lawmakers are unlikely to: Social Security's finances are in dire straits. In roughly a decade, retirees could see their benefits slashed by 21% if Congress doesn't take action. Ending taxes on benefits — which account for 4% of the retirement program's income — would squeeze the program further. In other words, Trump probably needs to propose a plan that increases revenue before lawmakers will agree to slash taxes. Social Security benefits are taxed in these US states A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) found that Trump's Social Security agenda — which also includes ideas like eliminating taxes on tips, imposing more tariffs and deporting unauthorized migrants — would 'dramatically worsen' the program's finances and move up the insolvency date three years, from 2034 to 2031. Trump’s campaign slammed the CRFB analysis at the time, saying: 'The so-called experts at CRFB have been consistently wrong throughout the years.' Polling suggests most Americans are in favor of changing the payroll tax so high earners pay more into the Social Security system, which would help bolster the program's revenue. So far, Trump hasn't signaled that he's open to the idea. Will Social Security change under Donald Trump? Trump has repeatedly said he won't 'cut one cent' from Social Security or raise the retirement age. The official Republican Party Platform adopted at the Republican National Convention echoed those promises but it's less clear how Trump plans to shore up the program's finances. Earlier this year, the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) 2025 budget proposal suggested raising the retirement age for those not near retirement 'to account for increases in life expectancy.' Trump has pointed to economic dynamism as a potential solution and has suggested bolstering the program by tapping into 'incredible wealth under our feet' in the form of oil and gas. The CRFB reported that would do little to address the shortfall. The most likely scenario, as Blahous sees it, is that Trump's second term will look a lot like his first, meaning few changes, if any, to Social Security. 'His standpoint has been, 'I'm just not going to change anything' and I think that's a fairly likely bet,' Blahous said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Aaron Cirksena, founder and CEO of MDRN Capital and a retirement planning specialist, thinks ending taxes on benefits would be popular if Trump can make it happen. 'To retirees, when they're getting taxed taking Social Security payments out of the system it feels like they're basically getting taxed twice on it,' he said. Today, about 40% of Social Security recipients pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. That share has risen from 26% in 1998 because the exemption thresholds don’t go up with inflation, an example of so-called 'bracket creep.' For now, Cirksena said it's a bad idea to shift your retirement strategy based on potential changes down the road. 'Until things are actually enacted and they're set in stone, don't make any hard, concrete plans,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-presidency-social-security/	2024-11-07T11:50:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Election-Trump-full-screen-2.png?w=900
Live: Biden addresses nation after Trump wins presidency a second...	(NewsNation) — Current U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the nation Thursday morning in the Rose Garden following Republican former President Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election. Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris gave her 'whole heart effort, and she and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran,' Biden said. 'The struggle for the soul of America, since our very founding, has always been an ongoing debate, and still vital today,' Biden said. 'I know for some people, it’s a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it's a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made.' Trump's win means Republicans will regain control of the White House four years after they lost to Biden in 2020. The GOP also won control of the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, though the fate of the House of Representatives still hangs in the balance. Trump showed an early lead as polls started closing Tuesday evening in the East Coast with the 'red mirage.' He had early wins in swing states like Georgia and North Carolina. Pennsylvania ultimately gave him the final electoral votes to seize the 270 needed to secure the presidency. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Biden called Trump and congratulated the President-elect on his victory and emphasized a smooth transition of power, extending an invitation to the White House. At 78 years old Trump will become the oldest president to be elected to the White House. Biden previously held that title, as he was 77. During Democratic nominee Harris' concession speech, she promised a peaceful transfer of power to Trump, and urged supporters to keep fighting for the ideals of her campaign at the ballot box, in the courts and in the public square.

Trump starts planning for second administration	(NewsNation) — The 2024 election is in the books, which means the clock has started on the transition to the second Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump's second inauguration is just 75 days away and the race is on for Trump to get teams in place for his new administration. How often does the US see a unified government? Trump takes office in January Trump's family has been helping the President-elect through the transition process. Trump will take office in January after Biden finishes his term. He’s already pledged to address the ongoing crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that he will begin mass deportations of illegal immigrants on day one. He has also promised to address the economy with Republicans ready to push to renew the 2017 tax cuts which were achieved during Trump’s first term, The New York Times reported. The GOP also promised 'massive reform' to the Affordable Care Act, the report said. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said health care reform would be a large part of the Republican agenda within Trump’s first 100 days as president. Trump also claimed he would end the 'Green New Deal atrocities' on his first day if reelected. The measure was never signed into law. Some of the names already being floated as possible Trump cabinet members include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who dismissed Trump's federal classified documents case, has also been floated as a possible attorney general. 2024 Election results Election fallout Trump spent his day on Wednesday at Mar-a-Lago, fielding phone calls from world leaders and donors. He also spoke with his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, who formally conceded the election. Both Biden and Harris spoke about the importance of unifying the country and a peaceful transition of power. A message the vice president echoed in her formal concession speech to supporters on Wednesday. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny,' Harris said. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness.' NewsNation also learned that President Joe Biden called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. The two are expected to meet in person at the White House soon. Biden will address the nation Thursday for the first time since the election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/75-days-trump-inauguration/	2024-11-07T06:23:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182676763.jpg?w=900

Peter Navarro explains how Donald Trump will compose his Cabinet	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump will assume his second non-consecutive term on Jan. 20, and now the transition team is compliling a shortlist of possible White House Cabinet members. How will Trump 2.0 be distinct? Ex-Trump administration adviser Peter Navarro explains what he believes the President-elect will do differently this time. 'I think the lesson of the first term was it's important to get the appointments absolutely correct. We had some folks there early on that were very, very difficult,' said former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, who served from 2017 to 2021. Some likely Cabinet contenders include Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. Others have speculated Trump may tap Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran as an independent presidential candidate earlier in the race, and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, who campaigned for him. What Donald Trump will do differently in second White House term Navarro was the first Trump White House official to service prison time related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and was released in July after serving a four-month sentence. He joined NewsNation's 'On Balance with Leland Vittert' Wednesday to discuss how Trump might choose his Cabinet. 'I think there's going to be a battle between the MAGA folks and the Wall Street folks,' Navarro said. 'I think if you see Wall Street-type people in key places like Treasury or the National Economic Council within the West Wing, that's going to be very, very difficult. One of the problems we had in the first term is that Wall Street was continually fighting.' Still, Navarro said he thinks Trump will bring on veterans from the first administration. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? 'I think what the boss is looking for, and I’ve thought about this a lot ... you want somebody to be loyal to the president … who'll be honest and blunt when need be but loyal,' Navarro said. 'Most importantly, they need to be loyal to the agenda, the Trump agenda, particularly on trade, particularly on border issues. He likes people who are good with the media, and if you're in the West Wing, you really have to have a command of how the policy process works.' The first 100 days of the second Trump administration could see '100 or more' executive orders, according to Navarro.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/peter-navarro-cabinet-selection-trump/	2024-11-07T01:21:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/navarropeter_081122gn15_w.jpg?w=900
What Donald Trump will do differently in second White House term	(NewsNation) — After President-elect Donald Trump previously criticized early voting, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee says it was critical that he led the effort to get more voters to the polls before Election Day. An estimated 85.9 million early votes were cast before Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to secure a second term in the White House, but Ronna McDaniel said after the victory that Trump made a change in encouraging his supporters to go against his former voting guidance. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes 'There’s no better person that’s going to get voters to change their habits, to believe in it, than President Trump,' McDaniel said, adding, 'This is certainly something that took an education, but it wouldn’t have happened without the top of the ticket saying it. This has to be the norm going forward. We can’t expect to get everything on Election Day.' Heading into Trump’s second White House term, McDaniel expects things to be different than his first. Trump has a better understanding of Washington, she said, and she believes Trump will have a definite plan from Day 1. Trump could have a fully Republican-controlled Congress to work with after the GOP flipped the Senate, but McDaniel says he will be eager to work across the aisle. 'I think he is talking about things that have bipartisan support,' McDaniel said. 'Like a border that we need safe and secure, like making sure we that we tackle our energy independence. I think there’s so much bipartisanship in Washington, and I believe President Trump will work across the aisle.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-do-differently-white-house/	2024-11-06T17:36:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182130711.jpg?w=900
Chris Cuomo breaks down what 2024 election outcome means	The views expressed in this article are those of the author, and not of NewsNation. (NewsNation) — The 2024 Democratic defeat runs deeper than conventional wisdom suggests. While many blame voter demographics or point fingers at specific groups, the reality is much simpler: Americans voted their pocketbooks. With costs higher than four years ago, voters prioritized economic concerns over warnings about President-elect Donald Trump's character flaws or democratic threats. NewsNation led the way in election coverage, delivering accurate calls before other networks thanks to solid modeling from Decision Desk HQ. Kamala Harris vows peaceful transfer of power in concession speech Wednesday's pivotal moment came when Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech at Howard University, formally acknowledging Trump's victory. The Democratic campaign strategy proved fundamentally flawed. They bet everything on an anti-Trump message, believing that highlighting his dangerous potential would overcome all other voter concerns. Bernie Sanders identified this critical error — the party had abandoned its core message about helping working families in favor of becoming solely the anti-Trump party. This miscalculation was costly. Most Trump voters aren't blind followers. They're pragmatic citizens worried about their families' financial security, physical safety and personal freedoms. While Trump certainly has his devoted base, the majority of his supporters voted for him because they believed he better understood their everyday concerns. When will House results come out? They saw him as someone who would fight against what they perceive as overreach in education policy, border control and speech restrictions. The media played a troubling role in this election. While NewsNation called races based purely on data, other networks showed clear hesitation when the numbers pointed to Trump. This bias only reinforces the perception that establishment institutions are working against ordinary Americans' interests. Trump now faces a greater challenge than winning the election.He must somehow transition from disruption to progress, from division to unity. Real solutions to border security and economic improvement require more than just walls or tax cuts -— they demand collaborative policy-making and genuine leadership. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Looking forward, Democrats have an opportunity to rebuild as the opposition party. They need to fundamentally rethink their approach, focusing less on telling voters why they're wrong and more on understanding and addressing their genuine concerns. The party must reconnect with working families and demonstrate how progressive policies can actually improve their daily lives. For the country to move forward, both sides need to engage in honest reflection. Fairness and cooperation must replace gratuitous division. The election is over, and now comes the harder task of governance. Simply demonizing the other side — whether it's Trump supporters or progressive activists — solves nothing. Real progress requires understanding that most Americans want the same things: economic security, safe communities and a better future for our children. The fundamental lesson of this election is clear: You cannot win by dismissing voters' concerns or telling them their feelings are wrong. The path forward requires less judgment and more understanding, less ideology and more practical problem-solving.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/opinion/chris-cuomo-breaks-down-what-the-2024-election-outcome-means/	2024-11-06T17:35:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_27a87f.jpg?w=900
What will Trump do on immigration, foreign policy?	(NewsNation) — Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said he will take a hard-line stance on immigration once in office, including enacting mass deportations of unauthorized migrants. Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokeswoman in the Trump administration, said there are various policies one can expect the former president to follow through on in his second term. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? However, there are other indicators for how Trump will deal with the southern border as president, such as who he picks to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Ortagus said. 'We know that he's going to want to try and to finish the wall,' Ortagus said, adding that Trump will also likely take on the controversial CBP One app. 'If you're circumventing the legal process, whatever the policy is, I think you can likely expect a second Trump term to not allow policies that are actually circumventing the law.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/what-will-trump-do-on-immigration-foreign-policy/	2024-11-06T16:59:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24303574162285.jpg?w=900
What Trump's proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump pledged to implement several initiatives if he defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, including a plan to eliminate personal income taxes in exchange for at least a 10% tariff on all important imported goods and a 60% tariff on products imported from China. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s plan to expand his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would, in 2024 dollars, cost $3.2 trillion over 10 years and $10.3 trillion over the next 30 years. With Trump projected to win a second term in the White House, however, what does his proposed tax plan mean for the earnings of everyday Americans? The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, shows that the Trump tax proposal benefits American workers in various income brackets following an election in which many voters considered the economy their top concern. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? The Wharton project estimates that the Trump tax plan would increase the nation's primary deficits by $5.8 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis and by $4.1 trillion on a dynamic basis, the report finds. Here’s how the Trump plan benefits the income of Americans, according to Wharton research. Income bracket: $48,000 Income category: Lower class Income gain under Trump: 1.8% or $870 Wharton analysis: The projected increase was much lower than Harris’ proposed plan (1.8% vs. 4.8% or $2,260), and under Trump’s tariff proposal for products coming from China and other places, those tariffs turn middle-and-low-income earners into 'net losers' because of the increased cost of goods, especially from China, the Wharton project reported. Income bracket: $81,000 Income category: Middle class Income gain under Trump: 2.1% or $1,740 Wharton analysis: While the Harris plan called for the Child Tax Credit to increase to $6,000 for newborns and $3,600 for children under 5 beginning in 2026, the Trump plan keeps the tax credit at $2,000. However, since the tax credit is scheduled to shrink, Wharton researchers consider his proposal a financial gain for Americans in this income grouping. Part of Trump’s plan, however, calls for the stoppage of taxes on Social Security benefits. The Tax Foundation projected retirees who earn between $55,000 and $137,000 to be the biggest winners, the Wharton research project found. Trump return likely to slow, not stop, US clean-energy boom Income bracket: $138,000 Income category: Upper Middle Class Income gain under Trump: 2.8% or $3,970 Wharton analysis: This group represents the first to see a bigger financial gain than under the Harris proposal. With Trump planning to extend provisions of his 2017 signature plan, Wharton researchers found that the upper middle class would see significant benefits under Trump. By extending the cuts beyond 2025, earners in this income bracket would see lower tax rates and a doubling of the standard deduction, the Wharton report said. Under the Trump plan, the standard deduction would jump to $24,000 from $13,000 for couples and to $12,000 from $6,500 for single residents. Income bracket: $327,000 Income category: Top professional earners Income gain under Trump: 2.7% or $9,020 Wharton analysis: Researchers found that like the upper middle class, this income bracket would also see significant benefits from the extension of the 2017 Trump plan. The Trump initiative raised the threshold of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Before 2017, Wharton researchers, citing the Tax Policy Center, found that about 18% of workers earning between $200,000 and $500,000 paid the AMT. After the Trump plan went into effect, less than 1% were affected by the AMT. Income bracket: $1.8 million Income category: Top 99% Income gain under Trump: 2.6% or $47,220 Wharton analysis: By extending the 2017 plan, earners in this wage bracket saw the top income tax rate drop from 39.6 to 37%, which resulted in a tax cut of nearly $50,000, the Wharton project found. In addition, business owners who earn $1.8 million benefit from a 20% deduction for qualified business income, the Wharton group reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-tax-plan-american-incomes/	2024-11-06T11:42:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Trump-ElectionNight.jpg?w=900

Watch Live: New York AG Letitia James on Trump sentencing	(NewsNation) — New York State Attorney General Letitia James will speak about the status of the case against President-elect Donald Trump. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26 for his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. While Trump could pardon himself in the federal crimes of which he's accused, he has no power to pardon himself on the conviction in New York, nor the 2020-related crimes he faces in Georgia. When will House results come out? In September, a federal judge swiftly rejected Trump’s request to move the case to federal court so that he could seek to have his conviction overturned in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said the defense failed to meet the high burden of proof for changing jurisdiction and that Trump’s conviction for falsifying business records involved his personal life, not official actions that the Supreme Court ruled are immune from prosecution.

How much of the vote did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receive?	(NewsNation) — After encouraging his supporters not to vote for him, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. received nearly 594,000 (about 0.4% of the popular vote) and zero electoral votes. RFK Jr. was on the ballot in every state except Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming. In late October, the Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal to remove RFK Jr. from the presidential ballot in two battleground states. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? Kennedy wanted to get off the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan after dropping his independent bid and endorsing Republican Donald Trump. He argued that keeping him on violated his First Amendment rights by wrongly implying he still wanted to be elected president. Michigan and Wisconsin said removing his name so late in the election season, with early voting already underway at the time, would be impossible. More than 1.5 million people in Michigan had already returned absentee ballots, and another 264,000 had voted early, state attorneys wrote in court documents. In Wisconsin, over 858,000 people have returned absentee ballots. The justices did not detail their reason in an order rejecting the emergency appeal, as is typical. One justice, Neil Gorsuch, publicly dissented in the Michigan case. RFK Jr. suspended his independent campaign in August. Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines off the market Kennedy said his internal polls had shown that his presence in the race would hurt Trump and help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Kennedy cited free speech, the war in Ukraine and 'a war on our children' as among the reasons he would try to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states. Prior to Donald Trump’s Nov. 5 victory, Kennedy said Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies like the Food and Drug Administration or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should he win the 2024 presidential election. 'He’s asked me to clean up the corruption number one,' Kennedy said during a town hall with NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'Number two, end the conflicts of interest, return those agencies to their rich tradition of gold standard, empirically-based, evidence-based science, evidence-based medicine, and to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country.'

Kamala Harris to address the nation Wednesday	(NewsNation) — A top Kamala Harris aide told attendees at the campaign’s gathering Tuesday night that the vice president plans to address the nation on Wednesday. 'Thank you for believing in the promise of America ... We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight...' Harris campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said. Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon sent out a letter to staff on Tuesday night, assuring them that the current closeness of the race was 'exactly what we prepared for.' In the email, Dillon said staff have known all along that this is a 'razor-thin race.' Donald Trump projected to win presidential election for second time 'While we continue to see data trickle in from the Sun Belt states, we have known all along that our clearest path to 270 electoral votes lies through the Blue Wall states,' O'Malley Dillon wrote. 'And we feel good about what we’re seeing.' Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to win a presidential election for a second time, as NewsNation/ Decision Desk HQ projects he will win Pennsylvania. Speaking to supporters at around 1:30 a.m. CT Wednesday, Trump said, 'This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before. 'Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,' Trump said. 'There’s never been anything like this in this country and maybe beyond, and now it’s going to reach a new level of importance because we’re going to help our country heal.' Trump’s running mate and now Vice President-elect JD Vance, who also spoke, called the former president’s win the greatest political comeback 'in the history of the United States of America.' 'He turned out to be a good choice,' Trump said of Vance.

When will House results come out?	(NewsNation) — With former President Donald Trump projected as winning the 2024 presidential election and the Republican Party flipping the Senate, Democrats' last hope for a foothold in Washington now rests in the House of Representatives. Track the balance of power in Congress Why are the results for the House taking so long? Several key states, including California and New York, will continue counting mail ballots received after Election Day, provided they were postmarked by Nov. 5. This legal framework means final results in these crucial contests could take days or even weeks to determine. California, the nation's most populated state, with its high volume of mail ballots and voter-friendly counting rules, traditionally takes weeks to process all votes. With multiple competitive House races in California still undecided, the final balance of power might not be known until late November, according to a few estimates. Key US House races to watch on election night Path to control the House The magic number remains 218 seats for either party to claim the majority, currently held by Republicans under Speaker Mike Johnson.

Who could be part of Donald Trump's second administration?	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump has secured a White House win and now will need to mull over who will join him for his second administration. While he hasn’t confirmed anyone, several names have been swirling as possible contenders. At the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original Cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible — a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Here’s who could join his administration: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. RFK Jr. said Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if he wins the 2024 presidential election. 'He’s asked me to clean up the corruption, number one,' Kennedy said during a town hall with NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'Number two, end the conflicts of interest, return those agencies to their rich tradition of gold standard, empirically based, evidence-based science, evidence-based medicine, and to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country.' Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks as he endorses Republican presidential nominee former President Trump at a campaign rally at the Desert Diamond Arena, Aug. 23, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. Kennedy ran as first a Democrat and later an independent in the election before dropping out and endorsing Trump. Trump said he would let Kennedy 'go wild' on issues related to food, medicine and health if elected to another term. Kennedy, in the past, has disseminated false information about health topics such as vaccines and is known for spreading conspiracy theories, as well. Because of this, NewsNation partner The Hill reports that medical experts have raised concerns about Kennedy’s potential influence in a future Trump administration. Elon Musk Trump has said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would probably be too busy to serve in his Cabinet if he wins the election in November but suggested the billionaire tech mogul could 'consult.'

Now, look, he’s running big businesses and all that, so, he can’t really, I don’t think he’d be [free] for the Cabinet,' Trump said in an interview on the 'Shawn Ryan Show.' 'I’d put him in the Cabinet, absolutely, but I don’t know how he could do that with all the things he’s got going,' he continued. 'But he could sort of, as the expression goes, consult with the country and give you some very good ideas.' Trump said in September he would create a 'government efficiency commission' first proposed by Musk, whom Trump said agreed to lead the new task force. Close Thank you for signing up!

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) speaks to reporters outside the Senate Chamber on Thursday, April 18, 2024. Rubio has served on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and as the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate, and while some members of Trump’s base may view the senator skeptically, he would have no trouble getting confirmed by his Senate colleagues. Aileen Cannon Cannon is the federal judge who dismissed Trump’s federal classified documents and is in the running to be the former president’s attorney general. ABC News reported that a 'proposed personnel roster circulating within Donald Trump’s campaign and transition operation' lists the Trump-appointed judge 'as a possible candidate for attorney general.' Mike Pompeo Pompeo, who served as CIA director and secretary of state during Trump's first term, is considered a top contender for secretary of defense but could land in various slots involving national security, intelligence or diplomacy, reported Reuters. He stands out as possibly the fiercest defender of Ukraine among Trump's close allies, a position that puts him at odds with most high-ranking figures in Trump's orbit.

How NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ called Pennsylvania for Trump	(NewsNation) — NewsNation was the first outlet to call the race in Pennsylvania for Donald Trump and as a result, was also able to call the race to the White House for Trump, immediately after. NewsNation's race call partner has issued a statement on how this call was made. Read the full statement below: Decision Desk HQ’s Statement on Our Pennsylvania Race Call Decision Desk HQ projects that former President Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, enough to elect him as the 47th President of the United States.How we made this race call: We deeply value information-sharing and transparency so the public knows they can trust our results. At the time of this race call, 93% of the vote in Pennsylvania was in – including mail-in ballots and Election Day votes. The data showed: In Philadelphia County and collar counties, including Bucks County, Montgomery County, and Chester County, President Trump was over-performing his 2020 results by more than 5% in each county. President Trump was over-performing his 2020 results in rural counties across Pennsylvania by more than 10%. Despite matching President Joe Biden’s 2020 margin in the Pittsburgh area and surrounding Allegheny County, Vice President Kamala Harris’s vote percentages were insufficient to overcome former President Trump’s gains elsewhere across the state. Bellwether counties, including Erie County, Centre County, and Monroe County, all went for President Biden in 2020, but flipped to President Trump in 2024. Decision Desk HQ has more than a decade-long track record of making accurate, independent, and transparent race calls – including our calls for President in 2016 and 2020 – and we have continued that record in this election cycle. Ahead of the election, ours was the only major forecasting model to accurately predict this election’s result. Before making any race calls, we deploy our peer-reviewed model to assist in our analysis and review the calls with our Director of Data Science and team of election analysts. We will not call a race until it meets all of our requirements. Ultimately, when making our race calls in 2024 as in previous cycles, we followed the data and our accurate prediction models and reached the same conclusion as the election results. Learn more about our process for accurately calling races.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/how-newsnation-decision-desk-hq-called-pennsylvania-for-trump/	2024-11-05T22:57:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/WIN-Trump-Pennsylvania.jpg?w=900
Donald Trump projected to win presidential race	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump is projected to win a presidential election for a second time, as NewsNation/ Decision Desk HQ projects he will win Pennsylvania. Trump faced off against the Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris in a tight and highly contentious race. With Trump’s projected win, the Republicans will regain control of the White House four years after he lost to President Joe Biden in 2020. Trump will become the oldest president to be elected to the White House at 78 years old. President Joe Biden was previously the oldest president to be elected at 77. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: Track results live He will enter the White House with a Republican-controlled Senate, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ projects. Trump showed an early lead as polls started closing in the East Coast with the 'red mirage.' With early wins in swing states Georgia and North Carolina, Pennsylvania gave him the final electoral votes to seize the 270 needed to secure the presidency. On his way to 270 electoral votes, the Republican candidate won Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Wyoming, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, West Virginia, Montana, Idaho and Utah. The victory comes just months after Harris entered the race in late July after Biden suspended his campaign. This campaign season, Trump has been the target of two assassination attempts. In July, a gunman fired and struck Trump while on stage during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service returned fire, killing the gunman, Thomas Crooks. In September, an alleged would-be gunman was positioned outside one of Trump’s golf courses before the Secret Service fired at him. The suspect, Ryan Routh, pleaded not guilty to assassination attempt charges. Despite the attempts on his life and numerous legal battles after being indicted four times on various charges, Trump remained defiant in his campaign for a second term in the White House. 'Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country,' Trump predicted during a 93-minute speech accepting the Republican nomination for president in Milwaukee, which just took place less than a week after the Pennsylvania rally. 'Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.' Where are Trump and Harris right now? On the campaign trail, Trump focused on border security and the economy, blaming Biden and Harris for the number of immigrants who have crossed into the U.S. illegally since 2021. Trump targeted Harris, saying she had failed as Biden’s 'border czar' while also blaming the current administration for allowing inflation to soar out of control. Trump and Harris faced each other in only one presidential debate, where both took jabs at one another on several key policies. Despite being pressed by Harris to participate in a second debate, Trump declined, saying he had already participated in two debates, counting the one in Atlanta against Biden. Trump said that a second debate with Harris would be too late, citing the fact early voting had already begun in several states. Trump will take office in January after Biden finishes his term. He’s already pledged to address the ongoing crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that he will begin mass deportations of illegal immigrants.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-president-wins-president-second-term/	2024-11-05T22:25:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/WIN-Trump-16x9-1.jpg?w=900
Donald Trump projected to win Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is projected to win Pennsylvania, taking 19 electoral votes in the crucial swing state, according to NewsNation/Decision Decision Desk HQ. See the results of the presidential race in other states here. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump had been neck and neck in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, leading up to the election, according to polling by NewsNation partner The Hill. Pennsylvania voters favored the Democrats in six straight elections prior to 2016, but Trump won the state that year by 0.7 percentage points. Biden clinched Pennsylvania back for Democrats in 2020 by 1.2 points. Pennsylvania lost an electoral vote from 2020 to 2024, going from 20 to 19 as the population declined. An October survey by Emerson College Polling and The Hill found the economy was the top issue for Pennsylvania, followed by threats to democracy and immigration. Much of Harris’ and Trump’s strategy was to reach out to the state’s rural voters, who typically lean red. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. The Harris campaign hired a rural engagement director to make additional inroads into those communities. In addition, Harris tried to reassemble the coalition behind Biden’s winning campaign, including college students, Black voters and women animated by protecting abortion rights. Trump drilled into his support for fracking — extracting oil and natural gas from underground formations. It’s a key issue in Pennsylvania, which is the second biggest producer of natural gas in the country behind Texas. The state holds over 100,000 jobs, and the industry has an economic impact of $41 billion. Harris has said she will not ban fracking. Meanwhile, Trump was the target of an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania’s Butler County in July. A gunman shot at the former president with a rifle from the roof of a building near the rally stage. Trump was hit in the ear and rushed off stage. One rally attendee was killed, and two more were injured. The gunman, Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by the Secret Service.

What is a 'red mirage'? Is it happening now?	(NewsNation) — Quick ballot counts could cause Election Day mirages, and they may not be good indicators of the candidate who will win. An Election Day 'red' or 'blue mirage' is when a candidate leads early after the polls close until other methods of votes are counted. NewsNation's political editor, Chris Stirewalt, says what appears to be shifts in voting patterns through election night is actually just a predictable pattern based on how different areas count their votes. 'It doesn't matter which piece you put in, first or last in a puzzle. It doesn't change the picture. The image remains the same,' Stirewalt said. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: Track results live It’s important to wait until all ballots are counted because the swing states tend to sway both ways throughout the day. Is the 'red mirage' happening now? Former President Donald Trump had an early lead right after polls started closing on the East Coast with wins in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. The votes in the crucial state of Pennsylvania are still being counted to determine a winner. The 'red mirage' phenomenon is an expectation that Republican voters are more likely to cast their ballots in person, whereas Democrats are more likely to vote by mail. That dynamic can result in GOP candidates seeing an early lead that later fades as mail-in ballots are counted. While the 'red mirage' is creating confidence among Republican supporters, NewsNation political analysts discuss how Vice President Kamala Harris is trending well in Michigan, Wisconsin and possibly Pennsylvania, which could swing the momentum back toward the Democrats. Pennsylvania doesn’t require counties to report their mail-in votes first, and they aren’t allowed to start processing those votes until Election Day. 'We are in for a car crash tonight because it's close,' Stirewalt said, suggesting that both parties will have moments of optimism and anxiety as various regions report their results through the night. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Rural areas count their votes faster since they have fewer ballots to process, less crowded precincts and shorter lines. 'The Hill Sunday' host described how vote counting moves from 'outside in,' starting with rural areas, then moving through suburbs and finally reaching dense urban centers. NewsNation is providing live results tracking on major races nationwide powered by Decision Desk HQ. Watch live results from the presidential election, important swing states and the balance of power in Congress. NewsNation will also be tracking your local state electionsand ballot initiatives on issues like abortionand minimum wage around the country. 'The less populous parts of the country count faster because the precincts aren't as crowded,' Stirewalt said. 'There aren't as many ballots to count in individual places, and the lines aren't as long in all of these places.' In Virginia, despite Trump leading in raw vote totals, the remaining votes are from Democratic strongholds like Fairfax and Henrico counties. 'Red mirage' during the 2020 election Stirewalt, who is also a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, explained that in 2020, the red mirage was amplified due to the high number of Democratic voters using mail-in and early voting, which skewed early results in favor of Republicans. This election's core battleground remains in the upper Midwest states along what Stirewalt calls 'the I-70 corridor' into Michigan and Wisconsin. While noting that Trump is performing better in key areas than in 2020, the political editor indicated current numbers suggest performance below 2016 levels.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/red-mirage-blue-mirage-is-it-happening/	2024-11-05T18:47:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-1962444959.jpg?w=900

Russia behind bomb threats against Georgia precincts, officials s...	(NewsNation) — A series of non-credible bomb threats targeting Georgia polling sites 'were of Russian origin,' Georgia Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger said. Five non-credible threats temporarily evacuated two Fulton County, Georgia, precincts for about 30 minutes each,' Fulton County Election Director Nadine Williams said at a morning news conference. Track your state’s election results 'Thankfully, these locations are now operational again and all polling sites are secure with an active security presence,' she said. Authorities including Georgia state officials and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are investigating the claims and say it’s safe for voting to continue. ​​ The FBI acknowledged the threats and said in a statement that none of them are credible so far. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Raffensperger criticized Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere with the election. 'We identified the source and it was from Russia … ' Raffensperger said during a separate morning news conference, which the FBI later confirmed. 'They’re up to mischief it seems and they don’t want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election.' 'They think they can get us to fight among ourselves and they count that as a victory,' he continued. 'So that tells you a little bit about the Russians. They’re not our friends. Anyone who thinks they are hasn’t been reading the newspapers.' NewsNation has reached out to the South Fulton Police Department in Georgia for additional comments. What time do the polls close in my state? U.S. adversaries are intensifying disinformation efforts and promoting false claims about voter fraud, intelligence officials warned Monday. Safety measures are in place. Around the nation, about 60 national guardsmen from six states have been activated for election support, Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder said. Roughly 600 guardsmen from 17 states are also on standby. The lines were moving quickly Tuesday morning in Georgia, with check-in times under one minute in some locations. Voters cast more than 29,500 ballots across Fulton County’s 177 polling sites as of 9:40 a.m. ET, Williams said. This story is developing.

Live results of swing states nationwide	(NewsNation) — Seven pivotal states are being closely watched on Tuesday as these could deliver either presidential candidate the final Electoral College votes needed to secure a victory. See the results of the presidential race in all 50 states here. Swing states, sometimes referred to as battleground states, are a critical part of a presidential candidate’s path to 270 electoral votes. This year these states are: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been neck-and-neck in nearly all major swing state polls, leading both to blitz the highly contested states in their final days of campaigning. Swing states are typically up for grabs for both parties’ candidates, changing election cycle to cycle, and often have the ability to sway the outcome of the election. To win the presidency, a candidate must get 270 electoral votes of the available 538. In 48 states along with Washington, D.C. the winning candidate gets all the electoral votes allocated to that state, but in Maine and Nebraska, electors are assigned using a proportional system.

Live results: Balance of power in Congress	(NewsNation) — The balance of power could shift in both chambers of Congress on Election Day, led by several toss-up races that could determine which party holds power in the federal legislature. See the results of the presidential election here. A total of 34 U.S. Senate seats will be determined on Election Day, with Democrats and Independents representing 23 of those races. Democrats are vying to hold on to the slim majority they have held in the upper chamber of Congress for the past two years. Some of the seats they will defend are in tougher-to-hold battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Republicans hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives with 220 seats over the Democrats who held 212 and three seats being vacant into Tuesday’s election. While there were hundreds of races, just a tenth of the races were deemed competitive, according to the Cook Political Report. Twenty-five were considered toss-ups with 11 of the seats held by Democrats and 14 by Republicans, and 17 races were rated as either leaning Democratic or leaning Republican.

Key US Senate races to watch on election night	(NewsNation) — Control of the Senate is up for grabs on Tuesday as more than a dozen critical races could shift the balance of power between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have held the slimmest of majorities for the last two years with Vice President Kamala Harris playing tiebreaker on 50-50 votes, but control could be upended. A total of 34 Senate seats are up for re-election with Democrats and Independents representing 23 of those races. For Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate, they’d need nearly all incumbents to win reelection and party members to win open seats in Arizona, Michigan and Maryland. Meanwhile, Republicans only need two seats in total to take the majority. Polling in the months leading up to the general election has shown Republicans favored to win back control in the Senate, with Democrats defending their seats in some of the tougher-to-hold battleground states, including in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Heading into the final week leading up to the election, NewsNation partner Decision Desk HQ predicted that Trump had a 54% chance of winning the presidency. Harris maintained a slim lead in the national polls, but Decision Desk HQ President Drew McCoy told NewsNation that several factors gave the edge to Trump. Despite the forecast that seemed to favor Trump, McCoy said that Harris held a similar advantage a couple of weeks prior, making the presidential race essentially a toss-up. Haris made her closing argument to American voters a week before Tuesday’s election. The Vice President delivered the speech from the same site where Trump stirred up supporters after he was defeated by Biden and that came ahead of the riots at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. 2021. 'There’s a big difference between he and I,' Harris told reporters last week. 'If he were elected, on day one he’s going to sit in the Oval Office working on his enemies list. On day one, if I am elected, which I fully expect to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

He also accused his Democratic opponent of spearheading a campaign of hate in the days leading up to Tuesday. Trump, who was shot in the ear in an attempt on his life during a Pennsylvania campaign rally just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, spent much of his campaign insulting and criticizing Harris’ tenure as Biden’s vice president. Trump also referred to his recent rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City as a 'lovefest' amid criticism that the event included sexist and racist comments and that was overshadowed by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage.' Trump claimed two days after the rally that he did not hear the comments. Harris remained focused on the future and asked voters at her rallies to 'turn the page' on Trump while focusing on undecided voters in the critical swing states that were expected to determine the nation’s next president. Harris also attempted to win over undecided voters over what the future would look like with her as president amid criticism that a Harris victory would simply mean an extension of Biden’s presidency.

Key US House races to watch on election night	(NewsNation) — All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for grabs on Tuesday with about two dozen being highly competitive and prone to flips. This election will be crucial for both parties who are battling for the balance of power. The GOP has a narrow majority in the House with 220 seats over the Democrats who held 212 and three seats being vacant prior to Tuesday’s election. Republicans had taken back the House by a slim margin during the 2022 midterm elections, flipping key seats in Washington, New York and California. In 15 House races in 2022, winners came out on top with fewer than 2 percentage points and this year seven of those races were rematches between incumbents and the same challengers. While there were hundreds of races, just a tenth of the races were deemed competitive, according to the Cook Political Report. Twenty-five were considered toss-ups with 11 of the seats held by Democrats and 14 by Republicans, and 17 races were rated as either leaning Democratic or leaning Republican.

Bill O'Reilly: Trump would be up '10 points' if I ran campaign	(NewsNation) — Bill O'Reilly believes Donald Trump would be 'up by 10 points' if he was running the former president's campaign. 'I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's absolutely true,' O'Reilly said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'I have a good rapport with Trump. I'd give him a Plan B. … A Plan B, he'll consider, because everything is a negotiation.' Trump’s nephew warns of unchecked power in a second Trump term OReilly says President Biden's recent 'garbage' comment 'saved' Trump by taking the heat off of the negative comments made about Puerto Rico by a comedian at an earlier Trump rally. But O'Reilly adds that Trump's own comments at his rallies have hurt him at times. 'Trump has run out of gas,' O'Reilly said. 'Trump's always been an entertainer as well as a politician. That's not a good combination. ... Trump wants to be funny at his rallies. ... It worked at the beginning, but now I think it's hurting him.' Some political strategists believe comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who made a controversial joke calling Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' last week in addition to other crass and bigoted remarks, could cost Trump the election. 'Every Puerto Rican in Pennsylvania has heard about the garbage comment. They all know about it,' said former Republican strategist Mark McKinnon. McKinnon said he thinks the 'garbage' comment is energizing voters who otherwise would not have turned out to cast ballots. Meanwhile, Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said the 'joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Trump, speaking at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort last week, referred to his rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden as a 'lovefest' despite criticisms it was racist and insulting. Other speakers during the Madison Square Garden rally preshow made comments targeting Latinos, Black people, Jewish people and Palestinians as well as sexist insults targeting Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump responded that everyone was happy and excited to be at the New York event and called critics ridiculous for tying it to a 1939 Nazi rally. Instead, Trump said that for him and his campaign, thousands of people were looking to be together and talk about how they wanted to change America. What Election Night trends could provide early clues on results? Vice President Harris and Trump are deadlocked in key swing states, according to a survey released Monday. Polling from Emerson College Polling and The Hill released before Election Day shows Harris and Trump in a tight set of matchups in the battleground states. Trump holds an edge in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, while Harris has the edge in Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/bill-oreilly-donald-trump-campaign/	2024-11-04T18:18:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/38ADF2B18821469B5B96EE308BB24226.jpg?w=728
Stirewalt breaks down what to expect with election night results	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris only have a few hours left to make their final appeals to voters ahead of the election. With 270 electoral votes needed to win, each candidate’s path to victory appears distinct. Key states and poll closing times The first crucial presidential election results will emerge from Georgia when polls close at 7 p.m. ET, with election analysts watching Forsyth County in suburban Atlanta for early signs of Trump's strength among affluent voters. North Carolina follows shortly after, with Nash County serving as a key indicator. The working-class region, with its 40 to 45% Black population, could signal whether Harris successfully mobilized Black voters. 4 potential paths to victory in the 2024 election The 8 p.m. ET rush of results positions Pennsylvania as the potential decider, with Erie County serving as the state's traditional bellwether. Erie's results have accurately predicted the statewide winner in the past two presidential cycles. By 9 p.m. ET, Michigan takes center stage, particularly three counties surrounding Detroit and Kent County near Grand Rapids. Trump's decision to end his campaign in Grand Rapids — as he did in previous races — underscores the region's importance in securing moderate Republican voters. Election experts predict a winner could emerge between midnight and 4 a.m. Eastern. Early results from Georgia and North Carolina, expected by 9:30 p.m., could provide strong indicators of the national outcome. Both states' efficient vote-counting systems typically deliver 80% of results by early evening, potentially offering clear signals of voter trends before the slower-counting Midwest states report their totals. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Trump and Harris paths to victory Harris faces a mathematically simpler path, needing only to defend traditionally Democratic states to reach 270 electoral votes. She could win without either North Carolina or Georgia if she maintains the Democratic Midwest firewall. Trump's route proves more challenging, requiring him to flip at least one traditionally Democratic state. While showing strength in Arizona, he needs either Pennsylvania or a combination of Michigan and Wisconsin plus Arizona or Nevada to secure victory.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/stirewalt-election-night-results/	2024-11-04T16:47:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_aeba71.jpg?w=900
How do I know if my mail-in vote was counted?	(NewsNation) — Several states across the United States allow their constituents to vote by mail, which can make the voting process far more streamlined for individuals. However, there have been concerns that mail-in, or absentee, ballots are inefficient or may be unable to be counted. Voters can request their ballots via USA.gov and Vote.org. They can also track their ballot status here. How to register to vote With Election Day closing in, NewsNation has all you need to know about mail-in voting. What to know about mail-in ballots Dating back to the Civil War, mail-in voting has been an institution of U.S. elections. The frequency of mail-in voting increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are varying ways in which someone can qualify for mail voting; absentee voting (excuse or no-excuse) and standardized mail voting. Which states allow mail-in voting? Every state allows mail-in voting, but the degree to which varies. Where are Trump, Harris, Vance and Walz campaigning today? All-mail elections occur predominantly on the West Coast. This means constituents will receive a ballot at their residence and can mail in their ballots, or vote in person. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington all allow mail voting under all circumstances. The only other state in the nation to have such practices is Vermont. Washington D.C. also allows all-mail voting. Twenty-eight states have a no-excuse absentee policy, meaning voters don't need to explain themselves to receive a mail-in ballot. These include Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Which states don't allow mail-in ballots? All states allow absentee voting, but a worthy excuse must be provided in the following states: Alabama: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, working during voting hours, student living outside of the county, election worker, incarcerated (not convicted of 'moral turpitude'), aged 65+, caregiver, military service, religious beliefs/practice. Arkansas: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, uniformed services member. Connecticut: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, election worker, armed forces member, religious beliefs/practice. Delaware: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, working during voting hours, religious beliefs/practice, armed forces member. Indiana: Illness/disability, caregiver, out of the county, work, religious reasons, aged 65+, election worker, armed forces or public safety officer, 'serious sex offender', state address confidentiality program. When does early voting begin in my state? Kentucky: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, state address confidentiality program, elderly age. Louisiana: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, state address confidentiality program, elderly age, military forces, aged 65+, involuntary confinement, incarceration, jury duty, religious practices. Is USPS prepared for the 2024 election? Mississippi: Out of county, illness/disability, aged 65+, work, caregivers, incarceration for a non-disenfranchising crime. Missouri: Out of county, illness/disability, religious beliefs/practices, election worker, essential worker, incarceration, state address confidentiality program. New Hampshire: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiving, work, religious beliefs/practices, incarceration, state address confidentiality program, protected by domestic violence protective order. South Carolina: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiving, work, aged 65+, incarceration, armed forces. Tennessee: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiving, work, aged 60+, reside in a nursing home, religious beliefs/practices, election worker, jury duty, military member. Texas: Out of county, illness/disability, work, expectant within three weeks before or after Election Day, incarceration. West Virginia: Out of county, illness/disability, work, state address confidentiality program, incarceration, first responder. How are mail-in votes counted? According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in 31 states voters must sign an affidavit on their ballot envelope which helps ballot workers verify their signature against their voter registration record. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Ten states require a copy of personal identification or the ballot to be notarized or have a witness signature — Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. Ten other states — Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming — plus Washington D.C., verify that a signature is on an absentee, but do not verify the signature itself. What are the pros and cons of mail-in voting? Proponents of absentee voting suggest it is a more cost-effective measure than in-person voting. It also allows for greater convenience and increased participation, particularly for those who would not be able to vote due to work or geographical constraints, among others. The primary concern of mail-in and absentee voting is the integrity of elections and the threat of voter fraud. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

However that notion can be countered by earlier voters tending to be more partisan compared to undecided voters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/mail-in-absentee-voting-how/	2024-11-04T13:39:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2175014852.jpg?w=900
Are ballot selfies illegal?	(NewsNation) — Some enthusiastic voters may have to resist the urge to post a photo of their marked ballot this election season as many states ban sharing ballot selfies. Sharing selfies of completed ballots has become a way some voters show who they supported, but concerns over coercion and even bribery have led at least 14 states to make it illegal. Voting in secret has long been a staple in American history, but the explosion of social media and ballot selfies has caused the secrecy issue to resurface, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Three governors races to watch this November Some free speech groups say voters should be able to share ballot selfies, which has forced lawmakers to weigh free speech against concerns of maintaining order against bribery, coercion and the risk of exposing others’ ballots. There is no federal law regulating ballot selfies, leaving the issue up to each individual state. What states make ballot selfies illegal? At least 14 states have made it illegal to take a ballot selfie, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. These include Alaska, Montana, Illinois, Nevada, South Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, West Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. In Texas and Tennessee, ballot selfies during in-person voting are illegal, but there is no law prohibiting or allowing absentee ballot selfies, according to the group. In Michigan, voters can post photos of their marked ballot as long as they don’t share them while they are at the polling place. However, voters cannot include themselves in the photo with their ballot. Many other states do not have explicit laws on ballot selfies, including Oregon, Idaho, Kansas and Maine.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Many government officials have defended the restrictions, saying they could lead to a host of other problems for voters. Former Idaho Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck told Vox in 2020 that he worries that in the age of 'cancel culture,' if 'a secret ballot were breached, if people knew how other people were voting,' there could be consequences. A spokesperson for Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft told the outlet that 'the secrecy of your ballot ensures that there cannot be voter intimidation.' Intimidation is also cited as a reason to preserve secrecy. In 2020, a Florida company president sent a letter in his employees’ paystubs that told them layoffs could be imminent if 'Biden and the Democrats win,' KTRK-TV reported. The outlet noted that 'some employees ... feel they were threatened with being laid off if they did not support President Donald Trump.' Where are ballot selfies legal? Several states have gone in the opposite direction and explicitly allowed voters to share ballot photos. These states include California, Washington, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Iowa, Alabama, Hawaii, Kentucky, Virginia and New Hampshire. 'Sharing a ballot selfie is a magnificent display of civic participation,' Marc Levine, the member of the California State Assembly who led the charge on amending the law in 2016 to allow ballot photos, told The New York Times. Some groups pushing for ballot selfies to be legal in every state say the original intent to preserve secrecy was designed to prevent vote-selling and voter coercion, but that is no longer the case. The net worth of richest Congress members 'The evil it was trying to address was a union boss or employer following workers into a polling place and making them show who they voted for,' Leo Glickman, a lawyer who argued that the law violates the right to freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, told the outlet. But there’s no evidence that is happening today, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said. The group says that no state has offered even a single example of someone taking and sharing a ballot selfie for the purpose of committing a crime. What is the punishment for posting illegally? Punishments for posting ballot selfies in states where it's illegal vary by each state. In Nevada, a violation is a felony with a sentence of one to four years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. In Illinois, it's a Class 4 felony, which carries penalties of one to three years in prison and a maximum fine of $25,000. A selfie post will get a voter 'not more than six months [in prison] or by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars' in Massachusetts.

Election officials asked her to take down her post, but Hogarth refused and filed a lawsuit against the state Board of Elections over the letter.

How are presidential election votes counted?	(NewsNation) — Finalizing the results of a presidential election is often a slower process than voters realize — a misunderstanding that makes it easier for misinformation to take root. As Nov. 5 draws near, former President Donald Trump is repeating claims about voter fraud and planting new seeds of doubt about the process this time around. Violent threats against poll workers increasing ahead of election Here’s how the ballot counting process works and what you can expect on election night. When do election officials start counting votes? Election officials publish unofficial results after the polls close on Election Day. Those results will fluctuate as in-person, mail-in, provisional, overseas and military ballots are counted. Each state has its own rules for when different kinds of ballots can be counted. Throughout election night and — in some states — several days later, unofficial results will periodically change to reflect those totals. How are ballots counted? Election officials need to process mail-in ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. Trump and Harris pledged to save Social Security. Here’s what they’ll do. While some states begin processing mail-in votes before Election Day, others can process them the same day as the election before polls close. Once those ballots are processed, how and when they’re counted and reflected in live, unofficial results vary greatly. When will the presidential election results be final? Results you see the night of the election, the next morning, and often weeks later are always unofficial. It typically takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Before anything is official, a joint session of Congress must take place to count the Electoral College votes for president and vice president. Why does it take so long to finalize election results? Once election officials in each jurisdiction receive every ballot, they need to canvass them. That usually means analyzing vote totals to find and fix any discrepancies between the number of voters and the number of ballots cast, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. What to know about poll watchers Most states also conduct audits as an extra measure to make sure their totals are accurate. Once canvasses and audits are done, the election results are certified as final. Can election results change after votes are certified and final? Yes. Some races may be subject to a recount after the certification process if it was a close call or if a candidate or interest group requests it. In those cases, every ballot in a contest is recounted and could hypothetically change the official results. Recounts have flipped the results in three non-presidential races. They helped Al Franken win his Minnesota Senate seat in 2008 and led Thomas Salmon to secure his role as Vermont state auditor in 2006. Christine Gregorie was also declared the winner of the Washington gubernatorial race in 2004 after a recount. All three candidates were Democrats.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/how-are-presidential-election-votes-counted/	2024-11-04T13:36:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2059253561.jpg?w=900
What to know about poll watchers	(NewsNation) — Thousands of poll watchers will be observing the election process this November in an effort to catch any irregularities. These volunteers have long served an integral role as the eyes and ears for political parties to ensure that the actual mechanics of voting are administered fairly and accurately. In the years since former President Donald Trump made unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020, the Republican National Committee has said that it hopes to recruit 100,000 poll watchers in 13 states this year. The party said it will deploy monitors to observe every step of the election process, create hotlines for poll watchers to report perceived problems and escalate those issues by taking legal action. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Both parties have a long history of organizing supporters to serve as poll monitors, and the Democratic National Committee said it plans its own volunteer recruitment effort. Several election officials in presidential swing states said they feel this kind of transparency and engagement is one of the best ways to help skeptics feel confident in the many safeguards baked into the election process. Research shows that fraud is very rare, voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent, and many instances of alleged fraud are, in fact, mistakes by voters or administrators, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan institute at the New York University School of Law. What do poll watchers report? Watchers are appointed by political parties, candidates or ballot issue groups to observe some portion of the election process without interfering in the voting process, according to the Election Assistance Commission. They must go through a training program on election rules before manning polls. Watcher duties vary under state law but largely include keeping track of voter turnout for their parties and making sure that the election rules are being followed. How to register to vote In some states, watchers are allowed to challenge an individual voter’s eligibility and report any potential issues. However, no states allow poll watchers to stop or otherwise try to interfere with someone trying to vote. They do their jobs by flagging issues for the current authorities, who will then look into the claims. Poll watchers have played an integral role in the election process. After the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, watchers were able to monitor elections to help realize the law’s promise of rooting out voting discrimination in places that still sought to suppress Black voters, according to the Brennan Center. Who can be a poll watcher? Qualifications vary by state, but poll watchers generally must be registered voters, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In most states, political parties, candidates and ballot issue committees can appoint poll watchers. In some states, organizations and civic groups can also appoint poll watchers, according to the organization. States differ on whether the poll watcher must be registered in the county or precinct rather than just in the state. Several states exclude law enforcement officers from being poll watchers. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Many states also limit the number of poll watchers at a voting location to ensure the voting process is not disrupted and may be explicit about what a poll watcher may and may not do at a polling location. When poll watchers become disruptive While poll watchers are supposed to be silent observers they can and have run the risk of disruption. Their access to spaces and records that are otherwise off-limits to the public creates a risk of abuse, according to the Brennan Center. Watchers can also cross the line with voter intimidation, harassment of election workers, the spread of disinformation and coordinated efforts to undermine elections, the group said. During Texas’s 2020 elections, a poll watcher accused a voter of not looking like a U.S. citizen and demanded to see their ID, the Brennan Center reported. In Arizona’s Pima County's early voting period in 2022, watchers complained loudly about 'fraudulent elections' and repeatedly tried to view private voter data, according to Time. When does early voting begin in my state? Election workers in Wayne County, North Carolina, had to move watchers who stood between voters and voting machines in 2022. 'You need to back off!' Anne Risku, the election director in North Carolina’s Wayne County, told a poll watcher who wedged herself between a voter and the machine. While there have been concerns about strengthening guardrails for poll watchers, several states have moved in the opposite direction. Florida and North Carolina recently changed their laws to grant watchers additional access. The Florida law has already led to an increase in watchers and subsequent challenges to voter eligibility.

Trump says he'll put ex-NFL player in charge of US missile shield	(The Hill) - Former President Trump told supporters Sunday that he wants to put former NFL player and failed GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker in charge of a new missile defense shield if elected. Walker, a staunch ally of Trump, appeared at a rally in Macon, Ga., where he flubbed the GOP presidential candidate’s name twice. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics 'It is time for it to stop, and it stops on Tuesday when we vote for my friend, and your friend, Donald Trump Jr. — Donald Trump. Jonald J. Trump,' Walker said at the end of his speech. Trump, who spoke after Walker, said if elected, he would 'build a missile defense shield all made in the USA,' and 'put Herschel Walker in charge of that little sucker.' Trump over the past year has declared that he would create an 'Iron Dome' for the United States in a second term, referring to the missile defense system used by Israel. Democrats call for investigation into grocery prices On Sunday, he said 'a lot of' such a system would be built in Georgia. But Iron Dome is used against short-range missiles, and any such system built to protect the U.S. mainland would come with an astronomical price tag and little use in stopping mid- to long-range missiles, such as from North Korea or Russia. It is unclear if Trump meant Walker would be in charge of overseeing all U.S. missile defenses or the process of building a new system. Walker spent 12 seasons in the NFL beginning in the late 1980s before retiring and pursuing business ventures in food processing, with no experience in missile defense or national security. He eventually made his way to politics and served under Trump as a co-chair of the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition from 2019 to 2020. Walker launched his first political campaign in Georgia's 2022 Senate election, during which he supported finishing Trump’s southern border wall and for Washington to 'heavily invest' in the military. Walker’s campaign, however, was plagued by controversies and baffling and false statements. He mistakenly said there were 52 states, falsely claimed he was once an FBI agent, and lied about graduating from the University of Georgia, when in reality he had left to play professional football and did not complete his degree.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-herschel-walker-missile-shield/	2024-11-04T11:27:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24309007583298-e1730746223488.jpg?w=900
Border important issue in battleground states like Arizona	(NewsNation) — Both candidates in the 2024 election have been talking about immigration, with Republican former President Donald Trump promising the country’s largest mass deportations in history and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris arguing to voters she is going to be tough on the border. In battleground border states like Arizona, this is an especially hot topic. Migrants arriving at Yuma in 2021 had to wait for so long for Border Patrol they began walking through the city looking for help. The regional medical center was sitting on more than $26 million in uncompensated migrant care. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Last year, in Lukeville, Arizona, thousands of migrants from Africa came across the border through holes cut in the wall by cartel members. NewsNation crews were there when more than 800 men waiting along the border to be transported were processed. The majority of fentanyl seized last year also came through Arizona. Immigration has had a profound impact on the economy. About 50% of the labor market’s recent growth came from foreign-born workers between January 2023 and January 2024, according to The Economic Policy Institute analysis of federal data. What Trump, Harris have said about the border Trump supporters have linked migrants to the rising cost of housing and said that the number of migrants coming into the country means they're taking jobs from American citizens. Democrats have noted that experts don't agree with Trump's comments on housing prices and say the Republican nominee's mass deportation plan would hurt employment opportunities for all Americans. The Biden administration’s early struggles to address the record number of people who poured across the border over the last 3 1/2 years may have done more damage than they can recover from despite unlawful crossings between the ports of entry being down. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said at a rally in Scottsdale on Saturday that this election's stakes 'could not be higher.' 'Arizona knows that better than almost any state in the union,' Vance said. 'There are over 453,000 illegal immigrants in this state because Kamala Harris refuses to do her job.' During an Oct. 29 speech, Harris said politicians need to stop treating immigration 'as an issue to scare up votes in an election and instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is, that we must finally come together to solve.' 'I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the border security bill that Donald Trump killed,' Harris said. Harris has leaned heavily on the failed Senate border bill as part of her campaign. However, opponents of the bill say it would have meant amnesty for millions and an open door for many more each year. The Border Patrol union pulled its support for the bill, and the National Sheriff's Association also came out in opposition to it. Arizona border ballot measure Arizona residents will consider a new ballot measure that would give more power to local officials when it comes to enforcing immigration law. Proposition 314 would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter Arizona from anywhere other than a port of entry, as well as allow for state judges to order deportations. In addition, state and local police would be given the power to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization. Supporters of the bill say something has to change after the state became such a hotbed for human and drug smuggling. Opponents call it reminiscent of the controversial Senate Bill 1070, which made it a crime to be in the state without immigration papers. They say that bill basically allowed law enforcement to racially profile people if they speculated that they crossed the border illegally. Senate Bill 1070, passed in 2010, was stripped down by the U.S. Supreme Court after it deemed aspects of the legislation unconstitutional in 2012.

Betting odds show Trump favored but Harris rising	(NewsNation) — Polls show former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are dead even heading into Election Day, and betting markets have also become closer in recent days. Unlike polling averages, which are primarily based on aggregated survey data, prediction markets offer insight into where people are putting their money. Those markets allow users to wager on the outcomes of future events. Betting platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket and PredictIt have shown Trump as the favorite since mid-October, which remains the case, but Harris' chances have improved recently. Election odds in every 2024 swing state Kalshi, a prediction market startup, shows Trump with a 53% chance of winning, compared to 47% for Harris, as of Nov. 4 at 11 a.m. A week ago, Trump was at 60%. Nearly $200 million has been wagered so far, according to Kalshi. Polymarket — which has seen more than $3 billion in bets on the election — showed Trump favored at 56% compared to Harris at 44%, as of midday Nov. 4. Last week, Trump was above 66% at one point. Another platform, PredictIt, showed Harris with an edge. A contract for a Harris win was priced at 54 cents versus 53 cents from Trump around 11 a.m. Nov. 4. That's an improvement for Harris from a week ago when Trump was at 59 cents, and Harris was at 45 cents. The RealClearPolitics betting average showed Trump with a 56% chance of winning and Harris at 43% as of Nov. 4. Note: Betting odds change from minute to minute, and the current percentages may not be reflected above. Are betting markets more reliable than polls? A U.S. appeals court cleared the way for election betting last month, and many are looking to gambling markets as a reliable indicator of which way the election will go. Proponents of prediction markets argue that they are better forecasters because they're more responsive to breaking developments than polls. In other words: Bettors are economically motivated to factor in new information faster. 'Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,' Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune last month. While it's true betting markets have generally been good forecasters of U.S. elections, there are some caveats to keep in mind. For one, betting platforms may be susceptible to manipulation. A Frenchman recently bet more than $30 million on Polymarket predicting a Trump victory, according to the Wall Street Journal. 'Even though volumes have surged on Polymarket this year, it is still small enough for one wealthy, opinionated individual to push prices around with a multimillion-dollar bet,' the WSJ noted. Big bets on Trump don't mean the market is rigged Other research from academics at the University of Arizona and University of Kansas suggests 'manipulating political stock markets is difficult and expensive to do for more than a short period.' Michael Schwimer, founder of the sports betting consultant firm JAMBOS Analytics, dismissed betting manipulation concerns in a recent NewsNation interview. He pointed out that international bets for Trump can't rig the markets any more than a big bet on the World Cup will affect how the game is played. PredictIt has an $850 cap on individual bets, which limits the potential for a single person to sway the odds. Liberty Vittert, a professor of data science at Washington University and the resident on-air statistician for NewsNation, also cautioned against reading too much into betting markets. '[Bettors] are betting on nothing more substantial than the 'vibes' that once made Harris’ victory seem inevitable earlier this summer,' Vittert wrote in a recent op-ed for The Hill. She added: 'In 2016, Hillary Clinton was the 88 percent favorite to win on the Sunday before the election. If you had the bright idea of putting your life savings on the easy favorite in hopes of making a quick buck, you lost it all.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/betting-odds-2024-election/	2024-11-04T11:03:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24304037053551.jpg?w=900
Has the Electoral College ever favored Democrats?	(NEXSTAR) — Did you know there have been five U.S. Presidential Elections in which the winner lost the popular vote? The Electoral College has voted to elect John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Benjamin Harrison in the distant past, and George W. Bush and Donald Trump in modern times. Ignoring the presidents of the distant past, as the political parties at those times were in flux and differed from today's Republicans and Democrats, it's easy to see why some argue the Electoral College has recently only benefitted Republicans. Can you vote in person if you were mailed a ballot? The Electoral College has famously decided a different winner in two modern-day elections: the 2000 Election and the 2016 Election — both Electoral College votes favored the Republican candidates who lost the popular vote, George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The reputational fallout of these votes — where the College appeared not to side with the will of the American people — has contributed to an increasingly unfavorable view of the Electoral College over the past few decades. Earlier this month, Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz even called for abolishing the Electoral College, though the Harris campaign later said this was not part of the official platform. 'I think all of us know, the Electoral College needs to go,' said Walz. 'We need a national popular vote.' Recently, Pew Research found that 64% of Americans (over 6 in 10) say they'd prefer the winner of the U.S. presidential elections be decided by national popular vote only. About 35% polled favored keeping the Electoral College. ‘He’ll never know’: 1 in 4 people lie about who they vote for When broken apart by political party, Pew Research found that most Democrats (87%) say they'd prefer the president be elected by popular vote only. Meanwhile, only 46% of Republicans say the same. Sixty-one percent of Moderates and more liberal Republicans said they'd prefer only a popular vote. Despite proposals to change or abolish the Electoral College (the University of Central Florida reports there have been over 1,000), there are many reasons why these attempts failed. Firstly, as UCF History Professor John Sacher explains, the Electoral College is part of the U.S. Constitution — and amending the Constitution is complicated and difficult. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Additionally, Sacher argues that the Electoral College is useful in instances like the 2000 Presidential Election. Despite Gore winning a plurality of the popular vote, he didn't win a majority. Neither Bush nor Gore won the majority and it fell upon the electors to decide. Sacher explains: 'We are the only nation that still uses an Electoral College... Given that this discussion has already lasted well over 100 years, we may be in for 100 more.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/electoral-college-democrats/	2024-11-04T11:02:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1284095375-1-e1730308594799.jpg?w=800
Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voter...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris has shaken the 2024 election, putting pressure on her Republican opponent since she entered the race in July. Since replacing President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket, Harris has quickly gained momentum, posing a threat to the healthy lead former President Donald Trump held over Biden, both nationally and in swing states. Harris has since announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, who himself has since extinguished any Democratic doubts during his performance at the DNC. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day Ohio Sen. JD Vance‘s nomination as Trump’s vice president pits him against Walz. Ahead of the 2024 election, NewsNation is committed to covering the issues that matter most to voters so they can make the most informed choices possible at the polls. Here is how the leading candidates’ policies compare on key voter issues. You can also read specific policy breakdowns for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Abortion Border crisis Climate change Crime Fentanyl crisis and opioid epidemic Inflation Israel-Palestine conflict Policing and gun safety Project 2025 Social Security War in Ukraine Abortion Trump During the September debate, Trump falsely said Democrats support abortions in the third trimester and after birth. No state in the country allows termination after birth. He refused to commit to vetoing a national abortion ban. When asked directly if he would veto a ban, Trump indicated Congress wouldn’t need to pass one. The former president wouldn’t initially say during a town hall whether he supports a federal abortion ban. He called the overturning of the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade 'a great victory' during a CNN town hall. In April 2024, he said on his social media platform Truth Social that it’d be best if states handled abortion the way their constituents want, adding he’s in favor of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Also said on Truth Social that he 'strongly' supports fertility treatments and that he 'has never and will never' advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives. Harris Harris said women do not want abortion bans, speaking about women who are miscarrying and denied care because doctors are afraid to go to jail and young teens who are incest victims being forced to give birth. She committed to signing a bill to protect the right to abortion across the U.S. Harris is aligned with Biden in her view on abortion and said 'everything is at stake' regarding women’s reproductive rights. The vice president is in favor of ensuring all American women have access to legal abortions. 'Every person of whatever gender should understand that, if such a fundamental freedom such as the right to make decisions about your own body can be taken, be aware of what other freedoms may be at stake,' Harris said in a joint MSNBC interview with Hadley Duvall, an abortion rights advocate from Kentucky who was raped by her stepfather as a child. Harris falsely wrote on X that Trump would ban abortion nationwide. She then added: 'President Joe Biden and I will do everything in our power to stop him and restore women’s reproductive freedom.' Harris also visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota in March, describing the banning or heavy restriction of abortions as 'immoral.' 'How dare these elected leaders believe they are in a better position to tell women what they need,' Harris said at the time. 'We have to be a nation that trusts women.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: VP picks' political views Border crisis Trump Trump and his allies have falsely accused Haitian immigrants in the small Ohio town of Springfield of abducting and eating pets. There’s no evidence that the community is doing that, officials told The Associated Press. The former president would launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, paid for with redirected military funds, Reuters reported. He would restore his 2019 'Remain in Mexico' program, which required asylum-seekers at the U.S. border to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed. Trump said he would end what he called 'catch and release' and instead detain all migrants who are caught entering the United States without authorization or violating other immigration laws. He'd also deputize the U.S. National Guard and local law enforcement to help with rapid deportations, according to Reuters. The former president said he would enact travel bans denying entry to people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and 'anywhere else that threatens our security.' Block communists, Marxists and socialists from entering the U.S. and send deportation officers to 'pro-Hamas' protests. End 'birthright' citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. End Biden’s immigration parole program and roll back Temporary Protected Status designations. Try again to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly referred to as DACA. While he was president, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the Southwest border, according to the Associated Press. Harris Among Republicans, Harris has the ironic moniker of 'border czar,' owing to her work wherein she oversaw diplomacy with Mexico and the Northern Triangle as a means of addressing 'root causes' of migration. Biden gave her the responsibility of manning everything immigration along the southern border in 2021, with her role, according to the White House at the time, to stem the arrival of 'irregular migrants.' Republicans heavily criticized the Biden-Harris approach to the border, a hot-button issue this election cycle. Under the Biden-Harris administration, migrants crossing into the US from Mexico hit record highs at the end of 2023. Close to 250,000 crossed during December 2023, surpassing the previous high of 224,000 encounters in May of 2022, also under the Biden-Harris watch. Harris announced in March that $5.2 billion in pledges from private companies had been made to prop up Central American communities to deter illegal entry to the U.S. under her guidance. 'The problems, of course, did not occur overnight, and the solutions will not be achieved overnight,' Harris said of the border at the time. Climate change Trump During the September debate, Trump falsely claimed that under Harris there would 'be no fossil fuels' and the country would 'go back to windmills.' At one point, Trump called himself a 'fan' of solar but then criticized solar farms that take up large plots of land. Claimed he will end the 'Green New Deal atrocities' on his first day if reelected. The measure was never signed into law. Said he would free up stores of liquid gold for energy development. Vowed to speed up approval of natural gas pipelines into the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York. Exit the Paris Climate Agreement again. Trump previously pulled the U.S. from the agreement, but Biden rejoined upon taking office. Said he would fight litigation from environmentalists. Harris During the September debate, Harris also called for investment in 'diverse' sources of energy, 'So we reduce our reliance on foreign oil.' Harris has backed the Biden administration’s climate initiatives, including legislation providing billions in tax credits for renewable energy and electric vehicles, the New York Times reported. 'The clock is not just ticking, it is banging,' she said last year, referencing climate change-driven disasters. She noted the administration made 'the largest climate investment in America’s history.' During her 2020 presidential bid, Harris emphasized environmental justice, addressing climate change’s effects on poor and minority communities. She’s continued this focus as vice president. In 2019, as a senator, Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., proposed legislation to evaluate environmental rules’ impact on low-income communities. It would have created an Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability and climate justice advisers in federal agencies. Harris introduced a broader version in 2020. Neither bill passed, The New York Times reported. How are presidential election votes counted? Crime Trump Said he would move homeless encampments out of cities. Vowed to give police more authority, deploy the military to fight the nation’s drug problem and impose the death penalty for convicted drug dealers. Promised to deliver record funding to hire and retrain police officers, strengthen qualified immunity and increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. Said he would send federal prosecutors and the National Guard into high-crime communities, according to his campaign website. As president, Trump granted pardons to 73 people and commuted the sentences of an additional 70. That includes former staff members and advisers such as Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Stephen K. Bannon and George Papadopoulos. Harris Harris, in April, hosted reality television star Kim Kardashian at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform after the Biden administration granted clemency to people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. The U.S. incarcerates more people than any other country. About 1 in 5 of those 1.9 million people are behind bars for a drug-related offense. Black and Latino people are disproportionately incarcerated, and drug law reform has the broadest support among young voters. Black, Latino and young voters tend to favor Democrats. 'Everybody makes mistakes, and for some, that might rise to the level of being a crime,' Harris said at the White House. 'But is it not the sign of a civil society that we allow people a way to earn their way back and give them the support and the resources they need to do that?' Harris’ record as California attorney general, however, drew the ire of many progressives during her 2020 bid for the presidency. During her seven years as a district attorney and then six as attorney general, she defended the cash bail system in a pair of federal court cases, shifting course only weeks before she entered the Senate. As a presidential candidate in 2020, she pledged a wholesale overhaul of the country’s criminal justice system, arguing for marijuana legalization, bail reform and a moratorium on the death penalty. Vice President Harris will face off with Republican nominee former President Trump this November for the White House. (Associated Press) Fentanyl crisis and opioid epidemic Trump Said he would 'impose a total naval embargo on cartels.' Vowed to designate cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Promised to order the Department of Defense to 'inflict maximum damage' on cartel leadership and operations. Said he would seek death penalty eligibility for cartel members and traffickers. Said he would permanently designate fentanyl as a federally controlled substance. Promised to threaten China with 'a steep price' unless it works to end the export of fentanyl’s chemical precursors. Vowed to create partnerships to encourage companies to provide job opportunities and skills training to people recovering from addiction. Said he would expand federal support for faith-based counseling, treatment and recovery programs. Promised family leave to care for relatives trying to overcome addiction. Harris In May 2024, the Biden-Harris administration announced the approval of over $1.5 billion in state or tribal opioid response funding to address the overdose crisis. Harris gathered state attorneys general from across the country at the White House in July 2023 to discuss fentanyl and illicit drugs in America. 'We each recognize and have joined together today because we are facing a public health crisis, and it also, therefore, is an issue that must have a response that addresses the underlying public health concerns that are both about addiction and treatment,' Harris said. Harris wants to increase access to and the affordability of naloxone, which reverses overdoses, with the vice president calling it 'the difference between life or death.' How do Donald Trump, Kamala Harris’ net worths compare? Inflation and economy Trump Promised 'lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for American workers' by enacting universal baseline tariffs that 'reward domestic production' and tax foreign companies. Said he would lower interest rates. Claimed to have achieved the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years — 3.5% with 6.4 million added jobs before the pandemic. During his presidency, federal debt held by the public rose from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion, influenced by Trump’s tax cuts, particularly his slashes to the corporate tax rate, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center’s FactCheck project. Trump is proposing tax cuts for big businesses and the wealthy to spur investment. He said his tax cuts would garner 3% growth, a milestone he did not reach in his first term. Trump has proposed broad tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. He has proposed no taxes on tips or Social Security income. Harris Shortly after taking office as vice president for Biden, the administration signed the American Rescue Plan, a $2 trillion stimulus package that delivered checks to Americans, boosted unemployment insurance benefits and expanded the child tax credit. Inflation peaked at a four-decade high of 9% in summer 2022 but has since receded to around 3.5%. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, which invested in clean energy that the White House estimates created 117,000 jobs and will reduce Americans’ energy costs by as much as 9% by 2030. Harris has said inflation was a high priority for the administration. 'The President and our administration’s probably highest priority is bringing down the price of gas and cost of living,' Harris said. During her time as a senator, Harris tried to get a bill passed where tax credits up to $6,000 would be available for middle- and low-income households. Harris has also been a strong proponent of forgiving student debt, spearheading the Biden administration’s move to abolish debt for several hundred thousand students at Corinthian Colleges. In 2017, she co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’ proposal for free college for middle-class students at four-year public schools and all who attended two-year institutions. Harris wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and big businesses to fund investments in housing and tax credits for parents. She has proposed more financial assistance for first-time homebuyers and expanded tax credits for parents. She also wants to cut taxes for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Harris wants to remove taxes on tips. .

Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Harris When asked how to handle the war in the Middle East, Harris said that Israel has a right to defend itself, citing the Oct. 7 attacks, while also saying that too many Palestinian civilians have been killed during fighting in Gaza. She said the war must end, there must be a cease-fire deal, and the hostages must be released by Hamas. Harris called for an 'immediate cease-fire' in Gaza in March, describing the situation as a 'humanitarian catastrophe,' the New York Times reported. She said Hamas’ threat to Israel 'must be eliminated' but added that 'too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.' She opposed an Israeli invasion of Rafah, southern Gaza, where over a million people had fled. 'I have studied the maps. There’s nowhere for those folks to go,' she said, noting about 1.5 million people were there after being told to go. Harris has repeatedly expressed support for a two-state solution. Policing and gun safety Trump During his first presidential campaign, Trump positioned himself as a defender of the Second Amendment. A Trump-era ban on bump stocks was overturned by the Supreme Court in June 2024, which said the Trump administration overstepped when it banned the rapid-fire gun attachments. After the May 24, 2022, Uvalde, Texas, shooting at Robb Elementary School, Trump called for 'drastically' changing the nation’s approach to mental health and 'a top-to-bottom security overhaul. at schools across this country' but dismissed calls for further firearm restrictions, AP reported. Trump vowed at an event sponsored by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in February to undo Biden-era gun restrictions if reelected. Harris Harris said during the September debate that she's a gun owner She has called for implementing universal background checks and expanding red flag laws to take away guns from people who are deemed dangerous or unstable. She also wants to ban so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Harris took a tough stand on policing in the wake of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. She co-sponsored legislation in the Senate that would’ve banned police from using chokeholds and no-knock warrants, set a national use-of-force standard and created a national police misconduct registry, among other things. It would have also reformed the qualified immunity system that shields officers from liability. The list in the legislation included practices Harris did not vocally fight to reform while leading California’s Department of Justice. And while she now wants independent investigations of police shootings, she didn’t support a 2015 California bill that would have required her office to take on such cases. In June, as vice president, Harris said that more needed to be done at the federal level to prevent gun violence during a campaign stop in Maryland. Harris, after high-profile shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, in 2022, called for a ban on assault-style weapons. Kamala Harris’ political views, from the border to the economy Project 2025 Trump At the September debate, Trump pushed back claims he's tied to plan, saying, 'I have nothing to do with Project 2025. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it purposely.' Trump has previously disavowed the controversial project, posting on his social media site that he has 'no idea' who is behind Project 2025 and knows 'nothing' about it, but dozens of people who worked closely with him and helped shape his administration are involved in the plan. 'I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,' he wrote. 'Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.' Trump’s campaign has previously said he sets his own priorities and that outside groups don’t speak for him. However, Trump's running mate, Vance, appears to have close ties with the people who had a hand in writing the conservative policy playbook. Harris One of Harris’ main points of attack on the Republican ticket is Project 2025, which she warns will go into effect should Trump get reelected. Harris has seized on the plan, linking it directly to Trump. At the September debate, Harris alleged Trump would sign a national abortion ban, referencing Project 2025. She said Americans believe the government should not control the freedom to make decisions about their body. Harris has pushed back against Trump’s denials, saying he will implement the conservative plan 'hatched by people who used to work for Donald Trump that focuses on the first 180 days' on her campaign website. Harris has spoken about Project 2025 numerous times both while campaigning for Biden and after she became the Democratic nominee for president. Her campaign website has a page dedicated to Project 2025 calling it 'Trump’s plan to take your power, your control and your money.' 'Donald Trump’s plans for a full government takeover have been exposed,' it reads, adding 'his Project 2025 agenda would strip away our freedoms.' At a campaign rally in Wisconsin, Harris said Project 2025 was a 'plan to weaken the middle class.' Harris’ running mate, Walz, also has spoken out against the conservative guidebook. 'Don’t believe him when he’s playing dumb about this Project 2025,' Walz said at a Glendale, Arizona, rally. 'He knows exactly what it will do. They are not playing. They wrote their plan out.' Harris has presented a diametrically opposite position on the issues Project 2025 aims to restructure. Social Security Trump Told Republicans in Congress not to cut 'a single penny' from Medicare or Social Security. Later made comments suggesting he was open to cuts to Medicare and Social Security; his team walked these back and claimed the remarks were taken out of context. Encouraged Republicans to focus their funding cuts on areas of 'waste, fraud and abuse' in addition to programs dealing with foreign aid, immigration, climate change and LGBTQ rights, Reuters reported. Said in a campaign statement he would reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. Harris When she was a U.S. senator for California, she supported the Social Security Expansion Act, which is now championed by leaders including Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., CNBC reported. As vice president, in Biden’s 2024 budget proposal, the administration called for 'protecting and strengthening' Social Security but offered few specifics on reforms to the program, CNBC reported. During the 2020 campaign, the administration proposed raising taxes on those making more than $400,000 to shore up Social Security but largely dropped the idea after taking office, Politico reported. The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare has endorsed Democrats’ Social Security plans, which call for applying additional taxes on wealthy individuals with incomes over $400,000, CNBC reported.

Falsely claimed that the war had killed 'millions' since Russia invaded Ukraine 2 1/2 years ago, while the United Nations says 11,700 civilian deaths have been verified. Called for a cease-fire in an official campaign statement. Said he could 'solve the conflict in a single day.' Trump: 'Every day this proxy battle in Ukraine continues, we risk global war.' More generally suggests overhauling the State Department, the 'defense bureaucracy' and intelligence services to fire who he called members of a 'deep state.' What are Donald Trump’s stances on major issues to voters? Harris Harris praised American and NATO support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion so far — and called for it to continue. Harris announced that the U.S. would donate over $1.5 billion to Ukraine, with funds coming from the State Department and USAID. The financial assistance will aid infrastructure, security, energy and refugee assistance. Harris has been in lockstep with Biden about helping Ukraine amid its war with Russia. During the June summit regarding peace in Ukraine, Harris spoke about the American commitment to the Eastern European nation.

Harris campaigns in Pennsylvania on eve of election	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Pennsylvania on Monday as she makes her final appeal to voters one day before the presidential election. Harris is scheduled to attend rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia alongside celebrities like DJ Cassidy, Fate Joe, Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey. She’ll begin by speaking at a campaign rally at 2:10 p.m. ET in Allentown, Pennsylvania, followed by a 9 p.m. ET rally in Pittsburgh and an 11 p.m. PT rally in Philadelphia. Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threats The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is neck-and-neck heading into Election Day. NewsNation’s partner Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) predicts Trump will win Pennsylvania by 53%. The Keystone State was a tipping point in the previous two presidential races. Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes are the most of any battleground state. Trump’s projected success would buck trends. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican for president by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Tuesday’s election remains a tossup in Pennsylvania, where Harris and Trump both had 50% chances of winning as recently as Oct. 20, according to DDHQ forecasts. This story is developing.

Trump stumps in battleground states in final push ahead of electi...	(NewsNation) — With election day less than 24 hour away, former President Donald Trump is making one final push to win over voters in battleground states. It's been four years since the former president lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, and since, he's been traveling the country and speaking to voters in hopes of returning to the Oval Office in January. Plus, it could be his last chance at becoming president a second time. Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threats Trump's last push ahead of election day Trump will watch the election results on Tuesday from his Mar-a-Largo Estate in Florida; but before then, he will barnstorm battleground states over the next 24 hours. Trump planned four rallies, beginning in Raleigh, North Carolina and stopping twice in Pennsylvania with events in Reading and Pittsburgh. The Republican nominee ends his campaign the way he ended the first two, with a late Monday night event in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Pennsylvania and Michigan are part of the 'blue wall' states for Democrats, and Trump's campaign hopes for a breakthrough. North Carolina is also seen as a must win state for the former president, but it's one where the polling shows an opportunity for Democrats to flip the traditionally Republican-leaning state. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Historic voter turnout Over the weekend, Trump's campaign made its final stretch, saying it's pleased with voter turnout already. The campaign told NewsNation their internal data shows the Trump campaign is turning out more mid and low-propensity voters, who are people who only vote in presidential elections or have never voted before. Trump spent the night in Georgia on Sunday, looking to build on the enthusiasm in the Peach State. 'You know we're on the five-yard line, maybe even the one-yard line. We're right there. We had a tremendous amount of early votes, records like no one can believe,' Trump said at his rally in Macon, Georgia. He continued, 'But all I can say is on Tuesday, just go out and vote. We're gonna close this thing out and it's gonna be party time.' Republicans are betting on voter turnout, arguing enthusiasm is on their side. About 77 million Americans already have voted early, but both candidates are pushing to turn out many millions more supporters on Tuesday. Either result on Election Day will yield a historic outcome. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said the Trump campaign was feeling 'bullish.' A Trump victory would make him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of a felony, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump would also become the second president in history to win non-consecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century.

Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threa...	(NewsNation) — With just two days until the presidential election, more than 77 million Americans have already cast their votes amid mounting legal challenges and concerns about election integrity. In Iowa, a federal judge ruled the state can continue challenging hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens, a decision critics say threatens the voting rights of new U.S. citizens. Recent polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading in Iowa by 3 percentage points. Legal battles are intensifying in key swing states, with both parties filing lawsuits challenging various aspects of the election process. The Republican National Committee has filed 135 lawsuits across 26 states over the past year, primarily concentrated in seven battleground states representing 93 electoral votes. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues In Pennsylvania, considered a crucial swing state, the Trump campaign secured a legal victory when early voting was extended in Bucks County after Republican voters reported being turned away. The state's Supreme Court also ruled in favor of Republicans by rejecting mail-in ballots without handwritten dates for the 2024 election. 'I think those cases are indicative of this overall strategy, which is kind of throw spaghetti at the wall strategy in challenging the integrity of our elections,' said Danielle Lang, Senior Director for the Voting Rights Program at Campaign Legal Center. 'It failed in 2020. They're getting a head start this time, but it's going to fail here as well, and the voters will decide this election, not political actors or litigation.' A Trump-aligned group is reportedly preparing to challenge this year's election results, citing concerns about voter fraud without providing evidence. If either candidate contests the results, they could file lawsuits or request recounts, potentially leading to Supreme Court involvement. The situation echoes the aftermath of the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump filed multiple lawsuits challenging the results. The Supreme Court declined to hear several of these cases, effectively upholding lower court rulings and the election outcome. Election officials and law enforcement are currently preparing for potential threats at polling locations as Americans express growing concern over election denialism.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/election-denial-polling-threats/	2024-11-03T18:00:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e378c8695379.01414579.jpeg?w=900
Republicans target weekend absentee ballot returns in Georgia	Republicans are taking aim at Democratic strongholds in Georgia that opened locations this weekend for voters to return their absentee ballots in person. The Republican National Committee (RNC) filed a new lawsuit Sunday after a state judge one day prior rejected allegations that deep-blue Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, was violating Georgia’s election law over its extension. Harris, Trump both see paths to victory as election nears Republicans cite a provision that mandates drop boxes close when in-person early voting, known as advance voting in Georgia, concludes, which it did Friday. The new case challenges both Fulton and six other Democratic-leaning counties that have similarly continued to accept hand-delivered absentee ballots through the weekend. It was filed in federal court and claims the practice violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection and its delegation of elections authority to state legislatures. 'The county’s actions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by granting special privileges to voters of those counties in violation of state law, thus arbitrarily and disparately affecting against voters and candidates in other counties,' the lawsuit states. The areas being sued include Fulton County and swaths of the Atlanta area that make up much of Democrats’ base in the key swing state: Cobb, DeKalb, Gwinnett and Clayton counties. The other two are Chatham County, which includes the city of Savannah, and Athens-Clarke County. President Biden won all seven counties in 2020 as he flipped Georgia blue in the presidential race for the first time in nearly three decades. This cycle, the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast estimates Trump has a 65 percent chance of winning the key battleground. The announcements to allow people to return absentee ballots in person this weekend and Monday quickly came under fire from the GOP. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now On Balance with Leland Vittert Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Republicans sued Fulton County late Friday night, leading to a hastily scheduled online hearing the following morning. Judge Kevin Farmer ruled in favor of the county, which was backed by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The state law provision at issue did not concern hand delivery of absentee ballots, he said. 'That refers to drop boxes. There are no drop boxes here. Drop boxes are off the table,' Farmer said. Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, said 305 absentee ballots were ultimately returned this weekend during the extension, which will continue Monday. Republicans have also criticized some of the counties for initially not letting the party’s poll watchers observe the continued ballot returns. RNC Chair Michael Whatley on Saturday wrote on the social platform X that observers were ultimately allowed inside. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Alex Kaufman, a Georgia attorney who represents the party, criticized Fulton County officials for announcing the extension just hours before it began. 'We have poll watchers that we would have had to have gone out. This clearly changes the time and conduct of the election at the last moment,' Kaufman said at Saturday's court hearing. The dispute over the extension is part of a broader legal battle playing out in key swing states over mail ballots. The current odds in every battleground state The DNC and other groups convinced a Georgia judge to extend the return deadline until Nov. 8, three days after Election Day, for 3,240 absentee voters whose mail ballots weren’t delivered in Cobb County. In Pennsylvania, the DNC similarly persuaded a state judge to extend additional options for Erie County voters that experienced mail ballot issues due to a vendor problem. The judge found that 365 voters received duplicate ballots and up to 17,000 others may not have received theirs. And in Bucks County, a populous area located north of Philadelphia, the Trump campaign won its lawsuit to extend on-demand mail balloting after voters reported long lines and being turned away early on the final day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-weekend-absentee-ballot-returns/	2024-11-03T16:05:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/georgia_lee_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Do you have to fill out the entire 2024 election ballot? Here's w...	(NEXSTAR) — With many high-stakes races on the ballot, voters face important decisions on Election Day, from presidential candidates to state and local measures. While some people may fill out a bubble in each section, others may be unsure about certain races and wonder: is it necessary to vote on every item? This can be especially true with lengthy ballots that contain numerous down-ballot races, judicial appointments, or proposals that may not have received widespread media coverage. Ballot box fires stoke fears of election violence Though widely encouraged, completing the entire ballot is not required. Ballots that are partially filled — referred to as 'undervoted' ballots — are still valid. So, you can opt to leave certain sections blank if you don't wish to vote on them. 'For example, a voter may choose to vote for president, senator, and governor, but not for other offices or ballot measures that are lower down on their ballot,' the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency explains on a website debunking election rumors. 'Even if a ballot includes an undervote in a particular contest, properly marked votes on their ballot are counted.'

(AP Photo/John Locher) To help make informed decisions, USA.gov, the federal government's official web portal, suggests reviewing voter guides and sample ballots before heading to the polls. Voter guides offer background information on candidates and ballot measures, including each candidate's experience, goals, and explanations of specific issues that will be on the ballot. You can find personalized guides using sites like Ballot Ready and Vote411. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics Sample ballots, on the other hand, simply show the elections, candidates, and measures you’ll encounter without additional information. Many local election offices offer downloadable sample ballots online, according to USA.gov. Voters can often bring these materials into the voting booth, which may be helpful to avoid memorizing each selection. However, some polling places restrict cell phone use, so paper copies may be the better option. Just make sure to check your local election office’s rules ahead of time.

DNC vice chair says 'we're prepared' for close race	Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Chair Ken Martin on Sunday projected confidence going into Election Day on Tuesday, saying Democrats have long prepared for a close race. 'I am really confident, in the end, not only with the early vote returns that we've seen, but also with the ground game that we have, that we'll be successful on election night,' Martin said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. 'Look, we've built this campaign from the very beginning; by the way, we knew this was going to be a close campaign, and we built it, and we're prepared for it,' he continued. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Martin said he tells voters to ignore the 'three Ps: polls, pundits and politicos' and said he was confident because Vice President Harris has the ground game going for her, and it’s riskier banking on low-propensity voters to turn out, which Martin suggested the Trump campaign is doing. 'One of the reasons we're buoyed, not only is the early vote returns that we're seeing throughout the nation, but also the fact that throughout all the battlegrounds, the only campaign that really has a sizable on-the-ground operation capable of actually getting their supporters to the polls, is the Harris-Walz campaign,' Martin said. 'And in the end, if you believe that this is a tied game, in the final quarter of the game, the tie has to go to the campaign that actually has the organization on the ground to get their voters and their supporters to the polls, and in all these battlegrounds, the only presence we're seeing on the ground in any sizable fashion is the Harris-Walz campaign,' he continued.

Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Michael Whatley said in a Sunday interview that he is confident in former President Trump's ability to win the Electoral College vote on Tuesday. 'We certainly have a great shot at winning the national vote, but I think more importantly is that we are going into Election Day with leads in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, and we are doing substantially better in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania than we were in either 2016 or in 2020,' Whatley said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. 'So we are in a great position to win this thing on Election Day,' he continued. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night The latest polling ahead of Election Day shows that Trump and Vice President Harris are locked in a close race, including in some of the key battleground states. In the national polling average from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points, with 48.3 percent support to Harris’s 48.1 percent. The polling averages in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia show Trump leading Harris by approximately 1 to 3 points. Trump leads Harris by an average of less than 1 point in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Michigan has Harris leading by an average of 0.2 points. 'We are very bullish,' Whatley continued in his interview. 'And Donald Trump is right now barnstorming across every one of these battleground states and talking directly with the American voters about the issues that they care about, and that's what's going to get him across the finish line.'

Harris, Trump both see paths to victory as election nears	The presidential race is tight, and neither candidate has a clear lead. But in the final weekend before Election Day, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump are ready to declare victory. Both campaigns say they have laid the groundwork to win. Both think they have the correct rationale for why they should win. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states The Harris campaign says their ground game will help see them through, pointing to more than 2,500 staffers and volunteers in key states. They also say issues like abortion along with Harris's favorability rating, which is several points higher than Trump’s in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill average of polls, will help catapult the vice president to the White House. At the same time, the Trump campaign points to polls that show that voters don't think the country is heading in the right direction, highlighting the recent rising costs and the overall 'vibe' of the economy. They also say Harris is tied to President Biden, whose own approval rating is underwater. Historically, they say when an incumbent has a low approval rating — Biden is at 40 percent — the opposing party prevails. They also feel good about their registration and early vote numbers. 'I think both sides have valid reasons for how and why a win is possible,' said one Democratic strategist close to the Harris campaign. 'That's part of the reason why it's so close and why neither side has the advantage. Every poll is ridiculously close.' A poll released by Gallup this week showed that approximately 49 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Harris compared to 44 percent for Trump. Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, also has a higher favorable rating at 45 percent than Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (Ohio), who is at 39 percent. Those numbers bode well for Harris, Gallup noted, because candidates with higher favorability ratings have typically won recent presidential elections. 'Honestly, there’s any number of data points and reasons I think Harris will win, but there’s also the Potter Stewart analogy: You may not be able to define a winning campaign, but you know it when you see it,' Democratic strategist Christy Setzer said. 'Harris continues to pack stadiums, generate excitement, while controlling the media narrative.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Since becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has leaned into abortion as an issue, and Democrats say that was a smart tack. They point to a recent NBC News poll that showed likely voters feel 'strongly' about abortion. When respondents were asked if there was one issue they felt strongly about that would decide their vote for or against a candidate, 22 percent said abortion, outranking other issues including immigration, protecting democracy and even cost of living. The current odds in every battleground state Since the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, Democrats have successfully rallied women around the issue, turning out record numbers of voters during the 2022 midterm elections. And that momentum shows no sign of slowing, Democrats say. 'So far, women are still voting at post-Dobbs level, and there are no corresponding sights yet of the ‘bro vote surge’ they have been targeting,' said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale. 'Harris has a strong closing message on the economy, abortion, and democracy, while Trump is flailing from grievance to grievance, playing dress-up garbage man, and threatening to shoot people.' But the Trump campaign says their message on top issues including the economy and immigration has been resonating with voters, a point even Republicans who aren’t supporting Trump acknowledge. 'When he’s on message and he’s talking about the issues, his points crack through the noise more than Kamala’s do,' one GOP strategist said. 'I still can’t tell you what her vision is.' Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Republicans have also 'made massive voter registration gains, and we are far outperforming in our share of the early vote relative to two or four years ago across all battleground states.' 'Voters know that Kamala Harris has destroyed our country, but President Trump will fix it when he ends inflation, secures the border, and makes America strong again — and that is why he is well-positioned for victory,' Leavitt added. Republicans say they have successfully tied Harris to Biden, who remains highly unpopular with the American electorate, which serves as a red flag to political observers. 'The bottom line is for Kamala Harris to win, she’d have to break history,' CNN’s Harry Enten, who analyzes election data, said this week on the cable network. Enten also pointed to recent polls that showed a majority of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction. 'There isn’t a single time in which 28 percent of the American public thinks the country is going on the right track in which the incumbent party actually won,' Enten said. Republicans also maintain Trump has also made significant inroads with Hispanic and Black men. 'It’s a matter of whether they can get them out to the polls now,' said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist who has worked on recent presidential campaigns. 'If he hits his mark with those two subsets of voters, look out.' How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election Speakers at a Trump rally in New York City last weekend caused a stir when a comedian made inappropriate jokes about Latinos and Puerto Rico. On Friday, Harris campaign aides said they saw the rally break through to undecided voters, giving them a shot in the arm in the final days of the campaign. The officials said internal data shows Harris winning by double digits among voters who just decided who to support in recent days. The Harris campaign also got good news on Saturday after a Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in Iowa showed Harris with a three-point lead over Trump. The poll of more than 800 voters who were surveyed showed Harris over Trump 47 percent to 44 percent. While the poll is within the margin of error, it revealed a significant shift from a September survey in the state which showed Trump leading by 4 points. Are Nevada voters swayed by promises of ‘no tax on tips’? The Trump campaign immediately cast the poll as a significant outlier, but it still gave the Harris camp a jolt of momentum. A second Democratic strategist said while Trump had been seen as the candidate with the momentum over the last couple of weeks, Harris has seen a turning point of sorts in the last several days. 'I think we are exactly where we need to be,' the strategist said. But Vale and other Democrats have concluded one thing: No one knows how it will end. 'It’s going to be close, and a grind to the finish,' Vale said. 'But the saying ‘Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades’ also applies to the Electoral College.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-victory-paths/	2024-11-03T14:37:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Declare_110324_Illustration_Courtney-JonesJulia-Demaree-Nikhinson-and-David-CalvertAPand-Adobe-Stock.png?w=900

Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said she does not anticipate a scenario in which Senate Republicans refuse to certify the election results but stressed she thinks former President Trump will win on Tuesday. 'Well, I think we want fair and safe elections. I think we see early reports that the safety and security of our ballots across the, across the country, now appear to be safe, and I think that is a great reassurance to all of us who are voting for President Trump,' Capito said in an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt when asked whether Senate Republicans were prepared to certify Vice President Harris as the next president if she is whom voters select on Election Day. 'Obviously, in a close election, every vote counts,' she continued. 'I don't anticipate a scenario where we're not ready to certify whoever wins, and but I believe that will be a reelection of President Trump.' What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Capito, however, avoided disagreeing with Trump when asked about his recent claims on social media that Pennsylvania 'is cheating and getting caught' ahead of the election. Pennsylvania is one of the closest battlegrounds for the major party candidates ahead of this election. 'Well, I think, I think Pennsylvania definitely needs to get their act together because we know in 2020 there were more than a few very suspicious ballots cast, and investigations showed that those who were in charge fell way short of assuring that our ballots were safe, counted properly, and attributed to the correct candidate,' Capito said, echoing unsubstantiated claims the former president has made. 'So I understand why President Trump is very suspicious of the state of Pennsylvania,' she continued. Capito said Pennsylvania has a lot of early votes and is being watched closely. Dems will ‘absolutely not’ repeat Jan. 6 if Trump wins: Senator 'I think what he's doing is very smart, and that he's keeping those in Pennsylvania feet to the fire. They know everyone's watching,' Capito said of the former president. 'Pennsylvania should definitely have this together. They've had, they've been challenged over the last four years as to the authenticity of the votes cast in 2020. I hope that they hear this, but they do know that those of us who experienced that in 2020 are very suspicious,' she said.

Trump says 'Fox News is not our friend,' claims it's airing 'Demo...	Former President Trump on Sunday took aim at Fox News for airing what the GOP presidential nominee sees as too much coverage devoted to the Democrats, just a few days before the election. 'FoxNews keeps putting on Democrat ads, as part of their news program. Their soundbites are almost all of Harris and her Democrat friends, all of whom are on the shows,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday morning. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics 'FOX NEWS IS NOT OUR FRIEND. It’s crazy!' Trump continued. The GOP presidential nominee has for months railed against Fox, the top-rated cable news channel, over its coverage of him and programming, though he is seen on the outlet regularly for interviews, town halls and other appearances. Just a few weeks ago, Trump criticized Fox News for airing negative political ads attacking him and said he would appeal directly to media mogul Rupert Murdoch to get them removed from the air during an interview on the network. 'In the old days, you never played negative ads. In other words, when I leave here, I’ll then be hit by five or six ads,' Trump said two weeks ago during an in-studio interview on 'Fox &amp; Friends,' the network’s flagship morning show. 'You mean Fox News?' host Brian Kilmeade interjected. 'When I leave, I’ll have 12 people from Kamala on, and pretty much unopposed,' Trump said. 'For 19 days, I don’t think we should do that anymore. I think you shouldn’t play negative ads. It’s very tough.' 'You do a show — and I complain all the time. I love complaining,' he added. 'I like to have everything perfect. But when I leave here … it’s sort of a net neutral.' The Hill has reached out to Fox News for comment. Trump’s latest remarks come just days before Election Day, as the race between him and Vice President Harris remains neck and neck. In the latest national polling average from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points, with 48.3 percent support to Harris’s 48.1 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-fox-news-ad-claims/	2024-11-03T12:32:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24308055921869-e1730601486191.jpg?w=900

(The Hill) — A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner has claimed that Vice President Harris’s recent appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' violates the 'equal time' rule. 'This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,' Commissioner Brendan Carr posted on the social platform X Saturday in response to a post from The Associated Press about Harris being on the show that night. 'The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct - a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,' Carr, a Trump appointee, continued.

During her appearance on this week’s episode of 'SNL' Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph, who often impersonates her, for a cold open sketch. While Rudolph was playing the vice president, Harris began her 'SNL' debut on the other side of a mirror from the comedian. 'I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do — you can open doors,' Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which former President Trump had a hard time grabbing the handle of a garbage truck.

Harris seeks boost from women voters to help her over finish line	Vice President Harris is seeking to maximize turnout from women voters in the final days before the election in hope the critical voting block can carry her over the finish line. While much of the conversation in the closing days of the campaign has surrounded Harris’s soft support among men, Democrats argue that women have the chance to boost Harris. They point to the voting bloc’s role in securing Democratic wins in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections. But Republicans remain skeptical that women, particularly suburban women in swing states, will be a shoo-in for Harris, pointing to concerns over the economy. 'Kamala Harris is positioned to win this election because of women,' said Jessica Mackler, the president of EMILY’s List, a group dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office. On Wednesday, the Harris campaign hammered Trump for defending comments he made in September, in which he pledged to be a 'protector of women.' During a rally on Wednesday, Trump said he disagreed with counsel from his advisers that he not use that language. 'I said, ‘Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I’m going to protect them. I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things,’' Trump told supporters in Wisconsin. Harris responded to Trump’s remarks on Thursday, calling them 'the latest in a series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women and their agency.' 'It actually is very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,' the vice president told reporters in Wisconsin. And earlier this week, the Harris campaign released an ad featuring actor Julia Roberts in which she encouraged women to vote for the vice president even if their husbands were backing Trump. 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,' Roberts says in the spot. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign worked to amplify comments from Harris campaign surrogate Mark Cuban, in which he told ABC’s 'The View' on Thursday that 'you never see [Trump] around strong, intelligent women.' Trump’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt tied Harris to the comments in a statement to The Hill. 'Kamala Harris' campaign thinks women who support President Trump are weak and dumb, and she takes issue with President Trump wanting to protect women, men, and children from migrant crime and foreign adversaries,' Leavitt said. 'Women deserve a President who will secure our nation's borders, remove violent criminals from our neighborhoods, and build an economy that helps our families thrive — and that's exactly what President Trump will do,' she continued. On policy, Harris and her allies have sought to amplify abortion access and reproductive health care in the closing salvos of the campaign, tying it to her campaign’s theme of 'freedom.' Amanda Zurawski, a Texas woman who sued the state after she said she was denied an abortion while facing pregnancy complications, delivered remarks alongside her husband ahead of Harris’s own closing argument remarks at the Ellipse outside the White House on Tuesday. Harris herself addressed the issue in her remarks, telling supporters she will 'restore what Donald Trump and his hand selected Supreme Court Justices took away from the women of America.' 'Kamala Harris has delivered this really clear message about the contrast, particularly on the issue of reproductive freedom,' Mackler said. Democrats point to their past success on the issue. In 2022, Democrats largely blunted what was expected to be a red wave in most parts of the country by focusing on abortion access in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The effects were also felt a year later in Virginia’s off-year elections, where Democrats took control of the state’s general assembly. In 2024, Harris and Democrats are tying Trump to bans and restrictions on the procedure at the state level. 'What we have seen since the Dobbs decision in every election is that women are motivated on the issue of abortion and this election is going to be fought and won on abortion,' Mackler said. The issue of abortion access seems to be resonating for young women in particular. According to a KFF survey released earlier this month, roughly four in ten women under 30 said abortion is the most important issue to their vote. Republicans, on the other hand, say abortion is not the only factor impacting the way women will vote in November. 'I don’t think they want to be defined as an abortion voter,' said Kristin Davison, a national GOP strategist. 'Obviously they care about the issue, but it’s not their main driver because they probably have bills to pay and crime is going up in their Atlanta suburb and they aren’t sure Harris is up to the job to fix it.' Republicans also point to the suburban female swing voters, predicting they could vote against Harris on the economy. 'The No. 1 issue for suburban women is the economy,' said Lauren Zelt, a national Republican strategist. 'The Harris campaign is working hard to make this about reproductive issues and understandably so. But at the end of the day women are the primary financial decision makers for their families and they’re going to be voting with their pocket books.' However, many Democrats say the two issues are fundamentally linked. 'I don’t see abortion and economy as separate issues,' said Rachel O’Leary Carmona, the executive director of the Women’s March. 'When we’re talking about the economy, I don’t think with the amount of women heads of household, women primary earners, women who are in the workforce that we can extricate the issue of reproductive freedom from concerns about the economy.' Others have pointed to poor messaging toward women on the part of Republicans, pointing to overly masculine messaging from figures like Elon Musk. 'This bromance and masculinity stuff, it borders on edgy to the point that it’s going to make women uncomfortable,' former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley told Fox News’ Bret Baier on Tuesday. 'You have got affiliated PACs doing commercials about calling Kamala the 'c' word or speakers at Madison Square Garden, you know, referring to her and her ‘pimps,’' she continued, referring to a video posted on X by Musk's super PAC calling Harris the 'c-word' before calling her a 'communist.' The video was deleted by the group on Monday. 'That is not the way to win women. That is not the way to win people who are concerned about Trump’s style,' Haley said. Early voting data shows heightened enthusiasm among women. According to a Politico analysis of the early vote data, women account for 55 percent of the early vote compared to men, who make up 45 percent in the battleground states. Democrats say they are optimistic about those numbers based on how women have broken in polling so far. A CBS News poll released earlier this week showed 55 percent of women supporting Harris, while 43 percent said the same about Trump. On the flip side, 45 percent of men said they were supporting Harris and 54 percent said the same about the former president. 'Every state will be different,' Davison said. 'I do think a woman in Buckhead, outside of Atlanta or Marietta, is going to have a different approach than someone who is in Media, Pa., which is in Delaware County outside of Philadelphia.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/harris-seeks-boost-from-women-voters-to-help-her-over-finish-line/	2024-11-03T10:15:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Female-voters_110324_AP_David-Calvert.jpg?w=900
Election security is a 'top concern': Atlanta mayor	(NewsNation) — Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens is focused on ensuring Atlantans feel safe as they head to the voting booth before Election Day. While concerns linger about the security of the election and those voting, Dickens told 'Morning in America Weekend' that is a top priority in his city. 'Election security is a top concern right now, the Atlanta police department and Fulton County Police Department are working hand in hand to make sure that all polling locations are safe so that voters can feel safe as they go to the polls and leave the polls,' Dickens said. Given the heightened rhetoric in American politics, there are worries violence and unruliness could occur once the next president is announced. 'We hope that individuals will use their best common sense to accept the results of the election, knowing that there's very little fraud that will occur, that this is going to be a safe and secure election, but we make sure that you know, as I talk to our police chief every single morning, we're going to do what needs to be done to keep the people of Atlanta safe,' Dickens added. According to Decision Desk HQ, former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 2.2% in the key battleground state of Georgia.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/election-security-top-concern-atlanta/	2024-11-03T10:10:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2176590215.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. says Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking wa...	PHOENIX (AP) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president. Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century. Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride. 'On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,' Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, 'want to Make America Healthy Again,' he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy. Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, 'but it sounds OK to me. You know it’s possible.' The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, 'He’s going to have a big role in the administration.' Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as 'a very talented guy and has strong views.' The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump’s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say. Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids. In August, a federal agency determined 'with moderate confidence' that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water. A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it’s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn’t say what those measures should be. In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food &amp; Water Watch. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit. What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to 'reorganize' agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture. But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: 'You can work on food, you can work on anything you want' except oil policy. 'He wants health, he wants women’s health, he wants men’s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,' Trump added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-donald-trump-would-push-to-remove-fluoride-from-drinking-water/	2024-11-03T09:44:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6727b6feee7ff2.41652838.jpeg?w=900
Final Senate rankings: 5 seats most likely to flip	Two days remain until Election Day, and Republicans are aiming to take control of the Senate and expand their majority. Democrats hold a 51-49 advantage, which Republicans have already sliced into with their pending victory in West Virginia. That leaves them needing only one more seat to win back the upper chamber, with Montana and Ohio being the prime targets. According to Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), the GOP has a 70 percent chance of wrestling back the Senate. A number of battleground races have tightened to dead heats, and the performance of former President Trump and Vice President Harris could also play a role in the outcomes. For the final time of the 2024 cycle, here are the top five seats likely to flip: Montana Republican Tim Sheehy, left, is in position to topple Democratic Montana Sen. Jon Tester. (Ben Allan Smith, The Missoulian via Associated Press) A win in Montana means the majority for the GOP, and the party has felt increasingly bullish that Republican Tim Sheehy is in position to topple Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). Montana is widely considered Republicans’ best chance at flipping a seat, outside of West Virginia. According to a recent survey by The Hill/Emerson College, Sheehy leads by 4 percentage points (50 percent to 46 percent) over the three-term incumbent. And the Cook Political Report has the seat in its 'lean Republican' column. Perhaps more indicative of where the race stands is how each side has maneuvered their final spends. A top GOP outside group recently shifted nearly $3 million from Montana to Nevada, where Republicans have seen some last-minute tightening, showing confidence that Sheehy is ready to seal the deal. 'I'm feeling certain about Montana right now,' one Senate Republican told The Hill, noting that recent internal polls on the GOP side have shown Sheehy holding a lead over Tester that is outside the margin of error. Democrats, however, don’t think this race is over despite the public polls. They are quick to note that Montana is notoriously difficult to poll and say that Tester’s 2012 victory, his last run in a presidential year, shows he can win despite polls showing him down. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), left, and Republican Bernie Moreno. (Jeff Dean and David Dermer, Associated Press) The race between Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Republican Bernie Moreno has drawn to even with Tuesday fast approaching. A win in Ohio would expand Republicans’ majority and the race has become the most expensive contest on the Senate map this year. Brown held a steady lead that lasted through Labor Day, buoyed by a massive advantage on the airwaves, but the wind appears to be at Moreno’s back now. An average of polls from DDHQ and The Hill shows Moreno up by just less than 1 percentage point. Republican operatives have argued that the contest is mirroring the trend line of Sen. JD Vance’s (R-Ohio) race two years ago. Vance trailed then-Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) throughout the summer and into October before overtaking and ultimately defeating him by 6 points. They are also counting on a boost from Trump. The operatives say an 8-point victory at the presidential level should be enough to pull Moreno across the finish line. Brown himself has reportedly told donors that an 8-point margin is one that he likely cannot overcome. 'Sherrod's an A [candidate] and Bernie's a C-,' one GOP operative involved in Senate races said. 'But we should win it based on gravity.' The Ohio contest is set to become not only the most expensive Senate race this cycle, but of all time. The Georgia Senate race in 2020 between Sen. Jon Ossoff (D) and former Sen. David Perdue (R) attracted $412 million, with this contest set to eclipse the $500 million mark. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), left, and Republican Eric Hovde. (Mark Schiefelbein and J. Scott Applewhite, Associated Press file) Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) is trying to hang on for dear life as Republican Eric Hovde has brought the must-win race for Democrats to a virtual dead heat. Republicans are eyeing Wisconsin as one of their best pickup opportunities outside of Montana and Ohio. Baldwin, a two-term incumbent, ran ahead of Hovde throughout much of the cycle, but that lead has largely disappeared as GOP-leaning men have come home to the Republican Party. The Cook Political Report rates the contest a 'toss-up.' Still, whether Hovde can get over the final hump remains a major question. According to the final Marquette University Law poll, Baldwin holds a 2-point lead over the GOP nominee. Perhaps just as important, she is outrunning Harris by a slight margin. Democrats still see work to do in the home stretch, and that centers on turning out Democratic-heavy Milwaukee. 'I think you'll see a real focus on the city of Milwaukee from Democrats up and down the ballot in the final hours,' one Wisconsin-based Democratic operative said, pointing to Harris’s rally with Baldwin in the city on Friday and other smaller events. Republicans, meanwhile, see Baldwin as a generic Democrat who will have trouble separating herself from the top of the ticket despite what the Marquette poll says. The race, much like several of the 'blue wall' states, also depends on the margin at the top of the ticket, with Hovde likely needing Trump to win with a big enough margin to carry him across the line. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) left, and David McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania. (Associated Press) Defeating Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has been atop the wish list of Pennsylvania Republicans ever since he knocked off Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) nearly two decades ago, and they easily have their best chance this week. Casey has held a consistent margin over Republican David McCormick into September, but has seen his lead sliced and diced to where it is now — almost deadlocked. While Republicans routinely note that toppling Casey is by no means easy, they laud McCormick and his team for how they’ve been able to tie the Democrat to Harris. The perceived inability to create separation is giving Democrats anxiety as they near the end. 'I always thought Casey would do like 3 points better than the top of the ticket. But polling isn’t showing that. His numbers are the same as Kamala’s,' one senior Pennsylvania Democrat said. 'I’m surprised.' 'Even [Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.)], who isn’t an incumbent, is running better than Bob and has some separation with Harris,' the Democrat continued, saying if Trump wins Pennsylvania 'by 1 then the Senate race could definitely go Republican too.' According to Decision Desk HQ, Casey leads by more than 2 percentage points and has a 72 percent chance at nabbing a fourth term. Republicans are also putting more muscle behind their message in the final stretch as they spent $16.2 million last week compared to $11.9 million by Democrats in the second most expensive Senate race on the map this cycle. Michigan Michigan Senate candidate Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), left, and former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.). (Associated Press) For a time this fall, Republicans had believed that Michigan represented the party’s best chance at winning a non-Montana or non-Ohio race. Unlike races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, the contest between former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and Slotkin does not feature an incumbent after Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) decided against seeking a fifth term, theoretically giving the GOP an advantage not seen elsewhere. However, Slotkin and Michigan have proved a tough nut to crack. Operatives on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged in recent days that while the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan are all up for grabs, Michigan is probably the least likely of the three to flip as the other states have narrowed more in the final weeks. 'Democrats in Michigan can win just if they hit their numbers,' one GOP operative involved in Senate races said. 'We can be perfect in Michigan, but if they hit their numbers, we lose.' Slotkin holds a 3.2-percentage point lead over Rogers, with Harris performing better there than in either of the two other states, according to Decision Desk HQ. And no Republican has won a Senate race in the Wolverine State in 30 years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/final-senate-rankings-5-seats-most-likely-to-flip/	2024-11-03T09:27:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Senate-flip_110324_Illustration_Courtney-JonesScott-ApplewhiteJeff-Dean-and-Matthew-BrownAP.png?w=900
A tie in the Electoral College could have this unprecedented outc...	(NEXSTAR) – A tie in the Electoral College, while very unlikely, is still very much possible thanks to the even number of electoral votes (538) up for grabs in the upcoming presidential election. If neither candidate obtains the 270 votes needed to win — i.e., each candidate gets 269 votes apiece — then the elected members of Congress would decide the winner of the presidency and vice presidency in what’s called a contingent election. That process, in and of itself, would be 'disruptive' and 'problematic,' Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, previously told The Hill. But it could also result in a scenario that the American public hasn’t seen in over 200 years. Which states have the highest and lowest voter turnout in presidential elections? In a contingent election, the House of Representatives would meet to determine the president, with each state’s delegation allowed to cast one vote for the candidate of their choice. (Washington, D.C. would not participate.) The first candidate to receive 26 votes would then become president. But the Senate would be tasked with electing the vice president, with each Senator allowed to cast a single vote. (Again, D.C. would not participate in contingent elections.) The first candidate with 51 votes is then declared the winner. In a contingent election, therefore, it’s possible that the House selects a president from the majority’s preferred party, while the Senate chooses a vice president from the other. Such a scenario would be more likely if the House and Senate are controlled by different parties after the election. For example, a tie in the electoral college after the 2024 election could theoretically result in a Trump-Walz administration, if the Republicans and Democrats manage to retain their current majorities in the House and the Senate, respectively.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University and the author of 'The Presidents and the People: Five Leaders Who Threatened Democracy and the Citizens Who Fought to Defend It,' believes the chance of this happening in 2024 is 'low.' But that's largely because he believes there are 'vulnerabilities' in the Electoral College system that could allow one candidate — Trump, he named specifically — to unethically manipulate the electoral votes before a contingent election would ever need to take place. 'The system as a whole is very precarious,' Brettschneider said. 'It’s not as stable as it should be.' If indeed a contingent election were held, and a president and vice president from different parties were chosen to serve in the same administration, there would be constant 'undermining' of the other’s objectives, Brettschneider believes. The last time that two politicians from different political parties somewhat reluctantly served in the same administration was between 1797-1801, when President John Adams (a Federalist) and Vice President Thomas Jefferson (a Democratic-Republican) held the offices. '[With] the Adams Administration, you had a president who was intent in shutting down the opposition, and a vice president who was the leader of that opposition,' said Brettschneider, adding that the administration was 'a microcosm of the instability of the country as a whole.' But Adams and Jefferson didn’t end up together because of a contingent election: At the time, the candidate with the most electoral votes became president, and the runner-up became vice president. The 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, aimed to prevent this by overhauling the process to create a distinction between votes for the offices of president and vice president. There’s still nothing in the Constitution that would forbid a two-party presidential ticket. Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson had belonged to different parties (Republican and Democratic) before they successfully ran for the nation’s highest offices in 1864 — though, technically, they had both aligned prior to the election under the newly created National Union party. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had also revealed in his 2018 memoir that he nearly selected Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) as his running mate in the 2008 election, and even expressed regret that he hadn’t. McCain’s advisers, he said, steered him toward Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, fearing that Lieberman’s pro-choice stance on abortion would hurt his chances. 'It was sound advice that I could reason for myself,' McCain wrote. 'But my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.' Why doesn’t the popular vote determine the president? But even a potential McCain-Lieberman ticket would have been spearheaded by politicians who willingly chose to be running mates. A Trump-Walz administration, on the other hand, would not be built on as stable a foundation — and could result in both men trying to undermine each other, or oust the other from power. 'I don’t see it as a good thing,' said Brettschneider. 'I don’t see a world where this is a good thing for American democracy.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/a-tie-in-the-electoral-college-could-have-this-unprecedented-outcome/	2024-11-03T07:59:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/YardSignsHarrisTrumpGettyImages-2174737008-e1730401432832.jpg?w=800

Harris appears on 'Saturday Night Live' as mirror image of Maya R...	NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' in the final days before the election, playing herself as the mirror-image double of Maya Rudolph's version of her. The first lines the candidate spoke as she sat across from Rudolph was drowned out by cheers from the audience. 'It is nice to see you Kamala,' Harris told Rudolph, 'and I’m just here to remind you you got this.' In sync, the two said supporters need to 'Keep Kamala and carry-on-ala,' declared that they share each other's 'belief in the promise of America,' and delivered the signature 'Live from New York it's Saturday night!' Harris made the surprise trip to New York City with the election looming, briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she’s been furiously campaigning in favor of the iconic sketch comedy show, where she was hoping to generate buzz and appeal to a nationwide audience. Harris arrived in New York on Air Force Two after an early evening campaign stop Saturday on in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was scheduled to head to Detroit, but once in the air, aides said she'd be making an unscheduled stop and the plane landed at LaGuardia Airport. Harris arrived at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan, where SNL tapes, shortly after 8 p.m., enough time for a quick rehearsal before the show airs live at 11:30 p.m. It is the final SNL episode before Election Day on Tuesday. The visit wasn’t previously announced and an official familiar with Harris’ planning only officially confirmed it for reporters traveling with the vice president moments before the live airing began. The official insisted on anonymity to discuss plans before they were made public. Rudolph first played Harris on the show in 2019 and has reprised her role this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice president, including calling herself 'Momala' — a reference to the affectionate nickname her stepchildren gave her. Rudolph opened the show’s season premiere with the line: 'Well, well, well. Look who fell out of that coconut tree.' And she’s joked about keeping President Joe Biden in his place. Harris' husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, was played again by former cast member Andy Samberg and Dana Carvey appeared as President Joe Biden. Rudolph's performance has won critical and comedic acclaim — including from Harris herself. 'Maya Rudolph — I mean, she’s so good,' Harris said last month on ABC's 'The View.' 'She had the whole thing, the suit, the jewelry, everything!' Harris added that she was impressed with Rudolph’s 'mannerisms.' Jason Miller, a senior adviser to former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump, expressed surprise that Harris would appear on SNL given what he characterized as her unflattering portrayal on the show. Asked if Trump had been invited to appear, he said: 'I don’t know. Probably not.' Politicians nonetheless have a long history on SNL, including Trump, who hosted the show in 2015 — though appearing so close to Election Day is unusual. Hillary Clinton was running in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary when she appeared next to Amy Poehler, who played her on the show and was known for launching into a trademark, exaggerated cackle. The real Clinton wondered during her appearance, 'Do I really laugh like that?' Harris repeated that line in response to Rudolph's portrayal of her laugh in Saturday's episode. Clinton returned in 2016, while running against Trump in a race she ultimately lost. The first sitting president to appear on SNL was Republican Gerald Ford, who did so less than a year after the show debuted. Ford appeared in April 1976 on an episode hosted by his press secretary, Ron Nessen, and declared the show’s famous opening rejoinder, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday Night.' Then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama appeared alongside Poehler impersonating Clinton in 2007, and Republican Bob Dole was on the show in November 1996 -- a mere 11 days after losing that year’s election to Bill Clinton. Dole consoled Norm Macdonald, who played the Kansas senator. Then there was Tina Fey’s 2008 impression of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin — and in particular her joke that 'I can see Russia from my house.' It was so good that Fey eventually won an Emmy and Palin herself appeared on the show that October, in the weeks before the election. ___ Long, Miller and Weissert reported from Washington.

Trump's nephew warns of unchecked power in a second Trump term	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump's nephew Fred Trump III in an interview on 'NewsNation Prime' warned of what another presidency under his uncle would look like. Fred Trump also said that the former president reportedly told him to let his disabled son die. Fred Trump said his uncle had never met his son, William, now 25, who has complex disabilities. When he called Donald Trump to discuss his son's condition, the former president responded: 'Your son doesn't recognize you. Let him die and move down to Florida.' 'I just simply said 'Donald, he does recognize me, and he is to me … the most courageous and inspirational person I know,'' the younger Trump recalled during the Saturday interview. Harris takes lead over Trump in Iowa: Poll Fred Trump was promoting his new book, 'All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way,' which features 'never-before-told stories' about the Trump family and Fred Trump’s complex relationship with the former president. He said similar comments about disabled people were made by Donald Trump in the Oval Office in 2020. The former president's nephew also warned about a potential second Trump term, saying there would be no 'guardrails' to check his power. He criticized his uncle's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that 'tens of thousands' were dying daily during his administration. Fred Trump said he decided to publish the book after the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots, which he called 'an absolute turning point,' and after his son moved into a group home, ensuring his safety from potential harassment. Trump says it’s ‘tough’ for Republicans to win the popular vote Fred Trump and his sister, Mary, have been vocal critics of their uncle. Trump communications director Steven Cheung denied Fred Trump’s claims in a statement to NewsNation partner The Hill. 'This is completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order,' he said. 'It is appalling a lie so blatantly disgusting can be printed in media. Anyone who knows President Trump knows he would never use such language, and false stories like this have been thoroughly debunked.' 'This is nothing more than a cheap shot to sell copies of a book that belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section,' he added.

AP Sources: Kamala Harris will appear on SNL in last episode befo...	NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris has made an unannounced trip to New York to appear on ' Saturday Night Live,' briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she’s been campaigning with just three days to go before the election. Harris departed on Air Force Two after a campaign stop on Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was scheduled to head to Detroit, but once the aircraft was in the air, aides said it was actually going to New York.

Trump says it’s ‘tough’ for Republicans to win the popular vote	Former President Trump argued that Republicans winning the popular vote is 'tough' because of Democratic strength in certain strongholds ahead of Election Day on Tuesday. Trump said at a rally in Virginia that votes need to turn out on Tuesday because he wants to win 'everything,' including the popular vote. But he said states like California make winning the popular vote tough. 'When you have New York, Illinois and California, you have automatically, it’s like ridiculous, automatically goes to a Democrat, it’s tough to win the popular vote because they’re three big states,' he said. While Trump won the presidency in 2016, he was unsuccessful in winning the popular vote that year against Hillary Clinton or in 2020 against President Biden. Democrats have won the popular vote in the past five of six presidential elections going back to 2000, though Republicans have won in the Electoral College three of those times. Trump claimed that polls are showing him leading 'everything' and that he expects to win the popular vote. He also alluded to his false claims of voter fraud helping Democrats, as he has claimed cost him reelection in 2020. 'I’d love to win the popular vote with them cheating. Let them cheat because that’s what they do. They do it very well. They’re very professional, but I think we have a really good chance to win the popular vote, and I think things are going to be very interesting,' he said. Because the Electoral College requires candidates to win enough states to equal 270 electoral votes, winning the popular vote is not necessarily enough to get over the finish line. Democrats have more recently been the victim of this effect, as frequent winners of the popular vote recently but falling short in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by 2 points in 2016 but narrowly lost the electoral vote. Biden won the popular vote by 4.5 points but only narrowly pulled off an electoral win. Experts have said Vice President Harris may not have enough to win the popular vote by as much as past Democrats because of some shifts in the electorate giving Republicans an improvement in popular vote margins that don’t necessarily help in the Electoral College. Trump’s visit to Virginia is one of a couple of stops he’s making this weekend to states that have leaned Democratic and are expected to vote for Harris comfortably.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-its-tough-for-republicans-to-win-the-popular-vote/	2024-11-02T17:26:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trumpdonald_110224gn15_w.jpg?w=900
Harris takes lead over Trump in Iowa: Poll	Vice President Harris has taken a 3-point lead over her opponent, former President Trump, in red-leaning Iowa, according to a new poll released on Saturday. The new Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey found Harris outpacing Trump by 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent, among Iowa’s likely voters, jumping ahead of the former president who won the state in both 2016 and 2020. The result was just inside the survey’s margin of error. The September iteration of the poll had Trump leading the vice president by 4 points. 'It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,' pollster J. Ann Selzer told The Des Moines Register. 'She has clearly leaped into a leading position.' Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who remains on the Iowa ballot, got 3 percent support. Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver was at less than 1 percent. Some 3 percent said they were not sure about their choice, 2 percent did not share who they already voted for and 1 percent said they sided with someone else, according to the survey. Both White House candidates have heavily campaigned in the seven battleground states. Neither has campaigned in Iowa following the conclusion of the party’s primaries, the Register noted. The last time a Democratic nominee won Iowa was former President Obama in 2012. 'Age and gender are the two most dynamic factors that are explaining these numbers,' Selzer said. Harris leads Trump among women independent voters by 28 points, 57 percent to 29 percent, while the GOP nominee was ahead by 10 points among independent men voters, 47 percent to 37 percent, according to the poll. The vice president has an advantage among those aged 65 and above. She leads Trump by 35 points, 63 percent to 28 percent, among senior women. Her lead is significantly smaller among senior men, beating Trump 47 percent to 45 percent, according to the survey. The poll found a larger contingent of Trump supporters being enthusiastic about backing the former president compared to Harris’s supporters. Around 76 percent of the ex-president’s supporters are 'extremely or very enthusiastic' about their pick in this election, 5 points more than 71 percent that expressed the same about Harris. Approximately 91 percent of respondents said they were firm about the choice in his White House election. The poll was conducted Oct. 28-31 among 808 likely voters. The margin of error was 3.4 percentage points.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-takes-lead-over-trump-in-iowa-poll/	2024-11-02T17:25:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Top-Harris-and-Trump_102924_AP.jpg?w=900
Harrison Ford endorses Harris for president	Actor Harrison Ford announced his endorsement of Vice President Harris in the 2024 White House race three days before Election Day. Ford shared that he would be voting for the Democratic nominee in a video recorded for the Harris-Walz campaign. In them, he praised the Democratic ticket for believing in the 'rule of law' while slamming former President Trump for 'embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.' The 'Indiana Jones' star referenced former Trump administration officials who have spoken out against the GOP nominee in the video posted Saturday and added that Harris will protect the people’s 'right to disagree with her about policies or ideas.' 'You have to pay attention,' Ford said. 'They're telling us something important. These aren't soft people. They're governors, generals standing up against the leader of the party. They spent their lives advocating for many of them. This will be the first time they've ever voted for someone who doesn't have an R next to their name, because they know this really matters.' 'The other guy [Trump], he demands unquestioning loyalty, says he wants revenge,' Ford says in the video. 'I'm Harrison Ford. I've got one vote, same as anyone else, and I'm going to use it to move forward. I'm going to vote for, Kamala Harris.' Ford joins a group of other celebrities, artists and Hollywood stars that have endorsed the Democratic nominee, including Taylor Swift, Leonardo DiCaprio, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, and others. Some have appeared with Harris on the campaign trail. Ford, in another video that was released by Rolling Stone on Saturday, emphasized that he does not agree with every policy position the Democratic ticket holds, but said they would govern, if elected, for all Americans. 'But these two people believe in the rule of law,' the actor says in the video. 'They believe in science. They believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans, they believe that we are in this together. These are ideas I believe in. These are people I can get behind.' The actor, who endorsed President Biden in 2020, said he is displeased by 'a lot of things' in the U.S., but emphasized that the country needs to 'work together again.' 'Look, I'm frustrated about a lot of things in this country,' he said. 'I'm sure you are too. But the other guy, he spent four years turning us against each other while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world. That's not who we are. We don't need to make America great again. Come on. We are great, but we need is to work together again. All we need is a president who works for all of us, and again.' The Hill has reached out to the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign’s spokesperson for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/harrison-ford-endorses-harris-for-president/	2024-11-02T17:25:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24015081327606-2.jpg?w=900
Georgia surpasses 4 million votes on last day of early voting	The Georgia Secretary of State’s office announced 4,004,588 voters have cast ballots through early voting or absentee by mail in a Saturday release. 'This was the most successful Early Voting period in Georgia history because voters trust the process,' said Secretary Brad Raffensperger in a statement. 'Four years of progress brought us here. We’re battle-tested and ready, regardless of what the critics say. And we’re going to hold those who interfere in our elections accountable.' The Peach State's election official noted that 92 counties exceeded 50 percent turnout for the first time in state history. A total of 3,761,968 people voted in person early while 242,620 sent in ballots by mail. The Secretary of State’s office did flag that four individuals may have violated Georgia law by attempting to cast multiple ballots. They are investigating reports accordingly. This week, the state also was subject to false reports about immigrants casting multiple ballots in videos on social media. Raffensperger addressed the posts in a Thursday statement, casting blame on foreign election interference. 'Earlier today, our office became aware of a video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant with multiple Georgia ID’s claiming to have voted multiple times,' he wrote. 'This is false and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen in this and other elections. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election.' He said the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is investigating the matter and has asked Elon Musk to remove the post from the social media platform X in hopes of preventing false narratives. 'As Americans we can’t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine our faith in our institutions - or each other,' Raffensperger added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-surpasses-4-million-votes-on-last-day-of-early-voting/	2024-11-02T15:33:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/votesticker_100822_ap-ben-gray_georgia.jpeg?w=900
Swifties for Kamala launches fandom mail campaign in Pennsylvania	Swifties for Kamala launched a fandom mail program targeting low propensity voters in Pennsylvania.

'We are offering encouragement, information and a call to action all wrapped up in a welcoming, star-covered envelope.' According to the release from the group, more than 250,000 mail pieces have been sent to encourage voters in Pennsylvania to support Harris. Wu also made a post about the launch on the social platform X on Saturday, which included a screenshot of the press release and a photo of a 'VOTE' card and a 'Voting Era' friendship bracelet — a nod to the friendship bracelet exchange that happens among Taylor Swift fans oftentimes at her concerts. The press release said that the bracelets were included in 50,000 of the mailers. 'Potential voters across PA have started receiving these in their mailboxes over the past few weeks,' Annie Wu Henry wrote in the post. Swifties for Kamala sprung into action long before Taylor Swift endorsed Harris in September, with 35,000 helping to raise $130,000 during the course of a fundraising call earlier this year. Pennsylvania is a key battleground state for the candidates, with Trump narrowly leading Harris, 48.6 percent to 48.1 percent, according to a polling aggregate from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ).	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/swifties-for-kamala-launches-fandom-mail-campaign-in-pennsylvania/	2024-11-02T15:32:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/swift-harris-ap.jpg?w=900

Trump blasts 'insecure' Cuban for remarks on women voters	Former President Trump hammered down on his comments alleging Mark Cuban was 'insecure' after the billionaire claimed the Republican nominee was 'intimidated' by intelligent women. 'I know Mark very well. He’s a very insecure guy. He can’t hit a golf ball more than 50 yards,' Trump said during a Saturday call in to Fox and Friends. 'He’s weak physically and mentally as far as I’m concerned, but I’ve known him for a long time.' The former president also described Cuban’s retraction and apology as a 'weak' move. 'He’s totally retracted his statement like weak people always do, they restrict their statements,' Trump said. After Cuban’s comments, various Republican women hit back on the billionaire's claims while affirming Trump’s support of them and their leadership. 'I’m told @mcuban needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are,' senior Trump adviser Susan Wiles posted on X. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R ) also chimed in encouraging voters to cast their ballot for Trump. 'I’m proud to be the highest-ranking woman in the United States Congress. When I ran, I was the youngest woman ever elected. I’m the most senior woman on the House Arms Services Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and I proudly am voting and endorse President Trump,' Stefanik said in a video. 'Save America in five days, vote Trump.' During the former president's call in, he said Cuban was held accountable by 'strong people.' 'He was hit by the strongest people. It wasn’t men, it was women,' Trump said on air.

Harris planning to vote by mail to ‘model behavior’	Vice President Harris will vote by mail ahead of Election Day as a way to 'model' the different modes of voting for Americans, the campaign told reporters Saturday. The team, however, didn't provide an update on whether Harris had already sent her ballot. The vice president is from California, but she has not traveled back to the state recently. Instead, she has prioritized her travel on the swing states, as the White House race remains close with less than a week left until the election. 'She wants to model behavior for other voters to continue to take advantage of the various modes of voting that we have during the [Get Out the Vote] time period,' campaign officials said. The team added that by Tuesday, they will be focused on convincing low propensity voters after they’ve made the push for early voting. 'That is the effort that we are pushing to all voters right now so that on Tuesday, it will be a last call for those final low propensity voters that this campaign needs to turn out and continue to convince all the way through polls closing on Election Day,' the official said. President Biden voted in-person in Delaware Monday, while early voting was open in his home. Gov Tim Walz (D), Harris's running mate, also opted to vote early, casting a ballot last week in his home state of Minnesota. The vice president is expected to spend election night at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, a source familiar told The Hill earlier this week. The vice president’s campaign has prioritized outreach to Black voters in the weeks before Election Day, while polling has indicated former President Trump is making gains with that voting bloc. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's polling aggregate shows that the party nominees are within 0.1 points of each other nationally. Harris had a slight edge over Trump, garnering 48.2 percent to his 48.1 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-planning-to-vote-by-mail-to-model-behavior/	2024-11-02T15:32:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24307100310143-e1730567526699.jpg?w=900
Harris, Trump issue appeal to Americans abroad in bid for more vo...	Nearly 5 million Americans living abroad are eligible to vote from overseas, representing a small but unique group that could influence the results in key swing states. While participation among overseas voters is considered low at less than 8 percent, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump have sent out direct appeals to these voters. 'We know there's a lot of enthusiasm,' said Sharon Manitta, global press secretary for Democrats Abroad, an official arm of the Democratic Party for overseas voters. 'The thing is, really, until the election is settled, goodness knows when that will be, we don't really know how that enthusiasm turns into turnout,' said Manitta, who is based in the United Kingdom. In 2020, more than 27,000 overseas ballot requests were registered in the swing states of Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Trump, in an Oct. 12 video, called on Americans living abroad to make sure they are registered to vote. He also promised to end double-taxation — where, generally, Americans pay taxes in the country they live in and the U.S. There are exemptions, and policies can vary from country to country. 'It was an October surprise from our side, from Republicans Overseas,' Solomon Yeu, the chief executive of Republicans Overseas, a political advocacy group that worked with the Trump campaign on the video. It also represented an about-face for Trump, who had earlier criticized and raised doubt over the legality of Americans voting overseas. Trump attacked the 1986 law that established overseas voting as 'a program that emails ballots overseas without any citizenship check or verification of identity, whatsoever,' in a post on Truth Social. Requirements can vary among states but generally a Social Security number or a valid state driver's license, or passport number can be used for identification verification. Republicans in North Carolina, Michigan and Pennsylvania have pursued, unsuccessfully, efforts to challenge rights for Americans overseas and people born overseas to American parents to vote in the U.S. elections. And while the Democratic Party has an official arm dedicated to overseas voters, this group is also generally overlooked. In this presidential election, for the first time, the Democratic National Committee provided Democrats Abroad with about $300,000 to help register voters and carry out get-out-the vote campaigns. Ballot requests for overseas voters opens 45 days before the election, in September. But it wasn’t until Oct. 24 that Harris published an open letter to Americans voting overseas in which she promised to take seriously their concerns surrounding finances, like banking and taxes, as well as access to consular services and immigration and citizenship processes. 'We were pleased … that both candidates have acknowledged that something has to be done on taxation of Americans overseas, or acknowledge that there's an interest in addressing these issues and doing something,' said Marylouise Serrato, executive director of American Citizens Abroad, a nonpartisan and nonprofit advocacy group. 'That's, for us, a really positive sign.' That came alongside a stepped up effort by the Biden administration earlier this year, which for the first time conducted a survey of Americans abroad on issues they are concerned about, said Martha McDevitt-Pugh, the international chair of Democrats Abroad. 'There really isn’t a lot of data around us, so we were really encouraged by that survey,' she said, adding that it led to the first-ever White House call with overseas stakeholders to talk about increasing awareness around government resources for Americans abroad. An estimated 2.9 million Americans who live abroad are eligible to vote. Another 1.4 million uniformed services members and 600,000 military spouses and vote-age dependents also live abroad, according to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). It’s not clear how many voters overseas come from specific states; that data won’t be available until well after Election Day and will have to be checked among multiple sources. The number of Americans voting from abroad can fluctuate for a variety of reasons: the increase in people working remotely, people retiring abroad, students studying overseas, Peace Corps workers, and military voters. Americans voting from abroad request ballots from their last address in the United States, no matter if it was a rented apartment or home or if decades had passed since they last lived there. And while the Federal Voting Assistance Program counted the participation rate of voters from abroad as unchanged between 2016 and 2020 — at 7.8 percent — the EAC recorded a 39 percent increase in returned overseas ballots between 2016 and 2020 — 655,844 overseas ballots in 2016 and more than 900,000 in 2020. Still, there are barriers to participation. Slow postal services, access to printers, personal follow through and confusion over each state’s voting requirements — either the need to mail in a ballot, fax, or submit it online — can also play a role in low participation rates. Rejected ballots are rare, at about 2.1 percent according to EAC, but the most common reason is an absentee ballot received after a state's deadline. On Thursday, Military Times published a report that election officials in the state of Georgia said 13,000 ballots requested by overseas military and Americans abroad have yet to be returned. One of the core issues with increasing the overseas vote is education, said Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and CEO of Overseas Vote, a 20-year-old nonpartisan, nonprofit public charity that helps inform people of their right to vote overseas and provides resources to help people submit their ballots. 'The fundamental problem we have with people voting from abroad is they don't know they have the right,' she said. Dzieduszycka-Suinat, who is based in Germany, said misinformation also plays a role in discouraging people from voting, such as a fear that there’s a connection between voting and increased taxes among people who live overseas. A myth versus fact section of the Overseas Vote website addresses the connection between voting and taxes. 'That is terrible for us in terms of voter participation, because people think, if I vote, they'll run me down for taxes,' she said. Still, she welcomes the increased attention on voters overseas as an opportunity to work to improve participation rates, even if some of that attention comes from Republican lawsuits or criticisms over the authenticity of overseas votes. 'There may be a renewed opportunity after the election, depending on how it goes, to improve the program, even more with some reform,' she said.

FBI condemns fake election security videos	The FBI released a statement on Saturday addressing false claims about the election and reaffirming their intention to ensure voter security leading up to Election Day. 'The FBI is aware of two videos falsely claiming to be from the FBI relating to election security, one stating the FBI has apprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud and a second relating to the Second Gentleman,' the agency wrote in a post on X. 'These videos are not authentic, are not from the FBI, and the content they depict is false.' While voters headed to precincts to cast their ballots, the FBI warned individuals to be aware of election related fraud schemes using fake images and names. 'Election integrity is among our highest priorities, and the FBI is working closely with state and local law enforcement partners to respond to election threats and protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote,' the bureau said in their statement. 'Attempts to deceive the public with false content about FBI operations undermines our democratic process and aims to erode trust in the electoral system.' The state of Georgia reported an instance of Russian election interference on Friday falsely depicting a Haitian immigrant casting multiple ballots. The Secretary of State addressed the matter by asking Elon Musk to remove the post, labeling it 'disinformation.' 'This is false, and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen this election. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election,' Raffensperger said in a statement on Thursday night. Earlier this month, the FBI and CISA also claimed China was behind former President Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance’s (R-Ohio), phone hacks. The agency is encouraging voters to stay aware of potential schemes as Nov. 5 approaches. 'The FBI encourages everyone to seek election and voting information from reliable sources, such as your local election office,' they wrote. 'And if you suspect criminal activity, we ask that you report that information to state or local law enforcement or your local FBI field office.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/fbi-condemns-fake-election-security-videos/	2024-11-02T15:31:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zoom-In-Georgia_052124_AP_Mike-Stewart.jpg?w=900

Raffensperger urges voters to ignore X ad purporting fraud: 'Don'...	Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensbegrer addresses a video falsely depicting a Haitian immigrant voting numerous times during a Friday CNN appearance. 'As we checked it out, came to a conclusion real quick. So we responded very quickly, you know, on Twitter and then also with a press release, just to let people know it's fake, don't fall for it,' Raffensperger said. 'Because in effect, what people want to do, these nation state actors, is really get us fighting among ourselves.' Earlier in the video, Raffensperger debunked the video by assuring voters that individuals cannot receive multiple state IDs with the same name. The leader attributed the video to 'bad actors' who are trying to divide the nation. 'We've got enough that splits us. We don't need to have the Russians or other bad actors try and split us further,' he said on air. 'So, you know, this was a week after the Intel community had said that a phony video showing fraud in Pennsylvania was just that, was phony, and that also had come from Russia.' The FBI has publicly addressed the uptick in fake videos by urging voters to be cautious of what they see on social media. The agency warned people that accounts using the name’s and images of candidates are being used to distribute false information.

Harris widens lead on Trump in Virginia: Poll	(The Hill) — Vice President Harris widened her lead over her opponent former President Trump in Virginia, with less than 3 days left before Election Day, according to a poll released on Friday. The survey, conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR) at Roanoke College, found the vice president leading Trump by 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent, among Virginia’s likely voters. Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both received 2 percent support while Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1 percent. Some 2 percent of respondents were undecided while another 2 percent said they would choose another candidate. The economy was the top issue for the likely voters at 43 percent. Abortion was second with 20 percent, followed by immigration at 12 percent. Foreign affairs was the fourth most important issue with 8 percent while crime was at 3 percent, according to the survey. Respondents trusted Harris more on both crime and foreign policy, 49 percent to Trump’s 45 percent. They favored Trump on the economy, 49 percent to 46 percent. On immigration, both White House contenders were tied at 48 percent. Likely voters had more faith in Harris on abortion, 57 percent to the Republican nominee’s 36 percent. Approximately 46 percent of the poll’s respondents said that Harris cares and understands people like them, nearly 10 points higher than Trump’s 37 percent. A Washington Post/Schar School, released just over a week ago, had Harris leading Trump by 6 points, 49 percent to 43 percent, in Virginia. The vice president is up by 5 percent over the GOP nominee, 50 percent to 45 percent, in Virginia, according to the latest The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s tally of surveys. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to 29 among 851 likely registered voters in the Old Dominion State. The margin of error was 4.6 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/polls/harris-widens-lead-on-trump-in-virginia-poll/	2024-11-02T15:00:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trumpdonald_harriskamala_110124gn01_w-e1730580140254.jpg?w=798
Ballot box fires stoke fears of election violence	Two ballot drop box fires in the Pacific Northwest this week have stoked concerns about election security and the risk of violence in the 2024 election days before voting concludes. Arson burned hundreds of ballots in what one official called 'a direct attack on democracy' in Vancouver, Wash., and harmed a small handful in nearby Portland, Ore. The pair of incidents mark rare disruptions to election administration, experts stressed, but they raise worries about whether more threats or attacks are to come amid a tense, polarized race — and whether the incidents could sow voter distrust in the systems. 'There’s this larger environment of distrust in our elections that has generated a set of security and safety concerns that ballot drop boxes are just one part of,' said Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California. 'These sorts of actions, like bombing these drop boxes, I think … are ultimately about increasing fear, increasing distrust and potentially discouraging people from voting.' Officials in Oregon and Washington have said the evidence suggests the two incidents this week, plus a third possible arson incident in the Evergreen State last month, are connected. A suspect description and vehicle have been identified, and the Portland Police Bureau said Wednesday that investigators believe 'it is possible that the suspect intends to continue these targeted attacks.' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been on alert in the run-up to Election Day that drop boxes could be targeted by 'domestic violent extremists' this cycle, according to internal bulletins, and experts are now concerned about continued or copycat attacks after the Pacific Northwest fires. 'Some social media users are discussing and encouraging various methods of sabotaging ballot drop boxes and avoiding detection, likely heightening the potential for targeting of this election infrastructure through the 2024 election cycle,' the DHS concluded in a September memo. The Vancouver drop box was notably in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, where incumbent Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D) faces a rematch against Republican Joe Kent in one of the cycle’s most competitive races. The Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman noted on social platform X, replying to the arson reports, that the Democrat beat Kent by just 2,629 votes in the midterms. The incidents also risk shaking voter confidence in an already fraught election cycle. Though a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Research Center found most voters have confidence their local and state officials will accurately count ballots, more than half of Republican voters in a YouGov survey last month said they’re worried poll workers could tamper with their ballots. Roughly three-quarters of voters in the AP polling also said that they’re at least somewhat concerned about violence over the election outcome. 'Sometimes the fear, the concern around it is enough to impact people’s sense of security. … People will see the headlines and wonder ‘Could this happen to my local drop box?’' Romero said. That’s why experts, who have been working overtime to debunk rumors and break through misinformation online ahead of Election Day, are pointing to how this week’s ballot drop box fires were handled as a positive sign of voting security for 2024. An incendiary device was placed inside the Portland ballot box, officials said, but fire suppressant inside protected 'virtually all' the ballots. Just three ballots were identified as damaged, and the affected voters were contacted for replacements. Hundreds of ballots were damaged at the Vancouver location, where a suspected incendiary device was found next to the drop box. It’s possible some ballots were completely burned, and a half-dozen were unidentifiable. But elections staff were able to identify 488 damaged ballots, according to the county. As of Tuesday evening, 345 of those voters had already contacted the Clark County office to request a replacement, and new ballots were mailed to the remaining identified voters on Thursday. 'This is certainly a threat that election officials have anticipated could happen in any given election from the moment we started installing drop boxes. So officials in Oregon and Washington really tried to make plans to respond to this, and prevent it from happening,' said Kim Wyman, a senior fellow with Bipartisan Policy Center's Elections Project and former Republican secretary of state in Washington. 'The good news is that election officials have really been preparing for this week for the last four years, and they’ve tried to build in as many security measures that they can for voters at polling places and early voting centers, [and] around mail-in ballots,' Wyman said, though she noted experts are bracing for 'a spike in activity' as Election Day nears. Oregon and Washington are both vote-by-mail states and have long used drop boxes to collect ballots. More states began embracing the tools last cycle to grapple with administration difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The boxes served as a way to avoid large crowds at polling places and have been seen as a more reliable delivery method than the U.S. Postal Service, due in part to confusion with postmarks and deadlines. The boxes have nevertheless drawn controversy amid an ongoing swirl of election conspiracies in recent years. Former President Trump, for one, has previously cast doubt on mail-in voting and argued the boxes opened ballots up to be tampered with. An Associated Press investigation in 2022 debunked those claims, finding that the expanded use of drop boxes in 2020 did not lead to fraud, theft or other issues that could have swayed the results. 'There’s almost no method of voting that’s invulnerable from somebody going to do something unexpected,' said Paul Gronke, director of the Elections &amp; Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland. But for the individual voter, he said, drop boxes are one of the safest methods of ensuring their votes are delivered on time. Still, other election security-related concerns loom over the 2024 homestretch. Threats and scrutiny often linked to false claims of voter fraud have contributed to a mass exodus of local election officials in recent years, raising alarms about understaffed and inexperienced teams left to handle the process — and to face potential new threats. Experts are also worried about misinformation, artificial intelligence and foreign influence on elections. And, as Trump and others continue to tout disproven claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 results, experts are on high alert for protests and violence postelection, nearly four years after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. The presidential race is on a razor’s edge as Election Day nears, and the latest polling averages from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill put Harris up by 0.3 points nationally, with similarly tight margins in key battlegrounds. Jim Messina, who served as a White House adviser to former President Obama, said last month that Trump 'is going to try to steal this.' Trump’s former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin has said the Biden administration 'needs to be ready to secure the Capitol and state capitols.' 'When you tell the population repeatedly, over and over again for years, that the election has been stolen and that election officials can't be trusted— that's inevitably going to lead to distrust of our election system and the risk of violence,' Ben Berwick, counsel at the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy, told The Hill in an interview last week. But even in the face of 'all this gloom and doom' around threats, conspiracies and potential violence, Wyman urged voters to remember that election officials have been readying to take on 2024 since 2020. 'A lot of planning has gone into this election by election officials across the country. They’ve been trying to think about those threats and have plans in place if something does materialize. They’ve been working with law enforcement and their federal partners to really vet those plans and be ready,' she said. 'People should feel safe going to their polling places on Election Day and participating in the election.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ballot-box-fires-stoke-fears-of-election-violence/	2024-11-02T14:59:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Ballot-box-fires_110224_AP_Greg-Kimsey.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump holds campaign event in Virginia	Former President Trump took a slight detour from his battleground state swing Saturday afternoon, giving remarks to supporters in Virginia. Trump is expected to target Vice President Harris over inflation, housing prices, and immigration, while arguing that the Biden administration has turned Virginia into a 'border state,' according to the campaign. The stop also comes as early voting is set to end in the state. The visit also follows a Supreme Court decision Wednesday that gave Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) and election officials the ability to cancel more than 1,600 voter registrations, which the state claimed were held by noncitizens. Youngkin endorsed the former president earlier this year. With just days left until the election, the GOP presidential nominee is trailing Harris by half a point — 45 percent to 50 percent — according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's polling index. Trump's remarks in Salem, Va., are scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. EDT. Watch the live video above.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/watch-live-trump-holds-campaign-event-in-virginia/	2024-11-02T14:39:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24307092238165-e1730558045352.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Harris, Bon Jovi rally voters in North Carolina	Vice President Harris will offer her closing remarks to voters in swing state North Carolina Saturday afternoon, just hours after early voting ended in the state. Harris will be joined in the battleground state by musical artists Bon Jovi and Khalid, as well as 'Scandal' actress Kerry Washington, among other guests. She has leaned heavily on celebrity endorsements as of late — including rallies in recent days with Cardi B and Jennifer Lopez. With 16 Electoral College votes up for grabs and just days until Election Day, both the vice president and former President Trump have spent significant time in the North Carolina. Trump is holding two campaign events in the state on Saturday. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling index shows that the race is still tight among Tar Heel State voters, with the former president garnering 49.1 percent support to Harris's 47.7 percent. The rally in Charlotte, N.C., is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

Trump will rally backers every day until the election in North Ca...	GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) — Donald Trump will rally supporters in North Carolina every day until Tuesday's election, a flurry of late activity in the only swing state that he won in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Even as Trump looks to expand the electoral map and project strength with trips to New Mexico and Virginia, two Democratic states not widely viewed as competitive, he is putting considerable time into North Carolina, which last backed a Democrat for president in 2008. The former president's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency gets significantly more complicated if he loses North Carolina. The fast-growing Southern state gave Trump his smallest margin of victory — 1.3 percentage points — over Democrat Joe Biden four years ago. Trump campaigned in Gastonia, west of Charlotte, on Saturday and was scheduled to be in Greensboro later in the day, with a stop in Salem, Virginia, in between. He will be in the eastern city of Kinston on Sunday and in Raleigh on Monday. Those four rallies will bring his total events in North Carolina since Oct. 1 to nine. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been in the state six times during the same period, most recently on Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, will also be in North Carolina on Saturday for a concert and rally in Charlotte. Her campaign has not announced any other travel to the state before Election Day. The extensive damage from Hurricane Helene across western North Carolina has created a dose of uncertainty about the state of play here. Flooding destroyed homes and displaced residents in several counties, including the liberal city of Asheville and the conservative rural areas surrounding it. Trump's team has said it is confident about his chances in North Carolina. Democrats see Trump's attention on the state as a signal of optimism for Harris. 'The repeat appearances may signal Trump’s campaign is in trouble,' said Democratic state Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham. 'If Trump continues with his dangerous, violent rhetoric these last few days, it may backfire. A campaign of personal retribution does not win votes from people.' Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump's late-campaign travels are not a signal of alarm. 'I'm not worried about anything,' Miller told reporters Friday. 'We have a smart strategy that's going to get President Trump across 270, maybe even a couple of states that surprise you, that slide in there. But we’re going to follow our strategy. Our strategy comes from our data and our targeting.' As he does at most of his events in North Carolina, Trump said in Gastonia that his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he installed as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, is from the state, and that Lara and Eric Trump named their daughter Carolina. 'It’s an amazing place. You’ve been through a lot,' Trump said, alluding to the hurricane before repeating a debunked claim that the Federal Emergency Management Agency prioritized people living in the country illegally over hurricane victims. 'Your government has not helped you too much, I can tell you. Your government, FEMA, has let you down because they wanted to spend the money on illegal migrants instead.' Roughly half of North Carolina's 7.8 million registered voters had already voted as of Friday, buoyed by early in-person voting, which ends on Saturday afternoon. North Carolina Republicans have been encouraged by early voter turnout among their supporters after national and state GOP leaders switched this year to a 'bank your vote' strategy, rather than focusing on Election Day turnout. Entering the final days of the campaign, over 50,000 more GOP registered voters than Democrats had voted early or by absentee ballot, even though there are over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans statewide, according to state elections data. It is unclear whether the Republicans' early vote surge will result in a higher overall turnout for Trump supporters. Independent voters now make up the largest group of registered voters in North Carolina. Trump lost ground with independents between 2016 and 2020. Harris supporter Gwen Garnett, 66, said Trump barnstorming North Carolina is 'just part of the process. It does not worry me at all.' She gave Harris’ candidacy a spiritual dimension. 'This is an anointed time for her to be in this role,' Garnett said. 'I just believe it’s God’s timing.' The state’s voters have shown a propensity to split their ticket over the years. That's why while Republicans have controlled the state legislature since 2011, Democrats have held the governor’s mansion for all but four years since 1993. The GOP's hopes to break that hold on Tuesday appeared to dwindle in recent weeks after the party’s nominee for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, received unwanted publicity from a CNN report that alleged he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago. While Robinson denied writing the messages and sued CNN for defamation last month, his campaign nearly imploded, raising fears that a large victory by Democrat Josh Stein, the state's attorney general, could harm GOP candidates in other races. ___ Robertson reported from Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina.
