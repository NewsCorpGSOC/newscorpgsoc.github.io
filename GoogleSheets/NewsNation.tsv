CIA believes COVID likely originated from a lab, but agency has l...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has 'low confidence' in its own conclusion. The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director. The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory. Mediterranean diet improves brain memory: Study Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities. 'CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,' a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment. Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs. Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. How will federal health ‘black out’ affect bird flu response? Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario. 'The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,' Ratcliffe said in 2023. The CIA 'will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA’s assessment,' the agency spokesperson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ap-cia-believes-covid-likely-originated-from-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-its-own-finding/	2025-01-25T12:41:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67954d6fbb08b7.80370789.jpeg?w=900
White House fires some independent inspector generals	(NewsNation) — A White House official has confirmed to NewsNation that 'some' of the independent inspectors general of major federal agencies 'have been asked to leave.' NewsNation partner The Hill reported that Trump has ousted around 17 federal watchdogs within various departments including the Department of Veteran Affairs, Defense Department, State Department, Energy Department and Housing and Urban Development. A HUD spokesperson told The Hill that Inspector General Rae Oliver Davis received notice on Friday. The Washington Post reported late Friday night that 'the White House fired the independent inspectors general of at least 14 major federal agencies in a purge that could clear the way for President Donald Trump to install loyalists in the crucial role of identifying fraud, waste and abuse in the government.' Mexico refuses US military flight deporting migrants, sources say House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig criticized Trump's move in a statement on Saturday. 'While the president has the right to replace inspector generals, the late-night firing of these independent watchdogs not only violates the law but also hampers our ability to combat waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure programs are run as Congress intended, whether its disaster assistance for farmers or nutrition programs,' she said. Craig referred to the 'midnight purge of inspector generals' as 'alarming and unprecedented.' 'These firings threaten to undermine public trust at a time when many hardworking Americans doubt whether government institutions are looking out for them and reinforce the perception that politicians get to play by a different set of rules,' she added. Senator Chuck Schumer also ripped Trump on X, saying that it 'is a glaring sign that it’s a Golden Age for corruption and abuse in government.' In an earlier statement on the platform, Schumer also said it could be a violation of federal law with 30 day-notice needed to fire inspector generals.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-fires-independent-inspector-generals/	2025-01-25T09:24:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072294.jpg?w=900
Senate confirms Noem to lead Department of Homeland Security	The Senate on Saturday approved the nomination of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), putting her at the center of an administration focused heavily on immigration. The 59-34 vote to confirm Noem capped off a relatively smooth process even as other nominees face more intense scrutiny. Six Democrats voted with Republicans to confirm Noem: Sens. John Fetterman (Pa.), Tim Kaine (Va.), Andy Kim (N.J.), Gary Peters (Mich.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.). Noem will lead one of the most sprawling agencies in government and one of particular importance in a Trump administration determined to crack down on immigration. During his first week in office, President Trump signed a number of orders on immigration, taking steps to militarize the border and crack down on many legal pathways for immigrating to the U.S. That included suspending refugee admissions and working to limit asylum — another pathway for those fleeing danger and persecution. He also sought to end birthright citizenship for children not born to U.S. citizens. While the order would apply to children of those unlawfully present, it could also impact those born to non-immigrant visas, such as those legally in the U.S. on work visas. It has already been challenged in court. The nomination is a major win for Noem, a four-term congresswoman with little national security experience but who had been vocal on border issues as governor, sending the South Dakota National Guard to the southern border. She is slated to work closely with Tom Homan, who Trump tapped as his border czar. It also solidifies her standing in MAGA circles after chatter about her serving as a potential running mate to Trump faltered amid the release of her book, in which she wrote about shooting a young dog she described as untrainable. Noem earned the backing of those on both sides of the aisle despite the role she will play in a controversial policy area. 'Kristi brings experience and commitment to her new role,' Senate Majority John Thune (R-S.D.) said on the Senate floor on Friday. 'One of the biggest challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security right now is securing our nation’s border. Four years of record breaking illegal immigration at our southern border has left our country vulnerable to a whole host of security concerns.' 'Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities, and it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security,' Thune continued. 'I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.' Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the top Democrat of the Senate Homeland and Government Affairs Committee, said he was willing to back Noem due to her commitment to handling issues on a bipartisan basis. 'During her confirmation hearing, I pressed Governor Noem to set aside partisan ideologies and to follow the facts when it comes to the threats our communities face – whether we’re talking about securing our borders, foreign and domestic terrorism, or even increasingly devastating natural disasters,' he said in a statement when Noem advanced out of committee. 'Given her openness to working on a bipartisan basis to address these and other threats to our homeland security, I voted to advance her nomination out of committee and send it to the Senate floor for consideration.' The South Dakota governor was on track for a bipartisan confirmation after the panel approved her in a 13-2 tally on Monday. Noem’s role will not just be limited to immigration. She will also oversee the numerous national security functions DHS controls, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and DHS’s Office of Intelligence Analysis. DHS also oversees the Secret Service, which has come under increasing scrutiny following two attempts on Trump’s life. The department also plays a key role in responding to cyberattacks through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Trump has also recently spoken about siphoning off another key DHS agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has come under fire as it has responded to a series of back-to-back natural disasters. The confirmation marks the fourth national security nominee the Senate has green-lighted in Trump’s first week. The upper chamber unanimously and quickly approved Marco Rubio to lead the State Department before Democrats forced Republicans to run out the clock in order to confirm John Ratcliffe and Pete Hegseth to lead the CIA and Pentagon, respectively.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-confirms-noem-to-lead-department-of-homeland-security/	2025-01-25T09:03:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/IMG_5214.jpeg?w=900
Inflation isn't the only reason egg prices are soaring	(NewsNation) — The last time eggs were under $2 a dozen was January 2022, around the time the now-widespread bird flu outbreak first originated. Now, egg eaters are lucky if they can find them cheaper than $7 to $9. Avian influenza, or bird flu, has killed millions of chicken flocks across the country, which is hurting the nation's egg-laying population. This has caused a supply shortage and in turn, higher prices for consumers. Egg prices have skyrocketed, with some grocery stores running out of the food item altogether and some placing limits on the number of cartons people can buy at once. In a statement to NewsNation, Walmart said they have not put a purchase limit on eggs but acknowledged that 'supply is very tight in some areas.' Experts say it’s going to get worse before it gets better. The Department of Agriculture reports that 136 million birds have been infected by or died from the bird flu since January 2022. More than 13 million chickens have died in the last month. Rents for single-family homes 41% higher than prepandemic In some states like California, prices have reached nearly $9 a carton, up 70% since December, according to the USDA Egg Markets News Report. Last week before President Donald Trump's inauguration, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would give biotech company Moderna just under $600 million to try to accelerate a bird flu vaccine. The FDA issued an alert saying eggs are safe to eat despite the infected chickens. Also, the risk of humans contracting the disease is rare. The CDC has reported 67 human cases and one death in Louisiana. The virus is also spreading among dairy cattle in California.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/egg-prices-soaring-bird-flu/	2025-01-25T08:39:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195557704.jpg?w=900
Missing Florida woman Jennifer Kesse's family hopeful 19 years la...	(NewsNation) — Florida woman Jennifer Kesse was last seen leaving for work in 2006. 19 years later, her family is still searching for answers, but hope remains with the involvement of state and federal agencies. On the anniversary of her disappearance, Jennifer's father Drew Kesse joined NewsNation's 'Banfield' to share how he feels her case was mishandled and explain how NASA got involved in the search. 'It’s Jennifer's time in the lineup, I guess, to either be found or not found,' Drew Kesse said. What happened to Jennifer Kesse? In 2016, 10 years after her disappearance, Jennifer was officially declared dead by the state of Florida. Since then, the Orlando Police Department handed the case files over to the family, who have now hired a private investigator, hoping for answers. They also enlisted the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is now leading the investigation. The agency announced Friday that it has conducted more than 50 interviews and reviewed tens of thousands of documents and pieces of evidence in hopes of developing new avenues to explore. Christy Giles’ husband: Hollywood producer’s defense is ‘shaky’ Florida woman Jennifer Kesse was last seen leaving for work in 2006 'FDLE, finally after 18 years, got involved, and it took them a little while to get going, but boy, they're going now,' Kesse said. 'But they are truly putting all the resources that they have towards trying to find out what happened to Jennifer, and we couldn't be more grateful. It's, been too long.' Nearly two decades ago on Jan. 24, 2006, Jennifer's day started like any other. She took a shower, got dressed, did her hair and makeup and then headed to work. But that's when things veered from the usual routine. The 24-year-old simply vanished. Her boyfriend didn't get his usual text that morning, and he couldn't reach her by phone. She didn't show up for work, which was unlike her, according to friends and family. Family of woman killed by estranged husband wants longer sentence Jennifer’s parents realized her purse, keys, phone and iPod — items she typically would take to work — were missing from her home. That was when Jennifer's parents contacted the Orlando Police Department. Soon after, Jennifer's car was found abandoned a mile away at a different apartment complex. Apartment security cameras showed images of a man parking her car around noon the day she disappeared. Because the video was so grainy, police made the rare move of reaching out to NASA for help.

(Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) NASA was able to produce a clearer image, providing a partial profile of the suspect, who wore clothing typical of a painter or some kind of worker. At the time of Jennifer's disappearance, she told her parents that workers at her building made her feel 'uncomfortable.' Once the family received the evidence from local police, they realized the lead detective hadn't been investigating. 'Come to find out, she did not write a single word for seven years,' Kesse said. 'It's a good thing that it's out of Orlando. I honestly don't think that they had the talent to do what's needed to do in a long-term missing persons case.' Evidence in Jennifer Kesse's case A witness saw Jennifer's car swerve out of the condo complex. Handprints and scratches on her car, which appeared to have been cleaned before it was found, indicate there may have been a struggle. A skeleton key for Jennifer's building had gone missing a year earlier. Physical evidence from the car includes hairs and 100 fingerprints, some of which were not identified to a person at the time. 'We do have to remember, technology has come so far since 2006. We didn't even have Google Earth in 2006. It was in beta, so we were still tapping twice on our phones for the letter B when we were texting things like that,' Kesse said. 'So, it's come a long way. Unfortunately, it just didn't help Jennifer at the time.' The family remains hopeful despite the decadeslong delays. 'This is what we live with, and we move forward every day because we have unconditional love for Jennifer,' Kesse said. 'We're just not going to give up until we find her.'

Hegseth says Pentagon will 'put America first' as sec. of defense	(NewsNation) — Pete Hegseth praised Jesus, President Donald Trump and his wife Jennifer for his Senate-confirmed position as Secretary of Defense. After being sworn in, Hegseth thanked those of greatest importance to him before saying it is 'the honor of a lifetime to serve under [the president].' Hegseth added, 'We will put America first, we will bring peace through strength. [At the Pentagon], we will restore the warrior ethos in everything that we do, rebuild our military and reestablish deterrence.' Vice President JD Vance's tiebreaking vote allowed for Hegseth's nomination to go through, despite tough grilling from legislators during the confirmation process. 'We don't want to fight wars, we want to deter them and we want to end them responsibly,' Hegseth said. 'But, if we need to fight them, we're going to bring overwhelming and decisive force to close with and destroy the enemy, and bring our boys home.' Democratic states weigh more support for immigrants as Trump administration cracks down His children and wife joined him on stage as Vance swore him in. 'I have to say a few words of appreciation, first, of course, to the President of the United States for nominating a person who is respected and adorned by the war fighters,' Vance said. 'I also want to say thank you to my Senate colleagues. It turns out we couldn't spare one.' Trump praised the Senate's decision. He wrote on Truth Social late Friday, 'Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense.' On Saturday before the swearing-in, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, showed his support. 'Congratulations to Pete Hegseth on being confirmed as Secretary of Defense,' Turner said in a statement. 'As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I look forward to working with Secretary Hegseth on rebuilding our military and its readiness to meet the challenges posed by our adversaries.' Former Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposed Hegseth's appointment, voting no on Friday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-congratulates-hegseth-secretary-of-defense/	2025-01-25T08:01:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Pete-Hegseth-e1731682598233.jpg?w=900
Mexico refuses US military flight deporting migrants, sources say	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Mexico has refused a request from President Donald Trump's administration to allow a U.S. military aircraft deporting migrants to land in the country, a U.S. official and a Mexican official told Reuters. U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants, to Guatemala on Friday. The government was not able to move ahead with a plan to have a C-17 transport aircraft land in Mexico, however, after the country denied permission. A U.S. official and a Mexican official confirmed the decision, which was first reported by NBC News. Mexico's foreign ministry, in a statement late on Friday, said the country had a 'very great relationship' with the U.S. and cooperated on issues such as immigration. 'When it comes to repatriations, we will always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms,' the ministry said. Secret Service says it visited Chicago elementary school, not ICE The Mexican official did not give a reason for the denial of permission to land, while the foreign ministry did not mention the incident. Trump's administration earlier this week announced it was re-launching the program known as 'Remain in Mexico,' which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their cases in the United States were resolved. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday such a move would require the country receiving the asylum-seekers to agree, and that Mexico had not done so. The U.S. State Department and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S.-Mexico relations have come into sharp focus since Trump started his second term on Monday with the declaration of a national emergency along the two nations' shared border. He has ordered 1,500 additional U.S. troops there so far, and officials have said thousands more could deploy soon. The president has declared Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations, renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and threatened an across-the-board 25% duty on Mexican goods beginning in February. Sheinbaum has sought to avoid escalating the situation and expressed openness toward accommodating Mexican nationals who are returned. Colorado hotline sees increased ICE raid reports around Denver But the leftist leader has also said she does not agree with mass deportations and that Mexican immigrants are vital to the U.S. economy. The use of U.S. military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon's response to Trump's national emergency declaration on Monday. In the past, U.S. military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. This was the first time in recent memory that U.S. military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one U.S. official said. The Pentagon has said that the U.S. military would provide flights to deport more than 5,000 immigrants held by U.S. authorities in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California. Guatemala also on Friday received a third flight of about 80 deported migrants on a chartered commercial aircraft, Guatemalan authorities told Reuters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/mexico-refuses-us-flight-deporting-migrants/	2025-01-25T06:21:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2172480608.jpg?w=900
Trump's 5 biggest moves on immigration so far	President Trump released a flurry of immigration actions this week, signing a series of orders targeting the border and ramping up enforcement. While Trump has long pledged to address illegal immigration, many of his actions targeted longstanding legal pathways. 'As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,' he said in his inaugural address. Immigration advocates describe the actions as yet another example of Trump cruelty, targeting vulnerable people while causing further unrest at the border in ways that won’t make Americans safer. Here’s a look at Trump’s five biggest moves on immigration during his first week in office: Birthright citizenship Trump signed an order on Day One to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to many noncitizen parents. It’s a move that directly counters the Constitution, which grants citizenship to anyone born in U.S. territory regardless of the status of their parents. The order generated some of the first lawsuits — and legal victories — against the Trump administration. Twenty-two different Democrat-led states sued over the order, as did groups including the American Civil Liberties Union. And a four-group band of states led by Washington scored a temporary injunction blocking the order for the next two weeks. 'I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, said during the hearing. The order was broader than just targeting children of those who may not be in the country legally. It applied to anyone in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant visa, a status that also includes those on work visas, raising numerous questions for how the children of those lawfully present would be viewed under U.S. law. Refugee program suspended Another order from Trump paused the U.S. refugee program, leaving the program under review for three months. The order calls for the Departments of Homeland Security and State to issue a report within 90 days detailing whether it’s in the nation’s interests to resume the admission of refugees. The secretaries of State and Homeland Security will submit a report every 90 days until it is found that it is appropriate to resume refugee admissions, the order states. Until then, refugee admissions will remain suspended. Though the order was not set to take effect until Monday, both agencies immediately curtailed their refugee operations. The State Department suspended refugee flights, saying it was 'coordinating with implementing partners to suspend refugee arrivals to the United States and cease processing activities.' And an email reviewed by The Hill that was sent to staffers who process refugee cases at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also directed them not to 'make any final decisions (approval, denial closure) on any refugee application.' 'The refugee program is not just a humanitarian lifeline through which the U.S. has shown global leadership. It represents the gold standard of legal immigration pathways in terms of security screening, community coordination, and mutual economic benefit,' Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, which helps resettle refugees, said in a statement when the order was first announced. Shutting down the CBP One app After Trump took office, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol suspended the CBP One App, cancelling all outstanding appointments made by migrants without visas who sought to enter the United States through legal ports of entry. CBP One was a key component of the Biden administration’s efforts to channel migrants through legal pathways to seek refuge in the United States, one they also used to bring a more orderly process at the border. Shutting down the app left in limbo those who have been waiting months just to get an appointment. It also sparked criticism from immigration advocates who said the Trump administration was targeting those who have sought to come to the U.S. through legal channels. The Trump administration this week also shut down the Safe Mobility portal, another initiative of the Biden administration that established offices across Latin America to help immigrants find legal pathways to the U.S. and dissuade them from migrating illegally. Militarizing the border Trump signed a series of orders directing increased military presence at the southern border. He signed a proclamation Monday evening declaring a national emergency at the border, a move that will mobilize additional resources to the region. The declaration will allow the Trump administration to deploy Pentagon forces and resources to help complete construction of the border wall and also allows for surveillance at the border, including the use of uncrewed aerial systems. Trump also signed an executive order directing U.S. Northern Command to draft detailed operational plans for the border. That directive came in an order declaring an 'invasion' there. The Pentagon is sending around 1,000 Army soldiers and 500 Marines to the border, building on an existing practice of relying on troops to support existing immigration agents. But the White House’s nods to the potential for more troops raises questions over whether military presence at the border could eventually violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars troops from carrying out domestic law enforcement duties. Beyond potential legal issues, immigration advocates are also concerned about having armed troops in close proximity to migrants. 'Military people are trained for a very aggressive, bellicose scenario, not necessarily for crowd control,' said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 'And so we feel that there are other types of law enforcement agencies that are trained for that, and that are best suited to be at the border, and they are already at the border.' Boasting over the border While Trump has taken a significant number of immigration actions, in some cases his team also sought to take credit for ongoing immigration enforcement actions. The White House on Friday shared an image of migrants boarding a plane, saying 'deportations have begun.' The photo was also emblazoned with the words, 'Promises made. Promises kept.' Of course, deportations never stopped under President Biden, and the statement was mocked by immigration experts. 'Are these people seriously trying to suggest the deportation flights have not already been going on?' Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, wrote on X. 'They’re lying to you. The Biden administration had already ramped up deportations from the border to a higher level than it was under the Trump admin.' The photo of migrants boarding a plane to be deported was reportedly returning a group of Guatemalan citizens, a nation that accepted hundreds of deportation flights during the Biden administration. Government accounts on Friday also sought to highlight migrants arrests, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) touting it had made 538 arrests and lodged 373 detainers as of Thursday night. However, those figures are also not a sharp departure from the levels that were under Biden, with Reichlin-Melnick saying the Trump administration was 'slap[ping] a ‘mass deportation’ sticker on the side of normal ICE operations.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-5-biggest-moves-on-immigration-so-far/	2025-01-25T04:07:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Immigration-–-5-things_012425_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=900
Hamas releases 4 female Israeli soldiers in ceasefire deal swap	(NewsNation) — Another four hostages in Hamas captivity were released Saturday morning and have returned to Israel, nearly one week since the start of the ceasefire deal with Israel in the war in Gaza. This is the second round of hostages freed since the deal took effect Sunday, Jan. 19. The hostages are four female Israeli soldiers, 19-year-old Liri Albag and 20-year-olds Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, who were kidnapped on Oct. 7, 2023, in the Hamas attack that spawned the war. Agam Berger, 20, was another female soldier abducted from their unit but was not included in the deal, reports say. Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next The four women were seen in military uniforms handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross a few minutes after 4 a.m. ET (11 a.m. local) in Gaza City. Shortly after, the Israeli military confirmed. They will be medically evaluated, transferred to hospitals and then reunited with their families.

On the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three female hostages -- Emily Damari, 28; Romi Gonen, 24; and Doron Steinbrecher, 31 -- in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. An additional 200 prisoners were set free on Saturday.

Israel and Hamas are set to swap more hostages for prisoners in a...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel and Hamas were expected to swap more hostages for Palestinian prisoners on Saturday, the second such exchange since a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip last weekend and another test for the deal. The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the militant group. The fragile deal has so far held, quieting airstrikes and rockets and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory. When the ceasefire started Sunday, three hostages held by the militants were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. On Saturday, four hostages are expected to be freed for 200 prisoners, including 120 who are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis. They will likely be released into Gaza or sent abroad. The four Israeli soldiers, Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19, were captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war. They were taken from Nahal Oz base near the border with Gaza when Palestinian militants overran it, killing more than 60 soldiers there. The female abductees had all served in a unit of lookouts charged with monitoring threats along the border. A fifth female soldier in their unit, Agam Berger, 20, was abducted with them but not included in the list. Israel's military issued a statement Saturday morning saying that preparations had been completed to receive the hostages and provide them medical care and personal support at the initial reception points, then transfer them to hospitals and reunite them with their families. In Gaza City's central Palestine Square, a crowd began to gather early as militants worked to cordon off an area where the hostages were expected to be handed over to the Red Cross. After the swap, Israel is expected to begin pulling back from the Netzarim corridor — an east-west road dividing Gaza in two — and allowing displaced Palestinians in the south to return to their former homes in the north for the first time since the beginning of the war. Palestinians will only be allowed to move north on foot, with vehicular traffic restricted until later in the ceasefire. What happens after the deal’s initial six-week phase is uncertain, but many hope it will lead to the end of a war that has leveled wide swaths of Gaza, displaced the vast majority of its population, and left hundreds of thousands of people at risk of famine. The conflict began with a cross-border attack led by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 others hostage. More than 100 hostages were freed in a weeklong truce the following month. But dozens have remained in captivity for over a year with no contact with the outside world. Israel believes at least a third of the more than 90 captives still inside Gaza were killed in the initial attack or died in captivity. Israel's air and ground war, one of the deadliest and most destructive in decades, has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not say how many were militants. They say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. ___ Follow coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-and-hamas-are-set-to-swap-more-hostages-for-prisoners-in-another-test-of-the-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-01-25T00:03:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67949b5bc22859.29490535.jpeg?w=900
Trump visit is 'morale boost': CA fire official	PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. (NewsNation) — Cal Fire battalion chief Brent Pascua said President Donald Trump's visit to Southern California following wildfire devastation is a 'morale boost' for the firefighters who have been working tirelessly. 'It's not over,' Pascua said during an appearance on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'I don't know what Trump can give us, but it's a morale boost.' Trump toured the damage caused by wildfires in Southern California on Friday, later expressing that the devastation is beyond what can be captured in images. Trump says the federal government is behind California ‘100%’ Trump acknowledged he had a 'very positive talk' with California Gov. Gavin Newsom once he landed in Los Angeles. He told wildfire victims and city officials the federal government is '100% behind California.' Gavin Newsom signs $2.5B bill to aid California wildfire recovery His comments came after he took an aerial and walking tour of Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood destroyed by one of the recent fires. On Thursday, Newsom signed legislation directing $2.5 billion in relief to support response and recovery efforts for Los Angeles.

Bolton: What can Pete Hegseth do in a 'tripolar nuclear world'?	(NewsNation) — Democrats missed the chance to grill Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth on topics of national security while favoring questions about his 'drinking' and 'womanizing,' said Donald Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. 'I think the way the confirmation hearing was conducted left it entirely open to the Democrats to try and make the case against Hegseth on the basis of competence, and they didn't do it,' he said. Bolton told NewsNation’s Elizabeth Vargas that Hegseth’s expertise wasn’t fully put to the test during the hearing. Pete Hegseth will be confirmed, has ‘big shoes to fill’: Clark 'What are you going to do in a tripolar nuclear world where China joins Russia and the U.S. (in terms of nuclear weapon capabilities)? So we just don't know what (Hegseth) knows or doesn't know — but we're going to find out one way or another,' Bolton said. He believes that barring an unforeseen event, Hegseth will be confirmed as secretary of defense on Friday evening. Bolton’s security detail revoked He also addressed President Donald Trump’s decision to revoke his security detail, a move that could potentially endanger the former diplomat’s life. 'I think this kind of attitude by Trump shows that what his real motivation was was entirely political,' said Bolton. 'This is part of the retribution campaign.' Trump revoked government security protection for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and Bolton, all of whom have faced threats from Iran since they took hard-line stances on the Islamic Republic during Trump's first administration. Trump signs order to declassify files on JFK, RFK and MLK Jr. assassinations Bolton, who has been targeted for assassination by Iran, said the Republic is still looking to exact revenge for the U.S. assassination of Iranian defense official Qassem Soleimani in 2020. 'President Biden back in late 2021 ordered that I receive protection,' said Bolton. 'It was ordered on the basis that the reason the Iranians were threatening to — and not just threatening, trying — to hire hitmen to assassinate me was because I carried out my official responsibilities as national security adviser.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pete-hegseth-confirmation-john-bolton/	2025-01-24T15:47:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/hegsethpete_120924gn02_w.jpg?w=900
Pete Hegseth will be confirmed, has 'big shoes to fill': Clark	(NewsNation) — Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth 'has some big shoes to fill' if he is confirmed, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark said on 'NewsNation Now.' 'I think it's the president's choice. That's our system,' the retired four-star general said ahead of Friday's Senate vote. 'I think the senior ranks in the military will do the best they can to work with the officer or leader appointed over them,' Clark added. Bolton: What can Pete Hegseth do in a ‘tripolar nuclear world’? Hegseth, a Fox News personality and former combat veteran, faces allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive actions toward women. He's denied all allegations. Detractors of the 44-year-old nominee also point to his inexperience and the Department of Defense's massive budget as a mismatch. 'Pete Hegseth has got to prove himself,' Clark said. 'He's got to earn their respect. Having the office is one thing, but actually doing the job is another.' Trump ends federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci If confirmed, which Clark thinks is likely, what matters most for Hegseth is who he works with — preferably, those with more bureaucratic experience. 'He's got to have people around him that he trusts who do have that experience,' Clark added. 'Because you're managing a huge bit of bureaucracy ... it requires attention to detail and management skill.'

Watch live: Pete Hegseth faces close Senate vote for confirmation	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Senate will vote on the nomination of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense Friday night, one day after two Republicans said they could not support the former combat veteran and Fox News personality serving in the role. However, Hegseth could still have enough support in the Senate in Friday's vote, even if one more Republican chooses not to support the nominee. On Thursday, Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced in separate statements why they voted against advancing Hegseth's nomination following Thursday's 51-49 Senate vote. Despite the two GOP defections, Republicans who spoke with NewsNation ahead of the vote believed Hegseth has enough support to secure the nomination. If needed, Vice President JD Vance could cast the tie-breaking vote should another Republican senator follow Murkowski and Collins’ lead. Trump tours Helene-hit North Carolina on first trip of second term Hegseth faces allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive actions toward women, which he has denied. In her statement announcing her decision not to support Hegseth’s nomination, Murkowski mentioned both of the claims levied against Hegseth while Collins said she believed the former television host lacked the experience to serve as defense secretary. Murkowski’s statement said that Hegseth’s 'past behaviors …demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who could lead our armed forces.' Regardless, other Republican senators expected Hegseth to be appointed to the role he was nominated for by President Donald Trump. 'Who knows, he may lose one more (Republican),' Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told NewsNation. 'But I’d be very surprised based on the number of people who have publicly said they are going to support him. … I’d be surprised if we lost another vote.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hegseth-senate-vote-confirmation/	2025-01-24T13:05:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675b325ce76751.04159269.jpeg?w=900
1,300 arrested in big city deportation operations: Homan	(NewsNation) — Federal authorities have arrested more than 1,300 migrants, according to President Donald Trump’s 'border czar' Tom Homan, who has carried out deportation operations in nearly 10 major cities across the U.S. Homan told NewsNation on Thursday that of the 1,300 arrested, at least 1,000 have criminal records. 'The other ones are either fugitives who've been through immigration court, that became a fugitive, or collaterals … in sanctuary cities because they forced us in the community,' Homan said. The number of arrests in the first three days of Trump’s presidency represents about 1.1% of total arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in FY2024. Fugitive task force plays critical role in border mission There were about 310 average arrests per day in 2024, but that average is now about 433 per day — with a high likelihood that number will grow. Homan said the Biden administration did not allow ICE to arrest migrants unless they were convicted of a serious crime, but that that policy no longer binds agents. 'There's nothing in the Immigration Nationality Act that says you got to be convicted of a crime. If you're here illegally, you could be removed,' he said. 'Our focus is on arresting public safety threats and national security threats. That's exactly what we're doing now.' Raids have taken place in major cities such as Boston, Denver, New York City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Miami, Washington, D.C., and Newark, N.J., according to media reports. Several of those, such as Newark, are sanctuary cities, which are areas that have refused to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in deportation proceedings. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said in a statement Thursday that ICE agents detained multiple people — including U.S. citizens, a U.S. military veteran and undocumented individuals — without a warrant. Trump expands use of fast-track deportation, which critics say is prone to mistakes 'Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,' the statement read. In Chicago, another sanctuary city, Mayor Brandon Johnson launched a campaign in conjunction with the public transportation system in which digital monitors at train stations provide 'know your rights' information to migrants, reported WLS-TV. 'Any of the measures that the president is looking to execute against working people in the city of Chicago ... ' Johnson said, according to the outlet, 'We will defend our city. It's just that simple.' But Homan pushed back on sanctuary cities, saying if they cooperated by allowing ICE into local jails, then federal agents wouldn't have to go into communities to arrest people. 'They're not letting us in the county jail because of their sanctuary laws, but if we can arrest the bad guy in the safety and security of a jail — which is safer for the officer, safer for the aliens, safer for the community — then it'd be a lot less of the type of low-level offenders, and be a lot less arrested,' Homan said. When agents are forced into the community, 'sanctuary cities will get exactly what they don't want: more agents in neighborhoods and more collateral arrests while we're doing this criminal operation,' he said. 'I hope the sanctuary cities come around,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/arrests-big-city-deportation/	2025-01-24T09:23:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/videoframe_2526.png?w=800
Trump tours Helene-hit North Carolina on first trip of second ter...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will kick off his first cross-country tour of his second term Friday, visiting disaster areas in North Carolina and California before heading to Nevada on Saturday for a rally. The tour comes as Trump considers overhauling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), floating the idea that he'd rather see states handle their 'own problems.' Friday's focus is on two major disaster zones. Trump's first stop is North Carolina, a state he visited in the wake of Hurricane Helene while still campaigning for the White House. Without FEMA, ‘more people would have died’ in Helene: Resident He'll return as he renews his criticism of the Biden administration, accusing it and FEMA of abandoning North Carolina, which still faces more than $50 billion in damage. After the Tar Heel State, Trump will head to California, where wildfires continue to burn and first responders work to contain the blazes. On Saturday, his trip to Nevada will strike a different tone as he thanks voters for giving him his first win in the state. He's expected to highlight his 'no tax on tips' campaign promises.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tours-north-carolina-helene/	2025-01-24T05:25:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194583291.jpg?w=900
Trump to survey wildfire-damaged Southern California	PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will tour the damage caused by wildfires in Southern California on Friday as he continues to feud with Gov. Gavin Newsom over his handling of the disaster and federal aid. Nearly 50,000 acres have burned from Los Angeles to San Diego. Eight active wildfires are burning in the region, and a red flag warning remains in effect. Residents are also reeling from the deadly and destructive Palisades and Eaton fires. Trump has criticized the state for not sending enough water into the cities, while Newsom accuses the president of spreading misinformation. The Trump administration has remained largely silent about specific plans for Friday. Trump may visit the region in person to survey the widespread damage, or he could choose to view it from a helicopter. Gavin Newsom signs $2.5B bill to aid California wildfire recovery Newsom, Trump spar on California water policy Tensions have escalated between Newsom and Trump over how the wildfires have been managed. Since the fires broke out on Jan. 7, Trump has used social media and interviews to accuse the state of sending too much water to the Pacific Ocean instead of south toward Los Angeles and to highlight how some hydrants ran dry in the early hours of the firefight in Pacific Palisades. In the first hours of his second term, Trump called on federal officials to draft plans to route more water to the crop-rich Central Valley and densely populated cities in the southern part of the state. Disaster prep: How to know if you’re underinsured Two days later, he threatened to withhold federal disaster aid unless California leaders change the state's approach to its management of water. Trump blames Newsom for the city's inability to tame some of the deadly fires, while Newsom denies this claim. On Thursday, Newsom signed legislation directing $2.5 billion in relief to support response and recovery efforts for Los Angeles.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/trump-survey-wildfire-damage-california/	2025-01-24T04:57:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25022819258498-1.jpg?w=900
A look at the executive orders President Trump has signed	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wasted no time in carrying out his White House agenda with a series of executive orders ranging from securing the U.S.-Mexico border and the ban on TikTok to pushing economic policies designed to prioritize American interests. By signing 26 executive orders during his first day in office alone, Trump put himself on pace to rank among the fastest-acting presidents during his first 100 days in office. In addition to curbing the flow of migrants entering the U.S. illegally, Trump has vowed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the government and to establish the Department of Government Efficiency.

US active duty troops beginning to arrive in Texas and San Diego ...	WASHINGTON (AP) - Active duty military troops will begin arriving in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego on Thursday evening, in what defense officials said is the first batch of the new forces being deployed to secure the southern border. The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that about 1,500 troops were being sent to the border this week, as the department scrambles to put in motion President Donald Trump’s executive order demanding an immediate crackdown on immigration. U.S. officials said they expect additional troops to be ordered to deploy in the next few days as defense and homeland security leaders iron out requests for more support. The officials said it’s not yet clear how many more service members would get tapped in the near future, but they would include active duty, National Guard and Reserves, and come from land, air and sea forces. Other defense and military officials this week estimated that the additional number deployed could be in the thousands. The troops announced Wednesday include about 1,000 Army soldiers from a variety of units and 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton in California. Officials said Thursday that they expect the bulk of them to be in El Paso - including Fort Bliss - or in San Diego by Friday, where they will get their mission assignments and prepare to spread out along the border. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details on troop movements. There were already about 2,500 Guard and Reserve forces deployed to the border, and the new 1,500 would add to that total. But officials noted that given the length of the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico, it will take additional forces to help put large rolls of concertina wire barriers in place and provide needed transportation, intelligence and other support to the Border Patrol. As of Thursday there were still no requests for the use of military bases to house migrants or for troops to be used for law enforcement duties.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/us-active-duty-troops-beginning-to-arrive-in-texas-and-san-diego-to-support-border-security/	2025-01-23T15:48:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-163834.jpg?w=494
Released JFK files could be ‘embarrassing’ to CIA: Journalist	(NewsNation) — An investigative journalist and Pulitzer Prize finalist said that while the release of thousands of classified government documents about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy may not put any conspiracy theories to rest, they will likely be 'embarrassing' to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 'I think these files won't prove that (the CIA) was behind the effort to kill the president, but I think they will be embarrassing to the agency about how much they knew that Oswald was unhinged in the weeks before the assassination,' Gerald Posner told NewsNation’s Elizabeth Vargas. 'They never told the FBI. So to the extent the files show that it will be embarrassing to the agency, and it should be, because we need to see these after all these years well.' Trump: Make products in America or face tariffs Trump had promised during his reelection campaign to make public the last batches of still-classified documents surrounding Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, which has transfixed people for decades. He made a similar pledge during his first term but ultimately bent to appeals from the CIA and FBI to keep some documents withheld. Posner cautions, however, that if you’re looking for what he calls an 'X-Files' moment, you’re probably going to be disappointed. Nevertheless, Posner said there will be 'important information' in the released files. 'There are still files about the Bay of Pigs, the failed invasion there. There are things about the Mafia, CIA plot to kill (Fidel) Castro. There's some Mexican intelligence material on Oswald. So we'll fill in part of the history, but I don't think it will put the conspiracy theories to rest,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/released-jfk-files-cia-gerald-posner/	2025-01-23T15:19:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194905868.jpg?w=900

'Give that to RFK Jr.,' Trump said about the pen he used to sign the order declassifying information about the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations. 'All will be revealed.' Trump: Make products in America or face tariffs Trump had promised on the campaign trail to release classified intelligence and law enforcement files on the 1963 assassination of JFK, America's 35th president. He had made a similar promise during his 2017 to 2021 term, and he did in fact release some documents related to JFK's 1963 slaying. But he ultimately bowed to pressure from the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, and kept a significant chunk of documents under wraps, citing national security concerns.

Senate advances Hegseth nomination; Collins, Murkowski vote 'no'	The Senate voted largely along party lines Thursday to advance Pete Hegseth, President Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of Defense, brushing aside a litany of misconduct allegations and the objections of Democrats who argued he is unqualified for the job. The 51-49 vote to end debate on Hegseth’s nomination sets the stage for a final confirmation vote on Friday, when he is expected to secure the majority support he needs to join Trump’s Cabinet. Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine) voted against Hegseth. Trump has touted Hegseth as someone who would bring a fresh perspective to the leadership of the Pentagon, move past the 'political agendas' of the Biden administration and help build the 'most powerful military in the world.' Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, who strongly supported Hegseth throughout the confirmation process, argued that the American people gave Trump 'a clear mandate' to reform Washington. He called Hegseth a 'good choice' who would be 'open to new ideas' and 'not beholden to the status quo.' Democrats, however, panned Hegseth as completely unqualified and unfit to lead the nation’s armed forces given his lack of managerial experience and multiple allegations of misbehavior. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) on Thursday called Hegseth, a former Fox News host who retired from the Army with the rank of major, 'utterly unqualified' and among Trump’s 'very worst nominees.' 'Pete Hegseth has shown himself not only incapable of running a large organization, he often shows himself incapable of showing up or showing up in a way where he could get anything done,' Schumer said. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the ranking member of the Armed Services panel, said Hegseth repeatedly 'dodged and deferred' allegations of 'disregarding the laws of war, financial mismanagement, racist and sexist remarks about men and women in uniform, alcohol abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment and other troubling issues.' Democrats highlighted throughout the contentious confirmation process his infidelities to multiple spouses and allegations that he got drunk at work events. That was enough to help sway Murkowski, who announced shortly before the vote that she would vote against Hegseth, citing 'significant concerns with his nomination.' She said that managing the 'department of Defense requires vast experience and expertise' and that Hegseth’s prior career experience does 'not demonstrate to me that he is prepared for such immense responsibility.' 'His leadership of two veteran organizations was marked with accusations of financial mismanagement and problems with the workplace culture he fostered,' she said. Hegseth admitted during his confirmation that he was 'not a perfect person' but he vigorously denied the allegation that he sexually assaulted a woman in 2017 or that he mismanaged the finances of two veterans’ groups he ran before joining Fox News as a contributor in 2014. But the nominee admitted to having a consensual sexual encounter with the woman who accused him of assault in 2017 while he was still married to his second wife and shortly after he fathered a child with another woman who would become his third wife. Murkowski cited this behavior as raising serious concerns about the nominee’s judgment. 'While the allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking do nothing to quiet my concerns, the past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces,' she said. The closely decided vote by the full Senate to advance Hegseth marks a remarkable turnaround for a nominee. He appeared to be in deep trouble in early December after allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement and public drunkenness surfaced in several media outlets. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said she hadn’t gotten to yes on Hegseth when asked about her position during a Fox News interview in early December, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) initially called the allegations 'disturbing.' Trump even floated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a possible Plan B option to head the Pentagon before changing his mind and deciding to fully back his embattled nominee. The president’s advisers warned, however, that if he let Hegseth’s nomination go down in flames, it could embolden Democrats and produce a domino-like chain reaction of other Cabinet picks failing to advance. Trump’s decision to double down in his support of Hegseth was backed by a strong push by the president’s allies on social media, who piled immense pressure on wavering Senate Republicans, including Ernst and Graham, to support the nominee. Ernst and Graham announced their support after Hegseth survived a bruising confirmation hearing at which Democrats repeatedly grilled him about his drinking, his infidelity, his management of Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America, and his view of women in combat roles. Ernst said after the hearing that Democrats 'were there just to score political points,' adding 'I think they failed.' Graham said Hegseth showed his mettle during several hours of withering criticism 'Democratic attacks were overly personal and fell flat. It was clear Pete was more prepared for the hearing than my Democratic colleagues,' he said. Wicker held a vote Monday to report Hegseth’s nomination out of the Senate Armed Services Committee over the angry objections of Democrats on the panel, who argued that Republicans should respect the tradition of waiting at least seven days after a hearing to report a nominee to the floor. The Armed Services panel voted along party lines, 14-13, to waive the seven-day rule and advance the nominee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-advances-hegseth-nomination-paving-way-to-confirmation/	2025-01-23T12:02:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/hegsethpete_011425gn43_w.jpg?w=900
A federal judge temporarily blocks Trump’s executive order redefi...	SEATTLE (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order redefining birthright citizenship, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional' during the first hearing in a multi-state effort challenging the order. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour repeatedly interrupted a Justice Department lawyer during arguments to ask how he could consider the order constitutional. When the attorney, Brett Shumate, said he’d like a chance to explain it in a full briefing, Coughenour told him the hearing was his chance. The temporary restraining order sought by Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington was the first to get a hearing before a judge and applies nationally. The case is one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and a number of immigrants rights groups across the country. The suits include personal testimonies from attorneys general who are U.S. citizens by birthright, and names pregnant women who are afraid their children won’t become U.S. citizens. Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee, began the hearing by grilling the administration’s attorneys, saying the order 'boggles the mind.' 'This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' Coughenour told Shumate. Coughenour said he’s been on the bench for more than four decades, and he couldn’t remember seeing another case where the action challenged was so clearly unconstitutional. Shumate said he respectfully disagreed and asked the judge for an opportunity to have a full briefing on the merits of the case, rather than have a 14-day restraining order issued blocking its implementation. Arguing for the states, Washington assistant attorney general Lane Polozola labeled as 'absurd' the government’s argument that the children of parents living in the country illegally are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States. 'Are they not subject to the decisions of the immigration courts?' he asked. 'Must they not follow the law while they are here?' He also said the restraining order was warranted because, among other reasons, the executive order would immediately start requiring the states to spend millions to revamp health care and benefits systems to consider an applicant’s citizenship status. 'The executive order will impact hundreds of thousands of citizens nationwide who will lose their citizenship under this new rule,' Polozola said. 'Births cannot be paused while the court considers this case.' Trump's executive order, which he signed on Inauguration Day, is slated to take effect on Feb. 19. It could impact hundreds of thousands of people born in the country, according to one of the lawsuits. In 2022, there were about 255,000 births of citizen children to mothers living in the country illegally and about 153,000 births to two such parents, according to the four-state suit filed in Seattle. The Trump administration argued in papers filed Wednesday that the states don’t have grounds to bring a suit against the order and that no damage has yet been done, so temporary relief isn’t called for. The administration’s attorneys also clarified that the executive order only applies to people born after Feb. 19, when it’s set to take effect. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them. The lawsuits argue that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship for people born and naturalized in the U.S., and states have been interpreting the amendment that way for a century. Ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, the amendment says: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Trump’s order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and orders federal agencies to not recognize citizenship for children who don’t have at least one parent who is a citizen . A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. After a trip abroad, he faced being denied reentry by the federal government on the grounds that he wasn’t a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act. But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say it’s less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally. Trump’s order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation’s first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. 'There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own,' Tong said this week. One of the lawsuits aimed at blocking the executive order includes the case of a pregnant woman, identified as 'Carmen,' who is not a citizen but has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent residency status. 'Stripping children of the ‘priceless treasure’ of citizenship is a grave injury,' the suit says. 'It denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.' ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ap-a-bid-to-block-trumps-cancellation-of-birthright-citizenship-is-in-federal-court/	2025-01-23T11:09:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67929430814294.64823705.jpeg?w=900
DOGE faces 'constant battle' in cutting spending: Burchett	(NewsNation) — The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is up and running now that President Donald Trump has taken office and has plenty of options for where to begin cutting government spending. The group, led by Elon Musk, is tasked with reducing federal spending by at least $2 trillion. Three lawsuits have already been filed over the formation of DOGE, which has targeted budget items such as health care and education for cuts, according to U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who sits on the House DOGE subcommittee. Burchett said he expects DOGE to go after Pentagon spending, which he told NewsNation is 'bloated' and said the group must also look at health care and Medicare, where he said there is fraud and duplication that needs eliminating. Trump re-ups tariff threats against Mexico, Canada, Russia Burchett also said education could be a target for spending and believes funding being devoted to the U.S. Department of Education should be returned to the states. 'I don’t know if we’ve got the guts to (eliminate the Department of Education),' Burchett said. 'I’ve got the guts to do it. We can pay our teachers more and that’s what the unions are supposed to be about — not about promoting bureaucrats. …they’re worse than the mob.' With so many areas to consider spending cuts, however, Burchett is not confident DOGE can reach its goal of eliminating as much spending as it has been tasked with by the time Trump leaves office. 'Heck, no. It’s going to be a constant fight,' Burchett said. 'People up here have no guts. They run on this, they go home to their districts to their MAGA and Reagan Day dinners and they’ll focus on things like Nancy Pelosi’s stock portfolio. … It’s all a diversion and then they come up here and they vote you down the river.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-constant-battle-cutting-spending/	2025-01-23T09:01:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
Hughes Fire breaks out in California, 50,000 under evacuation ord...	(NewsNation) – More than 50,000 people are under evacuation warnings because of another fire that broke out late Wednesday morning in Los Angeles County. The Hughes fire started late Wednesday morning and and quickly engulfed 10,176 acres, according to CAL FIRE. It charred miles of trees and brush near Castaic Lake, a popular recreation area. The extremely strong winds were fueling the flames. However, they have since died down — something firefighters are using to their advantage. 'It’s really terrible to see it happening,' Chris Dittes, a member of the Castaic Town Council, said. 'But this instance here is not one of tragedy. There’s no homes that have been burned as far as I know. It’s just just been brush that has actually long needed to burn.' Oscar noms announced: Which film leads the pack? Still, 'any fire, of course, is scary,' Dittes added. Evacuation warnings were also in effect but later lifted for parts of the Brentwood and Bel Air neighborhoods for the Sepulveda Fire, which started overnight. Firefighters were able to stop forward progress on Sepulveda around 2 a.m. Thursday, NewsNation local affiliate KTLA reported. That blaze torched around 40 acres. The Los Angeles area had already been devastated by wildfires that began earlier this month and have continued burning. Of these, the Palisades Fire is the largest, burning 23,448 acres. It is 70% contained, per CAL FIRE. The second-largest, the Eaton Fire, is 14,021 acres and 95% contained. Disaster zone: How to know if your home is underinsured Meanwhile, the Clay Fire in Riverside County has burned 39 acres and reached 65% containment. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said residents and officials have been on edge over the last 16 days because of the numerous figures started in January. However, Marrone noted that the situation for the Hughes fire is different. 'In addition to the state resources that were pre-deployed, we had two strike teams in the Santa Clarita area,' he told reporters. 'We were able to amass a lot of fire resources early on to change what this fire looks like.'

Kohberger to appear in court as defense challenges DNA evidence	(NewsNation) — Attorneys for Idaho college killings suspect Bryan Kohberger are set to ask a judge to dismiss most of the evidence in the case, which they believe relies on a genetic investigation process that they say is unconstitutional. Kohberger's defense team also claims the search warrants in the case were tainted by police misconduct. They'll make their arguments during a two-day hearing starting Thursday. If successful, their motion could significantly disrupt the prosecution's case ahead of the trial, which is set to begin in August. Idaho college murders timeline in Bryan Kohberger case Prosecutors say the investigation, including the use of genetic genealogy, was properly done. Part of Thursday's hearing will be held behind closed doors, which the judge says is meant to avoid potential jurors being 'tainted' by hearing evidence that might not be allowed in trial. The open portions of the hearing will be livestreamed on the court's YouTube page, starting at 9 a.m. local time. Prosecutors: Bryan Kohberger's DNA on knife sheath Kohberger's attorneys claim law enforcement violated his constitutional rights when they used Investigative Genetic Genealogy, or IGG, to identify possible suspects. The IGG process often starts when DNA found at the scene of a crime doesn’t yield any results through standard law enforcement databases. When that happens, investigators may look at all the variations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, that are in the DNA sample. Those SNPs, or 'snips,' are then uploaded to a genealogy database like GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA to look for possible relatives of the person whose DNA was found at the scene. In Kohberger's case, investigators said they found 'touch DNA,' or trace DNA, on the sheath of a knife that was found in the home where the students were fatally stabbed. The FBI used the IGG process on that DNA, and the information reportedly identified Kohberger as a possible suspect. Kohberger allowed to wear suit during murder trial The defense team also says that once Kohberger was identified as a possible suspect, law enforcement officers either purposely or recklessly lied or omitted crucial information when they asked the court to issue search warrants for his apartment, his parent's house, his car, his cellphone and even for his own DNA. They want all of that evidence kept out of the trial as well. Specific details about the alleged police misconduct are hidden from public view. Judge Steven Hippler has kept most of those court filings, along with many of the court documents on the IGG evidence, under seal. Bryan Kohberger can face death penalty if convicted Kohberger, accused of killing four University of Idaho students on Nov. 13, 2022, can face the death penalty if convicted, a judge ruled last November. Kohberger’s defense team sought to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment, but Hippler denied its request. The deaths of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, shocked the small town of Moscow. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths.

Elon Musk's father calls claims Elon made Nazi salute 'rubbish'	(NewsNation) — During an exclusive interview with NewsNation's 'CUOMO,' Errol Musk, father of billionaire Elon Musk, revealed what he thinks about his son's collaboration with President Donald Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, and the fact that he's now become a key figure in the Trump administration. Errol Musk laughed and defended his son against allegations of making a Nazi salute, calling the accusation 'absolute nonsense' and 'rubbish.' While addressing a large crowd Monday at Capital One Arena, Musk thanked attendees for helping to elect Trump. He grabbed the left side of his chest with his right hand and extended his arm at a raised angle. Musk turned around and made the gesture a second time. 'My heart goes out to you,' he said. Democratic infighting is rising as Trump takes center stage Responding to criticism of the stage gesture, Errol Musk pointed out that other politicians have used similar hand signals without controversy. Elon Musk, widely regarded as the world's richest man with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, has made his mark on space, technology and politics. The elder Musk talked about his own political history, noting he was twice a parliamentary candidate for a party opposing apartheid in South Africa. He also revealed a family connection to the Jewish community through his grandfather. Biden’s outgoing letter to Trump: ‘May God bless you’ Elon changed after Biden snubbed him, father Errol Musk says Errol Musk detailed his son's political transformation, highlighting a shift from supporting Democrats to aligning with Trump. He attributed this change to former President Joe Biden's perceived slight of not inviting Tesla to a White House electric vehicle event in 2021. 'He started changing when Biden invited all the electric car manufacturers to the White House in 2021 but didn't invite Tesla. Tesla built a million cars, and the other five manufacturers built about 26 and hadn't even sold one,' Errol Musk told NewsNation. 'Elon couldn't understand that. He started calling Biden a lunatic and the government 'loony,'' Errol Musk said. Errol Musk recounted a 2016 incident in which Elon and his brother were upset by their father's public support for Trump. He suggested Elon's current alignment with Trump stems from feeling marginalized by the Democratic administration. The tech billionaire is now leading Trump’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), which is expected to focus on reducing government spending and regulations and has already secured a White House email address. Speaker Johnson forms committee to probe Dems, Jan. 6 investigation After co-founding and selling PayPal, Musk launched SpaceX, which now dominates the reusable rocket industry. He later was an early investor in Tesla, manufacturing millions of electric vehicles, and acquired Twitter, where his influence grew. 'We are very happy with' Elon, Errol Musk says Errol Musk said he was 'very happy' with Elon, and adds that his children have 'done well in their fields.' He said Elon has 'broken the mold' to some extent, but the family is not 'sitting back' and would 'like to see more' from him.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/elon-musk-father-errol-nazi-salute-rubbish/	2025-01-22T19:00:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-8.jpg?w=900
Trump orders 'blackout' for federal health agencies	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has ordered a 'blackout' for federal health agencies, banning them from publishing external communication. Agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institute for Health and the Department of Health and Human Services will not be allowed to publish scientific reports, issue health advisories or update their websites. The blackout, first reported by the Washington Post, comes at a time when experts are raising the alarm about public health concerns. When will Trump’s mass deportations begin? During a change in administration, it's not uncommon for agencies to pause external communications. However, the blackout comes at a time of concern over public health issues and as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nominated for Health and Human Services secretary, faces a potentially lengthy confirmation. CNN reported that a follow-up memo specified the blackout is set to last through Feb. 1, and includes public speaking engagements and communications with lawmakers. Communications deemed urgent, such as recall notices or that are required by law, are exempt but higher-ups must be notified. Another issue of concern is the increased spread of bird flu. The virus has been rapidly spreading among birds, wreaking havoc on the poultry industry, and a strain has been circulating among livestock, as well. There have also been cases of bird flu reported in humans. The majority of cases have been reported in farm workers, though there have also been cases in which it's less clear how it was contracted. While continuing to stress that the risk to the public is low and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the CDC recently advised hospitals to speed up testing for bird flu in admitted patients, urging subtype tests for those positive for influenza A be done within hours of admission. A blackout would cut off such advisories and recommendations, leaving the public and health care professionals in the dark about new developments. Trump cuts DEI regulations across federal government The Senate has yet to set a confirmation hearing date for Kennedy, even as it hurries to push through other Trump nominees. It's not clear whether this would impact the length of the blackout. Kennedy's nomination has been controversial even among Republicans, with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a polio survivor, criticizing efforts by a lawyer working for Kennedy to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. A group associated with former Vice President Mike Pence has also begun running a series of ads urging Republican senators to oppose Kennedy's nomination. Other Republican senators, however, including Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, have expressed support for Kennedy. Some of Kennedy's critics have also supported aspects of his platform, including efforts to reduce some of the ingredients used in processed food.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/health-agency-blackout/	2025-01-22T14:30:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1892965715-e1730320693839.jpg?w=800
Trump ends remote work impacting half of federal workers	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is putting an end to remote work for federal employees, with one of his first executive orders bringing the federal workforce back to the office full-time. Half of the federal workforce has been allowed to work remotely. It's part of a larger culture shift that occurred during the pandemic and for many workers, the desire to remain remote has stuck. But that has left large federal facilities like the Department of Energy empty, with fewer than 1% of the office spaces being used according to the Public Buildings Reform Board. Trump cuts DEI regulations across federal government In addition to bringing workers back to the empty desks, Trump says he wants to sell unused federal buildings. Research shows there are nearly 8,000 empty buildings that cost taxpayers about $8 billion to maintain. That's on top of another $7.7 billion spent on energy bills to keep them running. A 2023 Government Accountability Office report said that 17% of the 24 federal agencies are using as little of 9% of federal buildings and only as much as 49% of their building's capacity. Several unions have pushed back, including one that represents 800,000 federal workers. Bird flu mutating in humans: Researchers 'President Trump's order is a blatant attempt to corrupt the federal government by eliminating employees' due process rights so they can be fired for political reasons,' said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley. 'It will remove hundreds of thousands of federal jobs from the non-partisan civil service and make them answerable to the will of one man.' While some employees are fine with heading back to the office, others are facing major upheaval, having arranged responsibilities like childcare around a work-from-home schedule.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-ends-remote-work-half-employees/	2025-01-22T12:18:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/return_to_office_telework_getty-e1698162451766.jpg?w=900
Trump re-ups tariff threats against Mexico, Canada, Russia	(NewsNation) — President Trump doubled down on his tariff threats against Canada, Mexico and China saying they will start in ten days in the hopes that it will force the countries to renegotiate trade deals. The president has set a February 1 deadline for levying 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico unless, he says, the nations do more to stop the flow of illegal immigration and fentanyl into the United States. The ultimatum has sparked a push back from the nations. Trudeau vows Canada will respond to Trump’s tariffs, but says burden will be shared across regions Outgoing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau responded on X saying, 'Our cabinet just wrapped a day of meetings focused on one thing, protecting Canadians from harmful U.S. tariffs. Canada and the US have a partnership that works for both sides of the border and will do everything it takes to keep it that way.' But Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said a trade war is 100% coming. Trump 'declared an economic war on Canada,' Ford said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'And we are going to use every tool in our tool box to defend our economy.' Meanwhile, Mexico's president says she will defend her nation's sovereignty and independence but also pursue dialogue with Trump. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs, taxes and sanctions on 'anything being sold by Russia to the United States' in a bid to put pressure on the nation to end its war in Ukraine. 'I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin — and this despite the Radical Left’s Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX,' Trump posted on Truth Social, referencing a special counsel investigation into any coordination between his 2016 campaign and Moscow. 'All of that being said, I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE,' Trump continued. Trump signed an executive order Monday that directed the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury and the United States trade representative to investigate the cause of America's trade deficits with foreign nations. The president also said he is trying to build an 'external revenue service' to collect tariffs. Trump pumps brakes on Day 1 tariffs Trump said he is still looking at a 10% tariff on China to stop the flow of fentanyl after threatening as much as 60% during his campaign, but appeared to temper his plans after a phone call last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He said Monday there would be more discussions with his counterpart in the world’s second largest economy. Trump is placing a big bet that his executive actions can cut energy prices and tame inflation and that the tariffs will strengthen the economy instead of exposing consumers to higher prices. But it’s unclear whether his orders will be enough to foster the growing economy with lower prices that he promised voters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-re-ups-tariff-threats-mexico-canada-russia/	2025-01-22T11:36:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676e04041219b3.84887230.jpeg?w=900
As buses of migrants deported, Mexican officials open shelters	(NewsNation) — Buses full of Mexican nationals being deported were caught on camera by a NewsNation crew — one sign that President Donald Trump’s immigration policies are being put into place. Sources in Tijuana said to NewsNation that the city has also started to see Mexican nationals deported back to that port of entry as well. Mexican government officials say they are sending the buses to Mexican border towns, and then will take those people farther inside the country. Deportations are expected to ramp up even more in the coming weeks — something Trump said he would enact many times during the 2024 election. Mexico opening migrant shelters To help those who are newly deported, Mexico plans to set up nine migrant shelters that will provide food, medical checkpoints and a temporary place to stay. Three of these new shelters are set to open soon in Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Each facility can hold up to 2,500 people. According to Mexican officials, those deported will receive around 2,000 pesos, which is around $10, to assist with travel expenses back to their hometowns. However, these shelters will only accept those originally from Mexico — not other foreign nationals. Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum is calling it the 'Mexico Embraces You' program. 'This initiative will provide a range of support to repatriated Mexicans, including services and other benefits,' Seguismundo Doguin Martinex, migration chief for Tamaulipas, Mexico, said. 'The National Institute of Migration is responsible for receiving them and providing them with a repatriation certificate, which serves as identification, and arranging transportation to their place of origin.' What would it take for US to reclaim the Panama Canal? Trump immigration policies After being sworn in Monday, Trump signed a slew of executive orders, several of which had to do with immigration. One of them was reinstating the 'Remain in Mexico' policy, which requires those seeking asylum to stay in Mexico until their claims are processed. Critics say that the policy forces migrants to live in Mexican border towns where many have been victims of abuse and extortion In addition, Trump signed an order for work to continue on the southern border wall. One of the biggest changes he made was shutting down the CBP One app, which let migrants make appointments for processing at the U.S.-Mexico border. Sheinbaum called on Trump administration to keep the app.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/buses-migrants-return-to-mexico/	2025-01-22T09:52:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676ecea8932413.89172779.jpeg?w=900
Pentagon to send up to 1,500 active duty troops to secure US-Mexi...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon will begin deploying as many as 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the southern border in the coming days, U.S. officials said Wednesday, putting in motion plans President Donald Trump laid out in executive orders shortly after he took office to crack down on immigration. Acting Defense Secretary Robert Salesses was expected to sign the deployment orders on Wednesday, but it wasn't yet clear which troops or units will go, and the total could fluctuate. It remains to be seen if they will end up doing law enforcement, which would put American troops in a dramatic new role, not done in recent history. WATCH: CBP officers in riot gear march through South Texas border crossing The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement has not yet been made. The active duty forces would join the roughly 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces already there. There are currently no active duty troops working along the border. The forces are expected to be used to support border patrol agents, with logistics, transportation and construction of barriers. They have done similar duties in the past, when both Trump and former President Joe Biden sent active duty troops to the border. Troops are prohibited by law from doing law enforcement duties on the border, but that may change. Trump has directed through executive order that the incoming secretary of defense and incoming homeland security chief report back within 90 days if they think an 1807 law called the Insurrection Act should be invoked. That would allow those troops to be used in civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil. The widely expected deployment, coming in Trump’s first week in office, was an early step in his long-touted plan to expand the use of the military along the border. In one of his first orders on Monday, Trump directed the defense secretary to come up with a plan to 'seal the borders' and repel 'unlawful mass migration.' On Tuesday, just as Trump fired the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, the service announced it was surging more cutter ships, aircraft and personnel to the 'Gulf of America' — another nod to the president’s directive to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Trump said during his inaugural address on Monday that 'I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places in which they came.' In his first term, Trump also ordered active duty troops to the border to help the Department of Homeland Security and border control agents, in response to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through Mexico toward the United States in 2018. As buses of migrants deported, Mexican officials open shelters In executive orders signed Monday, Trump suggested the military would help DHS with 'detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services.' U.S. active duty troops are forbidden from doing law enforcement duties under the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century federal law. So they can’t arrest or detain people at the border, unless the president acts to invoke the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act allows presidents to call on reserve or active duty military units to respond to unrest in the states, an authority that is not reviewable by the courts. During the 2018 deployment, more than 7,000 active duty troops were sent to Texas, Arizona and California, including military police, an assault helicopter battalion, various communications, medical and headquarters units, combat engineers, planners and public affairs units. What would it take for US to reclaim the Panama Canal? At the time, the Pentagon was adamant that active duty troops would not do law enforcement. So they spent much of their time transporting border patrol agents to and along the border, helping them erect additional vehicle barriers and fencing along the border, assisting them with communications and providing some security for border agent camps. The military also provided border patrol agents with medical care, pre-packaged meals and temporary housing. Normally, in deployments to the border in support of the Department of Homeland Security, Pentagon officials request specifics from DHS on what needs to be accomplished, and military leaders then decide what troops should go and how many.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ap-pentagon-to-send-up-to-1500-active-duty-troops-to-help-secure-us-mexico-border-officials-say/	2025-01-22T09:49:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67912c78adcb28.95907475.jpeg?w=900
Previously approved refugee flights to US canceled after Trump or...	(The Hill) - The State Department has suspended flights bringing previously approved refugees to the United States, cutting off access to protection in advance of the timeline set by President Trump in a new order pausing the program. An email reviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press, the U.S. agency overseeing refugee processing and arrival told staff and stakeholders that 'refugee arrival to the United States have been suspended until further notice.' Trump pardoned violent Jan. 6 rioters. Here are 5 of them The suspension of flights indicates early action on an order that didn’t direct movement from agencies until Jan. 27. The State Department did not return a request for comment, but a page on refugee admissions was already unavailable. Afghan refugees walk through a refugee camp at Joint Base McGuire Dix Lakehurst, N.J., on Sept. 27, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) A Day 1 order from Trump pauses the refugee program for a minimum of three months, calling for the departments of State and of Homeland Security to issue a report within 90 days detailing whether it’s in the nation’s interests to resume the admission of refugees. The agency heads are directed to do so every 90 days until it is found that it is appropriate to resume refugee admissions, the order states. Until then, such admissions will remain suspended. The U.S. refugee program is considered one of the most rigorous on the globe, providing a pathway to safe haven for those fleeing danger or who has faced persecution due to their race, religion, nationality or political views. WATCH: CBP officers in riot gear march through South Texas border crossing 'The refugee program is not just a humanitarian lifeline through which the U.S. has shown global leadership. It represents the gold standard of legal immigration pathways in terms of security screening, community coordination, and mutual economic benefit,' Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, which helps resettle refugees, said in a statement when the order was first announced. 'The US Refugee Admissions Program was designed and ameliorated over four decades precisely to address the concerns used to suspend it today.' Democrats seized the moment to criticize Republicans over the order’s impact on stranding an estimated 1,600 Afghan allies cleared for resettlement in the U.S. They pointed to GOP attacks on the Biden administration for leaving behind thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. during the chaotic and deadly American withdrawal. 'Republicans spent 4 years baselessly chastising Biden for ‘abandoning our Afghan Allies.’ But *this* is what abandonment looks like. Leaving vetted, verified Afghan Allies at the mercy of the Taliban is shameful,' the Democratic side of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote in a post on X. 'Among those being abandoned are: family members of US military service personnel, Afghans who fought alongside us and allies who worked with US contractors. We owe them better.' ICE now allowed to make arrests in and near churches and schools Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said she was 'alarmed' at the suspension and that it goes against bipartisan support for the Refugee Admissions Program. She noted that among those stranded are victims of genocide, such as the Rohingya Burmese and Sudanese refugees, as well as Afghan partners. 'Stepping away from this program at a time of unprecedented displacement will put refugees’ lives at risk and ultimately weaken our nation’s long-term security,' she said in a statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/refugee-flights-trump-order/	2025-01-22T09:43:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/refugeecamp_092721_ap_afghanrefugees-e1737562101687.jpg?w=900
Trump vows to shine light on New Jersey drone mystery	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has vowed to release a report on the unexplained drones spotted over the Northeast, which led the FAA to issue temporary drone bans in New Jersey and parts of New York. While signing executive orders at the White House on Monday, Trump promised to investigate drone reports that began in November. He promised a report on the drones within a day of taking office. However, when reporters questioned Trump in the Oval Office on that 'Day 1 update,' he put White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on the case. Trump wants American astronauts on Mars: Is it possible? 'I would like to find out what it is and tell the people. In fact, I'd like to do that,' Trump said. He then redirected to Wiles. 'Could we find out what that was, Susie? Why don't we find out immediately?' Trump added: 'I can't imagine it's an enemy, or there would have been, you know, people would have gotten blown up, all of them. Maybe they were testing things. I don't know why. They wouldn't have said what it was. They had a lot of them flying over Bedminster, which is interesting.' Where were drones spotted? Unexplained drones began reportedly flying over sensitive military sites in New Jersey in mid-November. The White House and the Pentagon insisted they did not pose a threat. Along the East Coast, drone sightings were also reported near Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, as well as in Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut. Sightings were additionally reported in California, Florida, Ohio and Minnesota. The reports and concerns from the public prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue bans in parts of New Jersey and parts of New York. Those drone bans have been lifted, but Trump believes there are questions left unanswered. Marco Rubio met with UAP whistleblower prior to Trump nomination Trump: Biden, military knew details Last month, Trump claimed the Biden administration and the military knew what was going on with the unexplained drone sightings but wanted to keep 'people in suspense.' Later, more than 20 officials from the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Defense went before Congress for a classified drone hearing, testifying there was no threat.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/trump-shine-light-on-drone-mystery/	2025-01-22T05:38:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ-e1734134961775.jpg?w=800
Trump expresses doubt in Gaza ceasefire: 'It's not our war'	(NewsNation) — Aid trucks are getting into Gaza as part of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, but President Donald Trump expressed doubt the ceasefire will hold while signing executive orders Monday night. As part of the ceasefire deal, three people taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, have been released by Hamas, with another four expected to be freed this weekend. A total of 33 hostages are set to return home in the first phase of the deal. Loved ones of those still being held are urging Trump to make sure the deal is carried out to completion. This was something Trump said he'd do on the campaign trail. At one point, he said there would be 'hell to pay' in the Middle East if all the hostages weren't released by Inauguration Day. When will Trump’s mass deportations begin? Some families of Israelis still believed to be in captivity were onstage at Trump's indoor parade Monday. The president was seen telling the families of at least one hostage that his administration was going to get him back. To the audience, Trump said the work begins now, saying that this is 'not a good situation.' In the Oval Office Monday, Trump called Gaza a 'massive demolition site' that has to be 'rebuilt in a different way.' Negotiating the second and third phases of this deal will be a critical step. If agreed to, a second phase would include the release of more hostages and a permanent pause in fighting, plus the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. In Phase 3, the deceased hostages would be returned, and the reconstruction of Gaza would begin. However, it's a delicate process. Mediators are in the Middle East right now on standby for obstacles as the first phase of this ceasefire is now underway. Trump on Monday night acknowledged that he is not confident the ceasefire will go through all three phases, telling reporters, 'It's not our war.' Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 Six killed by Israeli military in West Bank A major Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday left at least six dead and dozens wounded, Palestinian health officials said. This operation was focused on the city of Jenin, which The Associated Press reports has been through repeated Israeli incursions and gunbattles with militants in recent years. This operation was announced shortly after the ceasefire in Gaza was announced. More than 800 people have been killed by Israeli fire, including attacks by settlers, in the West Bank since Oct. 7, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. According to the Associated Press, more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, which started after the Hamas-led attack on Oct.7 that killed 1,200. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/trump-doubt-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-01-21T12:50:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021402908298.jpg?w=900
Trump cuts DEI regulations across federal government	(NewsNation) — President Trump slashed all diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, giving agencies 60 days to cut all DEI positions and proclaiming there are only two genders. In several executive orders signed Monday, Trump undid several Biden-era initiatives, saying they were 'illegal and immoral discrimination programs' within the government. 'This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private light; we will forge a society that is color blind and merit-based,' Trump said during his inauguration. 'As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.' Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 The order asks the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to coordinate with agencies to terminate what it deems as 'all discriminatory programs' in the agencies. The U.S. government is the largest employer in the country with 3 million workers, and the new marching orders appear to stand in line with a similar shift away from DEI initiatives in the private sector. Walmart, Meta and McDonalds have all reportedly pulled back on some aspects of DEI. A Trump official said Monday that 'private businesses should wait and see ... we have more actions coming very soon.' Trump has also caused concern among LGBTQ+ Americans after declaring the government would recognize only two sexes, male and female, and those will correlate with the sex assigned at birth. What is an executive order? His order directs agencies to enforce laws to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes and not enforce laws as if sex includes gender identity. It will also direct the secretaries of state and Homeland Security to ensure official government documents such as passports and visas reflect categories of 'male' and 'female.' It will also prevent agencies from promoting the concept of gender transition, and agencies will only list 'male' or 'female' when asking about sex. The order also intends to stop federal funds from promoting gender identity. The Trump administration also intends to recognize that women are identified as having reproductive cells, as opposed to identifying women through a chromosome.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-cuts-dei-federal-government/	2025-01-21T12:36:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021063358170.jpg?w=900
DOGE faces early bumps with lawsuits and leadership shakeup	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was slapped with several lawsuits on his first day in office from groups saying the new nongovernment entity must abide by the same transparency as federal agencies. The suits were brought by progressive consumer watchdog Public Citizen, the American Public Health Association and National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm. The groups argue that DOGE should be considered a federal advisory committee, which falls under regulations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. The three cases were some of the first lawsuits filed against the new Trump administration after the president took the oath of office in the Capitol. Vivek Ramaswamy set to depart DOGE What is DOGE? Trump tapped Musk and Ramaswamy to co-lead DOGE shortly after his reelection last year, promising to cut down on federal spending and slash federal jobs that the nongovernmental task force deems unnecessary. Since then, Ramaswamy left DOGE, leaving the agency in the hands of tech tycoon Musk. While Ramaswamy is also planning to run for Ohio governor in two years, his departure may be linked to disagreements with the congressional leaders working on DOGE, according to some reports. The two had pledged to cut $2 trillion in government spending and restructure federal agencies. Elon Musk’s DOGE sued as Trump takes office: Report What do the lawsuits say? Three separate lawsuits allege that DOGE should be classified as a federal advisory committee, which has rules around them. The plaintiffs each claim DOGE is covered by FACA, which mandates federal advisory committees meet transparency requirements like having a charter, fairly balanced membership and a designated federal officer to call meetings. 'The suit challenges DOGE’s operating without complying with federal transparency laws,' the groups said in a statement. 'DOGE’s stacked membership, far from being fairly balanced, reveals that only one viewpoint is represented: that of ‘small-government crusaders’ with backgrounds in either the tech industry or Republican politics. This shortcoming renders DOGE’s membership imbalanced and unfit for the function it has been directed to perform,' the National Security Counselors' lawsuit states. DOGE leadership hit back. 'I expect the entrenched bureaucracy and the vested interest to fight like dickens…I wouldn't count Elon Musk out,' Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is part of the DOGE congressional leadership, told NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-faces-early-bumps/	2025-01-21T11:34:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
Democratic AGs sue Trump over birthright citizenship executive or...	Twenty-two Democrat-led states and two cities challenged President Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship, that on Tuesday kicked off the first legal battles between his new Justice Department and Democratic attorneys general. The two separate lawsuits, filed in Massachusetts and Washington state, ask federal judges to rule the order contradicts the Constitution, which under the 14th Amendment bestows citizenship on anyone born in the United States. 'President Trump now seeks to abrogate this well-established and longstanding Constitutional principle by executive fiat,' one group of states wrote in their complaint. 'The principle of birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution for more than 150 years. The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment unambiguously and expressly confers citizenship on ‘[a]ll persons born’ in and ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States.' Trump’s order, signed as part of a flurry of executive actions during his first day in office, seeks to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are not lawfully present. But it also applies to some parents in the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, a broader category that blocks citizenship to children born to those with authorization to work in the U.S. The states’ lawsuits follow a similar challenge filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) late Monday. In a call Monday to preview executive orders, a Trump administration official seemed to acknowledge potential problems with the order, saying it would be carried out on a 'prospective basis.' 'On a prospective basis, the federal government will not recognize automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens born in the United States,' the official said. The order from Trump frames citizenship as 'a priceless and profound gift,' casting the order itself as one that protects 'the meaning and value' of American citizenship. One coalition, which sued in Massachusetts, comprised Democratic attorneys general 18 states, as well as the cities of Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. The other coalition, which filed in Washington, comprised four states. 'President Trump’s public statements make clear that he wishes to end birthright citizenship purely as a policy tactic to purportedly deter immigration to the United States. Despite a president’s broad powers to set immigration policy, the Citizenship Stripping Order falls far outside the legal bounds of the president’s authority,' the second group of states wrote in their complaint.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democratic-ags-sue-trump-over-birthright-citizenship-executive-order/	2025-01-21T11:00:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021063358170-e1737479667344_b55e3b.jpg?w=800
Trump pumps brakes on Day 1 tariffs	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump pumped the brakes on his plan to deliver wide-ranging tariffs as soon as he took office, slow-tracking and toning down changes to the U.S. trade system that figured as a centerpiece of his campaign. Trump kicked off his second term with a memo that directs federal agencies to study U.S. trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, but he did not impose any new tariffs, which are taxes levied on U.S. individuals and companies that import goods from abroad. The memo, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, also seeks to make progress on Trump's 2020 U.S.-China trade pact and looks ahead to a 2026 review of the updated NAFTA deal with Canada and Mexico. But the order stops short of ordering any new import taxes. Here are the biggest fights Democrats are bracing for in Trump’s second term A summary of the memo says agencies will assess the updated NAFTA deal and 'make recommendations' about U.S. participation in it, the Journal reported. That’s a far cry from the rhetoric on trade that Trump used while on the campaign trail. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first executive orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25-percent tariff on all products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous open borders,' Trump wrote on social media in November after winning the election. Trump frequently blasted establishment thinking on trade deals, suggesting an overhaul of U.S. trade doctrine was underway with the imposition of a general tariff, something that hasn’t been widely tried since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was set up following World War II. 'It must be hard for you to spend 25 years talking about tariffs as being negative, and then have somebody explain to you that you’re totally wrong,' Trump challenged Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait during an interview in October. Presidents can issue tariff orders without approval from Congress, and there had been heavy speculation that Trump was going to single-handedly change the trade system overnight. Mexican steel producers put out a statement Friday, saying they didn’t pose a threat to U.S. businesses. 'Steel exports from Mexico do not represent a threat to the United States. On the contrary, the U.S. greatly benefits from steel trade flows,' Mexican steel industry group Conacero said. Even the Federal Reserve noted in December that uncertainty about the U.S. trade posture was clouding its economic projections, saying they had to build out multiple scenarios. 'The effects of trade policy changes could be larger than the staff had assumed,' the Fed’s December minutes say. Uncertainties had been showing up in foreign markets, as well. 'Foreign financial market pricing reflected weaker-than-expected foreign data releases, expectations of further policy easing by foreign central banks, and potential changes in U.S. trade policy,' Fed meeting participants noted. Markets and industry groups that work on international commerce seemed reassured by the decision not to immediately impose new tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of major U.S. stock rose by more than 300 points in afternoon trading. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up more than 290 points, and the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 60 points. The retail industry, which sources many of its products from countries with considerably lower labor costs than the U.S., welcomed the new trade approach from Trump, saying they wanted to make sure it’s 'carefully targeted.' 'We look forward to working with the president to see that the resulting policy changes are carefully targeted and create an environment that attracts investment and protects critical industries,' the National Retail Federation said in a Monday release. The National Foreign Trade Council, a business advocacy group, said U.S. businesses want to keep access to foreign markets. 'American companies need to maintain a competitive advantage globally, and access to open markets,' the group said in a Monday release. 'We are keen to work with the Administration on the details of its economic strategy, including its trade, tax and tariff policies.' Trump campaigned hard on tariffs, which allowed him to tap into undercurrents of frustration about the globalized economy and to deliver clear and repetitive messaging that likely made a difference in the election. Trump, who made import taxes the backbone of his first-term economic policy, called 'tariff' the 'most beautiful word in the dictionary.' Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Tariffs are taxes on U.S. companies that import foreign products. The tax, which can take a bite out of the importer’s profit margin, can be avoided by switching to a domestic supply chain, or it can be passed along to a retailer in the form of a price increase. The latter option added to concerns that Trump’s tariffs could contribute to short-term inflation, which could further be spurred by stimulative tax cuts expected by the new Congress and increased labor costs stemming from a clamp down on immigration. But Trump’s lack of immediate action on tariffs likely bodes well for the pace of price increases. In his inaugural address, Trump said he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, which have largely been outsourced to foreign production centers, representing another point of economic frustration for many voters. Manufacturing jobs have been on the decline since the late 1970s and really fell off in the 2000s following the passage of a string of 'free trade' deals. While they rebounded slightly in the 2010s to a recent high around 13 million jobs, they have yet to approach historical levels. A surge in manufacturing construction investment during the Biden administration could reverse this trend to some degree. After hovering around $6 billion annually, the number shot up to more than $21 billion in October, following the passage of a major infrastructure law, a climate technology law and a bill to promote semiconductor production.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs/	2025-01-21T08:56:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/trump_012025ap_1a2b52-e1737463030433.jpg?w=800
Live:Trump attends prayer service at National Cathedral	(NewsNation) — After being sworn in on Monday, President Donald Trump is marking his first full day in office with a prayer service at Washington National Cathedral on Tuesday morning. Leaders from nearly a dozen different religions are on hand for the service, which has been a post-inaugural tradition since former President Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office. The service is meant to be a way to push past the divisiveness of the 2024 election, staffers say, and the political jabs on the campaign trail. Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 It's a message the president tried to convey at the Commander in Chief Ball on Monday evening when speaking to the troops. 'Your bravery inspires us. Your service unites us, and your sacrifice and spirit protect us all,' Trump said. 'We love you, we respect you so much, and we have a big commitment to each and every one of you. Starting today, America will be stronger and greater than it's ever been before.' Staffers say this year's prayer service is different from those held in the past, as it was not planned with a particular candidate in mind. Trump starts second term Shortly after being sworn in, Trump signed a slew of executive orders relating to diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government, gender identity, border security and other issues. In addition, Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, was confirmed in a 99-0 vote Monday night. John Ratcliffe, Trump's nominee to lead the CIA; Pete Hegseth, nominee for head of the Department of Defense; Kristi Noem, nominee for secretary of Homeland Security; and Russ Vought, nominee for chief of the Office of Management and Budget are all in position for a full vote in the Senate. Their confirmations have been passed by Senate committees. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are heading to the White House and are expected to meet with Trump on Tuesday.

When will Trump's mass deportations begin?	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Migrants in Chicago are growing increasingly anxious as they brace for potential mass deportation raids, which could begin as soon as Tuesday. On Monday, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders related to immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the border. According to the Wall Street Journal, four people familiar with the plan said on the day after Trump’s inauguration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will send 'between 100 and 200 officers' for the operation. In December, Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, told Chicagoans the largest deportation operation in history was set to start on Tuesday. However, it's uncertain whether the raids will begin as planned, given the extremely cold temperatures and leads about the operation. When can we expect to see mass deportations start? Federal immigration officers are expected to target more than 300 people in Chicago with histories of violent crimes, according to an official who spoke anonymously to NewsNation over the weekend. Additionally, Trump aids have indicated they may arrest others, like spouses or roommates, who aren't the primary target but are also in the country illegally. Still, Trump hasn't provided any specific timeline for the deportation. Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 'I don't want to say when, but it's going to happen. It has to happen, or we're not going to have a country left,' Trump said Monday when asked if ICE raids would start Tuesday. Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker emphasized that ripping families apart is not acceptable to Americans and asserted that the state will stand up for those affected. However, immigrant rights groups say the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants in Chicago are living in fear as raids loom. How are undocumented Chicagoans preparing for potential raids? Some Chicago churches have canceled in-person services to protect churchgoers from potential immigration roundups. Meanwhile, immigrant advocacy groups have distributed flyers and held workshops to educate undocumented people about their rights. Elena Barrera, who has lived in the Chicago area without legal status for nearly 27 years, shared her fears. A mother of three, including a 9-year-old, Barrera worries about the trauma her family would face if she were detained by ICE agents. '(My son) doesn't want to go to Mexico because he has his school here. He has lived his whole life here. He cries. Nothing has happened yet, but he is already anxious. He is thinking, 'What will I do without my mom?'' she said. Can Trump use a law from 1798 to crack down on cartels? Organizations like the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights advise that those fearing a raid do not open the door if ICE agents come knocking. They also urge people to memorize the phone numbers of loved ones in case their phones are taken during an arrest. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city’s law forbids Chicago police officers from coordinating with ICE. Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Transit Authority, the Chicago Park District and Community Colleges of Chicago have all been directed not to allow ICE access into any of their buildings. Trump's deportation plans are a 'disgrace': Pope Francis On Sunday, Pope Francis appeared on a popular Italian talk show, 'Che Tempo Che Fa,' where he called Trump’s mass deportation plans a 'disgrace.' 'If true, this will be a disgrace because it makes poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill,' for the problem, Francis said. 'This won’t do! This is not the way to solve things. That’s not how things are resolved.' Bishop Robert Casey, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago, has been a Catholic priest for 30 years. 'For all those 30 years, I have found myself living in a nation that's struggled with immigration reform,' said Casey, whose parents were immigrants. 'I think it's important to recognize ... what Pope Francis reminds us, that we're dealing with people with faces and names. This is not just an issue on paper.' Casey added that people are afraid and anxious because there is so much unknown about what to expect and when it will happen. 'For many of our immigrants, they have been able to build a life here and contribute greatly to the foundations that our city is built on, and they're at the core of who we are as a community and as churches,' he said. 'But at the same time, amidst that blessing, there is the challenge that people don't want to welcome the stranger, that don't want to welcome the migrant in our midst.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/when-will-mass-deportations-begin/	2025-01-21T05:01:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6772ed5e99af47.82108108.jpeg?w=900
Trump's 'two sexes' order to face legal challenges	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday recognizing only two sexes, male and female. The gender identity order will limit the choice of gender identification to sexes assigned at birth and direct federal agencies to cease the promotion of the concept of gender transition. 'I will end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,' Trump said Monday in his inaugural address. 'We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.' Here are all executive orders Trump is expected to sign on Day 1 The order will require Americans to select their sex assigned at birth on government documents like passports and visas. The State Department issued the first U.S. passport with an 'unspecified' gender marker in 2022, denoted by a single letter X, NewsNation affiliate 'The Hill' reported. Trump’s executive order also tasks the attorney general with providing guidance on how the Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, which determined that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination because of their gender identity or sexuality, may be applied to other federal statutes. 'It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,' the order reads. Trump vows to release JFK, RFK, MLK assassination records Monday's executive order will likely face legal challenges in the months and years ahead. The ACLU has pledged to take the administration to court 'wherever we can.' Chase Strangio, an ACLU attorney who last month became the first transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court, wrote in an Instagram post that Trump’s orders 'do not and cannot change the law.' Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, said Monday’s orders 'serve no other purpose than to hurt our families and our communities' and stressed that they would not take effect immediately, 'The Hill' reported. Janson Wu, senior director of state advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth suicide prevention organization, said Trump’s executive orders 'will cause harm,' especially for young people. 'We know that many people are feeling afraid, or even confused, by what certain actions today and in the coming days mean for our community,' Wu said. 'I want to remind everyone that we are prepared for whatever lies ahead — and will continue to protect and care for each other now, just as we always have.'

Nelly: I wasn't scared of Trump performance backlash	(NewsNation) — After receiving backlash from the public, Nelly defended his decision to perform at President Trump's inauguration ball. Nelly told NewsNation's 'CUOMO' his performance is about 'respect.' 'This is not a campaign trail,' Nelly said. 'This is not anything that I feel like I'm influencing people to sway how they feel, but it's more about the respect and the honor of being invited for what I like to call the greatest country on the planet.' Nelly said 'Regardless of the differences we have,' it's 'all about coming together' and being positive. He also said he doesn't plan to take his shirt off during his performance because 'they don't want to see this dad bod.' Judges allow some Capitol riot defendants to return to DC for Trump’s inauguration Nelly wasn't the be the only music star present in Washington, D.C., on Inauguration Day. Country music phenomenon Carrie Underwood sang 'America the Beautiful' at the swearing-in ceremony. Underwood also faced some backlash for taking the opportunity to sign at Trump's inauguration, though longtime Trump critic Whoopi Goldberg came to her defense this week. Nelly, 49, whose birth name is Cornell Haynes II, is a St. Louis native with hits such as 'Hot in Herre' and 'Just A Dream.' The 49-year-old has had four No. 1 hits and won nine Billboard Music Awards. He escaped drug charges in November following an arrest at a Missouri casino in August. Other performers on Inauguration Day include Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Rascal Flatts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/nelly-trump-performance-backlash/	2025-01-20T19:59:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/D929FD020AE9F8625C91C846178ADE3C.jpg?w=536
Trump pardons nearly all Jan. 6 rioters on first day of presidenc...	President Trump pardoned nearly all Jan. 6 defendants on Monday, making good on a long-standing campaign promise just hours into his second presidency. He briefly said Monday night that he granted roughly 1,500 'full, complete and unconditional pardons' for rioters charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. There have been 1,583 total defendants charged. 'What they've done to these people is outrageous,' Trump said while signing various orders from the Oval Office. The pardons clear the way for potentially hundreds of his supporters to be released from prison in coming days, some of whom were sentenced to years in prison for violently attacking law enforcement that day. They came just hours after former President Biden in the eleventh hour of his presidency issued preemptive pardons for members and staff of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the riot. Trump also commuted the sentences of Proud Boys and Oath Keepers members who were charged with plotting to forcibly halt the peaceful transfer of power in 2020 to time served. However, former Proud Boys national chair Enrique Tarrio — who is serving a 22-year prison term, the longest handed down in connection with the attack — received a pardon. An attorney for Tarrio told The Hill he’s being 'processed out' of prison, suggesting his release could be imminent. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers who is serving an 18-year prison term, is among those whose sentences were commuted to time served. About 600 Jan. 6 defendants were accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding police. Ten defendants were convicted of sedition, the crown jewel of the Justice Department’s sprawling prosecution. Trump also ordered his Justice Department to take steps to throw out all pending indictments against Jan. 6 defendants whose cases have not yet been fully adjudicated — a decision that would shut down roughly 470 ongoing cases. Trump long vowed to grant clemency to those who descended on the Capitol as Congress certified the 2020 election win of his Democratic opponent, former President Biden, describing them on the campaign trail as 'political prisoners' and 'hostages.' But in recent weeks, his allies’ comments suggested Trump’s clemency might not be so sweeping. Vice President Vance said earlier this month that people who 'committed violence' on Jan. 6 should 'obviously' not receive pardons, while Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick for attorney general, said at her confirmation hearing that she 'condemns' any violence against law enforcement. Trump said Monday he believed the supporters of Jan. 6 rioters would be pleased with his clemency decisions, describing them as 'hostages' who 'for the most part ... didn’t do stuff wrong.' 'You'll be happy because, you know, it's action, not words that count,' he said. 'And you're going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages — a lot.'

Bill O'Reilly: Trump 'humiliated' Biden in inauguration speech	(NewsNation) — Bill O'Reilly stated that President Donald Trump 'knows he humiliated' outgoing President Joe Biden and that the act was driven by 'vengeance.' 'That was a brutal speech,' O'Reilly said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'It's a unique moment in American history. I can't find any other inaugural address that humiliated an outgoing president as much as this one did.' 'Vengence doesn't leave the building easily,' O'Reilly added, calling out Biden for 'attacking' both Trump and his family. Live Updates: Trump’s inauguration Cuomo: Time Trump spends persecuting Biden is wasted O'Reilly pointed out how Biden had to sit through Trump's speech and 'listen to how he screwed up every single thing in this country.' 'It was excruciating,' O'Reilly said, emphasizing that Trump chose to speak that way because 'He believes that President Biden was behind Jack Smith and Mar-a-Lago raids.' NewsNation's Chris Cuomo disagreed, calling it 'petty vengeance.' 'Every moment that Donald Trump motivates any retrospective in terms of investigating narratives, looking at narratives, is, to me, a moment wasted for the American people,' Cuomo said. Trump calls America’s past leadership corrupt Trump described America’s leadership over the last four years as incompetent and corrupt, echoing some of the darker rhetoric he used daily on the campaign trail. He did not mention his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, or any other Democrats by name. But there was no question about whom he was talking. 'We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,' Trump charged. Here are all executive orders Trump is expected to sign on Day 1 He said the current government protects dangerous immigrants instead of law-abiding citizens, protects foreign borders at the expense of American borders and 'can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency.' 'All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly,' he said. As of Monday, Republicans control all three branches of the federal government.

Marco Rubio unanimously confirmed as secretary of State, becoming...	The Senate on Monday unanimously confirmed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) as America's 72nd secretary of State, putting in place the first member of President Trump's cabinet on the day of his inauguration. Rubio’s confirmation vote passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 99-0. Rubio also was able to cast a vote for himself. Vivek Ramaswamy set to depart DOGE 'No one on this body can doubt that Marco Rubio is an intelligent man with remarkable understanding of American foreign policy and a very deep commitment to the American Dream,' Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in remarks on the Senate floor. Rubio’s Senate seat will be filled by Florida state Attorney General Ashley Moody. As the son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio is the first Latino American to serve as top diplomat. A 14-year veteran of the Senate, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Rubio’s nomination as secretary of State brought relief to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and America’s allies abroad concerned over Trump’s unpredictable and chaotic approach to foreign affairs. Alongside Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virg.), Rubio co-sponsored legislation that would prevent any president from withdrawing from NATO, a move viewed as safeguarding America’s position in the alliance in the face of Trump’s threats to withdraw the U.S. Trump in recent weeks has telegraphed imperialist goals, expressing his desire to assume ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, as well as talk of making Canada the 51st state and taking over the Panama Canal from Panama. 'The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory,' Trump said during his inauguration address. Trump singled out retaking control of the Panama Canal in his address as an imperative to counter China’s influence in the strategic waterway. Panama’s president has rejected that the canal is under foreign influence. Senate passes Laken Riley Act in first move after Trump inauguration Rubio, during his confirmation hearing, said that the presence of Chinese companies on either side of the canal has raised concern from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and poses a national security risk to the U.S. – in one example of how he is planning to thread the needle of explaining some of Trump’s threats. 'In reality a foreign power today possesses, through their companies – which we know are not independent – the ability to turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict and that is a direct threat to the national interest and security of the United States,' he said. Rubio, viewed as a China hawk, is sending early signals of his focus on countering Beijing’s global influence ambitions, scheduling bilateral and group meetings in Washington with American allies on the frontlines of Chinese aggression the day after the inauguration. This includes a bilateral meeting with Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, and a joint meeting with the foreign ministers of Japan, Australia and India, the so-called Quad. The foreign ministers were present at Trump’s inauguration at the Capitol on Monday. The group's meeting demonstrates 'an iron-clad commitment' to close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong told reporters in Washington on Sunday, Reuters reported. Wong posted a photo from Trump’s inauguration ceremony at Capitol Hill alongside Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and India’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar. Also in the photo was Malta’s Deputy Prime Minister Ian Borg. The meetings are expected to take place Tuesday, a nod to the confidence that Rubio’s confirmation vote would move through quickly. Rubio has called for making the State Department 'highly relevant again,' but it’s unclear how much influence the State Department will have in a Trump administration where the president has appointed a slew of special envoys to take on specific foreign policy challenges.

Trump has also appointed a Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, part of his push to end the nearly three-year war. And Trump has anointed Richard Grenell, his former ambassador to Germany, whose name was floated as a potential secretary of State, for the undefined role of Presidential Envoy for Special Missions. Rubio steps into a role filled by two people during Trump's first term: Rex Tillerson, a former oil executive who was fired by Trump after 423 days in the role, and then Mike Pompeo, a former House member and CIA director under Trump. Rubio was a fierce Trump critic during the contest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. But he has evolved to a staunch loyalist, a shift cemented when Trump chose him for secretary of State one week after he won the election. He is widely seen as a potential presidential contender again in 2028.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/marco-rubio-confirmed-secretary-of-state/	2025-01-20T16:05:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/rubiomarco_011525gn03_w.jpg?w=900
Transcript: Trump's second inaugural address to the American peop...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump delivered a 30-minute speech from the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, his second inaugural address to the American people. Here is a transcript: Trump’s inauguration 2025 vs. 2017: Photos Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the United States Supreme Court, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation. And we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud and prosperous and free. America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before. But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing and the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, the radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens. While the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair, we now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or more importantly, its own people. Tech CEOs get prime seating at Trump inauguration Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, who’ve been treated so badly. And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago. Or more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting. But we can’t let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That’s going to change. We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today and will change very quickly. Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America’s decline is over. Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency and loyalty of America’s government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi: Here’s who skipped Trump’s inauguration That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. For American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day. It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society. Young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban and rural. And, very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote. We won by millions of people. To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is Martin Luther King Day and his honor — this will be a great honor — but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution. And we will not forget our God. Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It’s all about common sense. First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions. And that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices. And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill. Trump officials shut down CBP One app for migrants America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have: the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth. And we are going to use it. We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again. And it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice. We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote. I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources. The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore confidence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents. Something I know something about. We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the Constitution and the rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities. This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. This week I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from the military for objecting to the Covid vaccine mandate with full back pay. And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It’s going to end immediately. Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission—defeating America’s enemies. Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be. A peacemaker and a unifier. I’m pleased to say that, as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. And we will restore the name of the great President William McKinley to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States — the United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made. And Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back. Melania dons hat at Trump inauguration, struggles to kiss Trump Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization. So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars. And it’s the lifeblood of a great nation. And, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There’s no nation like our nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close. Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted millions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve. Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best. From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steel workers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced. Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore an American promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love. And we love it so much. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child to dreams for their future: I am with you, I will fight for you and I will win for you. And we’re going to win like never before. In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again. Greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other. Full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.

Tech CEOs get prime seating at Trump inauguration	(NewsNation) — The strategic seating of several prominent tech leaders who were perched behind President Donald Trump during his inauguration could foreshadow their potential hand in his administration, some political analysts say. The heads of the largest companies were spotted at his inauguration Monday. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple head Tim Cook and Google chief Sundar Pichai all attended the inauguration service at St. John's Church in Washington and were later seen seated together in the second row behind Trump’s family. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was also in attendance, with the inauguration occurring one day after the video-sharing platform went dark in the U.S., though he was not seated with the other tech leaders at the Capitol rotunda. Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? 'They [tech leaders] got some of the most prominent positions there, and it seems like Donald Trump was trying to send a message of some kind,' NewsNation Chief Washington Correspondent and host of 'The Hill' Blake Burman said. Niall Stanage, White House columnist for The Hill, also noticed the priority seating. 'I think visually, one of the most striking things was the prominence of so many tech executives, much more prominent than most members of Congress or even the proposed members of President Trump's Cabinet,' he said. Trump Cabinet nominees all sat behind the tech titans during the president's inaugural lunch. Musk is not a surprising guest as he will co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The billionaire owns Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X and has become Trump's close friend in recent years. The executives or their companies had all donated hefty sums to Trump’s inauguration fund, which likely garnered the prime locations. 'Things in Washington are changing. This is a different town when Donald Trump walked in here,' NewsNation's Leland Vittert said, referring in part to the seating chart. TikTok app restored in US amid Trump assurances A number of Republican governors, including Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida and many spouses of members of Congress, were relegated to an overflow room in Emancipation Hall due to the limited space in the Capitol rotunda, reported The Hill. Democrats denounced the seating decision. 'Big Tech billionaires have a front row seat at Trump’s inauguration. They have even better seats than Trump’s own Cabinet picks. That says it all,' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote on the social platform X. 'All you need to know. The billionaires are in charge. Not you,' Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote on X. Some Republicans privately were miffed, the outlet reported. 'I didn’t like that,' one GOP lawmaker told The Hill. 'Why is Zuckerberg all of a sudden in our fold? My concern is, if we hadn’t won, where would he be? Would he be on the other team?' a second GOP lawmaker said. 'At least Elon was in the fight.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/tech-ceos-trump-inauguration/	2025-01-20T13:57:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194915745_a4adc3.jpg?w=900

Here are all executive orders Trump is expected to sign on Day 1	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will put pen to paper Monday, signing a slew of executive orders relating to ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government, strictly defining two sexes and enforcing heightened border security. The president is expected to make good on several campaign promises on his first day in office, but many of his executive orders will likely come up against legal opposition in the coming days. An executive order is a signed statement about how the president wants the federal government to be managed. They can come in the form of instructions to federal agencies or requests for reports. Trump vows to release JFK, RFK, MLK assassination records 'Today I will sign a series of executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,' Trump said during his inauguration speech Monday. Trump is expected to sign these executive orders Monday afternoon: Border Diversity and inclusion Border-related executive orders Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border This order would help the secretary of defense quickly and seamlessly deploy members of armed forces to the border and free up more federal resources. Trump will end catch and release of migrants Border czar Tim Homan said the Trump administration would be ending the federal 'catch and release' program, which allows immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country as long as they are in the process for asylum. 'Stay in your homeland,' Homan told NewsNation last month. 'Be safe. Crossing into this country illegally is very dangerous.' Trump will reinstate the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy During his first term, Trump implemented the 'Remain in Mexico' policy, also called 'Migration Protection Protocols,' which required asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico until their claims were processed. Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration ended the policy in 2022. Under the order, this policy would be reinstated. Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? Trump will resume border wall construction Trump began construction of the southern border wall during his first administration in an effort to prevent illegal crossings. Under the order, work would resume. Trump will designate cartels as global terrorists After being elected, Trump revived a campaign vow to designate Mexico’s drug cartels as terrorist groups. 'I will immediately designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,' Trump said. Trump plans to rename Gulf of Mexico, Mount Denali — but can he? While in office in 2019, Trump dropped the plan at the request of Mexico’s then-President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who said he wanted U.S. cooperation in fighting drug gangs. Trump will suspend refugee resettlement for 4 months Trump, who put tight limits on refugees in his first term, has vowed to 'suspend refugee resettlement' for four months as part of a broader effort to 'immediately end the migrant invasion of America.' Trump will end birthright citizenship The president said he would end birthright citizenship, the right of children born in the U.S. to claim citizenship regardless of their parents’ immigration status. The 14th Amendment guarantees American citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. Only constitutional amendments, not executive orders or legislation, can change the Constitution. Trump said he intends to issue an executive order to end the practice, though executive orders cannot overturn constitutional amendments. Trump will direct the military to prioritize borders White House officials said the order would 'clarify the military’s role in protecting the territorial integrity of the United States' by sending military personnel to the border, pushing the Department of Defense to erect barriers and green-lighting the use of drones and other surveillance measures. Trump will order enhanced border vetting and screening Under this order, the president is expected to tighten up the vetting and screening of migrants entering the country. Trump plans to rename Gulf of Mexico, Mount Denali — but can he? Diversity and inclusion Trump will define gender as two sexes Trump officials said the order will direct federal agencies to enforce laws in order to protect men and women as distinct sexes and use sex, not gender, in federal policies and documents. The Trump administration will maintain there are two sexes, 'male' and 'female,' and that 'they are grounded in incontrovertible reality,' one official said. The official added the federal government will use the sex of a person at birth to determine how they are classified. Under the order, government-issued identity documents, including passports and visas, will reflect a holder's sex. The order is expected to state that the federal government will no longer promote gender ideology, according to officials. Trump will end federal DEI programs A Trump official said an executive order will end 'radical wasteful DEI programs and preferences' in the federal government in order to 'create equal treatment.' DEI refers to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. This order will end funding for DEI funding in the government and will direct the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to end 'illegal mandates, preferences.' 'This is going to be a priority,' one official said. This story is developing.

Trump declares ‘Golden Age’ in America in inaugural address	President Trump on Monday declared it was the beginning of a new 'Golden Age' in America, pledging to restore a country that he said had been decimated by the previous administration as he officially took the oath of office for his second White House term. In an inaugural address from the Capitol, Trump depicted a nation in disrepair and laid out an ambitious agenda that he argued was validated by his election victory in November. The president, in taking a shot at his predecessor Joe Biden, who was also seated directly next to the lectern as he spoke, said he was inheriting a government that 'cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.' 'Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and, indeed, their freedom,' Trump said. 'From this moment on, America's decline is over.' Trump said he would address the 'inflation crisis,' which he blamed on overspending by the Biden administration. He vowed to declare a national emergency at the southern border and to impose tariffs on foreign goods. He said he would end 'weaponization' of the Justice system. He vowed the official policy of the government would be that there are 'only two genders.' And he cast himself as a 'peacemaker,' even as he signaled he would seek to reclaim ownership of the Panama Canal. Trump delivered his address in the Capitol Rotunda after Monday’s inauguration proceedings were moved indoors in anticipation of bitterly cold temperatures in the nation’s capital. It was the first time an inauguration took place inside since 1985 for then-President Ronald Reagan’s second inaugural ceremony. The change in plans meant fewer people could be in the room to witness Trump’s swearing in and remarks in person. Attendees who made it inside the Rotunda and were seated directly behind the lectern included Trump’s Cabinet nominees and senior officials, former presidents and vice presidents, GOP donors and tech industry leaders like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai. Hundreds of other guests were relegated to an overflow room in the Capitol, including members of Congress, governors, New York Mayor Eric Adams and influencer Logan Paul. Thousands of Trump supporters who intended to watch from the National Mall witnessed the events via livestream at nearby Capital One Arena. Trump’s 2017 inauguration speech was widely remembered for its references to 'American carnage' and a pledge to put 'America First,' a sharply different tone than the typical notes of optimism and unity that are hallmarks of inaugural addresses. Monday’s address carried some of those same echoes, as Trump promised to put America first and argued he'd been left with 'plentiful' challenges. But he was at times reflective, speaking about the rally last July where he was grazed by a bullet. And, as he did throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump argued the nation's success would ultimately unify its citizens. 'I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success,' Trump said. 'A tide of change is sweeping the country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-declares-golden-age-in-america-after-inauguration/	2025-01-20T10:09:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25020631610246-e1737394872142.jpg?w=900

Trump, Melania launch meme coins: What are they?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's newly created cryptocurrency token has soared to more than $10 billion in market value on his second Inauguration Day. Trump announced the new $TRUMP meme coin Friday, writing on Truth Social: 'It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community.' Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House? On Sunday, Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, $MELANIA, writing on X: 'The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $MELANIA now.' Here's what to know about the bizarre world of meme coins and the ethical concerns around the president's involvement: What is a meme coin? Meme coins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet trends or jokes. They have no intrinsic value. They're worth what someone else is willing to pay. In some cases, that can be a lot. Dogecoin, the first meme coin, was meant as satire to mock Bitcoin, but its viral popularity has led to real gains for many. DOGE has a current market cap of roughly $55 billion. Unlike stocks, which represent an ownership share in a company, meme coins' value are based on hype, making them notoriously volatile and risky to invest in. Are the Trump meme coins worth anything? The Trump meme coins started selling for less than $10 each before surging above $70 on Sunday. By Monday morning, the price was below $50. The Melania coin was trading for around on $8 Monday morning, down from $13 on Sunday evening. Where is Michelle Obama? Those price swings underscore the volatility that makes meme coins so risky for buyers. A community note was later added to Melania's announcement on X, reading: 'Buying this token is incredibly risky and will likely result in the loss of funds.' On the meme coins' official websites, potential buyers are warned that Trump and Melania's crypto coins are 'digital collectibles intended to function as an expression of support for and engagement with the values embodied by the symbol $TRUMP' and the symbol 'MELANIA.' The disclaimers go on to say the tokens 'are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.' Instead, Trump's meme coin website encourages buyers to, 'Celebrate our win and have fun!' Why did Trump launch a meme coin? Trump is expected to be the most pro-crypto president in history, and his foray into the space suggests as much. The project is also likely to enrich him personally, raising ethics issues. 'The tokens released by Donald and Melania Trump appear to symbolize support for the digital currency sector. However, the introduction of these coins during the presidential inauguration raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest,' Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, told CNBC.

The Trump meme coin was organized by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization. CIC Digital and another company collectively own 80% of the Trump meme coins and 'will receive trading revenue derived from trading activities,' according to the official website. The coin’s website said 200 million Trump meme coins are currently available, with plans to issue 1 billion over the next three years. Felix Salmon, chief financial correspondent at Axios, put it like this: 'Trump has just delivered a masterclass in the ability of a president to turn power into wealth.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-melania-meme-coin-explained/	2025-01-20T08:53:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671f95c3b3c396.69294679.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is expected to fulfill the crackdowns he’s long promised on securing the U.S. border by signing multiple executive orders around immigration on his first day in office. Trump ran a campaign largely focused on immigration and the southern border, saying he would order the largest mass deportation in American history of people who crossed illegally. 'The border security measures I will outline in my inaugural address tomorrow will be the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen,' Trump told attendees of a private dinner on Sunday.

Trump plans to rename Gulf of Mexico, Mount Denali — but can he?	Video above: President Biden welcomes President-elect Trump to the White House ahead of the inauguration. (NEXSTAR) — President Donald Trump is set to hit the ground running as he takes office for the second time on Monday. In addition to declaring a national energy emergency and issuing executive orders regarding the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump appears set to enact another change he has teased: renaming the Gulf of Mexico. Earlier this month, Trump told reporters he wants it to be known as the Gulf of America, calling it 'a beautiful name' and 'appropriate.' It quickly drew pushback from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, who suggested North America be labeled as 'América Mexicana' or 'Mexican America.' That didn't stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., from quickly introducing a bill to rename the gulf. Trump's Inauguration Day: Live updates Ahead of Trump's inauguration Monday, his incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, shared on X that Trump will rename not only the Gulf of Mexico but Mount Denali as part of his initial executive orders. The post included a link to the New York Post, which reports it has learned that Trump will call for the Gulf of Mexico to become the Gulf of America. Mount Denali will return to Mount McKinley — President Barack Obama changed the name of the continent's highest mountain in 2015. FILE - A tour bus kicks up dust during a sunny day at Denali National Park in Alaska as Mount Denali appears in the background on Thursday, Aug. 8, 2013.

(AP Photo/Manuel Valdes, File) Citing a preview of the executive orders, the Post reports the move is to honor 'American greatness' and would require the secretary of the interior to change the names. In federal communications and official maps, the locations would be referred to as the Gulf of America and Mount McKinley. Mount McKinley was named for Republican president William McKinley, who was assassinated in 1901. Trump had previously expressed admiration for McKinley, calling him a 'very successful businessman' and a 'very good president' during a December 2024 rally. Will Melania Trump and Barron live at the White House? Following Obama's renaming of the mountain in 2015 — a move done to recognize 'the sacred status of Denali to generations of Alaska Natives' — Trump criticized the decision. He then vowed to change it back to McKinley during his first term in office. Members of Congress representing Alaska long resisted Denali becoming McKinley again. Does Trump have the power to rename both sites, though? While he could take the same path Obama did to rename Denali after McKinley — technically, his Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, used her authority to rename the mountain — it's unclear exactly if that's what Trump's executive order calls for. Because Denali is within the U.S. boundaries, it could be a relatively simple process. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico could be more complicated. 378913 01: Pennzenergy Company Oil Exploration Drilling Rig In The Gulf Of Mexico During Sunset.

MLK Day, Trump inauguration convergence brings reflection	(NewsNation) — The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Monday coincides with Martin Luther King Jr. Day for just the second time, but the occasion is one of reflection rather than concern for King’s family. Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights leader, told MSBC that Trump’s inauguration falling on the same day as the national holiday that honors her father draws attention to the legacy of service that King left behind. 'It points us back to King,' Bernice King said in the interview. 'It says, ‘When we move forward, we’ve got to do in the spirit of King.'' Trump expected to sign record number of executive orders on Monday Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and was first observed in 1986. Since then, only the inauguration of former President Bill Clinton in 1997 coincided with the federal holiday. In 2013, former President Barack Obama was sworn in during a private ceremony on Jan. 20, which fell on a Sunday. However, a public ceremony was held the following day, which fell on the federal holiday. Obama’s inauguration ceremony included a Bible that belonged to King. The next time the federal holiday falls on Jan. 20 will come in 2053 for the swearing-in of the winner of the 2052 presidential election. While the inauguration is always scheduled for Jan. 20, MLK Day falls on the third Monday of January each year. Bernice King, who was 5 years old when her father was assassinated in 1968, has been critical of Trump in the past. However, she told MSNBC that she wanted those who felt defeated by Trump’s victory in the 2024 election to stay focused on the message of nonviolence preached by her father. 'We have to strategize. We’ve been missing the strategy. We’ve been missing the spirit of Dr. King,' she said in the televised interview. 'The spirit of Dr. King is nonviolence. And nonviolence is not just a posture, it’s a mindset. For us, we define it as a love-centered way of thinking, speaking, acting and engaging that leads to personal, cultural and societal transformation.' Trump’s son, Martin Luther King III, told NBC News on Sunday that it is important for Trump to work to unify the country rather than to tear it apart. 'If you said you wanted to be a uniter, then those who didn’t support you, you need to reach out to them or allow them to reach out to you,' King's son said in an interview with 'Meet The Press'. 'We’re not reflective of the ‘United’ States of America right this moment, in my judgment.' Civil rights activists also stressed the importance of recognizing the timing of Trump’s inauguration and the holiday remembering King. Like King’s family, the Rev. Al Sharpton told USA Today the convergence of the two events serves as a reminder of King’s message that the work never stops. However, Sharpton said that to remain silent on Trump’s past rhetoric would be a disservice to King’s legacy. 'Everything that Dr. King stood for, Donald Trump has stated clearly he wants to dislodge,' Sharpton said, according to the report. Bernice King and other faith leaders will participate in a program at the King Center in Atlanta on Monday. She said it is important for people to listen to Trump’s speech as he is sworn in for a second time. 'Regardless of what people feel or think about President-elect Trump, at this point he's going to be the president of the United States,’’ she said, according to USA Today. 'We need to hear what he says. It does not need to be ignored, because you cannot create an effective strategy making assumptions.’’	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mlk-day-trump-inauguration-convergence/	2025-01-20T08:07:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/kingbernice_032723_AP_Brynn-Anderson-e1730817580302.jpg?w=900
Will Melania and Barron Trump live at the White House?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is returning to the White House on Monday as the second president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. Trump has not said he will live anywhere but the White House. Seven presidents have resided elsewhere during their administrations for varying periods, most of which occurred due to renovations. Where will Melania live during Trump's presidency? Trump's wife, Melania, and teenage son, Barron, are expected to stay at the White House in varied capacities, with the latter attending NYU in Manhattan. Melania told Fox News in a Jan. 13 interview that she will split her time between Washington, D.C., New York and Florida. Biden issues pardons for Jan. 6 Committee members, Fauci, Milley 'I will be in the White House. And when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York,' Melania said. 'When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach. My first priority is to be a mom, to be a first lady, to be a wife.'

Where will Barron live during Trump's presidency? As for Barron, Melania told Fox that he would visit the White House but primarily stay in New York like most NYU students. 'I think he will come and visit,' she said. President Joe Biden and his family will leave the White House on Monday morning; Melania told Fox they have five hours to move out.

Trump vows to release JFK, RFK, MLK assassination records	(The Hill) -- President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday vowed to release records related to former President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassinations 'in the coming days.' 'As a first step toward restoring transparency and accountability to government, we will also reverse the overclassification of government documents, and in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, as well as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and other topics of great public interest,' Trump said during a rally at Washington D.C.’s Capital One Arena in a clip highlighted by Mediaite. Robert F. Kennedy’s son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., backed Trump’s 2024 bid for the presidency and has been picked by Trump as his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. In a 2023 interview, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. backed a conspiracy theory about the CIA being involved in his uncle’s killing. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Trump to promise 'new era of national success' in inaugural addre...	(The Hill) -- President-elect Donald Trump is set to promise a 'new era of national success' in his inaugural address, according to The Wall Street Journal. 'I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country,' a part of the inaugural address, which the Journal first obtained, reads. 'My message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization,' the speech continues. The former president's inauguration ceremony on Monday is set to take place inside the Capitol Rotunda instead of the West Front of the Capitol due to cold weather. Trump’s return to the presidency comes after an intense 2024 election cycle that featured one of the major candidates dropping out and assassination attempts against the president-elect. He enters the office amid a period of heated political rhetoric on both sides of the aisle. In President Joe Biden’s inaugural address four years ago, he pushed for 'unity,' saying that Americans 'can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.' 'We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury,' he added. The expected attendees for Monday's swearing-in ceremony include Biden, former President Bill Clinton, former President George W. Bush and former President Barack Obama. Other expected guests include tech moguls such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-to-promise-new-era-of-national-success-in-inaugural-address/	2025-01-20T05:39:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25009055812675.jpg?w=900
What's next in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire?	(NewsNation) — On Day 2 of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, amid mixed emotions of joy and relief, there is uncertainty about what happens next. Aid trucks are flowing into Gaza following the release of three Israeli hostages and dozens of Palestinian prisoners. In the coming weeks, 30 more hostages are expected to be freed. Additionally, Yemen's Houthi rebels signaled they will limit attacks on Israeli ships in the Red Sea now that there is a ceasefire. In less than a week, another four Israeli hostages are expected to be released from Gaza, with the remaining 26 set to be freed over the next five weeks. How the deal to pause the Israel-Hamas war could unfold Gaza sees surge in food and medical aid Gaza is seeing a surge in food and medical supplies, with more than 630 trucks of humanitarian aid in the region, according to the U.N. Egypt's foreign minister has confirmed the assistance is expected to continue daily over roughly the next 40 days. However, the next critical step involves negotiating the second and third phases of the deal. If agreed upon, these stages would include the release of hostages, a permanent pause in fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Phase three would focus on returning the bodies of the deceased hostages and beginning the reconstruction of Gaza. Mother of slain American son in Gaza reacts to ceasefire deal Hostage's father: 'The job is not done' Over the weekend, the first hostages were released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli custody. It was a bittersweet moment for the families of those still believed to be in captivity, including the family of Itay Chen, a U.S.-Iraeli believed to be held hostage in Gaza. 'We also know that the job is not done, and that there are still 94 hostages in Gaza, and we must do everything possible in order to bring them back,' Itay's father, Ruby Chen, told NewsNation. 'We feel that all the families will stick together and support one another till the last hostage comes out. and that is exactly what we are waiting for.' Ruby Chen and former military personnel emphasize this agreement is only a partial deal and that future negotiations are needed. This, they stress, is not a peace deal.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israel-hamas-ceasefire-whats-next/	2025-01-20T05:10:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25019691319746.jpg?w=900
Biden issues pardons for Jan. 6 committee members, Fauci, Milley	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden issued pardons for retired Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci and members of the congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot on Tuesday, just hours before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. People who are close to Trump expect the president-elect might try to prosecute those who have gone against him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss. In a previous interview with NewsNation, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said the House Judiciary Committee would be considering potential investigations into the Jan. 6 committee. Biden said in a statement that the issuance of the pardons 'should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.' 'These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,' Biden said in a statement. Trump expected to sign record number of executive orders on Monday Several of those on the committee who got pardons Tuesday publicly said they didn’t want them, nor did they feel they even needed one. They include former Republican representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. However, Bennie Thompson, chairman of the committee, has gone on record saying he would accept the pardon for fear of prosecution in the incoming administration. Trump's pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi wouldn’t commit either way to prosecuting or not prosecuting the incoming president's political foes during her confirmation hearing last week. Instead, she said she needed to 'look at the facts and circumstances.' Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump’s conduct around the Jan. 6, 2021 riot. Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. He coordinated the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised the ire of Trump after refusing to back the president-elect's claims about the virus.

Trump's Inauguration Day security: What we know	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration is under heightened security in the wake of two national security events — a terror attack in New Orleans and a Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas. The event will mark Trump's nonconsecutive return to the White House, ringing in a presidency for a man who faced two assassination attempts during his reelection bid and incited the Jan. 6 Capitol riots after his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. Are there Inauguration Day security threats? Law enforcement prepared for potential demonstrations this time around, but they are not anticipating any major problems, the Associated Press reported. In a Capitol Police intelligence assessment report released earlier this month, obtained by ABC News, authorities expect the 'civil unrest' trend in 2020 to repeat in 2024. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events In an interview with CBS News, FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency was 'not tracking any specific or credible threats to the inauguration.' 'What I would tell you, though, is that we're dealing with a threat landscape where terrorists, whether they be foreign, jihadist-inspired or domestic terrorists or others, can move from radicalization to action quite quickly, often with very crude but still lethal attacks,' Wray told the outlet.

JD Vance; and Master Sergeant Matthew Nall, stand-in for President-elect Donald Trump, review troops during an inauguration rehearsal on the East Front of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 12. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) He pointed to FBI cooperation with state and local law enforcement partners to prevent safety issues. 'What I would tell you is that I have enormous confidence in the FBI's men and women in our role as supporting the other agencies, which have the primary responsibility for securing the inauguration,' Wray said. Who will act as security at Trump's inauguration? Roughly 7,800 National Guard soldiers and airmen will join the Secret Service, U.S. Capitol Police and D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department to secure the 60th presidential inauguration. That's roughly the same amount of guardsmen as Trump's first inauguration in 2017 and one-third of the guardsmen present at President Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration, according to NGAUS officials. The guards will provide security support, crowd management and medical assistance during the event. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. 'The National Guard is proud to contribute to the safe and orderly inauguration of our 47th commander-in-chief,' Gen. Steven S. Nordhaus, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement. 'We are immensely proud of the Soldiers and Airmen who will take part in it.' The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security will also secure the event. How is security impacted by an indoor ceremony? Security preparations changed last minute after Trump announced the swearing-in ceremony would move inside due to forecasted freezing temperatures. Trump will take the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda, the first time in 40 years that a president isn't sworn in on the Capitol steps outdoors. Instead of hundreds of thousands of people being able to watch the ceremony outside, now a room housing about 2,000 will be the site for Trump’s swearing-in as the 47th president. On the eve of the inauguration, inauguration committee staff members were mapping out where entertainers would enter the room and who would escort family members to the stage. The decision Friday to move the ceremony inside forced organizers and security agencies to redo hundreds of decisions meticulously laid out for months to new ones decided within days, such as: Who will get the coveted seats, and who won’t? A new road closure map was released late Saturday. What is the Inauguration Day schedule? Procession to Capitol: By tradition, a procession to the Capitol will kick off the events. President Joe Biden, President-elect Trump and their spouses will travel to the White House, escorted by members of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC). The two presidents will meet briefly and then proceed to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremonies. Swearing-in ceremonies: Vance will be sworn in first, followed by Trump. Inaugural address: The chief justice of the Supreme Court will deliver the oath to Trump, who will subsequently give his inaugural address. Every President since George Washington has delivered an inaugural address, according to the JCCIC. Outgoing presidential departure: After the ceremonies, outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will depart the Capitol by plane.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Signing ceremony: In his first official acts in office, Trump will gather with aides and members of Congress in the President’s Room to sign nominations and possibly some memorandums, proclamations or executive orders. Luncheon: The president, first lady, guests and members of the JCCIC will have a luncheon in the Capitol, a tradition since 1953. Military review and parade: Finally, the president and vice president will make their way to the east front steps of the Capitol, where they review the military troops, who will then lead a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The procession will include ceremonial military regiments, citizens’ groups, marching bands and floats.

Moving presidents in, out 'mass bedlam': Former White House usher	(NewsNation) — Within the next day, President Joe Biden's belongings will leave the White House as the Trumps settle in again. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated for his second presidential term on Monday, and former White House usher Chris Emery has a look behind the scenes at the 'mass bedlam' behind a White House flip. Emery told NewsNation the process of moving presidents in and out of the White House 'is almost like Cirque du Soleil,' with all 97 staff members working together. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events 'Some people are bringing clothes in. Some are bringing furnishings. You got electricians doing wiring. You get engineers putting up things. Everybody's working together,' Emery said. It's incoming first ladies who plan for the move — and it doesn't always go as planned, Emery said. 'I can recall President Clinton coming directly to me, saying, where's his tux? He had an inaugural to go to, and so there's a mad search throughout the house trying to find what happened,' Emery recalled. 'His tux was finally found in a third floor closet, like a half an hour before he was ready to go.' The first family knows what to expect this time around, but Emery said it will still be a heavy lift before their homecoming is complete. 5 takeaways from Trump’s inauguration eve rally How to watch Inauguration Day on NewsNation You can watch the full Inauguration Day proceedings on NewsNation on TV, online at NewsNationNow.com or on the NewsNation apps for your television or phone.

Trump expected to sign record number of executive orders on Monda...	President-elect Donald Trump is expected to sign a record number of executive orders on Monday after he takes the oath of office. The topics are expected to include temporarily suspending the ban on TikTok, measures to toughen border security, stop diversity mandates in the federal government, multiple ones dealing with energy policy and to stop what he called the 'over classification' of government documents. 'You are going to see something tomorrow. You are going to see executive orders that are going to make you extremely happy – lots of them, lots of them. We have to set our country on the proper course,' Trump said at a rally Sunday evening. President Biden signed a total of 22 executive orders during his first week in office, marking a modern record at the time. 6 dramatic moments that shaped Biden’s presidency 'Somebody said yesterday, 'Sir don’t sign so many in one day. Let’s do it over a period of weeks.' I said, 'Like hell we are going to do it over weeks.' We are going to sign them at the beginning … we are doing them tomorrow,' Trump added. As expected, some will deal with one of his top priorities: the border. 'The border security measures I will outline in my inaugural address tomorrow will be the most aggressive, sweeping effort to restore our borders the world has ever seen,' he told the crowd. There will be multiple executive orders dealing with energy policy: opening up areas and easing permitting for oil and gas production, two Senate Republican sources familiar with the plans said. Capitol Rotunda prepped as inaugural ceremony moves indoors The president-elect also promised he would undo some of the recent executive actions President Joe Biden enacted. 'Every radical, foolish executive order of the Biden administration will be repealed within hours of when I take the oath of office.' Trump told the rally he will pardon a number of defendants charged with the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. 'Tomorrow everybody in this very large arena will be very happy with my decision,' referencing the Jan. 6 pardons. Jason Miller, a senior adviser for Trump, teased on Sky News on Sunday that Trump could sign some executive orders inside the Capitol Rotunda shortly after being sworn in and then sign some additional actions later at Capital One Arena, where the presidential parade is now set to take place.

Live updates: Trump to hold victory rally at Capital One Arena, T...	President-elect Trump is making the rounds in Washington on Sunday ahead of a victory rally at Capital One Area just before Inauguration Day. Trump arrived in the nation's capital over the weekend where he is preparing to take a second term in the White House as the Republican trifecta takes form. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance took part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier earlier Sunday. He will hold a rally this evening where the slate of guest speakers include Megyn Kelly and Elon Musk. Also Sunday, TikTok said it was 'in the process' of restoring service in the United States hours after the popular video-sharing platform went dark. And in the Middle East, the ceasefire deal struck between Israel and Hamas took effect on Sunday, with the release of hostages that have been held in the Gaza Strip for more than one year. The deal includes three phases including an initial six-week pause in fighting. Several lawmakers also took to the Sunday political news shows including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) who told NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' that Trump is entering the White House as a 'different Donald Trump' from the man who took office eight years ago. Plus, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that he 'won’t commit' to sending California disaster aid without conditions, even as Gov.

Capitol Rotunda prepped as inaugural ceremony moves indoors	(NewsNation) — With just under 24 hours before Monday’s inauguration, the Capitol Rotunda was full of activity Sunday afternoon. The majestic room is being turned into the site of the inauguration, which was moved inside because of concerns about the frigid cold. Instead of hundreds of thousands of people being able to watch the ceremony outside, now a room housing about 2,000 max will be the site for Donald Trump’s swearing-in as the 47th president. These notable inaugurations weren’t held at the US Capitol. Here’s why Congressional officials were figuring out where exactly Trump should stand on stage as he takes the oath. Inauguration committee staff were mapping out where entertainers would enter the room, and who would escort family members to the stage. The decision Friday to move the ceremony inside forced organizers and security agencies to re-do hundreds of decisions meticulously laid out for months to new ones decided within days, such as: Who will get the coveted seats and who won’t? Various agencies are now figuring out where security entrances will now be. What road closures now need to be in effect? A new road closure map was released late Saturday. For the Secret Service, which is in charge of the security for the inauguration, the switch of venues means the swearing-in ceremony is an easier event to safeguard because it means fewer people in attendance and takes away the uncertainty of an outside site. Capitol staff, who are in charge of setting up the ceremony, were seen unloading new batches of chairs as they see how many seats could be jammed into the area. Ted Cruz: ‘This is a different Donald Trump that is being sworn in than in 2017’ Meanwhile, the decision to move the ceremony is causing repercussions across Washington. Congressional offices are being inundated with constituents who had received inaugural tickets but now won’t be able to attend and want to know if there is anything they can do. As part of the move inside, jumbotrons set up across the National Mall allowing thousands without tickets to view the swearing-in and feel like they are part of the event were taken down by the Presidential Inaugural Committee because of the weather, a spokesman for the National Park Service said. As for the Rotunda preparations, workers will be probably working through much of the night putting on the final touches because just like every other inaugural- at noon the new president will be sworn in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/capitol-rotunda-inaugural-ceremony/	2025-01-19T13:40:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/cap_rouunda.jpg?w=900

Mother of son killed in Gaza 'relieved' after first hostages rele...	(NewsNation) — The ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of the first three hostages is bittersweet for one mother who lost her 23-year-old American son, Hersh Goldberg, to the war. The ceasefire deal in Gaza is in effect as of Sunday morning, after almost falling apart in the final hours with Hamas holding out on releasing the list of hostage names. Ultimately, Hamas announced the names of three living female hostages who were successfully freed to Israeli officials Sunday afternoon local time. The deal was too late for Rachel Goldberg-Polin and her family, but she remains hopeful for the other grieving families. 'I woke up this morning, and I felt tremendous relief,' Goldberg-Polin said on NewsNation’s 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday. 'I am a mother who is going to be processing the loss of her only son for the rest of my life, but I am so relieved for these families.' Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next She described her son, who was executed by Hamas five months ago, as a 'happy-go-lucky, positive, wide-eyed lover of listening, small ego, curious, beautiful young man.' She compared him to a flower 'that's about to open up,' as she hopes his memory will 'serve as a blessing and as motivation to do and be better.' This undated photo provided by Rachel Goldberg shows her son Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

(Courtesy of Rachel Goldberg via AP) First hostages released Three women -- Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari -- were handed over to the Red Cross on the first day of the ceasefire. They are now in Israel and will soon be medically evaluated. The three-phase ceasefire began with this prisoner exchange, with Israel releasing 1,700 Palestinian prisoners in return in the first phase. Thirty-three hostages held captive by Hamas are expected to be released in the first six weeks as well. No Americans were released on the first day of the ceasefire, Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told NewsNation, but they are expected to be freed within the first six weeks. Phase two will include the return of the remaining living Israel hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza. The third phase is expected to address the handing over of the remaining bodies of dead hostages and the start of Gaza’s reconstruction, according to President Joe Biden. Families of hostages grateful but cautious about ceasefire deal The youngest hostage was kidnapped when he was nine months old, celebrating his second birthday the day before the ceasefire’s start. And 64 people will remain in captivity. 'We cannot be celebrating until every single one is home, and until this deal is complete,' Goldberg-Polin said. The war began 471 days ago on Oct. 7, 2023. In that time, people of different backgrounds faced a life-changing event. 'Now the remaining hostages comprise 23 different nationalities. They are Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. And I started to wear the number because so many people would ask me during interviews, just on the street randomly, how many days has it been and I decided very early on that this is going to be my identity until every single one of these hostages comes home.' More than 46,000 Palestinians have died in the war, according to officials. In a post to X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the hostage release. 'Romi, Doron and Emily - an entire nation embraces you, with congratulations on your homecoming. This moment was achieved thanks to the sacrifice and fighting of our heroic fighters - the heroes of Israel. I promise: We will bring everyone home!' Netanyahu wrote, translated from Hebrew. Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefire deal Is the ceasefire deal enough?

Scott Applewhite) It’s been five months since Goldberg-Polin lost her son. Is the deal enough? 'Well, if this deal gets every single person home, it is enough,' she said. 'If this deal even saves one life according to Jewish tradition and actually to Islamic tradition, one life is one universe. So, if we can save one universe, three universes, 33 universes, that's wonderful, but we have an obligation, a moral, ethical obligation to save 98 universes.' Goldberg-Polin said she wants to see Trump stand by his promises. Ceasefire in Gaza begins, Hamas releases hostage names to Israel 'This deal could have happened back in the summer, and Hersh and three of the people who he was executed with would have been released. But I don't think anymore that it's healthy nor helpful to dwell on that,' Goldberg-Polin said. 'That was not the destiny for our six families of the beautiful six who were tortured, starved and murdered in that lightless, airless tunnel that wasn't meant to be.' She is looking ahead and not behind. 'I truly believe there is light ahead, and we all need to be looking toward the light.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/mother-of-son-killed-in-gaza-relieved-after-first-hostages-released/	2025-01-19T09:18:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/652d813a1663e5.11579913.jpeg?w=900
These notable inaugurations weren't held at the US Capitol. Here'...	(NEXSTAR) – For decades, Americans have gathered at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. to watch the inauguration of the incoming president, but there are some noteworthy exceptions. While the first and second inaugurations of President George Washington were held outside of Washington D.C., they were still held in the nation's capital, which was in New York City in 1789, and, for Washington's second inauguration in 1793, in Philadelphia. The inauguration ceremony would move to Washington D.C. for Thomas Jefferson's 1801 oath of office, according to the National Library of Congress, but circumstances in subsequent years would force the inauguration to happen on a plane, at a farm and at a personal residence. Chester A. Arthur (1881) After just 200 days in office — a presidency historians called 'impactful,' if short — an 'embittered attorney' passed over for a consular post shot President James A. Garfield at a Washington, D.C. railroad station. Garfield would not survive his injuries, making his vice president, Chester A. Arthur, head of state. On Sept. 20, 1881, then-Vice President Arthur took the oath of office at his home in New York City, with New York Supreme Court Judge John R. Brady administering the proceedings, according to official accounts. The next day, he took his oath again, this time before a group of invited guests inside the vice president's room at the U.S. Capitol, according to UC Santa Barbara's 'The American Presidency Project.' Theodore Roosevelt (1901) The assassination of President William McKinley led to an inauguration ceremony hastily arranged at a home in Buffalo, New York, according to the National Park Service. McKinley was shot twice at point blank range while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, on Sept. 6, 1901, according to White House historians. He would die eight days later. His vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, had been vacationing in New York's Adirondack Mountains when he received news that McKinley was gravely wounded. Roosevelt rushed to Buffalo, but by the time he arrived McKinley had died. Using a borrowed coat, pants, waistcoat, tie and leather shoes, Roosevelt decided to take the oath of office immediately so the country wouldn't experience a gap in leadership, according to the Park Service. 'I was so shocked by the terrible news brought to me last night and by the calamity which it entailed upon the country, as well as by personal sorrow which I feel, that I have had no time to think of plans for the future conduct of the office, which has been so suddenly and sadly thrust upon me,' Roosevelt said, according to a newspaper account from The Richmond Dispatch. The impromptu inauguration ceremony was held in the library of the house of Roosevelt's friend, Ansley Wilcox. The home is now open to the public as the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site. Calvin Coolidge (1923) The death of a sitting president brought about another unorthodox inauguration – this time in 1923 when Calvin Coolidge was sworn in using a family bible at the Vermont farmhouse in Plymouth Notch where he grew up. Coolidge was ushered into office after President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in 1923 while in San Francisco, according to White House historians. After learning at 2:30 a.m. on August 3, 1923, that he was president, Coolidge's father, a notary public, had his son place his hand on the family Bible and swear the oath of office. The birthplace and childhood home of President Coolidge have since been preserved as a Vermont State Historic Site. Lyndon Johnson (1963) Roughly two hours after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade in Dallas, Lyndon Johnson made history by becoming the only president to be inaugurated on an airplane. Johnson took the oath of office in the forward cabin of Air Force One in Dallas, according to a Library of Congress blog post. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath, the first time a woman had done so in U.S. history. Photos show Johnson flanked by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and his wife, Claudia 'Lady Bird' Johnson as he pledged to 'preserve, protect and defend The Constitution of the United States.' Five days later, he would address Congress and invoke Kennedy's vision for the country, calling for the passage of civil rights and tax legislation. Fast forwarding to Monday, President-elect Trump's inauguration ceremony is already making history. While the ceremony will happen at the Capitol, Trump announced that it will be held inside the Capitol Rotunda to shield people from the brutal cold forecast for that day. An indoor inauguration ceremony hasn't happened since President Reagan's in 1985, according to The Washington Post.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/these-notable-inaugurations-werent-held-at-the-us-capitol-heres-why/	2025-01-19T08:05:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-515466874-e1737143828756.jpg?w=799
First round of hostages released after ceasefire	(NewsNation) — More than 30 Israeli hostages have been released, signaling the start of Israel and Hamas' three-phase ceasefire deal. On Sunday, 33 Israeli hostages deemed 'humanitarian cases' — including all women, children and men over 50 years old — were released. Two American citizens, Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, are on the list of hostages to be released in the first phase. Not all Americans are expected to be released Sunday, a U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. French citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi are also among the 33 hostages, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. Palestinians are expected to be able to return to their homes during the first phase. Names of hostages to be released The Times of Israel and Jerusalem Post reported the names of the 33 people set to be released in the deal. They are: Liri Albag Itzhik Elgarat Karina Ariev Ohad Ben-Ami Ariel Bibas Yarden Bibas Kfir Bibas Shiri Silberman Bibas Agam Berger Romi Gonen Danielle Gilboa Emily Damari Sagui Dekel-Chen Yair Horn Omer Wenkert Alexander Troufanov Arbel Yehud Ohad Yahalomi Eliya Cohen Or Levy Naama Levy Oded Lifshitz Gadi Moshe Moses Avera Mengistu Shlomo Mansur Keith Siegel Tsahi Idan Ofer Calderon Tal Shoham Doron Steinbrecher Omer Shem-Tov Hisham Al Sayed Eli Sharabi The process for releasing the remaining American hostages, including those who have died, is ongoing. The temporary ceasefire is set to become permanent during the second phase. The third phase will involve the return of dead hostages and reconstruction in Gaza. Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a ceasefire deal to return Hamas-held hostages has been reached. Netanyahu said in a statement that the decision was made after 'examining all the political, security and humanitarian aspects, and with the understanding that the proposed transaction supports the achievement of the war’s goals.' Both President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have claimed credit for the deal. Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefire deal The pause in fighting comes after more than a year of conflict and a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Israel says 405 soldiers have been killed in the conflict, while Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed. It is not clear how many of those are combatants and how many are civilians.

TikTok app restored in US amid Trump assurances	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to help the popular social media app TikTok stay in operation under his presidency. And now, it looks like it is powering back up despite a shutdown in the United States late Saturday night before the ban upheld by the Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. 'In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,' TikTok said in a statement on Sunday afternoon. 'We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.' Trump had said earlier Saturday that he would 'most likely' give TikTok a 90-day extension but left no one in any doubt via Truth Social on Sunday morning. The president-elect kept it short initially, writing on his social media platform: 'SAVE TIKTOK!' TikTok ban enforced: What happens now? Shortly after, Trump said he would not let the app 'stay' dark, saying he would issue an executive order on Monday to 'extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.' He proposed that the U.S. have 50% ownership in a 'joint venture.''By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions,' he wrote.TikTok began to restore service to U.S. users Sunday afternoon and credited Trump again for pushing to keep the app operational. 'In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,' TikTok said in a statement posted to the social platform X. 'We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,' it continued. Upon opening the app shortly late last night, users were greeted with a message: 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.' 'We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!' the notice continued. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-AK, and Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-NE, posted a joint statement to X on Sunday morning stating that there is 'no legal basis' for an extension of any kind. Republicans set to give Trump big immigration win — while dividing Democrats 'We commend Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft for following the law and halting operations with ByteDance and TikTok, and we encourage other companies to do the same. The law, after all, risks ruinous bankruptcy for any company who violates it,' the statement read. 'Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. 'Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posed to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok.' Elon Musk, who has become close with Trump, posted to his own social media app X: 'I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but 𝕏 is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change.' In 2020, Trump tried to ban TikTok with an executive order, but two courts later shut his efforts down.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-save-tiktok-truth-social-shutdown/	2025-01-19T05:23:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2193195255.jpg?w=900
6 dramatic moments that shaped Biden’s presidency	President Biden’s single term in office will be marked by several moments that saw the White House take the spotlight. It began with the pandemic and a raucous State of the Union. Then there was the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and his handling of wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Ultimately, his age and questions about his stamina led to him dropping out of the 2024 race that ended his decades-long political career. Here are the top dramatic moments of Biden’s presidency. The raucous 2023 State of the Union During his 2023 State of the Union address, Biden sparred with Republican lawmakers over potential cuts to Social Security with a lively back-and-forth in the House chamber. He argued that 'some Republicans want Social Security and Medicare to sunset' and Republicans yelled back, 'no,' which prompted the president to ad-lib about people contacting his office if they don’t believe him. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) stood up and pointed her finger at Biden, and yelled 'liar.' Biden replied, 'I don’t think it’s a majority of you, I don’t even think it’s a significant' before more jeers from Republicans. 'So folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right?' Biden said. 'Alright,' he added, with a thumbs-up, while Democrats and some Republicans stood up to cheer. Biden spent much of his speech urging unity to kick off the second half of his presidency following the 2022 midterm elections, but a back-and-forth inside the chamber with Republicans was the key takeaway from the address. At the time, it offered Biden and the White House an example of the president’s stamina, which Democrats used as an example when arguing Biden was fit enough to run for reelection. Ukraine speech In March 2022, Biden gave a fiery speech in Poland about his support for Ukraine a month after Russia’s invasion, during which he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin can’t remain in power. 'Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. We will have a different future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principles, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom, and possibilities,' Biden said during a speech in front of the Polish presidential palace. 'For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.' The crowd he spoke to was made up of Polish citizens, Ukrainian refugees and government officials from both countries. But, his stern remarks led to a clean-up operation from the White House and officials at the time attempted to argue that Biden’s comments meant Putin should not have power outside of Russia. A year later, the president made a surprise trip to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which involved a covert journey to the war-torn country on a 10-hour train ride from Poland to Kyiv. He is the only commander-in-chief to visit a war zone not controlled by U.S. forces. Afghanistan withdrawal The August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan was a major bruise on Biden’s legacy early into his presidency and is seen as the start of a long and windy downfall for his presidency. When hectic images out of the Kabul airport surfaced, Americans at home could see how chaotic the troop removal was. Then, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members who were helping to evacuate people from the country. Biden was told to 'burn in hell' by a family member of one of the 13 fallen service members in Kabul when the remains of troops arrived at Dover Air Force Base. Biden was personally involved in solving problems at the Kabul airport during the withdrawal, directing people on the ground to find ways to get Afghans at risk out of the country, according to a recent book.The nature of the withdrawal and the several deaths led to investigations from House Republicans, who dropped a long-awaited report in September. It painted Biden as determined to leave the country but fumbling preparation, criticizing him for a rushed effort regardless of counsel from allies and advisers that led to unnecessary deaths. Hur report A March 2024 release of a transcript of special counsel Robert Hur’s two-day interview with Biden for his investigation into the president’s handling of classified materials gave Republicans and critics new ammunition to go after his age — and gave the public a window into the president’s fitness for office. Biden had not engaged in many press interviews, in print or television, so the Hur report released amid the president’s campaign for reelection fueled concerns over Biden’s age. Hur described the president as a 'well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory' in the report, which recommended no charges against Biden for his handling of classified documents. One of the most notable exchanges to come out of Hur’s final report was when the special counsel wrote that Biden struggled to remember key dates and details, including when his son Beau died. The White House and Biden himself went on the attack. Disastrous debate Biden and Trump had their first and only 2024 presidential debate on June 27, moderated by CNN. It began immediately with Biden fumbling his answers and giving confused looks. Biden’s disastrous performance, one that lasted 90 minutes, set off a series of events that led to him ultimately dropping his reelection bid. Biden’s voice was hoarse, he struggled to finish sentences and he tripped over his words while discussing key topics like border security and the economy. He appeared to lose his train of thought while mixing up the terms Medicare and COVID and Trump took aim at him for slurring his comments. His team at the time said that Biden had a cold to explain his slow start and raspy voice. Democratic operatives were the first to call for him to drop out, followed by the first Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), on July 2. Pressure then built from party leaders like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and former President Obama, who were in part behind urging lawmakers to publicly call for the president to drop out and warning Biden that he could lose to Trump. At the time of the debate, Biden was trailing Trump in the polls, especially in the pivotal battleground states. Drops reelection bid Once the flood gates were open with Democratic lawmakers calling for him to drop out, Biden was unable to stop the bleeding. In early July, he and his team spoke with Democratic congressional leadership and Democratic governors and he sat for an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in an effort to show he can participate in unscripted events. He campaigned in Wisconsin, where he fought back against critics, and he gave a defiant interview on 'Morning Joe' to dare other Democrats to challenge him at the convention in August. At this time, the White House also faced a series of questions over visitor logs that showed a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson’s disease visited the campus several times in recent months. There was then a brief pause in calls from lawmakers for Biden to step down in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania The president sat for another interview, with NBC’s Lester Holt, to defend the fallout from the debate. Days later, he tested positive for COVID-19 when he was campaigning in Las Vegas. While isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., with a growing list of sitting Democrats urging him to drop out, Biden and a small circle of his closest advisers ultimately made the decision to do so. He announced he would no longer seek another four years in office on July 21 in a letter shared on X and then later endorsed Vice President Harris to be the party’s nominee Harris had just over 100 days to run against Trump and lost decisively in November.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/6-dramatic-moments-that-shaped-bidens-presidency/	2025-01-19T05:21:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Biden-regulations_010825_AP_Gerald-Herbert.jpg?w=900
Marco Rubio met with UAP whistleblower prior to Trump nomination	(NewsNation) — Whistleblower Jacob Barber tells NewsNation he not only knows of secret unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs, more commonly known as UFOs) retrieval programs in the government but has worked for one. For the past 30 years, Barber said he’s worked in both an official and unofficial capacity for the United States government and its partners in the intelligence community. 'We're in this rare opportunity in human history where it's very clear that we know that there are things flying in the sky that are unexplained and un-understood,' Barber told NewsNation investigative reporter Ross Coulthart exclusively. UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive During his time as a contracted helicopter pilot, he retrieved all kinds of downed craft, some of which he believes are of nonhuman origin. 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber said. 'It was not human.' Barber claims he is 'uniquely providing information on' UAPs and wants the public to know what he knows. Witnesses at the congressional UAP hearings have been saying the same thing. 'The Pentagon, the intelligence community is treating us like children. It's time for us to know the truth about this. I think that we can handle it,' journalist Michael Shellenberger said during his testimony. Barber has been to Capitol Hill too. NewsNation confirmed that this past fall, he met with staffers for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is now President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state. 'I feel I was able to fill in gaps that have been there for a long time that no other whistleblower has been able to do,' Barber said. Rubio is expected to see a smooth confirmation from the Senate. Is Trump considering an overhaul of NASA? NewsNation checked Barber's records and confirmed he was an airman in the U.S. Air Force who worked as an aerospace mechanic in the late 1990s. He was also recruited into Air Force Special Operations, known as 'combat control.' He would eventually go on to work in a nonofficial capacity for the Defense Department and the intelligence community. In addition to reviewing his official documentation, NewsNation spoke with three former special operations soldiers who corroborated Barber’s credentials.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/marco-rubio-uap-whistleblower-jack-barber/	2025-01-18T18:01:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/FX6_0682.mp4.15_03_57_00.Still002000.png?w=900
UAP recovery video shows ‘egg-shaped’ object: Exclusive	(NewsNation) — NewsNation has obtained exclusive footage capturing an egg-shaped craft, recorded during a UAP retrieval operation. The egg resembles the UAP encountered by U.S. Navy fighters off the east coast of the U.S. in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects. NewsNation was told that the video was sent to the organization responsible for monitoring UAPs, and until now it has never been shown to the public, making a U.S. Air Force veteran's mission even more critical. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs Whistleblower Jake Barber believes he was involved in the recovery of alien technology while working for a long-rumored secret UFO retrieval program. When asked to describe the object, Barber told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber said. 'It was not human.' He added: 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.' Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims Other whistleblowers, including Lue Elizondo and David Grusch, have alleged a secret government UFO program exists but Barber says he knows it’s true because he’s part of it. NewsNation has also obtained exclusive, never-before-seen video of one of these alleged UFO crash retrievals. That video and the full interviews will air in Saturday's special report 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' at 8p/7c. Click here to find NewsNation's channel on your television. In June 2023, NewsNation was the first television network to present an interview with Grusch.

(NewsNation) — In October 2024, an unknown man stepped out of the shadows, arriving in our nation’s capital to deliver an important message about what the public calls 'UFOs' and what the government calls 'UAPs,' or unidentified aerial phenomena. His name is Jacob Barber, and he says for the past 30 years, he’s worked in both an official and unofficial capacity for the United States government and its partners in the intelligence community. What he knows, and what he’s here to tell Congress, could change the world. 'We're in this rare opportunity in human history where it's very clear that we know that there are things flying in the sky that are unexplained and un-understood, and that's another one of the things that I'm uniquely providing information on,' Barber said. Others have alleged there’s a secret government UAP retrieval program that’s been going on for decades. People like David Grusch and Lue Elizondo. They say they’ve been told about it, they believe it exists, but they weren’t a part of it themselves. Barber, however, is different. He says he was part of that covert program that worked with alien spacecraft for years. NewsNation checked Barber's records and confirmed that he was an airman in the U.S. Air Force who worked as an aerospace mechanic in the late 1990s. He was also recruited into Air Force Special Operations, known as 'combat control.' He would eventually go on to work in a nonofficial capacity for the Defense Department and the intelligence community. Barber was a highly talented airplane mechanic who was deployed on a number of presidential support missions. But Barber was no ordinary mechanic. Being recruited into the Air Force’s Elite Combat Control unit meant he had a résumé that reads like something out of an action thriller: helicopter pilot, freefall parachutist, expert marksman and the recipient of a NATO top-secret security clearance — a legacy of his service in Bosnia, for which he won an award for heroism. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs In addition to reviewing his official documentation, NewsNation spoke with three former special operations soldiers who corroborated Barber’s credentials. One of his most fervent supporters is Col. John Blitch, a Renaissance warrior who also holds a doctorate in psychology, was a Delta Force sniper and is one of the few men to hold doomsday in his hands while commanding a nuclear weapons battalion. Blitch says he believes Barber’s claim wholeheartedly and that the U.S. has 'absolutely' recovered UAPs. For Barber, he says 'everything changed' for him around Sept. 11, 2001. 'I left the Air Force and was sent out to California at that time to begin establishing my cover basis as an independent contractor so that I can serve. What was coming down the line next for me was the path which led to the UAP subject,' said Barber. He says he was contracted as a helicopter pilot and was part of a team assigned to retrieve crashed aircraft at an undisclosed testing facility in the desert. 'A lot of the work we did was on what I call ‘the range,’ where the U.S. government and its private partners used to test all kinds of things — weapon systems and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft — and so you see a lot of exciting things,' said Barber. That’s where Barber said he began to see strange things. 'It's always interesting out there,' he said. 'Things come in and out of sight. Things disappear for a moment and reappear. Things seem to move very quickly. Things change color. They change shape.' Barber said his team recovered 'things that were exotic in nature.' 'We know they were classified craft,' he said. 'And we recovered them and took them back to where they go.' Barber’s first encounter with nonhuman intelligence 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was not human,' he said. Barber said he got his first glimpse of 'not human' pretty quickly. 'I was a helicopter pilot, and I operate with a 150-to-200-foot-long line. So, I got within 150 feet of this object,' he said. That’s when he saw it. 'I saw an egg, a white egg,' he said. 'There was no engine. There was no thermal signature. I was operating at night when I finally came in to pick it up. So, I'm working under night vision goggles at the time, and it was quite clear. I flipped them up, flipped them down and looked at it a couple of different ways.' UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive Barber said the 'metallic, pearly white' object was about the size of an SUV. 'I can tell you that the reaction by my team … we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary,' he said. While Barber said he was never told the craft wasn’t human, he’s certain. 'I'll tell you that because of the reaction of my leadership structure and because of my experience working in that capacity, everyone involved was convinced that what we were seeing and dealing with was, in fact, exotic in its origin,' said Barber. 'I will also tell you that during this process, over the last couple of years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP Task Force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence), and it was not a unique experience.' Barber said he still doesn’t know what exactly the object was or where it may be housed now. 'It would be taken to a secure facility. But my role stops once I deliver it,' he said. That wasn’t Barber’s only brush with the unexplained. 'There was another object. One was the egg, the other is what I called an ‘eightgon.’ The eightgon was essentially a flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections when looking down,' said Barber. 'And I can tell you what it looked like from looking down because that's primarily how I saw it. Because I'm a helicopter pilot. We did recoveries with the eightgons. There was more than one that made its way to the ground on this particular operation.' Barber said what happened next would be one of the most 'profound' experiences he’s had in his life. 'As I get closer to this site, I start feeling odd, I start feeling extremely emotional, and the closer I get, the more the emotion starts to overwhelm me,' he said. 'I feel this intense hybrid of sadness and happiness and beauty and song, and it was very disruptive to me because I had a very practical responsibility at the time to operate a helicopter in the mountains at night. And I began wondering, ‘What was wrong with me?’' Barber said it didn’t feel like an emotional breakdown but rather something entirely different. Drone sightings over Long Island airport spark concerns 'I felt like something connected with me,' he said. 'I felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.' Barber said he had never experienced a feeling like that before. 'It was a very feminine energy. I'll tell you that it felt like the spirit of God, but not in any masculine sense. And it wasn't like a soul; it was like a frequency that I was connected with. And whatever that force was since that night, it has stayed with me. And as crazy as this sounds, it's what's guiding me now, and it's what's providing protection for me.' Psionics Barber said his mission that night came from no accidental crash. He claims the UAP was summoned by a special team with special abilities: the 'Psionics.' Psionics, according to Barber, are people with a 'predisposition for extratemporal abilities and sensitivities,' more commonly referred to as people with alleged psychic powers. 'In the program, there was certainly a desire to explore the idea that perhaps UAP could be summoned, could be communicated with, could be controlled and could be persuaded to land, all by deploying people with psionic abilities to interface and communicate with the UAP,' said Barber. It’s something Barber said he has witnessed firsthand — and it looks a lot like meditation. He firmly believes psionics are capable of making a mental and spiritual connection to technology. It’s something another decorated Special Forces operator and colleague of Barber says he has witnessed too. 'I've had the pleasure of meeting multiple psionic assets,' said Don Paul Bales. 'I've seen them function. I know that they're capable of doing what they're doing.' It’s an established fact that the Pentagon has had an interest in psychic abilities — what it calls 'remote viewing' — for military purposes. The famed Project Stargate spent years studying the subject and despite the CIA’s official position that such studies yielded nothing. Despite the wonder of it all, Barber claims that he and his team have suffered serious injuries. Are UAPs bad for your health? Barber tells NewsNation that these encounters could come with a staggering cost to his health. 'We transported what we called ‘mystery boxes’ all the time,' he said. 'I have no idea … it could have been empty. It probably wasn't empty, but we don't know what was inside the boxes.' Barber and his team, however, were authorized to use 'lethal force' to protect their shipments should someone attempt to seize them. Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims 'After this particular mission, I and everyone on my team got extremely sick, like physically ill, in the hospital,' he said. 'Within weeks after this, I lost every hair on my body, which they call alopecia. I also lost the skin on my arms, so the skin's actually falling off your body. I ended up developing a severe heart murmur that I'd never had before.' Last year, NewsNation’s Ross Coulthart introduced Barber to Stanford University immunology professor Dr. Garry Nolan. He’s been studying anomalous injuries among U.S. military personnel for years at the behest of the CIA. He agreed to review decades of Barber’s medical records. 'The acute injuries were obviously severe,' said Nolan. 'I mean, the report reads like a bit of a horror show, to be quite honest. To me, the first thing that came to mind was (Barber) was exposed to some kind of radiation.' To this day, Barber is nervous that he may have some form of cancer. Assuming Barber and his team were exposed to radiation emanating from the mysterious box they transported, could it have come from one of the many radioactive materials used regularly by the military? Barber doesn’t believe so. 'Can I put on my speculative hat for a minute? Okay, so if the Air Force, let's say, knew that what we were working with that night had any type of radiological signature, there's a whole set of processes that we're trained in on how to deal with that from a hazmat perspective and a containment perspective,' said Barber. 'And the fact that none of that was apparent that night tells me they didn't know what was in the box, and it got turned on or turned off. It leads me to believe, in hindsight all these years, that it may have been something of nonhuman origin or exotic. Let's just say exotic. It may have been something exotic that activated or still had some fallout.' Barber remains under Nolan’s care and is receiving proper evaluation and treatment. Stolen hard drives? It wasn’t just the U.S. government interested in using Barber’s expertise in UAPs and psionics; his skills were also needed by private companies involved in the program. His assignments soon took a turn from recovering UAPs to something more sinister. 'We were deployed on a particular task to recover what we call HVTs, or 'high-value targets.' Those high-value targets were Panasonic Toughbooks — the sensitive material that is on these Toughbooks has to do with sensor data, video that was illegally captured during some of these operations, some of which may be incriminating or classified now,' said Barber. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action Those laptops allegedly contained illegally obtained sensor data from the UAP recovery missions — sensor data that was illegally recorded during UAP recovery missions in violation of top-secret protocols. Barber said the company contracting him was determined to cover up the laptops’ existence. 'We recovered our first two Toughbooks. We got back to our base location and then went through them and took photographs. Then we discovered that the hard drives were missing,' he said. Barber said the next piece of intelligence that came through led them to a lake where they found the hard drives in a sealed steel container 25 feet underwater. 'Yeah, so someone's going through a lot of effort in order to hide these things,' he said. What began as a straightforward recovery mission proved to be anything but simple, and Barber says things soon took a nefarious turn. ‘Things got strange for me’ 'The very next time we went out, things got strange for me. My spidey senses, my intuition, was on high alert because our intel contact changed; the rhythm and style of our intel changed. As we got closer to the day in which we were going to deploy, intelligence kept changing. That raised my concern, but we ended up going anyway. When we got there, the HVTs were gone, and it was clear that shots had been fired,' said Barber. Barber was worried he was in significant danger and possibly being set up. 'We were being prepared for the one thing that we've always offered employers, and that is plausible deniability and that we were perhaps going to be the hidden hand that gets severed,' he said. Bales, a Special Forces veteran who was working on Barber’s team at the time, said he was concerned about a potential setup. 'Yes, setup is a mild term,' Bales said. 'The fact that people have lost their lives involved in this type of activity — and the links to which people have gone to suppress politically uncomfortable truths — is such that there is risk involved.' Barber was convinced his former employer, or someone pretending to be them, was determined to kill him. Barber was then on the hunt, using his skills and vast network of contacts to determine who was behind this shadow war fought over those missing hard drives. He says the trail led him right to the top. Last spring, Barber and his team were in Washington, D.C., conducting surveillance — and eventually confronting — one of their prime suspects. Where are UFOs coming from? 'I reached out to the director of security for the particular organization and a sister organization and set up a meeting with them because there were only two truths in my mind: Either they were complicit, or they were compromised,' he said. Barber said he got in contact with the head of security of his former private aerospace company and was basically told to 'forget it.' 'If he had any knowledge at all, it was clear he was trying to distance himself from it,' said Barber. 'He didn't want to get involved. But he did provide some advice on where we should go.' Barber was no closer to finding out who wanted him dead, but he knew that he was no longer doing the mission he signed up for when he first enlisted. To make it stop, he would need more than his handpicked team: He would need Congress, he would need funding, and he would need to go public. Startling UAP footage Barber says he has been recruiting individuals from within the program and forming a new team in coordination with government agencies. Barber would not name the various agencies he’s recruiting from but hopes to 'very soon.' His Skywatcher Team has already deployed on behalf of the U.S. government to investigate last year’s drone sightings on the East Coast. But before that, they were on the hunt for something even more elusive. In August of 2024, Barber and the Skywatcher Team conducted their own operation, with a psionic asset, to see if they could summon a UAP themselves. The team hoped to quietly gather evidence for Skywatcher but instead found themselves in danger once more. According to the team, Barber says a UAP psychic dogfight erupted in the sky above them. He believes the craft summoned by the team was warring with a rogue UAP piloted by an unknown entity attempting to intercept Skywatcher’s operation. 'And then things got a little weird,' said Barber. 'I'd say, four or five minutes into the operation, (the psionic) goes, ‘Something's going on, something's wrong. Get me out of here.’ And right about that time, our overwatch, Fred, looked up to the sky and saw a disc, a classic lenticular-shape disk.' What Fred Baker and the rest of the team saw was an oval egg — exactly like the one Barber had a previous encounter with. NewsNation has independently obtained video recorded during one of those UAP retrieval operations. The extraordinary footage shows a view from the belly of a helicopter retrieving one of those mysterious eggs. The egg resembles a UAP encountered by U.S. Navy fighters off the East Coast in 2015, suggesting a possible connection between these anomalous objects. Aside from releasing data and footage like this to the public, the Skywatcher Team feels it also has to push the federal government to disclose what it knows about the UAP program — and any criminal activity that may have been perpetrated over the years to keep it secret. NewsNation has confirmed that last fall, Barber met with staffers for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, now Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state. 'I feel I was able to fill in gaps that have been there for a long time that no other whistleblower has been able to do,' Barber said of the meeting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/hfr-uap-recovery-video-egg-shaped-object-exclusive/	2025-01-18T16:54:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/MainbarThumbnail.png?w=900
CDC urges hospitals to fast-track bird flu testing	Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that hospitals speed up testing people who are hospitalized with the flu for H5N1 bird flu. Health care workers in hospitals are urged to perform additional testing on patients hospitalized with influenza A — ideally within 24 hours of admission — to determine whether they have bird flu, according to a CDC advisory issued Thursday. The advisory comes amid concerns that cases of H5N1 avian influenza will sicken more people in the United States. CDC officials confirmed earlier this week that a second San Francisco child contracted bird flu last week, and earlier this month, a 65-year-old Louisiana man became the first person to die from the disease in the United States. FDA proposes putting nutrition labels on the front of packaged foods Principal Deputy Director for the CDC Nirav Shah said the agency is not changing its guidance out of growing concern about the H5N1 bird flu virus. Instead, officials want to speed up an already slow system that runs the risk of becoming backlogged amid a surge in seasonal flu cases. More than 100,000 people have been hospitalized with the flu since October, according to CDC data. Officials said they expect more than 200,000 flu hospitalizations by the end of the winter. There have been 67 confirmed bird flu cases across 10 states since March, with 40 of those cases linked to exposure from infected dairy cows. About two dozen of those cases have been linked to infected poultry and one to a backyard flock of birds. CDC officials said there is still a low risk of contracting H5N1 bird flu and a moderate pandemic risk stemming from the current age of the virus. There are different types of influenza, and H5N1 avian influenza is caused by a kind of influenza A virus, which is a category of flu that also includes most seasonal variants of the virus. Currently, hospitals will occasionally test for influenza in patients who appear to have the virus. Most influenza tests performed in hospitals or other health clinics can show if someone has a seasonal variant of the flu, but they cannot detect bird flu. Many hospitals will test for the H5N1 bird flu variant by sending bulk batches of influenza A samples to public health laboratories every few days, according to Shah. US to hit 2 million annual new cancer cases for the first time 'But this system can take time, and sometimes by the time the results of the subtyping are in, the patient may already be discharged,' said Shah. Hospitals that have the equipment to test for the H5N1 bird flu subtypes are urged to do so in house, as close to the time of admission as possible, particularly for patients with influenza in intensive care units. CDC officials said they are working with hospitals that cannot test for influenza subtypes to connect them with public laboratories that can test influenza samples in real time. The new guidance is one of a few new efforts from the Biden administration to prepare for an H5N1 bird flu pandemic before President-elect Donald Trump takes office later this month. Other efforts include the Department of Agriculture launching a national program to test for bird flu in untreated milk and $211 million in new funding to address emerging infectious diseases.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/cdc-bird-flu-testing-hospitals-cases/	2025-01-18T15:15:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24228761933243-e1728569319445.jpg?w=900
First residents allowed back to communities ravaged by LA fires	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Some residents affected by the Palisades Fire are being allowed to return home and begin taking the first steps on a long road to recovery. Repopulation began Friday afternoon in communities where evacuation orders had been issued and have since been downgraded by officials. As of early Saturday morning, the Palisades Fire was 43% contained. Since erupting on Jan. 7, it has scorched more than 23,000 acres, destroyed thousands of structures in the Pacific Palisades, and led to the deaths of ten people. How to build a budget to help you save in 2025 Simultaneously, the Eaton Fire, which was 73% contained as of publication, reduced thousands of structures to ash and rubble further east in the Altadena area after breaking out on the same day as the Palisades Fire. The fires have killed at least 27 people as of Friday and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in the residential enclaves of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. In the wake of the fires, rents have surged and uncertainty over insurance settlements has left some of the displaced in limbo. The Eaton and Palisades fires that erupted last week have collectively burned almost 4 square miles of highly dense parts of Los Angeles, more than double the urban acreage consumed by the region's Woolsey Fire in 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Silvis Lab at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles said Thursday it expects a 'much-needed break from the fire weather concerns' for the end of this week. However, 'next week is a concern,' the weather service said. 'While confident that we will NOT see a repeat of last week, dangerous fire weather conditions are expected,' the NWS in LA added. A moderate red-flag warning is predicted Monday and Tuesday, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said at a news conference.

Can Donald Trump save TikTok ahead of ban?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump could issue an executive order to save TikTok once he's in office, according to reports. In doing so, it would suspend the enforcement of the ban or sale for 60 to 90 days, buying the new administration time to find a solution. The Supreme Court ruled the social media app would be banned in the U.S. on Jan. 19, a day before Trump’s inauguration, unless the Chinese-owned company was sold. Trump tried to ban it during his first term as president but could be changing his tune on the popular video platform. Trump’s goal is 'perhaps to buy himself more time,' political contributor Dr. Lauren Wright, said on 'NewsNation Live Weekend.' 'That's what I would expect the executive order to do.' Lawmakers first proposed a ban in 2023, claiming it poses a national security threat, alleging the Chinese government could be spying on American users. What happens to TikTok and its users after ban starts Sunday? Wright, who teaches courses on the presidency and executive power at Princeton University, said she concurs the app threatens national security. 'Most Republicans agree on that, but young people are not persuaded by that argument. A lot of them found President Trump on the app, and a ton of small businesses use this, in addition to young people who just really like the app and their favorite social media platform,' Wright said. 'Trump sees the benefits of it, and I'm sure he's getting a lot of pressure from Republicans in Congress … about the very real security concerns.' She said it’s a 'no-brainer' that Trump would move to prevent the ban. In recent weeks, a new Chinese-owned app called RedNote has emerged in popularity. 'There are certainly other potential replacements that China is already flooding the marketplace with that would do the same thing,' Wright said. 'But for a lot of Americans who use (TikTok) every day, it's an economic question and a very real annoyance for them.' Kevin O’Leary says he’s offering $20B cash for TikTok Trump issued an executive order in 2020, claiming the app was capturing mass amounts of information about Americans. A judge blocked this under the Biden administration. So can Trump successfully lift the ban this time? 'He certainly has leverage based on how many Americans voted for him last time around, (and) he has the understanding of the app because it helped his campaign a lot,' Wright said. 'He's reportedly said he has a soft spot for it for that reason,' Wright added. 'He has a direct line to the American people. But I really think if he wants TikTok to go away, all Republicans in government, and there are definitely some Democrats on this side of the argument too, need to articulate more clearly to the American people, what are the risks? What is this doing?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tiktok-ban-potential-executive-order/	2025-01-18T10:09:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67632728725895.04797781.jpeg?w=900
How to build a budget to help you save in 2025	(NewsNation) — With 2025 in full swing, there is no better time to start the year off with less financial stress. Thirty-six percent of Americans owe an average of $1,181 in credit card debt from holiday shopping. Crafting a tailored budget to your financial needs is essential to paying off what you owe -- and avoiding interest. NewsNation spoke with a personal financial expert about how to build a budget. How to save for retirement without a 401(k) 5-step process to building a budget Elizabeth Ayoola with NerdWallet, a financial services company, recommends following a five-step process. Determine your after-tax income. Add up all your income, including side gigs, after taxes to know how much you have to work with each month. Choose a budgeting system. This is not a one-size-fits-all, so try different methods to see which one works best for you. Track your progress. Some may struggle with consistency, so tracking your progress is important to achieve your financial goals. NerdWallet suggests using budgeting apps to track expenses. Automate your savings. Set up an automatic deduction from your checking account to your savings account. You can also automate your bills to deduct from your checking account without having to think about it every month. However, NerdWallet cautions against overdraft fees if you don't have enough in the account. Practice budget management. Update your budget as your lifestyle and financial situation change. If you get a new job, get married, lose income sources, or develop a new health condition, you should review and adjust your budget. List: Budgeting apps that can help you get on track Budgeting methods There are different budgeting methods to follow, from the zero-based budget to the pay-yourself-first budget. What works for one person may not work for the next. For the overspender, Ayoola recommends the zero-based budget system, which involves allocating every dollar to something until your balance reaches zero. 'This can be a little bit meticulous, but the good thing about this system is it really helps you to see where every single dollar is going,' Ayoola said. 'The goal is to get to zero at the end of the month and allocate every single dollar that you have, giving it a home, essentially. So it can be good to track spending expenses and see where all your money is going.' For the person who doesn't want to track every dollar: 'They may try the pay-yourself-first method,' Ayoola said. 'Essentially what this is is you pay yourself first. ... and you put money toward savings, and then you can essentially spend the rest on bills and whatever you want.' Other methods include the envelope system, the no-budget budget, and incremental budgeting. IRS to send $2.4B in unclaimed stimulus payments: Who is eligible? Budgeting tools 'Budgeting apps can be extremely helpful because they can help you do everything from start to finish when it relates to budgeting,' Ayoola said. 'If you know that you're more hands-off and you want something that's not too meticulous, you may also consider using budgeting apps.' Budgeting apps allow you to customize your budget, personalize it to your spending and lifestyle, track your net worth, review educational resources, and track expenses. 'These apps will link to your financial institutions for you to see all of your expenses in one place and also group them into different budgeting categories so you get a clearer picture of where all your money is going,' Ayoola said. NewsNation has compiled a list of budgeting apps you can find here.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/how-to-build-budget-save-2025/	2025-01-18T09:00:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/GettyImages-1403824678-e1717440328367.jpg?w=800
US to hit 2 million annual new cancer cases for the first time	(NewsNation) — The number of cancer cases is expected to cross the two million mark in 2024 — the first time — according to estimates by the American Cancer Society. Just over 2 million new cancer cases are projected from 2024 as more than 611,000 deaths occurred last year, according to the American Cancer Society's yearly report, published Friday in its medical journal 'CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.' That equates to 5,500 daily cancer diagnoses, as cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. overall. Although total cancer rates and death counts are down, the cancer incidence rates for common types are rising. Cancer incidence is the number of new cases per year, usually at a rate per 100,000 people, whereas the number of cancer cases is the total number in a population. 'Rising diagnoses of six of the most common cancers (breast, prostate, endometrial, pancreatic, kidney, and melanoma) threaten that longstanding downward trend,' the report said. Experts attribute the overall decline to reductions in smoking, earlier detection, and improved treatment options. Rising cases in younger people, women For a long time, cancer risk increased with age and was more likely to develop in people older than 65. Now, more people between the ages of 50 and 64 are being diagnosed. And for people younger than 50: 'Especially notable is the rise in colorectal cancer diagnoses among people younger than 50,' the study says. 'In the late 1990s, colorectal cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in this age group, and now, it is the first cause of cancer death in men younger than 50 and the second cause in women that age.' Women are facing an increase in cases, particularly with cervical cancer in women 30 to 44 years old and liver cancer, while racial disparities in diagnoses persist. Because it takes years to compile data, researchers still need to analyze how the pandemic affected cancer statistics.

Mother of woman killed in Eaton Fire sues California utility	NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The mother of a woman who was killed in the Los Angeles-area Eaton Fire on Friday sued Southern California Edison (SCE) in what may be the first death-related case brought against the electric utility in connection with the disaster. Multiple fires that began to burn and quickly spread across Los Angeles in strong Santa Ana wind gusts last week have killed more than two dozen people and charred some 40,000 acres of the second-largest U.S. metro area. While official investigators have not released the cause of the Eaton Fire near Pasadena, SCE has fielded a growing number of lawsuits accusing the utility's equipment of sparking the initial flames. Altadena resident Evelyn Cathirell sued SCE for wrongful death after the remains of her daughter, Evelyn 'Petey' McClendon were found in their shared home after it was destroyed by the blaze. State Farm cancels Super Bowl ad over California wildfires 'Petey's final hours were filled with chaos and panic,' said the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. 'The surroundings were straight out of a disaster movie with embers blowing freely in the wind, spot fires sprouting up in all directions, and a ceaseless wind.' Cathirell's legal action follows multiple lawsuits filed against SCE this week by residents and business owners with destroyed property. Late Thursday night, attorneys for a woman who lost her home in the Los Angeles-area Eaton Fire filed an emergency request for SCE to preserve additional electrical equipment to be examined in blaze investigations, court filings show. Evangeline Iglesias, who is among those suing SCE after her Altadena home was decimated in the inferno, asked the Los Angeles Superior Court to halt efforts by SCE to destroy some distribution lines and other electrical equipment in the burn area, according to court documents. A spokesperson with SCE said the company is focused on restoring power to affected areas. The company said it is aware of lawsuits related to the Eaton Fire and will review them. SCE, which is the main subsidiary of Edison International, previously said it preserved some power equipment to be examined in fire investigations. Wisdom of a California grandmother, 90, goes viral amid Eaton Fire tragedy The law firm representing Iglesias, Edelson PC, said in the filings that SCE told the firm in letters that it planned to imminently remove physical power infrastructure in the burn area unless told specifically which equipment to keep. That level of specificity, Edelson argued in its emergency request to the court, was unreasonable, 'particularly where most or all of that evidence is owned by SCE and where SCE has unique knowledge of the fire's origin and spread,' the filings showed. Multiple investigations into the cause of the Eaton and Palisades fires -- the two most destructive fires in California -- are ongoing.

Mass deportation raids could start in Chicago as soon as Tuesday:...	CHICAGO - Mass deportation raids threatened in Chicago could start as soon as Tuesday, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming border czar Tom Homan have threatened to begin the raids in Chicago in the lead up to the new administration. According to the Wall Street Journal, four people familiar with the planning said on the day after Trump's inauguration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will send 'between 100 and 200 officers' for the operation. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have said the city's law forbids CPD from coordinating with ICE. Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Transit Authority, the Chicago Park District and Community Colleges of Chicago have all been directed not to allow ICE access into any of its buildings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/mass-deportation-raids-could-start-in-chicago-as-soon-as-tuesday-report/	2025-01-18T05:39:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/generic-chicago-flag.jpg?w=900
Engineer Tedesco brothers use retrofitted RV to track UAPs	(NewsNation) — Two brothers are using a mobile field lab tricked out with various forms of technology as they seek out more answers about unidentified anomalous phenomena and other objects flying around the sky. John and Gerry Tedesco have transformed a retrofitted RV into a fully functional laboratory that tracks UAPs, aka UFOs, and other objects. The efforts come as lawmakers and U.S. residents remain frustrated by a lack of answers over a series of drone sightings around the country. The brothers use their lab, which they have called 'The Nightcrawler,' to collect data. SpaceX loses spacecraft after catching rocket booster at the launch pad in latest Starship test The Tedesco brothers are both engineers who use The Nightcrawler to report their findings on UAPs to the FBI. The two men were recently summoned to a Long Island airport where a series of drone sightings have been reported around the Francis Gabreski Airport in recent weeks. Watch NewsNation Saturday at 8 p.m. ET for 'HUNTING UFOS: THE CRASH RETRIEVAL' The brothers provided NewsNation with an exclusive look at the Nightcrawler rolling lab, which includes a specialized camera that includes a 36x optical zoom, night vision and other technology, including Geiger counters, G4 sensors and monitors.

They then compare their data to information associated with commercial and private aircraft that may be in the air at the time. The Nightcrawler’s vertical system can reach up to 70,000 feet into the air to track any moving objects in the sky as well as any radioactive particles that may be in the air. The FBI is said to be looking into the data that the brothers have collected about recent sightings. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to deliver a report on drone sightings around the United States over the past few months shortly after taking office next week. Federal agencies had previously said that drones and other objects spotted in the sky were not the property of the U.S. military or other foreign governments.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/tedesco-brothers-rv-track-ufos/	2025-01-17T12:28:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Nightcrawler.jpg?w=900
Trump inauguration moved indoors due to bitter cold forecast	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration has been moved indoors after forecasts showed bitter cold weather expected for Monday, according to NewsNation's partner The Hill. Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will take the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda as opposed to the usual location at the west front of the Capitol. The forecast for Washington, D.C., shows an expected high in the low 20s on Monday, with a wind chill in the single digits. How to watch Trump’s inauguration on NewsNation That would make it the coldest inauguration on record since President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Reagan also moved his ceremony indoors because of the weather. The change means fewer people will be able to watch the ceremony, which will also be broadcast on TV. On Truth Social, Trump posted that the decision was made because he did not want anyone hurt or injured at the event and said the Capitol One Arena would be open for a live viewing and the inaugural parade. Trump indicated he would join the crowd at the arena for his planned victory rally following his swearing in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-inauguration-indoors/	2025-01-17T09:19:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192426947.jpg?w=900
TikTok ban upheld by Supreme Court	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a law banning TikTok in the United States by Jan. 19 unless it’s sold by Chinese parent company ByteDance. 'There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,' the Supreme Court opinion said. 'But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.' Early in arguments that lasted more than two and a half hours, Chief Justice John Roberts identified his 'main concern': TikTok’s ownership by China-based ByteDance and the parent company's requirement to cooperate with the Chinese government’s intelligence operations. President-elect Donald Trump has indicated he plans to help negotiate a deal to sell the social media platform from ByteDance after his inauguration on Monday. He asked the Supreme Court to pause the ban to give his administration time to negotiate a deal. President Joe Biden said this week he would not enforce a ban if it was upheld. A White House official told NewsNation Thursday, 'it will be up to the next administration to implement.' What happens to your TikTok account? TikTok users who already have the app on their phones will continue to have access to it. But new users won’t be able to download the app and existing ones will no longer be able to receive updates. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings. ByteDance and TikTok have been saying that divestment is not feasible, and that if the ban is allowed to go into effect, the app will effectively go dark. What happens if ByteDance can't find a buyer? If TikTok isn’t sold to an approved buyer, federal law would prohibit app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google, from offering the popular app. It would also bar internet hosting services from hosting TikTok. Why was TikTok facing a ban? President Joe Biden signed a law last April stating that ByteDance, which owns TikTok and is based in China, had a Jan. 19 deadline to sell the platform to an approved buyer or face being banned in the U.S. U.S. officials argued that the vast amounts of user data that TikTok collects, including sensitive information on viewing habits, could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. They were also concerned that the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who could pressure ByteDance to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. TikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. The law came under a larger foreign aid package called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. TikTok has been fighting the law ever since. What did Tiktok say about the ban? TikTok and ByteDance — along with some content creators and users — argued the law violates constitutionally protected free speech rights. 'Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free speech case that matters to so many people,' lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. TikTok said in previous court briefs that a ban 'will silence the speech of applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts and other matters of public concern.' The platform also contends it operates separately from its Chinese parent company and will not be subject to pressure from the American adversary. TikTok embattled in legal challenges all over the world With billions of users spanning the globe, concerns around TikTok have sparked in several countries. The company faces outright or partial bans in at least 20 nations, The New York Times reported. India banned the app in 2020 as tense relations with China exploded into combat along their shared border, the Times reported. Nepal took TikTok offline for nearly a year for not shutting down content the government described as hate speech, according to the Times.

Live updates: Kristi Noem has confirmation hearing; Senate holds ...	South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R), President-elect Trump's pick to head the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is set to appear for her confirmation hearing before a Senate panel on Friday. The purview of DHS involves immigration and federal emergency management — two hot-button topics. Immigration was one of Trump's signature issues and has been a top priority for Republicans in the new Congress, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which falls under DHS, has been in the spotlight since Hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated the southeastern U.S. and historic fires broke out in California. Also on Friday, the Senate is poised to vote on cloture for the Laken Riley Act, an immigration bill that has split Democrats. The measure, named after a Georgia college student who was killed in February by a man who had crossed into the U.S. without permission, would mandate federal detention of immigrants without legal status accused of theft, burglary and other related crimes. It is poised to be the first bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, but has also earned the support of a number of Democrats in both chambers.

Armed California resident keeps watch for looters during wildfire...	(NewsNation) — Officials say they are making progress fighting the Los Angeles-area wildfires that started last week. However, problems still linger, not only for the thousands who have lost everything in the fires but also for those whose homes and businesses are still standing. About 82,000 people are under evacuation orders. Some California residents are defying those orders to protect their property, as well as that of their neighbors. Mel Gibson: They didn’t tell LA firefighters ‘the reservoir is empty’ One woman who talked to NewsNation said she is going into her neighbor's houses and cleaning out refrigerators so they won't smell. Altadena resident EveAnna Manley is keeping herself armed in an attempt to scare looters away. 'To be looting during a natural disaster is the lowest form of human behavior,' Manley said. Manley has a sign in her yard that warns: 'If you are looting, we are shooting.' What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency 'It's a bit of a joke, but it's to remind someone — please don't just steal my freaking Starlink,' Manley told NewsNation. 'I know what the laws are as well, and I'm trying to make sure I'm always legal with my firearm control.' Authorities have made multiple looting arrests. On Monday, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced charges against 10 people in four separate incidents during the wildfires’ onset. Two people were charged with first-degree residential burglary, looting and grand theft for allegedly stealing over $200,000. Security has been heightened in the areas hit by wildfires, with people having to go through several different checkpoints to get through the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/wildfire-looting-residents-fight-back/	2025-01-16T11:56:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25010617515175.jpg?w=900
Drone sightings over Long Island airport spark concerns	(NewsNation) — Repeated drone sightings over a Long Island airport have prompted local law enforcement officials to turn to technology to determine who may be behind the mysterious objects. Officials have reported an unusually high number of drone sightings near Francis Gabreski Airport in Suffolk County in recent weeks. The sightings have taken place in highly sensitive areas, including over runways and in restricted air space. That has prompted investigators to turn to Dedrone, a highly sophisticated detection system that uses radar, cameras and artificial intelligence to pinpoint drones in real time. Watch NewsNation’s TV special: 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' on Saturday, Jan. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. The airport is also home to the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York Air National Guard, which has increased concerns over the sightings. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to make drones a priority, saying he would issue a report on the objects soon after taking office. David Lynch, ‘Twin Peaks’ creator and filmmaker, dies at 78 Christopher Brockmeyer, the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office chief deputy chief, said officials will use the drone detection technology to get to the bottom of the sightings around the airport property. 'We’re going to use that information to potentially go and knock on doors and locate the actual operator and have a conversation as to what they’re doing,' Brockmeyer said. Officials from the airport and the Air National Guard told NewsNation some of the drone sightings involved objects as large as cars. On Christmas Day, officials reported 17 different sightings at the airport.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/drones-long-island-airport/	2025-01-16T11:29:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2189936159_bdca8a-e1734653140947.jpg?w=800
LAFD officials demand chief's ouster for wildfires mismanagement	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley has come under attack for her handling of the deadly wildfires. Several current and former LAFD battalion chiefs and administrators are calling for her retirement. In a scathing five-page letter obtained by NewsNation, the group puts the number of fatalities and the loss of property at Crowley’s feet and says her retirement 'would be best for the citizens of Los Angeles' and members of the department. Crowley told Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass that nearly $18 million in budget cuts within the department’s budget would affect its ability to respond to emergencies. In a memo to the mayor, Crowley wrote that the cuts 'has severely limited the department’s capacity to train for and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires,' NBC Los Angeles reported. UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive An LAFD memo shows that Bass had requested an additional $48.8 million in budget cuts and indicated that 16 fire stations would need to close as part of the cuts. In the letter, which was sent on Monday, the group referred to Crowley’s comments regarding budget cuts as 'ill-advised and poorly timed' and took attention away from the efforts being made to control the wildfires, which have claimed at least 25 lives. 'When this incident is over, there will be time for investigations, after action reviews, reflection and of course, finger-pointing and the placement of blame, which apparently you have already started,' the letter states. FILE_4779Download Sources told NewsNation that a group of around 100 fire chiefs and former chiefs have received the letter, as has Crowley. The group wrote that the lack of experience, arrogance and inability to manage and lead the department contributed to its failings in dealing with the Palisades fire. The letter claims Crowley, who took office in March 2022, was aware of LAFD budget issues before taking office. The group of chiefs and former chiefs wrote that Crowley 'went along' with the budget cuts, which are now coming back to haunt the chief. The group blames Crowley for ignoring preventative systems and mechanisms previously put into place to deal with the current wildfires. The letter also blames Crowley for her lack of response in evacuating residents from residential neighborhoods affected by the fires. The chiefs wrote it is LAFD’s responsibility to support and assist with evacuation efforts. That did not happen in this case, the group wrote. 'As harsh as this sounds, the horrific truth is that you and your command staff own this terrible loss of light,' the letter states. Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire? John Knox, a 23-year LAFD veteran who was fired in 2021 for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, told NewsNation that he describes the situation as a 'complete and utter lack of leadership.' Knox told NewsNation that a lack of pre-deployment when the city knew about the looming catastrophe was a failure on the chief’s part. He also said department officials suspended the testing of hydrants due to budget cuts. The letter criticizing the chief's leadership comes as questions continue as to why local reservoirs were empty as firefighters began to battle the sweeping fires. For instance, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which is a 117-million-gallon water resource near Pacific Palisades was empty and undergoing renovations when the fires began. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an investigation into why the reservoir was empty and told reporters that all of the region's reservoirs were operating and full. However, data from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power show that five other reservoirs are currently empty. The reservoir issue has already led to one lawsuit being filed, the Associated Press reported. The group also pointed to several critical issues under Crowley’s watch that the chief has ignored or failed to resolve. Among those were a lack of mechanics and support personnel; multiple lawsuits by females, minorities and command officers related to retaliation, harassment and hostile work environment issues; as well as extreme call load and work issues. The group said Crowley did nothing to put mechanisms in place that dealt with a large exodus of experienced fire service professionals. The letter states that more than 125 senior-level chief officers have retired in the last year. The letter states that many of those who left the department were veterans of wildfires who would have been beneficial in dealing with the current fires burning around Los Angeles County. 'While no one is saying that this fire could have been stopped, there is no doubt among all of us that if you had done things right and prepared the LAFD for an incident of this magnitude, fatalities would have been reduced, and property would have been saved,' the group wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/lafd-chief-attack-deadly-wildfires/	2025-01-16T09:33:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25011203379482.jpg?w=900
Live: Lawmakers host hearing over Trump's 'Remain in Mexico' poli...	(NewsNation) — Less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump is set to enter the White House for his second non-consecutive term, senate lawmakers are hosting a hearing about his controversial 'Remain in Mexico' immigration policy. During his first term, Trump implemented the policy, also called 'Migration Protection Protocols,' which required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their claims were processed. Democratic President Joe Biden's administration ended it in 2022. In the 2024 election, Trump said he plans to reinstate the 'Remain in Mexico' policy and start other hard-line immigration measures such as mass deportations. What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the Republican chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also said he would immediately take up the matter. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing is set to start at 9 a.m. ET. Those testifying include Kenneth Cuccinelli, a former senior official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies and Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight for The Washington Office on Latin America. Lutheran Social Services, an immigration relief and refugee welcome agency, in a statement ahead of the hearing, criticized 'Remain in Mexico' as a stark departure from longstanding U.S. asylum procedures and protections. When it was in effect, 'families and individuals faced dangerous and unsafe conditions, including violence, exploitation, and inadequate essential services like healthcare, education, and housing' in northern Mexico, Lutheran Social Services said. The American Civil Liberties Union challenged 'Remain in Mexico,' saying it left 'vulnerable asylum seekers stranded.' 'The Migration Protection Protocols (MPP) policy was one of the most abusive and egregious of President Trump’s attacks on the asylum system, exposing vulnerable people to violence and murder,' the ACLU said in a statement to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 'The policy was a boon to organized crime in Mexico and inflicted horrendous and lasting harm on asylum seekers, including their minor children.'

Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefir...	Two Americans, Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, are expected to be released as part of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal that emerged Wednesday after being held for 15-months by Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza, according to a senior administration official. The deal includes the release or older males and those who were wounded on Oct. 7, of which Seigel and Dekel-Chen apply. The first phase in total includes the release of hostages that are women, elderly males and the sick and wounded. The third American being held by Hamas, Edan Alexander, is a 21-year-old American-Israeli who served in the IDF. Uniform soldiers are part of the second phase of the deal. The official said that they spoke with Alexander’s father last night and are committed to getting Edan out. 'We will see — and I don’t want to say until we actually see them — but Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen will come out in the first day and Edan will come out of Gaza, no doubt about it,' the official said. The administration is in regular contact with the families of the Americans being held and are 'committed' to getting them all out, whether they are living or not, according to the official. Wednesday’s deal largely aligns with a multiphase proposal President Biden first put forward in late May, which included the release of American hostages, remains of hostages who were killed and a surge in humanitarian assistance during the first phase. Biden had announced that Americans would be released in the initial six-week phase earlier on Wednesday. 'I’m proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well, and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home,' the president said. The official told reporters that the administration didn’t have full confidence that a deal would come together until 'late this afternoon' in the Middle East, saying that Hamas tried to bring up more issues this morning and the U.S. 'held the line on that.' The official also gave credit to President-elect Trump’s team for their help in the hostage deal negotiations, saying that Biden’s Mideast negotiator Brett McGurk and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff were both pivotal in the 'last 96 hours.' 'Steve and Brett have been talking regularly about the process, Brett has been keeping Steve fully informed,' the official said. When asked if the hostage deal would have happened if Trump wasn’t elected in November, noting that the first group of hostages will be released the day before Trump’s swearing in, officials said 'any negotiation, any breakthrough diplomacy, sometimes we just need a deadline.' Trump on Wednesday claimed the credit for himself, saying a deal would not have happened without his victory in November. Meanwhile, Biden replied, 'Is that a joke?' when asked by a reporter whether he or Trump would get credit for the deal.

Families of hostages grateful but cautious about ceasefire deal	(NewsNation) — With the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal expected to begin Sunday, the families of hostages are hoping to once again see their loved ones in front of them. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal that could see the first release of American hostages within days, as part of a broader agreement to free 33 captives during a 42-day pause in fighting. The deal, which awaits approval from Israel's security Cabinet in a Thursday vote, would include the release of two Americans — Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen — in its first phase, according to a senior administration official. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal Of the seven Americans believed held by Hamas, only three are presumed alive. The third, 21-year-old American-Israeli Edan Alexander, a former IDF soldier, would be part of a second phase of releases. In exchange, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, following a pattern seen in previous hostage negotiations. Phase three calls for the return of the bodies of remaining hostages and the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which is largely devastated and faces decades of rebuilding. After 466 days in captivity, it remains unclear how many of the approximately 100 hostages still held by Hamas are alive. Officials estimate more than a third of all hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack have died. For families of the hostages, the wait continues. While some may soon reunite with their loved ones, others face the grim possibility of receiving confirmation of deaths during captivity.

(The Hostages Families Forum via AP) Jonathan Dekel-Chen revealed his son Sagui, held captive since Oct. 7, may not even know he has a new daughter, born two months after his capture. 'I simply do not know if Sagui even knows that his family survived the massacre,' Dekel-Chen said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' His 36-year-old son is among those expected to be freed in the first phase of releases. 'I will feel joy when Sagui is able to embrace his little girls,' Dekel-Chen said. The last confirmed proof of life for Sagui came over a year ago, when released hostages reported briefly encountering him wounded but alive in Hamas tunnels beneath Gaza. 'When he does emerge from that ambulance, we will embrace him in all meanings of the word and help him in all ways necessary to rebuild his life,' Dekel-Chen said while tempering his optimism about his son's condition after 466 days in captivity. While grateful for his son's expected release, Dekel-Chen said that many hostages remain in what he called 'hell holes' under Gaza, including 29 from his own Kibbutz Nir Oz. Some of those captives, he learned, were subsequently killed by Hamas. 'We cannot leave a single hostage behind,' he said. What happens to the hostages in Gaza after ceasefire deal? Omer Neutra's parents hope for a 'proper burial' The parents of a deceased American hostage called the ceasefire 'a deal with the devil' while supporting the necessary compromise to bring home the remaining captives. 'This is not a good deal,' said Ronen Neutra, whose 21-year-old son Omer was confirmed dead after 422 days in captivity. 'But on October 7, 2023, they took 250 people out of their beds… and unfortunately, we have to do a deal with the devil.' Omer Neutra, a first responder who rushed to defend Israeli villages during the October attacks, was among the 98 hostages still in Gaza. His parents learned of his death last month after advocating for his release at the Republican National Convention and in meetings with President Joe Biden. His mother, Orna Neutra, described 'mixed emotions' about the agreement. While supporting the deal, the Neutras now fight for a different outcome — the return of their son's body for 'proper burial.' The parents praised the bipartisan cooperation between the outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump's team in securing the agreement. 'There's no daylight between the two teams,' Orna Neutra said, noting both administrations helped push the deal forward.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/families-hostages-ceasefire-deal-reaction/	2025-01-15T16:41:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot_61eeee.jpg?w=900
Whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclu...	(NewsNation) — A U.S. Air Force veteran believes he was involved in the recovery of alien technology while working for a long-rumored secret UFO retrieval program. In an exclusive interview with NewsNation, whistleblower Jake Barber said he has contracted as a helicopter pilot to retrieve all kinds of downed craft, some of which he believes are of nonhuman origin. 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. 'It was not human.' Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims Watch the full interview during NewsNation's TV special: 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' on Saturday, Jan. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. When asked to describe the object, Barber said: 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' He added: 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.' Other whstleblowers, including Lue Elizondo and David Grusch, have alleged a secret government UFO program exists but Barber says he knows it's true because he's part of it. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs 'Over the last couple years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence) and it was not a unique experience,' Barber said. Three high-level military veterans are backing up Barber's story, on the record and on-camera to NewsNation. NewsNation has also obtained exclusive, never-before-seen video of one of these alleged UFO crash retrievals.

Los Angeles fire captain loses home to Eaton Fire	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — A man tasked with protecting the Los Angeles area from raging wildfires now ranks among those who have lost their homes and everything inside. Capt. Al Hugo, a 32-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department, lived in his Altadena home with his wife, Carmen, for 20 years. As the Eaton Fire ignited on Jan. 7, the fast-moving blaze eventually reached Hugo’s neighborhood. LA-area wildfires: At least 25 have died as winds strengthen He and his wife quickly evacuated with their four dogs, leaving their belongings behind. Although wildfires have threatened his community before, he said the flames had never reached his neighborhood until now. The next day, the family learned their home was completely destroyed by the fire. 'It was surreal,' Hugo told Nexstar's KTLA. 'It's painful because you’ve [spent] a lot of time there. I’ve been there for 20 years so I got a lot of memories and a lot of mementos that we lost, but I’m just thankful that my family and my pets are good.'

Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump celebrated the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal on Wednesday and said it wouldn't have happened if not for his win in the 2024 election. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.' Israel-Hamas hostage deal The deal, which will see 33 Israeli hostages freed and pause the war, comes after more than 15 months of fighting. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal In his post, Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue 'to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.' Witkoff had joined Biden’s Mideast adviser Brett McGurk for the recent round of talks in Doha, the Qatari capital. A senior U.S. official described McGurk and Witkoff’s coordination as a fruitful partnership, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, outgoing President Joe Biden emphasized his role in getting the deal done, telling reporters: 'This is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May.' When asked how much he credits the Trump team, Biden said: 'I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do.' Israel-Hamas ceasefire comes days before Trump's inauguration The ceasefire comes just days before Trump is set to begin his second term. Last week, Trump warned all hell would break loose if Hamas didn't release the Israeli hostages before his inauguration, though it's unclear how much that threat tipped the scale. What happens to Israeli hostages now? One diplomat who was briefed on the negotiations did credit progress in the talks, in part, to Trump's influence, saying it was 'the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal,' according to the Washington Post. The New York Times said Trump's election win and his team's work were, according to multiple people, a factor in the deal getting done. Jonathan Panikoff, director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told the AP the deal shows how powerful foreign policy can be when it's bipartisan. 'Both the outgoing and incoming administration deserve credit for this deal and it would’ve been far less likely to happen without both pushing for it,' he said. Biden cheered the agreement in remarks Wednesday, chalking it up to 'dogged and painstaking American diplomacy.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next	(NewsNation) —A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was reached Wednesday after more than a year of negotiations and is expected to be carried out in three phases beginning Sunday. Qatar, acting as an intermediary, and President Joe Biden heavily pushed the two sides to reach an agreement that would secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. 'This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,' Biden said in a statement. What happens to Israeli hostages now? Biden said the ceasefire deal was the same one he introduced to both sides in May 2024. 'The road to this deal was not easy,' Biden said during a news conference announcing the deal. 'This is one of the toughest negotiations I’ve ever experienced.' President-elect Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Qatar for discussions. Trump celebrated the deal on Truth Social, taking credit for its success and saying it would not have happened if he had not won in November. Phase one of the ceasefire deal Phase one of the ceasefire deal is expected to take place over a six-week timeframe. Thirty-three Israeli hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas in 2023 will be returned under the first phase of the deal. These hostages include women, children, people over the age of 50 and the sick or injured, which were given special focus under the deal which passed after more than a year of negotiations, Qatar’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Wednesday. In return, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The remaining American hostages are also expected to be released in the initial phase of the ceasefire deal, a U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal Phase one also includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza. Palestinian civilians will be allowed to return to their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, and humanitarian aid will begin to flow into the Strip, Biden said. 'The surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin, and innocent people can have greater access to these vital supplies,' he said. Hamas and Israel will begin negotiations for phase two in these six weeks, he added. There are still a number of negotiations that need to take place before phase two can be mapped out, but if the negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue as long as talks are ongoing, Biden said. Phase two of the ceasefire deal Biden said phase two would be a 'permanent end of the war,' where a temporary ceasefire would become a permanent one. Phase two will consist of the return of the remaining living Israeli hostages, including male soldiers. All remaining Israeli forces would also withdraw from Gaza under this phase, he said. Phase three of the ceasefire deal The third phase is expected to address the handing over of the remaining bodies of dead hostages and the start of Gaza’s reconstruction, according to Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ceasefire-deal-timeline/	2025-01-15T12:04:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/bidenjoe_112624gn16_w.jpg?w=900
Details need to be addressed in Israel-Hamas ceasefire	(NewsNation) — Negotiations involving a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have been ongoing for more than a year, but nearing an actual agreement has never been this close to bringing 15 months of fighting to an end. But before a ceasefire is officially declared, several details still need to be addressed, Ret. U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen, Richard Newton told NewsNation. 'I believe we’re on a path to have at least an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but nothing is final at this point,' Newton, a senior NewsNation contributor, said on Wednesday. What happens to Israeli hostages now? There are still several implementation details to be ironed out before the ceasefire is finalized. This will include exactly how Israeli hostages will be released as well as how Palestinians are released from jail and where they will be sent, Newton said. Other issues include the flow of humanitarian aid and who will control that flow into Gaza. 'There are many details we need to have sorted out here,' Newton said, adding, 'But we are still a long way out from the end of what will be, at least through the first phase of what we think is going to be a deal.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government officials still need to sign off on the ceasefire. Newton said that Netanyahu is 'setting the conditions' for the ceasefire, but that Monday’s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump may have emboldened the prime minister to act. 'The emphasis is on Israel and the emphasis is on who’s leading this effort — not Hamas, but Prime Minister Netanyahu,' Newton said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/details-addressed-israel-hamas-ceasefire/	2025-01-15T11:44:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771c6185c5905.15866153.jpeg?w=900
Biden to outline accomplishments in farewell address	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden is expected to outline the accomplishments of his four years in the White House during a farewell address to the nation Wednesday night. The reported ceasefire announced between Israel and Hamas will most likely change the tenor of the prime-time address, on which White House officials said Biden will work until the last minute to finalize. The speech was originally set to reflect on Biden’s presidency as well as the moment in which the country finds itself as President-elect Donald Trump takes office next week. White House officials said the address will not include 'a laundry list' of Biden’s accomplishments as president but rather an overview of the time since Biden took office in 2021. What happens to Israeli hostages now? In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden said the country has the strongest economy in the world after his administration created a record 16.6 million jobs. He also said inflation continues to come down while the racial cap is the lowest it has been in 20 years. 'I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake,' Biden wrote. 'The very nature of who we are was at stake. And, that’s still the case.' Biden called serving the U.S. for more than 50 years the 'privilege of my life' and wrote he has 'been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.' 'History is in your hands,' Biden wrote. 'The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep the faith and remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there is simply nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.' What to make of the final polling of the Biden years Biden is also expected to address his future plans and those of the Democratic Party, which lost control of the U.S. Senate as well as the White House in November. The Republicans also maintain control of the U.S. House as Trump begins his second term as president. Biden is considering taking additional actions as president before Trump assumes control of the White House on Monday. Biden, who commuted about 1,500 sentences in December, is said to be considering more pardons and executive orders, which could be difficult for Trump to undo once he takes office. Biden issued 39 presidential pardons to Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes; several were issued to people who have already been released from prison. Among the pardons issued was one for Biden’s son, Hunter, who the president previously said he would not pardon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-accomplishments-farewell-address/	2025-01-15T11:02:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192231820.jpg?w=900
Malibu mayor: No expedited re-entry permits for evacuation zones	(NewsNation) — Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart on Facebook debunked a false claim that the city is giving out expedited re-entry permits into evacuation zones as wildfires continue blazing in southern California. At least 25 people have died in the fires that started last week, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service because high winds are expected to cause extreme fire weather. About 88,000 people are under evacuation orders because of the fires. What Trump said he will do on Day 1 'I want to assure you that city staff have been working around the clock alongside our partners to respond to this historic and unprecedented event,' Stewart said in a letter to Malibu residents. This work includes inspecting infrastructure, clearing streets of debris, assisting with damage assessments and stabilizing the area to pave the way for safe re-entry and rebuilding, Stewart said. 'We ask for your patience and understanding as our teams — along with law enforcement, fire crews, and utility providers — continue this vital work,' Stewart said. While some residents have hired private contractors who requested access to the evacuation zones, Stewart said they are not permitted to go in them at this time. 'We urge all residents to adhere to the evacuation orders for their safety and the safety of the crews working in these areas,' he said. 'To our residents, I want to acknowledge the frustration and hardship you are experiencing. Many of you are understandably anxious to return to your homes. We hear you, and we are doing everything in our power to make that happen as quickly and safely as possible.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/malibu-mayor-no-re-entry-permits-evacuation-zones/	2025-01-15T10:39:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25013163967406.jpg?w=900

War between Israel and Hamas On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas took approximately 240 civilians and soldiers hostage during the attack in Southern Israel. Hamas released around 100 hostages during a negotiated pause in fighting. A total of 70 hostages have died, the Wall Street Journal reported. Human rights organizations have warned of a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which has long been blockaded with civilians unable to flee the area.

Rubio to say he'll put US interests 'above all else' at hearing	(NewsNation) — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio will say at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that as part of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, he will place American interests 'above all else.' 'Placing our core national interests above all else is not isolationism,' Rubio will tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. 'It is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our national interest is not some outdated relic.' 'The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us,' Rubio is set to say in the opening statement. What Trump said he will do on Day 1 Rubio's confirmation is expected to go smoother than other Trump cabinet picks such as Fox News host Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, Trump's choice for defense secretary, faced questions over allegations of sexual assault, excessive drinking and his divisive views on women in combat and minorities. On the other hand, Rubio has gotten bipartisan support, including from Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said he plans to vote yes on his nomination. 'I believe Senator Rubio has a thorough understanding of the United States’ role on an international scale, has served with honor on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and is a good choice to lead the State Department,' Durbin said Monday, noting the two share similar views on issues such as the 'continued threat of China' and 'recent sham election in Venezuela.' Born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, Rubio would be the first Latino to serve as Secretary of State if confirmed. While serving in the Florida legislature, Rubio was the first Cuban American to act as the state's speaker of the House. After his election to the U.S. Senate in 2011, Rubio unsuccessfully ran to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016. Although he once had a combative history with Trump, Rubio has since positioned himself as an ally of the president-elect.

Pam Bondi, Trump's AG nominee, faces Senate hearing	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general, will face questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. She is expected to face tough questions about her loyalty to Trump, who has pledged to use the Department of Justice to target his perceived political enemies. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, will likely be one of the most closely watched Cabinet members as Democrats express concerns that Trump may attempt to bend the DOJ to his will. Bondi's hearing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET. Senate hearings are scheduled this week for Trump's picks for more than a dozen top administrative positions. Democrats’ hopes of derailing Trump nominees fading fast Who is Pam Bondi? Bondi was a prosecutor for nearly two decades in the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office before becoming Florida’s first female attorney general in 2010. She served as Florida’s attorney general for eight years. She campaigned for the state’s top legal office by challenging then-President Barack Obama’s signature health care law and calling for her state to adopt Arizona’s controversial 'show me your papers' immigration law. As attorney general in Florida from 2011 to 2019, Bondi was vocal on human trafficking issues and urged tightening state laws against traffickers. After that, she worked as a lobbyist for Ballard Partners. How will the Pentagon change under new Trump administration? In addition, Bondi represented KGL Investment Company KSCC, a Kuwaiti firm also known as KGLI. She lobbied the White House, National Security Council, State Department and Congress on immigration policy, human rights and economic sanctions issues, the Associated Press reported. Sources tell NewsNation that Bondi is trusted by Trump and that she spends time at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump’s first impeachment defense team when he was accused in 2020 of abuse of power for allegedly pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Trump was ultimately not convicted.

Border billboards warn against unregulated cabbies, rideshare dri...	SAN DIEGO (Border Report) — Billboards warning people — especially women — not to accept rides from unregulated drivers went up a few weeks ago near the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry. They show a worried woman holding a suitcase while a driver in a parked car extends his arm offering her a ride. The messaging is in Spanish telling people not to accept the rides and not 'to play with their lives.' Since 2023, these drivers, called 'wildcatters,' or raiteros in Spanish, have become entrenched outside pedestrian border crossings. San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, the Metropolitan Transit System and other agencies have launched a public campaign warning people against these 'wildcatters,' calling them 'unregulated and unpermitted ride-sharing services.' 4-year-old migrant found alone at the border reunites with mother After a number of complaints from citizens and cab drivers who say the wildcatters are taking business away from them, Stephan got involved. 'It is simply dangerous and unsafe to have passengers transported in a vehicle that is often uninsured, with an unlicensed driver with an unknown background check,' Stephan said back in November. The billboards themselves have been up for only a few weeks. 'We have received reports of exploitation for human trafficking where vulnerable women are in these cars,' Stephan said. 'Protecting the safety of San Diego County residents, commuters and others who cross the border falls squarely in our mission of preventing crime. We are also working closely with our law enforcement and transportation partners to hold those who are not authorized to offer this type of service accountable for their crimes.' Stephan said the campaign is all about public education and awareness. 'We want to empower passengers to understand the difference between an unlicensed driver and a legitimate taxicab or ride-sharing vehicles,' she said. Offering rides for a fee is against the law and carries penalties. 'It is a misdemeanor that carries jail time and it also carries a fine of up to $500,' Stephan said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-billboards-warn-unregulated-cabbies-rideshare-drivers/	2025-01-15T03:14:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/wildcatter-billboard.png?w=537
Particularly Dangerous Situation' forecast for fire-scarred Los ...	LOS ANGELES (NEXSTAR) — Millions of Southern Californians were on edge as a final round of dangerous fire weather was forecast for the region on Wednesday, along with a rare warning of a 'Particularly Dangerous Situation' for an area near where two massive blazes have killed at least 25 and destroyed thousands of homes. Updates: Containment grows on Palisades, Eaton fires; winds return Disabled Eaton Fire victim escaped deadly flames in wheelchair Firefighters got a reprieve Tuesday when winds were unexpectedly light and they were able to make progress battling the two huge Los Angeles area fires and quickly snuff out several new fires. The Eaton Fire burning just north of Los Angeles and the Palisades Fire that destroyed much of the seaside LA neighborhood of Pacific Palisades broke out Jan. 7 in conditions similar to what’s expected Wednesday. High winds last week pushed flames at remarkable speed and carried fire-sparking embers sometimes miles away. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings – done when temperatures are warm, humidity is low and strong winds are expected – from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. from the Central Coast 275 miles (443 kilometers) south to the border with Mexico. The 'Particularly Dangerous Situation' was in effect for an area that includes parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 'Key message: We are not out of the woods yet,' the weather service said in a post late Tuesday. 'The winds underperformed today, but one more enhancement could happen tonight-tomorrow.' The devastation of the Palisades Fire is seen at sunset in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Ethan Swope) More than 77,000 households were without electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes. A state of alert Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice. They remained vigilant, keeping an eye on the skies and on each other: Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes. Of those, three people were arrested on suspicion of arson after being seen setting small fires that were immediately extinguished, LA Police Chief Jim McDonnell said. One was using a barbecue lighter, another ignited brush and a third tried to light a trash can, he said. All were far outside the disaster zones. Authorities have not determined a cause for any of the major fires. Among nine people charged with looting was a group that stole an Emmy award from an evacuated house, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said. The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds. Now backed by firefighters from other states, Canada and Mexico, crews were deployed to attack flareups or new blazes. The firefighting force was much bigger than a week ago, when the first wave of fires began destroying thousands of homes in what could become the nation's costliest fire disaster. Kaylin Johnson and her family planned to spend the night at their home, one of the few left standing in Altadena, near Pasadena. They intended to keep watch to ward off looting and to hose down the house and her neighbors’ properties to prevent flareups. 'Our lives have been put on hold indefinitely,' Johnson said via text message, adding that they cannot freely come and go because of restrictions on entering the burn areas. 'But I would rather be here and not leave than to not be allowed back at all.' Packed and ready to go Residents said they were ready to make a hasty escape. Javier Vega, who said he feels like he has been 'sleeping with one eye open,' and his girlfriend have planned out how they can quickly pack up their two cats, eight fish and leopard gecko if they get orders to evacuate. 'Typically on any other night, hearing helicopters flying overhead from midnight to 4:00 in the morning, that would drive anyone crazy,' Vega said. But figuring they were helping firefighters to keep the flames from threatening their neighborhood, he explained, 'it was actually soothing for me to go to sleep.' Preparing for another outbreak Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals, while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials who were criticized over their initial response expressed confidence that the region is ready to face the new threat. The mayor said she was able to fly over the disaster areas, which she described as resembling the aftermath of a 'dry hurricane.' Winds this time were not expected to reach the same fierce speeds seen last week but they could ground firefighting aircraft, LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. He urged homeless people to avoid starting fires for warmth and to seek shelter. Wildfires on the rise across LA With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area. Firefighters have jumped on small blazes that popped up, quickly smothering several in Los Angeles county, including a blaze Tuesday evening in the Angeles National Forest. The four largest fires around the nation’s second-biggest city have scorched more than 63 square miles (163 square kilometers), roughly three times the size of Manhattan. Of these, the Eaton Fire near Pasadena was roughly one-third contained, while the largest blaze, in Pacific Palisades on the coast, was far less contained. Searching for victims The death toll is likely to rise, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna. Nearly 30 people were still missing, he said Tuesday. Some people reported as missing earlier have been found. Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. The process of locating and identifying the deceased remains slow, with some of the victims still in the location where they died. In many cases, this is because investigators are still unable to access certain areas due to the dangers left behind by the wildfire, like gas leaks, smoldering debris and unstable structures. Another hurdle for the DME’s office is that normal identification processes, such as visual identification and fingerprinting, may not be available to investigators. Of the 25 deceased, 17 died in the Eaton Fire and 8 in the Palisades Fire. While the medical examiner’s office has publicly identified several of the victims, the others have been identified by family members or friends.

Wildfire smoke's long-term health effects, explained	(NewsNation) — Fires in the Los Angeles area have stretched across tens of thousands of acres, spreading smoke and ash throughout Southern California. Breathing in smoke, which contains tiny particles called PM2.5, can spread chemicals, dust, soot and metals throughout the human body. In short doses, smoke exposure has been linked to premature death, hospital admissions, bronchitis, asthma attacks and other respiratory and cardiac problems, the California Air Resources Board said. And long-term exposure can cause another host of issues, Dr. Lipi Roy tells NewsNation. How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke Wildfire smoke's long-term health effects Roy warned that long-term exposure can lead to dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and lung cancer, among other diseases. The World Health Organization associates 7 million premature deaths annually to indoor and outdoor air pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency says there aren't enough studies to accurately link long-term wildfire smoke exposure over multiple seasons to specific diseases, though short-term and cumulative short-term exposure can cause myriad problems. Los Angeles wildfire survivors describe ‘hellscape’ they left behind Smoke exposure can especially pose a problem when the smoke comes from urban areas with more than just vegetation to burn, Roy said. 'Houses have paint, rubber, metal, steel. When those burn, they release really toxic fumes and ash,' Roy explained. Particle pollution also triggers asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes and can cause death, according to the American Lung Association. People at the highest risk — children, the elderly, those with respiratory or heart conditions and people with compromised immune systems — may experience more severe effects, such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, fatigue and/or chest pain. How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke The best way to protect yourself from wildfire smoke is to get far away from the source. If movement isn’t an option, it’s best to stay indoors and limit any outdoor activity. Inside, make sure your doors and windows are tightly closed and sealed. An air filter or HVAC system with air filters can help maintain healthy indoor air quality, and portable air purifiers can help, as well, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s important to run your fan the entire time; otherwise, the air will only be filtered when cooling. If your system operates using a fresh air intake, close it. If you have to stay outside, wearing an N95 respirator mask and taking frequent breaks is crucial for your well-being.

Jay Leno feeds LA’s first responders: ‘They’re great men and wome...	(NewsNation) — Comedian Jay Leno's goal is simple: Feed the people who are 'there to save your life' amid raging fires in the Los Angeles area. The legendary late night talk show host, 74, cooked up more than $21,000 worth of ribs, chicken and more for the first responders who spent the past week battling flames in Southern California. 'My God, these guys can eat. They went through the whole thing. We need more food,' Leno said. 'So we got more food today. Got more food tomorrow, more food Thursday.' LA wildfire victims contend with price-gouged rental prices Leno likened the Los Angeles Fire Department's setup to a 'military operation,' commending their ability to work tirelessly, even as flames turn the area into a 'war zone.' 'Everybody thinks Malibu is heaven, but you have heaven and hell, literally, on the same street,' Leno said. 'Over here, there's nothing, and over here, it's just the chimneys that are standing.' Sitting in front of his vintage fire truck, Leno told 'CUOMO' on Tuesday that he's seen an unparalleled sense of community and care among Californians during the tragedy. LA wildfires arson suspect reportedly entered US illegally 'It doesn't matter what sign you have on your lawn. You know, it's come down to neighbors caring for one another,' Leno said. 'I haven't heard one political opinion. I just heard people ask, 'How can we save this?'' he added. At least 24 people have died in the wildfires. As of Tuesday, AccuWeather estimates the total damage and economic loss from the fires could be $135-150 billion and Poweroutage.us shows at least 85,000 people across California are without power.

A look at the terms — and tensions — in the Israel-Hamas draft ce...	CAIRO (AP) — If the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal goes according to the current draft, then fighting will stop in Gaza for 42 days, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed. In this first phase Israeli troops will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as stepped-up aid flows in. The question is if the ceasefire will survive beyond that first phase. That will depend on even more negotiations meant to begin within weeks. In those talks, Israel, Hamas, and the U.S, Egyptian and Qatari mediators will have to tackle the tough issue of how Gaza will be governed, with Israel demanding the elimination of Hamas. Without a deal within those 42 days to begin the second phase, Israel could resume its campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas – even as dozens of hostages remain in the militants’ hands. Hamas has agreed to a draft of the ceasefire deal, two officials confirmed, but Israeli officials say details are still being worked out, meaning some terms could change, or the whole deal could even fall through. Here is a look at the plan and potential pitfalls in the draft seen by the Associated Press. Swapping hostages for imprisoned Palestinians During the first phase, Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. By the end of the phase, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed. Some 100 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. On the first official day of the ceasefire, Hamas is to free three hostages, then another four on the seventh day. After that, it will make weekly releases. Which hostages and how many Palestinians will be released is complicated. The 33 will include women, children and those over 50 — almost all civilians, but the deal also commits Hamas to free all living female soldiers. Hamas will release living hostages first, but if the living don’t complete the 33 number, bodies will be handed over. Not all hostages are held by Hamas, so getting other militant groups to hand them over could be an issue. In exchange, Israel will free 30 Palestinian women, children or elderly for each living civilian hostage freed. For each female soldier freed, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 serving life sentences. In exchange for bodies handed over by Hamas, Israel will free all women and children it has detained from Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Dozens of men, including soldiers, will remain captive in Gaza, pending the second phase. Israeli pullbacks and the return of Palestinians During the proposed deal's first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a kilometer (0.6 miles) wide inside Gaza along its borders with Israel. That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza’s population driven into massive, squalid tent camps, Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes, even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel’s campaign. But there are complications. During the past year of negotiations, Israel has insisted it must control the movement of Palestinians to the north to ensure Hamas does not take weapons back into those areas. Throughout the war, the Israeli military has severed the north from the rest of Gaza by holding the so-called Netzarim Corridor, a belt across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. That allowed them to search people fleeing from the north into central Gaza and bar anyone trying to return. The draft seen by the AP specifies that Israel is to leave the corridor. In the first week, troops would withdraw from the main north-south coastal road — Rasheed Street — which would open one route for Palestinians returning. By the 22nd day of the ceasefire, Israeli troops are to leave the entire corridor. Still, as talks continued Tuesday, an Israeli official insisted the military will keep control of Netzarim and that Palestinians returning north would have to pass inspections there, though he declined to provide details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed negotiations. Working out those contradictions could bring frictions. Throughout the first phase, Israel will retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the strip of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, including the Rafah Crossing. Hamas dropped demands that Israel pull out of this area. Humanitarian aid In the first phase, aid entry to Gaza is to be ramped up to hundreds of trucks a day of food, medicine, supplies and fuel to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. That is far more than Israel has allowed in throughout the war. For months, aid groups have struggled to distribute to Palestinians even the trickle of aid entering Gaza because of Israeli military restrictions and rampant robberies of aid trucks by gangs. An end to fighting should alleviate that. The need is great. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant among Palestinians, crammed into tents and short on food and clean water. Hospitals have been damaged and short of supplies. The draft deal specifies that equipment will be allowed in to build shelters for tens of thousands whose homes were destroyed and to rebuild infrastructure like electricity, sewage, communications and road systems. But here, too, implementation could bring problems. Even before the war, Israel has restricted entry of some equipment, arguing it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. Another Israeli official said arrangements are still being worked out over aid distribution and cleanup, but the plan is to prevent Hamas from having any role. Further complicating matters, Israel's government is still committed to its plan to ban UNRWA from operating and to cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. The UN agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The second phase If all of that works out, the sides must still tackle the second phase. Negotiations over it are to begin on Day 16 of the ceasefire. Phase two's broad outlines are laid out in the draft: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues. Israel has said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated and it cannot rearm — ensuring Hamas no longer runs Gaza. Hamas says it will not hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from everywhere in Gaza. So the negotiations will have to get both sides to agree to an alternative for governing Gaza. Effectively, Hamas has to agree to its own removal from power — something it has said it is willing to do, but it may seek to keep a hand in any future government, which Israel has vehemently rejected. The draft agreement says a deal on the second phase must be worked out by the end of the first. Pressure will be on both sides to reach a deal, but what happens if they don’t? It could go in many directions. Hamas had wanted written guarantees that a ceasefire would continue as long as needed to agree on phase two. It has settled for verbal guarantees from the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Israel, however, has given no assurances. So Israel could threaten new military action to pressure Hamas in the negotiations or could outright resume its military campaign, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened. Hamas and the mediators are betting the momentum from the first phase will make it difficult for him to do that. Relaunching the assault would risk losing the remaining hostages — infuriating many against Netanyahu — though stopping short of destroying Hamas will also anger key political partners. The third phase is likely to be less contentious: The bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a 3- to 5-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/ap-a-look-at-the-terms-and-tensions-in-the-israel-hamas-draft-ceasefire-deal/	2025-01-14T18:23:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67871caf070ef3.61325871.jpeg?w=900
Biden to lift Cuba terrorism designation, reversing Trump decisio...	The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it will remove Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism (SST) in exchange for the release of political prisoners jailed for protesting against the regime in July 2021. The Trump administration placed the SST designation on Cuba in the last week of the president-elect's first term, and Biden officials said they are in contact with the Trump transition team over their action. 'This issue is among the issues on which they've been in communication,' a senior administration official said in a call with reporters. The administration, required by law, is notifying Congress of the decision, allowing them to review it, although there’s little that lawmakers can do to block the lifting of the designation. Cuban officials had fought tooth and nail for removal from the SST list throughout President Biden’s term, but had generally not received much buy-in from administration officials. Officials briefing reporters on Tuesday said that the U.S. constantly reviews SST designations, and, in the case of Cuba, the administration does not have information supporting it being a state sponsor of terrorism. They added that the U.S. had received numerous diplomatic requests for the designation to be lifted. This includes from Colombia, a senior administration official said, where officials noted 'positive role that Cuba has made in the Colombian peace talks.' 'We believe these actions will be broadly well received in the region and beyond,' said a second administration official, adding other countries supporting the move include Brazil, Chile, Spain and Canada, as well as the European Union. Administration officials also noted a critical role played by the Catholic Church. 'We have been in close coordination with a range of actors, including the Catholic Church, to create an improved environment in Cuba,' the official said. Biden on Saturday also awarded Pope Francis the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, and made him the first person to receive the added commendation of 'with distinction' from the president. The U.S. is lifting the SST designation and taking additional relief actions on Cuba as goodwill actions to facilitate the release of unjustly detained individuals. The administration said they understand the Catholic Church has been in dialogue with the Cuban government 'to undertake a set of actions that will allow for the humanitarian release of a significant number of political prisoners in Cuba and those who have been detained unjustly.' Amnesty International estimates that Cuba has jailed 671 people for taking part in protests in July 2021. 'We do anticipate that these releases will happen very soon, and we do anticipate that there will be people who are released from detention in Cuba before the end of the Biden administration on January 20,' one senior administration official told reporters. The Biden administration is taking two other actions to incentivize Cuba’s release of political prisoners. This includes Biden blocking U.S. nationals or other individuals to bring claims in U.S. courts over property confiscated by the Cuban Revolution, issuing a waiver for Title III of the Helms Burton Act Biden is also rescinding a Trump-era sanctions policy against Cuba, called 'National Security Presidential Memorandum 5,' ending restrictions on financial transactions with certain Cuban entities. 'The principal impact of this rescission is that it will eliminate the so-called restricted list, which is the list of certain entities in Cuba that are subject to certain prohibited financial transactions,' the administration official said. Biden’s last minute removal of Cuba from the list mirrors Trump’s 2021 move to designate the island a state sponsor of terrorism, with both U.S. presidents leaving behind a political hot potato for their 2020 opponent in their final days in office. Trump left Biden with the dubious choice of either giving the appearance of siding with the Cuban communist regime, or leaving the designation and further depressing Cuba’s economy, a major factor behind emigration from the island. Now Trump will have to make the opposite choice, either taking a hardline approach and dealing with potential Cuban migration or letting Biden’s decision congeal. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, introduced legislation in February 2023 that would prevent Cuba’s removal from the SST list until democratic elections are held in the country, a transition government is in power and all political prisoners are released. Rubio will sit for a confirmation hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday where he is likely to face questions from his colleagues over whether the Trump administration will maintain Biden’s actions or reverse them. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a Tuesday statement that he would work to reverse Biden's decision. 'Today’s decision is unacceptable on its merits. The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision,' Cruz said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-to-lift-cuba-terrorism-designation-reversing-trump-decision-in-final-week-in-office/	2025-01-14T12:21:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Biden-Trump_Evan-VucciandManuel-Balce-CenetaAP.png?w=900
LA wildfires arson suspect reportedly entered US illegally	(NewsNation) — An alleged arson suspect connected to the California wildfires entered the country illegally from Mexico, officials said in a statement. Police had been questioning the involvement of Juan Manuel Sierra-Leyva, 33, in starting a fire that may have contributed to the wildfires. Sierra-Leyva is a 'Mexican national who entered the U.S. unlawfully at an unknown date and location without inspection by an immigration official,' a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement read. How do wildfires start, and how long do they last? The man was allegedly chased and apprehended by residents of Woodland Hills after they saw him setting fire to old Christmas trees and debris with what one resident described as a 'flamethrower' soon after the massive wildfire began Thursday, the New York Post reported. Sierra-Leyva has had multiple encounters with law enforcement since November 2016 for a variety of charges, ICE stated.

Dementia cases expected to double by 2060: Study	Dementia cases in the U.S. are expected to double by 2060 when around 1 million Americans are projected to develop the memory-losing condition every year, according to a new study that was published Monday in the medical journal Nature Medicine. The study found that the risk of developing dementia after turning age 55 is around 42 percent. Dementia is a group condition that includes loss of concentration, judgment and memory. Princess Kate in remission from cancer The collaborative study was funded by the National Institutes of Health to NYU Langone. It relied on the data garnered from the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study, which began in 1987 and has tracked the cognitive function and vascular health of participants. 'Our study results forecast a dramatic rise in the burden from dementia in the United States over the coming decades, with one in two Americans expected to experience cognitive difficulties after age 55,' said Josef Coresh, the study’s senior investigator and epidemiologist. The researchers discovered that a lifetime risk of suffering from dementia for men after turning 55 is 35 percent while it is 48 percent for women. For the most part, the higher risk among women is because of their lower death rates, according to researchers. The study also found those who had a variant of the APOE4 gene are at a higher risk of developing dementia. How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke Blood pressure control and preventing diabetes are one of the ways to slow down cognitive decline and prevent dementia, according to researchers. 'The pending population boom in dementia cases poses significant challenges for health policymakers in particular, who must refocus their efforts on strategies to minimize the severity of dementia cases, as well as plans to provide more healthcare services for those with dementia,' Coresh said. A study from September last year found nearly one in five dementia cases are linked to vision impairment, suggesting that diagnosis rates could drop with more sufficient eye health.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/dementia-cases-2060-study/	2025-01-14T11:19:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AlzheimersGettyImages-1125084447.jpg?w=900
This popular hiking trail may hold clues to how Palisades Fire ig...	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) – A beloved hiking spot north of Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades along the Temescal Ridge trail is reportedly a point of interest for investigators looking into the origins of the costliest wildfire in the history of Los Angeles. The area in question, near Via Las Palmas and Via La Costa in the Palisades-Highland community, is less than a mile from Piedra Morada, where the fire was reported on Jan. 7 at around 10:30 a.m. LA wildfire victims contend with price-gouged rental prices The trail, which offers expansive views of the Pacific Ocean, is home to Skull Rock Trailhead, named for a skeletal-shaped rock along the route. Aerial footage of the area captured by NewsNation affiliate KTLA's Sky5 on Monday showed more than a dozen investigators riding and walking the area, presumably looking for an ignition point for the Palisades Fire. Investigators seen walking an area off the Temescal Ridge trail in Pacific Palisdes on Jan. 13, 2025. (KTLA)An area along the Temescal Ridge trail cordoned off by yellow crime scene tape seen from Sky5 on Jan. 13, 2025. (KTLA) One area along the route, around several rock formations and near a visible burn scar, was cordoned off with yellow crime scene tape, footage showed. While the cause of the fire and its starting point remain under investigation, the general area around Skull Rock was the site of a small New Year’s Eve brush fire, reportedly ignited by fireworks, that burned for several hours before being extinguished by a water-dropping helicopter, the Los Angeles Times reported. (A nearby resident also told The New York Times that he observed a haze over that area — though no flames — on Jan. 7, but doubted that any brush from the New Year's Eve fire could still be smoldering.) Because the location is frequented by the public, sources familiar with the investigation told the L.A. Times it’s possible the Palisades Fire started in the same spot, and added that 'it appears to have human origins,' though the investigation is in its early stages. Mother of former child star killed in Palisades Fire speaks on devastating loss Investigators are likely looking into whether the Palisades Fire could have been a rekindling of the alleged fireworks-related fire on New Year’s Eve as well as scorched power-line poles in the area. 'There’s been no definitive determination that it is arson at this point, but we are looking at every angle,' LAPD Asst. Chief Dominic Choi said, as reported by the L.A. Times.

LA wildfire victims contend with price-gouged rental prices	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles County residents displaced by the deadly wildfires are now contending with another obstacle in trying to find a new place to live: Rising rental prices that, in some cases, are illegal. Price gouging on rental properties and other necessities such as food and other household items has drawn the attention of the California Attorney General’s Office, which told the media outlet LAist that the state bans price gouging. Under state law, price gouging occurs when the normal price of an item or service rises by more than 10%. But, the attorney general says that existing laws banning price-gouging haven't kept some landlords from spiking their rentral price asks. School funding a ‘guarantee’ amid LA closures: State superintendent But in the wake of the wildfires that have displaced tens of thousands of local residents, rental prices around the region have jumped considerably. The New York Times reported that a recent review of rental properties showed increases ranging from 15% to 64%. One listing for a Bel Air home was listed at $29,500 per month, which was previously listed at $15,900. Los Angeles real estate agent Nikko Santo Pietro told NewsNation on Monday, says that the wildfires have brought out the best and worst of people. The latter includes some landlords charging 'astronomical' rents. 'It's inhumane, it's not right morally,' he said. The realtor said the matter is currently a 'gray area' as real estate professionals await word from the Department of Real Estate and from Bonda's office. California Attorney General Rob Bonta told the outlet that anyone noticing price gouging should immediately report it to his office’s website. 'If prices look really out of whack — if they look like they've increased from what you're used to — report it to us,' Bonta told the website. 'We'll take it from there. We'll evaluate it. We'll hold folks accountable and enforce if necessary.' Other officials have spoken out to landlords who have spiked the price of their properties. 'This is absolutely unacceptable and illegal to do in the face of this horrible tragedy,' State Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin said at a news conference Sunday, according to NBC News. In California, a database of areas designated as being hit by disasters is available and includes a designation stating that price gouging is illegal in these areas. Among the affected areas are communities ravaged by the wildfires in which at least 26,000 people have applied for disaster relief funds. President Joe Biden announced on Monday that victims of the wildfires will receive a one-time payment of $770 to purchase basic necessities after being displaced. But the jump in rental costs around Los Angeles County is not exclusive to the wildfires, National Housing Law Project attorney Natalie Maxwell told USA Today. Maxwell said that her office sees people taking advantage of disasters as a way of an 'opportunity to make additional money.' Firefighters deploy as strong winds threaten more LA neighborhoods 'We see that over and over,' Maxwell said. USA Today reported that California Penal Code 396 specifically prohibits landlords from evicting tenants to offer the property up at a higher price to someone else. The law is also the statute that defines price gouging as anything that is more than 10% higher than the normal price. The law went into effect when California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and covers a range of goods and services. Yet, with so many people seeking shelter in the wake of the wildfires, The New York Times reports some people won’t allow the price of moving in from doing so. 'There will be a desperation on the part of folks who will need housing, and an opportunity for property owners to take advantage of that,' Rachel Bogardus Drew, senior research director at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable-housing nonprofit, told The New York Times. However, landlords who are found guilty of price-gouging face up to a year in jail and fines, Bonta told the BBC. 'This is California law [and] it's in place to protect those suffering from a tragedy,' Bonta said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/wildfire-victims-price-gauged-rental/	2025-01-14T10:08:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192687291.jpg?w=900
Pete Hegseth faces fiery confirmation hearing for defense secreta...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is heading into a potentially explosive Senate confirmation hearing. Hegseth, a former TV show host and military veteran, will answer questions about allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking, as well as his views on the current state of the U.S. military. The hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee is set to start at 9:30 a.m. ET. It's the start of a weeklong marathon as senators begin scrutinizing Trump’s choices for more than a dozen top administrative positions. The Republican-led Senate is rushing to have some of Trump’s picks ready to be confirmed as soon as Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, despite potential opposition to some from both sides of the aisle. Hegseth to answer assault allegations Hegseth, 44, could be confirmed as defense secretary with only Republican support, but he can't afford to lose more than three Republican votes if his nomination moves to the full Senate. A major issue surrounding his confirmation involves allegations of sexual assault. While Hegseth was never charged, the alleged victim, who organized a Republican women’s event, claims they met in a hotel room in 2017, where Hegseth allegedly took her phone and refused to let her leave. Jack Smith: Evidence could have convicted Trump in Jan. 6 case A nurse who saw the alleged victim days later stated the woman requested a sexual assault exam and recalled little of the night but believed her drink may have been spiked. Hegseth’s attorney has confirmed he paid the accuser to avoid a lawsuit. Sen. Joni Ernst a must-watch at Hegseth hearing Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a veteran and sexual assault survivor, could play a pivotal role in Tuesday’s hearing. Ernst has met with Hegseth twice and described the discussions as productive. Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, both sides spoke about the significance of the event. The hearing is expected to address several topics, including Hegseth’s past comments opposing women in combat roles and accusing the military of being 'woke.' What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency Although he has since walked back some of those comments, emphasizing the contributions of women in the military, a report last month detailed concerns from Fox News employees about Hegseth’s drinking habits. He has vowed not to drink if confirmed. If appointed, Hegseth would lead the Department of Defense, the federal government’s largest employer, overseeing 3.4 million service members and civilians with an annual budget of approximately $850 billion.

Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a Gaza ceasefire and the...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages, two officials involved in the talks said Tuesday. Mediator Qatar said Israel and the Palestinian militant group were at the 'closest point' yet to sealing a deal. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed agreement, and an Egyptian official and a Hamas official confirmed its authenticity. An Israeli official said progress has been made, but the details are being finalized. The plan would need to be submitted to the Israeli Cabinet for final approval. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end the 15-month war and secure the release of dozens of hostages captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered it. Some 100 people are still captive inside Gaza, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. Any deal is expected to deliver a pause in fighting and bring Israel and Hamas a step closer to winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought, a conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. It would bring relief to the hard-hit Gaza Strip, where Israel's offensive has reduced large areas of the territory to rubble and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of whom are at risk of famine. Meanwhile, dozens of Israeli hostages would be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity. Officials have have expressed optimism before, only for negotiations to grind to a halt. But they are now suggesting that they can conclude an agreement ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose Mideast envoy has joined the negotiations. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday that the ongoing negotiations were productive, while declining to get into the details. 'Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' he said. Hamas, meanwhile, said in a statement that the ongoing negotiations had reached their 'final stage.' In the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250. Around half those hostages were freed during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israeli strikes across Gaza overnight and into Tuesday killed at least 18 Palestinians, including two women and four children, according to local health officials, who said one of the women was pregnant and that the baby died as well. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. A three-phase agreement The three-phase agreement — based on a framework laid out by U.S. President Joe Biden and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council — would begin with the gradual release of 33 hostages over a six-week period, including women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Among the 33 would be five female Israeli soldiers, each of whom would be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 convicted militants who are serving life sentences. The Israeli official said Israel assumes most of the 33 are still alive. During this first, 42-day phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from population centers, Palestinians would be allowed to start returning to their homes in northern Gaza and there would be a surge of humanitarian aid, with some 600 trucks entering each day. Details of the second phase still must be negotiated during the first. Those details remain difficult to resolve — and the deal does not include written guarantees that the ceasefire will continue until a deal is reached. That leaves the potential for Israel to resume its military campaign after the first phase ends. The Israeli official said 'detailed negotiations' on the second phase will begin during the first. He said Israel will retain some 'assets' throughout the negotiations, referring to a military presence, and would not leave the Gaza Strip until all the hostages are back home. The three mediators have given Hamas verbal guarantees that negotiations will continue as planned and that they will press for a deal to implement the second and third phases before the end of the first, the Egyptian official said. The deal would allow Israel throughout the first phase to remain in control of the Philadelphi corridor, the band of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas had initially demanded Israel withdraw from. Israel would pull out from the Netzarim Corridor, a belt across central Gaza where it had sought a mechanism for searching Palestinians for arms when they return to the territory's north. In the second phase, Hamas would release the remaining living captives, mainly male soldiers, in exchange for more prisoners and the 'complete withdrawal' of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to the draft agreement. Hamas has said it will not free the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the past vowed to resume fighting until Hamas’ military and governing capabilities are eliminated. Unless an alternative government for Gaza is worked out in those talks, it could leave Hamas in charge of the territory. In a third phase, the bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision. Growing pressure ahead of Trump's inauguration Israel and Hamas have come under renewed pressure to halt the conflict in the lead-up to Trump's inauguration next week. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, recently joined U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators in the Gulf country’s capital, Doha. Trump said late Monday that a ceasefire was 'very close.' 'I understand ... there’s been a handshake and they are getting it finished -- and maybe by the end of the week,' he told the American cable channel Newsmax. Hamas has blamed Israel for the repeated setbacks in the negotiations, saying that on more than one occasion, the militant group had accepted a proposal from mediators only to see Israel reject it or launch a new military operation immediately afterwards. Israel and its close ally the United States have blamed setbacks on Hamas. ___ This story has been updated to correct that some 100 people are still being held captive in Gaza, including foreign nationals, not 100 Israelis. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Jack Smith: Evidence could have convicted Trump in Jan. 6 case	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Special counsel Jack Smith, who investigated Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, said in a new report that he believes the evidence against the president-elect was enough to convict him had he not won the 2024 election. 'Indeed, but for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the presidency, the office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,' Smith wrote in the 137-page report. The report, arriving just days before Trump returns to office on Jan. 20, focuses fresh attention on his frantic but failed effort to cling to power in 2020. Special counsel defends prosecuting Trump Smith defended his prosecution of the president-elect in the report, stating his team 'stood up for the rule of law' and said they set an example to fight for justice. Smith alleged that then-President Trump knowingly spread false claims of election fraud, claiming Trump weaponized those lies to try to stay in power. 'The throughline of all of Mr. Trump’s criminal efforts was deceit — knowingly false claims of election fraud — and the evidence shows that Mr. Trump used these lies as a weapon to defeat a federal government function foundational to the United States’ democratic process,' the report states. What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency The special counsel also detailed how Trump allegedly used his status on social media to target witnesses, courts and U.S. Department of Justice employees, adding his office had to protect witnesses from threats and harassment. 'A significant challenge that the office faced after Mr. Trump's indictment was his ability and willingness to use his influence and following on social media to target witnesses, courts and department employees,' the report states. Read the full report: Trump slams Smith's report Trump responded early Tuesday on his Truth Social platform, calling Jack Smith 'deranged' and claiming he was 'totally innocent': 'Deranged Jack Smith was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his 'boss,' Crooked Joe Biden, so he ends up writing yet another 'Report' based on information that the Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs ILLEGALLY DESTROYED AND DELETED, because it showed how totally innocent I was, and how completely guilty Nancy Pelosi, and others, were. Jack is a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide. THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN!!!' The president-elect promised to fire Smith when he returned to the White House. Smith submitted his report to the DOJ on Jan. 7 and resigned as special counsel on Jan. 10. David Weiss condemns pardon, defends record in Hunter Biden prosecution report Trump had been indicted in August 2023 on charges of working to overturn the election, but the case was delayed by appeals and ultimately significantly narrowed by a conservative-majority Supreme Court, which held for the first time that former presidents enjoy sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. Though Smith sought to salvage the indictment, the team dismissed it entirely in November because of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.

Strong winds forecast for LA threaten wildfire fight	LOS ANGELES (NEXSTAR) — Additional water tankers and scores of firefighters have arrived in the Los Angeles area ahead of fierce winds that were forecast to return and threaten the progress made so far on two massive infernos that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Firefighters give behind-the-scene look at heroic battle with Eaton Fire Crews stop forward progress of fast-moving brush fire in Ventura County On Monday, planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals, while crews and fire engines were being placed near particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush. Dozens of water trucks rolled in to replenish supplies after hydrants ran dry last week when the two largest fires erupted. Tabitha Trosen and her boyfriend said she feels like they are 'teetering' on the edge with the constant fear that their neighborhood could be the next under threat. The facade of the Altadena Community Church stands amidst damage from the Eaton Fire on Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, in Altadena, Calif. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) 'Our cats are ready to go, we have their carriers by the door prepped with their little stuffed animals and things like that,' Trosen said, adding that she's packed things as she thinks about what she could lose. 'It’s like, how do I take care of myself, and what are the things that will ground me as a human and remind me of my background and my life and my family.' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials — who have faced criticism over their initial response to fires that began last week — expressed confidence Monday that the region was ready to face the new threat with additional firefighters brought in from around the U.S., as well as Canada and Mexico. 'We’re absolutely better prepared,' LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said when asked what will be different from a week ago, when hurricane-force winds propelled multiple fires across the parched, brush-filled region that hasn’t seen rain in more than eight months. There have been more than a dozen wildfires in Southern California since Jan. 1, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area. The latest started late Monday in a dry riverbed in Oxnard, about 55 miles (about 89 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, and was burning in an agricultural area. Live footage from AlertCalifornia showed flames of the Auto Fire spreading near the River Ridge Golf Course around 8 p.m. Although no residential structures are within the evacuation zone, Ventura County spokesperson Andrew Dowd said 'Anyone in and around the river bottom needs to get to a safe location.' The winds are predicted to pick up starting early Tuesday and continue through midday Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. They are not expected to reach hurricane-force like last week, but could ground firefighting aircraft, Marrone said, warning if winds reach 70 mph (112 kph), 'it’s going to be very difficult to contain that fire.' Fire officials advised residents in high-risk areas to just leave home – and not wait for formal evacuation orders -- if they sense danger. That’s exactly what Tim Kang of La Crescenta did last Wednesday. Feeling sick from the smoky air and fearful of nearby fires spreading, Kang and his brothers packed up and have stayed away from their neighborhood. 'Everything just felt like, ‘Oh man, the world’s ending,’' said Kang, who's staying with his girlfriend in Pasadena. In less than a week, four fires around the nation’s second-biggest city have scorched more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), roughly three times the size of Manhattan. The National Weather Service warned the weather will be 'particularly dangerous' on Tuesday, when wind gusts could reach 65 mph (105 kph). A large part of Southern California around Los Angeles is under this extreme fire danger warning through Wednesday, including densely populated Thousand Oaks, Northridge and Simi Valley. The Eaton Fire near Pasadena is roughly one-third contained, while the largest blaze in Pacific Palisades on the coast is far less contained. Search for victims continues The death toll is likely to rise, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Monday. At least two dozen were missing, he said. Luna said he understands that people are eager to return to their homes and neighborhoods to survey the damage, but he asked for their patience. 'We have people literally looking for the remains of your neighbors,' he said. At a Monday evening community meeting about the Palisades Fire, a Los Angeles Police Department official said many people reported as missing had been found. It wasn’t clear if there was overlap in the numbers shared by the sheriff. Checking on their homes The slower winds over the weekend allowed some people to return to previously evacuated areas. Many had no idea if their homes or neighborhoods were still standing. Jim Orlandini, who lost his hardware store in Altadena, a hard-hit neighborhood next to Pasadena, said his home of 40 years survived. 'The whole time I was thinking, I don’t know what I’m going to find when I get back here and after 40 years, you know, you got a lot of stuff you forget about that would disappear if the house burned down. So we’re thankful that it didn’t.' Warnings to stay out of disaster zones LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from burned neighborhoods filled with broken gas lines and unstable buildings. Just under 100,000 in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. Fighting flames on multiple fronts Firefighters over the weekend fought flames in Mandeville Canyon — home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities — after the Palisades Fire spread, prompting new evacuation orders. Crews continued battling there Monday before potentially strong winds could push the flames toward the famous J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles. Beyoncé, Disney and other celebrities and entertainment organizations have pledged millions to help those who have been displaced or lost their homes. Other stars — and ordinary people — have left large donations of clothing and other items along street corners in around the city. Investigating looting, fundraising scams Dozens of people have been arrested for looting after the wildfires. Officials are now starting to see price gouging and scams, including with hotels and short-term rentals and medical supplies, said Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Counting up and investigating the destruction The fires that began Tuesday north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 homes, cars and other structures. Authorities haven’t determined an official cause for any of the fires. Southern California Edison has acknowledged agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a smaller blaze. A lawsuit filed Monday claims the utility's equipment sparked the much bigger Eaton Fire. Edison did not respond to a request for comment and last week said it had not received any suggestions that its equipment ignited that blaze. AccuWeather’s early estimates suggest the fires could be the nation’s costliest ever, topping $250 billion including what’s to come in the next days. The reconstruction cost for commercial and residential properties inside areas with active fires could be $14.8 billion, according to real estate data tracker CoreLogic.

McALLEN, TEXAS (Border Report) -- Representing migrants who died while trying to cross the border last year, 600 wooden crosses covered a field for a month in Eagle Pass, Texas. US ‘knowingly killing migrants,’ county official says Many of the crosses had blue or pink marks indicating the young boys and girls who died, organizers with the Border Vigil, a human rights program by the Eagle Pass Border Coalition, told Border Report on Monday. Volunteers remove crosses at Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas, during a ceremony on Jan. 11, 2025. (Photo Courtesy Eagle Pass Border Coalition Border Vigil) The memorial of crosses were set up on Dec. 14 in a field at Shelby Park -- a park that that's been partially closed to the public because it is the staging point for Operation Lone Star, Texas' border security initiative in Eagle Pass. New border base camp staffing up in Eagle Pass Volunteers removed the crosses on Saturday. 'One of the reasons that we do it all at once and then take it down, is to show this is what happened this year,' coalition co-founder Amerika Garcia-Grewal said. This is the second year that the organization has put up the crosses at Shelby Park. 'It was an emotional and moving experience walking among the 600 crosses representing people who died either trying to swim the river,' said Mike Garcia, co-founder of the Border Vigil. 'To understand that each one of those crosses represented the loss of someone's life. The pink tipped crosses were for children, for girls and the blue tipped ones were for boys and there was a lot of them there. It's knowing what all that's about and the family still doesn't know for some of them. What happened to them? Where did they end up? It really made you think.' US ‘knowingly killing migrants,’ county official says 'It was sad to see so many people died reaching for the American dream,' said Ana Guardiola, director of Ballet Folklórico De Las Águilas, which performed at the ceremony to the song 'La Llorona.' At the end of the song, community members and clergy joined the dancers and walked among the crosses for a moment of silent contemplation and to reflect on the significance of the memorial, organizers told Border Report. 'We pray that God will comfort the families that have lost a loved one who was only looking for a safer and better life for their families,' Pastor Javier Leyva told participants.

Poll: Do Americans want more states? Are we on the right track no...	Editor's Note: Beginning at 11 a.m. ET, the video player above will feature live analysis of the latest Emerson findings on public sentiment at the end of the Biden Administration. (NEXSTAR) – On the eve of President Trump's return to the Oval Office, Emerson College Polling conducted a survey to gauge public sentiment on a swath of issues including the popularity of Presidents Joe Biden and Jimmy Carter, the criminal proceedings against former President Trump and the potential expansion of United States territories. A January 10-11 survey of 1,000 registered voters found President Joe Biden with a 37% approval rating in the final week of his presidency, 12 points lower than when Emerson first polled his approval in 2021. A deeper look into the number reveals continued perceptions of a struggling economy likely dragging on Biden, as they did during the General Election last year. The economy remains the top issue for voters (36%) followed by Immigration (17%) and healthcare (12%).The poll does offer hope for Mr. Biden's legacy over time, as respondents held broadly positive feelings about fellow one-term Democrat Jimmy Carter. Of those surveyed, 59% held a favorable opinion of Carter, who died on December 29th, with only 16% stating a negative opinion of the Georgia lawmaker. President-elect Trump enjoys 52% approval as he returns to the White House, but a majority of those same voters (55%) stated it was appropriate to hold the future president accountable in court for falsifying business records. 'Trump’s conviction continues to highlight partisan divides, independents aligning more with Democrats on this issue,' Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling said in a news release. 'Eighty-seven percent of Democrats and 57% of independents think the trial was appropriate to hold Trump accountable, while 79% of Republicans hint the trial was a political witch hunt.One of Trump's most headline-grabbing proposals, expanding the footprint of the United States, earned a cool response from survey participants. Sixty-seven percent of those polled believe the US should stay the size it is, while 20% think the country should add states or additional territories. Thirteen percent were neutral on the proposition. More broadly, November's election seems to have done little yet to convince Americans that the country is moving toward a brighter future. Two-thirds of respondents said America is now 'headed in the wrong direction,' with the other third saying the U.S. is on the right track. At the beginning of Biden's term, 54% felt the country was headed in the wrong direction and just under half felt things were getting better. 'All political parties consider the country on the wrong track heading into 2025: 62% ofDemocrats, along with 70% of Republicans and 69% of independents,' Emerson wrote in a news release.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/polls/poll-do-americans-want-more-states-are-we-on-the-right-track-now/	2025-01-14T03:42:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24311625770843.jpg?w=900
Incarcerated firefighter program turns 'negative into positive'	(NewsNation) — Royal Ramey, co-founder and CEO of the Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program, says he turned a 'negative into a positive,' leading to a career he loves. Ramey previously worked as a firefighter while incarcerated and now wants to help others follow a similar path. 'My experience was a roller coaster emotionally and physically,' Ramey said during an appearance on 'Banfield.' 'Now, I'm trying to help others find that path as well.' Biden to convene top officials on LA wildfires response Incarcerated firefighters earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to CDCR. Overall pay can depend on their skill level. Wage levels doubled in 2023, up from between $2.90 and $5.12 per day, CBS News reported. The California conservation or fire camp program, which has been around since the 1940s, has drawn criticism for its low pay and the high risks involved. As of Friday, over 900 prison inmates have been deployed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to help contain the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires, the department confirmed to CBS News. The crews of incarcerated firefighters include several graduates from the Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program. School funding a ‘guarantee’ amid LA closures: State superintendent At least 24 people have died in the Los Angeles area wildfires that have been blazing since last week. LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said Monday there are 23 active missing persons cases in the county. Seventeen are in the Eaton Fire area, and six are in the Malibu area. All of those reported missing in the county are adults, Luna said. Los Angeles police said they are also working to look for six people unaccounted for in the city. As the sheriff’s department continues grid-searching the Altadena area, Luna said at a press conference that they are 'running across the remains of individual community members.' 'That is not easy work, very sad to report, and I believe that work is not only going to continue, but I believe we’ll continue to find remains,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/california-incarcerated-firefighter-program/	2025-01-13T21:20:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/9E9E8F3DFEBCF2094CDCC1D8B0282DF4.jpg?w=721
LA wildfires: Four members of the same family each lose their hom...	(NewsNation) — While wildfires devastating wealthy Los Angeles neighborhoods have dominated headlines, the historic community of Altadena is facing its own crisis as multiple generations of families lose their homes to the flames. Among them are the Williams sisters, whose family exemplifies Altadena's tight-knit community — California's first middle-class Black neighborhood, established during the Great Migration as a sanctuary from Jim Crow laws. 'The community is super strong, and we always have been,' Eshele Williams said Monday on NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' 'You're talking about generational home ownership, but the families that still live in Altadena, we've never moved.' Now, the area's nearly 50,000 residents are a diverse mix, with Black and Latino residents comprising half the population. Biden: Govt. to give $770 to each resident affected by LA wildfires Three Williams sisters, along with their parents who once fostered local children, lost their homes to the fires. A fourth sister's home remains standing but is currently inaccessible. The extended family — 17 people, four dogs and a 40-year-old family parrot named Hank — are now sharing a hotel room. Their mother, Matilda Williams, said that family unity is key to their survival. 'Our faith, our unity, definitely, and the love we have for each other — when something goes wrong, we all gather together,' she said. The Williams family has started two GoFundMe pages to rebuild their homes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/la-wildfires-family-loses-four-homes-altadena/	2025-01-13T19:54:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-2-3.jpg?w=900
LA price gauging is 'inhumane': Real estate agent	(NewsNation) — Officials are warning landlords in the Los Angeles area against price gauging, which is prohibited in California during a state of emergency. Nikko Santo Pietro, Los Angeles real estate agent and son of 'Wheel of Fortune’s' Vanna White, said the supply of housing is 'so limited' and that he can only imagine what the fires will continue to do for prices across Los Angeles County. Santo Pietro said price gouging has previously been defined as raising prices by 10% over the preemergency price. However, he's awaiting guidance from the Department of Real Estate to clarify what is allowed and what isn't allowed. For now, the exact definition of price gouging is in a 'gray area.' 'We are seeing landlords and agents charging astronomical numbers for rent,' Santo Pietro said during an appearance on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'It's inhumane. It's not right, morally. It's illegal.' Biden to convene top officials on LA wildfires response At least 24 people have died in the Los Angeles area wildfires that have been blazing since last week.

Suspected looter dressed as fireman detained near homes damaged i...	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — Two alleged looters, one of whom was dressed as a firefighter, were detained by Los Angeles County authorities on Sunday along the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades. It’s unclear exactly what time the suspects were stopped, but a local photographer spotted the pair on a scooter and a moped. One of the suspects was dressed in fire boots, jeans, and a yellow fire jacket emblazoned with Cal Fire’s old acronym CDF, which stood for California Department of Forestry and Fire. Mother of former child star killed in Palisades Fire speaks on devastating loss Eric Fox told Nexstar's KTLA he saw the pair riding up the Pacific Coast Highway. Homes along Pacific Coast Highway are seen burned and damaged while a few still stand after the Palisades Fire, Jan. 12, 2025, in Malibu, Calif. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) 'As I pulled up to the checkpoint to report them, the deputies had already detained them,' Fox explained. Two crime prevention unit deputies from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department's Santa Clarita Station, who were assisting with the Palisades Fire, made the stops, along with California Highway Patrol and National Guardsmen, who were all manning the checkpoint. Photos of the two individuals show them in handcuffs sitting on the sidewalk just outside the Getty Villa as deputies search them. Sheriff’s officials posted an image of the handcuffed fake firefighter on social media. LA area wildfires: At least 24 have died, strong winds expected No information was provided on the alleged looters' identities or if they were caught with any stolen property. Officials later said the person dressed as a firefighter was released. It was unclear what happened to the suspect pictured wearing a helmet and boots. Approximately 50 miles away in Irwindale, firefighters battling a small brush fire near Rivergrade Road and the 605 Freeway, spotted an alleged arsonist starting fires. The suspect, a 29-year-old Baldwin Park resident, was taken into custody by police. In Santa Monica, officials said that in the last five days, 39 people have been arrested in evacuation zones, 10 of whom were found in possession of burglary tools and are considered burglary suspects. L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is set to announce charges on Tuesday against suspects in several recent arrests for arson and looting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/wildfire-looters-los-angeles/	2025-01-13T14:28:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25013600160213-e1736804871547.jpg?w=800
Biden: Govt. to give $770 each to residents affected by LA wildfi...	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden announced Monday that federal aid is flowing to Los Angeles as California battles its worst wildfires in state history, with containment levels varying from 14% in Pacific Palisades to 100% in Ventura. Biden and senior officials met Monday night to discuss the ongoing federal response to the Los Angeles County wildfires as Biden’s White House tenure draws to a close. Biden has vowed the federal government will cover 100% of the disaster response costs for the next six months connected to the fires, which have claimed at least 24 lives. 'We are not waiting until the fires are over to help victims. We are helping them all right now. All those affected are going to receive a one-time payment of $770,' Biden said. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues The federal government will cover all firefighting costs for the next 180 days. Nearly $5.1 million in immediate aid has been distributed, with affected residents eligible for one-time payments of $770. FEMA reports about 33,000 people have registered for assistance. 'It's going to cost tens of billions of dollars to get Los Angeles to what it was,' Biden said during a briefing with Vice President Kamala Harris and emergency officials. 'We are going to need Congress to step up with the funding.' Officials will also work to determine what is left for the federal government to address on the fires before Biden leaves office next week. The briefing determined how the White House and administration officials can better assist state and local officials in California. The meeting included Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell, who said in various media interviews that she did not feel that California officials were unprepared to deal with the fires. Instead, she said 100 mph winds and dry conditions contributed to the inevitability of the damage being caused by the fires. Rep. John Moolenaar: Why won’t ‘Chinese Communist Party’ sell TikTok? Criswell in the briefing said about 700-800 people are staying in eight emergency shelters, while others have found refuge with family or in hotels. She has directed her team to personally assist families struggling with documentation requirements for aid. In terms of the federal response, the Department of Defense has provided infrared imaging technology to assist firefighters in battling the deadly fires. Additionally, at least 1,800 National Guard troops have been deployed to the region to assist with the wildfires. U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore warned of critical fire conditions through Wednesday, with wind gusts expected to reach 70 mph. However, he noted that approximately 15,000 additional firefighters are available if needed. Bob Fenton, who managed the Maui wildfire response, will coordinate federal support and debris removal efforts in Los Angeles, working with FEMA, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers. Officials expect weather conditions to improve by Friday, with cooling temperatures and increased humidity forecast. 'The next 48 hours are very critical,' Harris said. 'This is the time everyone must remain vigilant.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-top-officials-wildfires-response/	2025-01-13T11:59:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25012100489450.jpg?w=900
Unauthorized drone flights double; 3 arrested during LA fires	(NewsNation) — Three people have been arrested as unauthorized drone flights have doubled in southern California as firefighters work to contain multiple wildfires that have devastated the LA area. LA County Sheriff Robert Luna announced Monday that three people were arrested for two drone incidents during a briefing on the fires. The use of unauthorized drones is hindering the ability of firefighters trying to contain the fires that have burned more than 40,000 acres, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and resulted in 24 confirmed deaths. Los Angeles wildfire survivors describe ‘hellscape’ they left behind On Friday, firefighting aircraft trying to contain the Palisades wildfire were forced to leave the area because of unauthorized drones in the air. In an earlier incident Thursday, a Super Scooper aircraft used to drop large quantities of water on fires was damaged after a collision with a small drone. The incident left a hole in the wing and grounded the plane until it could be fixed. The FBI is investigating the incident, saying the drone violated temporary airspace restrictions the FAA instituted during the fires. California authorities say there have been at least 40 incidents in which unauthorized drones have forced firefighting aircraft to pause operations, putting more lives at risk as the fires continue to spread and firefighters on the ground are left without air support.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/unauthorized-drone-double-la-fires/	2025-01-13T09:18:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192352117.jpg?w=900
LA-area wildfires: Private crews charge thousands, inmates make $...	(NewsNation) — Thousands of first responders are fighting the flames as wildfires continue scorching the Los Angeles area. Along with agencies such as the Los Angeles Fire Department, the California National Guard and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, currently incarcerated people are helping out in the emergency response. In addition, some people and businesses have hired private firefighters to protect their property. Other states such as Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Idaho and New Mexico are assisting California. Mexican emergency crews and Canadian aircraft have been sent over the border to help as well. What we know about how the LA wildfires started Inmates fighting LA wildfires Incarcerated firefighters make $10.24 a day, and they get an extra dollar for each hour they've responded to a blaze. That means, for a 24-hour shift, an inmate with the lowest skill level could make almost $27 a day. This is lower than minimum wage and the rate Cal Fire gives its nonincarcerated seasonal firefighters. Those firefighters make a base salary of $3,700 to $4,600 a month. California has nearly 1,000 inmates pitching in. Incarcerated people who want to participate in the program have to volunteer. To be eligible, they must have eight years or less remaining on their sentence. Convictions involving sex offenses or arson, as well as a history of escapes, will disqualify them from the program. Inmates can have two days taken off their sentences for every day they serve in a fire crew. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events Calls are growing for the incarcerated crews to earn more. Kim Kardashian recently said in an Instagram story that the 'hundreds of incarcerated firefighters, risking their lives to save us' get paid almost nothing, and urged California Gov. Gavin Newsom to increase their wages. 'We never know who we're going to need,' Sam Lewis, executive director of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, said. 'When people go to prison or jail, we forget about them, we throw them away, and we assume that they may not have value as a society. That's not true. People are resilient. People can change, and we should always want to be able to give a person a second or third chance to be able to become the best version of themselves.' Private firefighters Meanwhile, private crews are being paid as much as $2,000 an hour to protect residences and businesses in Los Angeles County. The National Wildfire Suppression Association represents over 300 private wildland fire service contractors. Many are contracted by insurance companies to protect the homes of those they provide policies for. Industrial corporations, such as those that work in oil, gas or vineyards, hire private crews to safeguard their property and manage potential fire risks. Private fire crews bring their own water supply and are typically armed with their own hoses, blocking gel and supplies. Cal Fire says the for-hire contractors aren't on the front lines and are not getting in the way of its critical work. 'Corporations are welcome to hire their own firefighters to protect their facilities, whether it's on a facility property, or if it's a series of stands or poles,' David Acuna, of Cal Fire, said. 'Or if a private homeowner wants to have the insurance company hire them, of course, we're not going to stop that, but we cannot and will not delegate to private firefighters the operations that we need to have complex coordination with.' California legislators passed a law in 2018 to regulate private firefighting. It requires them to coordinate with public fire agencies and prohibits them from using emergency lights or sirens. LA wildfire aid from other countries Mexico has sent 72 firefighters and emergency personnel to California. They were transported to a mobile station for a safety orientation before being dispatched on Monday. 'Emergencies have no borders — we are deeply grateful to our neighbors in Mexico for their unwavering support during one of our greatest times of need,' Newsom said according to NewsNation local affiliate KTLA. 'Thank you to President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo for lending the best of the best.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has dispatched aerial firefighting aircraft to California as well. He said Canada is 'always here to help our American friends.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-area-wildfires-private-inmate-firefighters/	2025-01-13T08:05:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25013163967406.jpg?w=900
LA area wildfires: At least 24 have died, strong winds expected	(NewsNation) — At least 24 people have died in the Los Angeles area wildfires that have been blazing since last week. Crews got some relief over the weekend as the winds died down, but the gusts are expected to pick up later Monday and Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions with sustained winds of 50 mph. In the mountains, they're set to reach 70 mph. Over 12,000 structures have been destroyed in the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires. The biggest of them, Palisades, is still only 13% contained. More than 150,000 people are still under evacuation orders. Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said Sunday that some residents won’t be allowed to return to evacuation zones until the forecasted Red Flag event on Jan. 15 ends. Most Los Angeles Unified schools and all of the district's offices are set to open Monday. 'Conditions have improved for a majority of areas across the Los Angeles region and the District is confident it is safe for students and employees to return to campuses,' the school district said in a statement. Schools remaining closed because of mandatory evacuation orders are: Canyon Charter Elementary, Kenter Canyon Charter Elementary, Palisades Charter Elementary, Marquez Charter Elementary, Topanga Charter Elementary, Lanai Road Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School. At a Monday afternoon press conference, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is set to announce charges against a group of people in a residential looting in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, as well as arson charges against a man in the city of Azusa. What we know about how the LA wildfires started Palisades Fire According to CalFire, the Palisades Fire has scorched 23,713 acres and is 13% contained as of Monday morning. Eight of the 24 deaths in the wildfires are attributed to Palisades, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office. Four people are missing from the Palisades Fire zone, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. The blaze was first reported as a vegetation fire around 10:30 a.m. PT Tuesday. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events Eaton Fire The Eaton Fire burned 14,117 acres and is at 27% containment, per CalFire. Sixteen of the deaths from the wildfires are from Eaton, the LA County coroner's office said. Luna said 12 people are missing in the Eaton Fire zone. Hurst Fire The Hurst Fire burned 799 acres and is 89% contained, CalFire said. How much damage have wildfires caused? Accuweather estimates that the total damage and economic loss from the fires to be $135-150 billion. There are 207,980 customers without power in California, per Poweroutage.us. Mark Pestrella, director of Los Angeles County Public Works Director, said sewer, power and transportation systems have been damaged significantly. All Los Angeles Unified schools and offices will remain closed until the conditions improve, Superintendent Alberto Carvalhohe said.The district has lost two elementary schools, and one high school is significantly damaged, Carvalho said. Other closures include NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, The Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Getty Villa, which will not open until Monday, Jan. 13. Angeles National Forest is temporarily closed for public safety through Wednesday, Jan.15. On X, the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team announced their Thursday game is being rescheduled. So far, the Wild Card playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams football team and Minnesota Vikings is still set for SoFi Stadium on Monday. If needed, though, the teams said they will play in Phoenix. The Altadena Golf Course has been destroyed, according to Johnny Eusebio, general manager.

When the flames first started, she grabbed her dog, Delilah, and her laptop, leaving behind her home, vehicle and precious keepsakes. That includes a recently-received scrapbook of her mother, who died when she was 6-years-old, and the handprints and footprints of the son she lost. Some of those precious memories are in a fireproof lockbox — which she hopes 'by some miracle, could be in the rubble.' Death toll rises to 24 in LA wildfires, more wind expected Nativo is one of the many thousands forced to leave behind their homes as wildfires scorch the Los Angeles area. The fires continued Sunday, with the Palisades blaze, Eaton Fire and more spreading across more than 38,000 acres of Southern California. Nativo said that, while the Pacific Palisades is often conflated as a mega-rich neighborhood, the people who lived in her building were hard-working, middle-class people, not just 'millionaires and celebrities.' 'I'm very blessed. I have this friend who's given me her guest house as a retreat for now, but I think about how many people are displaced, and how many people are in shelters and just are left with nothing?' Nativo told NewsNation. A firefighter battles the Palisades Fire in Mandeville Canyon on Saturday, Jan. 11, 2025, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Jae C.

(Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) Parents separated from children during fire As Natalie Mitchell escaped the fire in Pacific Palisades, her children were at school, spread out across Los Angeles County. 'That night, there was a moment where I thought, 'I don't know if we're going to make it out of here,'' Mitchell told NewsNation. Within minutes of seeing the spark of fire on a hill, Mitchell and her husband watched it grow rapidly -- and decided to leave. 'We took whatever we could, we jumped in the car, we started going down the hill,' Mitchell said. 'There was no one else on the road. It was pitch black, and the visibility at one point was, I couldn't, we couldn't see.' Watching the homes around them burn, the couple realized that, if anything were to happen, their children would lose them both. 'And we thought, what do we do?' Mitchell said. Maneuvering around firetrucks, the pair made it down the mountain and to safety. Her children — separated themselves at first — were picked up by members of Mitchell's 'wonderful community.' 'We're happy to be together. We're happy to be safe, and that's the most important part,' she added. 'It's really, really hard. I feel like, every hour, I get a new update on a friend that's lost their home.' CA firefighters face impersonators, staffing shortages, low pay Couple loses Altadena home in fire Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling knew the wind would be an issue. 'But we didn't really anticipate the devastation that was to come,' Kiessling said. The couple, along with their nearly 4-year-old daughter, lived in Altadena — where the Eaton Fire raged. Kiessling said she grew more unnerved and anxious as the night went on, leading the trio to evacuate overnight on Wednesday before any orders had been passed down. 'By 5 a.m., our burglar alarms started going off. And later when we checked, every single alarm in our house tripped within four minutes. So we think, 'Wow, took four minutes for our house to go up.''

It was complete inferno, a hellscape … I barely made it to my car,' Gellis said, describing the smoky air as having 'zero oxygen.' 'I mean, there was so much embers going, it was like a blizzard of murder hornets that were on fire,' he described. 'And honestly, it was just so beyond. It's just like being out of a scene of up from hell.' CA firefighters face impersonators, staffing shortages, low pay He said he'd gone back to visit the house to find only rubble where it stood.

CA firefighters face impersonators, staffing shortages, low pay	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles firefighters battling historic urban blazes face mounting challenges beyond the flames, including criminals impersonating first responders and critical staffing shortages. Officials report 29 arrests connected to the fires, including an incident where police detained two men on Vice President Kamala Harris's property during curfew hours. In one of the most brazen cases, authorities arrested a man dressed as a firefighter who was caught burglarizing a home in the evacuation zone. 'Zero tolerance for crime,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. 'If you are bold enough to go into a fire area and attempt to break in homes or [engage in] looting of any type, you will be arrested.' Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said he encountered a man dressed as a firefighter burglarizing a home. 'I saw a gentleman that looked like a firefighter, and I asked him if he was okay because he was sitting down. I didn’t realize we had him in handcuffs. We are turning them over to LAPD because he was dressed like a fireman and he was not. He just got caught burglarizing a home,' Luna said. Meanwhile, firefighter advocacy groups are pushing for permanent pay increases as staffing shortages reach critical levels. While California state firefighters earn approximately $52,000 annually, U.S. Forest Service wildland firefighters make significantly less at about $36,000 per year, with no hazard pay or health insurance benefits. What we know about how the LA wildfires started Federal wildland firefighters currently receive a temporary pay increase authorized by President Joe Biden, extended through March. Without congressional action to make the increase permanent, these firefighters could see their wages cut in half. The crisis is exacerbated by year-round fire seasons, with many firefighters working 18-22 hour shifts under dangerous conditions. 'At base rate, it's 50 to 100% difference between the feds versus an organization like Cal Fire that's paying significantly more,' Luke Mayfield, president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters said. Adding to the strain, a large portion of the federal firefighting workforce is typically laid off outside traditional fire seasons, despite the evolving nature of fire threats. 'A lot of that mitigation and management work is hazardous. It should have hazard pay attached to it,' Mayfield said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/ca-firefighters-face-impersonators-staffing-shortages-low-pay/	2025-01-12T17:19:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675913a511c130.57131305.jpeg?w=900
Trump slams officials’ handling of Los Angeles inferno: 'Incompet...	WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump slammed Los Angeles officials’ handling of the wildfires Sunday, calling them 'incompetent' and questioning why they have not yet contained the blaze. 'The fires are still raging in L.A,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.' Death toll reaches 16 in LA wildfires, more wind expected 'Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place. This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?' he concluded. As Los Angeles continues to burn, California politicians have come under sharp criticism by the soon-to-be 47th president, specifically for the state’s water management. Trump has hurled blame at Governor Gavin Newsom (D) – whom he has feuded with for years – for the wildfire crisis, proclaiming he should resign. In a post on his social media site earlier in the week, Trump wrote that Newsom 'refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water' to areas now burning, alleging he prioritized 'small fish' over California residents. Newsom swiped back Saturday, insisting Trump’s accusations were 'made up' and 'delusional.' 'The Delta smelt somehow being culpable of somehow leading to some of the challenges that we face down here… it’s made up, it’s delusional,' Newsom said during an interview on 'Pod Save America'. 'It’s so profoundly ignorant and yet [Trump] absolutely believes it,' Newsom continued. 'It’s not an ignorance on his part, it’s sort of an indelible misinformation that he sort of manifested a falsehood and he decided to bring it into this crisis, in a profoundly demeaning and damaging way.' The governor has since launched a website to combat 'misinformation' being spread about the disaster, which addresses claims on resources, funding, and policies. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues Newsom sent a letter to Trump dated Friday – and publicly posted to his X account – inviting the president-elect to survey the devastation firsthand and meet with fire victims and first responders. The California governor said Trump has not responded to his invitation as of Sunday. At least 16 people have been killed by the inferno in the Los Angeles region, and officials warn there will likely be 'a lot more' added to the death toll. The wildfires have burnt at least 40,000 acres and destroyed at least 12,000 structures.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-los-angeles-wildfires/	2025-01-12T12:36:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192426947.jpg?w=900
Altadena, small LA-area town, decimated by Eaton Fire	(NewsNation) — Rubble and debris litter the small town of Altadena, California, whose approximately 44,000 residents are scrambling after the Eaton Fire destroyed homes, churches, businesses and everything in between. 'Hotel to hotel until I get some assistance. I have nothing but my dogs and me,' said Tonya Robinson, who lives in Altadena, as she fought back tears. 'One thing I do have is God. My church here where I'm at right now, I got food, I got blankets, I got food for my dogs. I got everything that I need right now.' Altadena, about 14 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, is known for its resilient working class. The Eaton Fire was 27% contained as of Sunday morning, according to the Los Angeles National Forest. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., recently spoke to NewsNation about the area, which is within her district. 'Altadena has working people, people who may not have enough money by which to go and rent a hotel, maybe for, you know, months to come,' she said Friday. 'I would like to ask you and any other media individuals that may be listening to do everything that you can to get attention on Altadena.' Waters said the area 'has just about been flattened.' California’s working class overlooked amid wildfires, US rep says Up in flames within four minutes Altadena residents Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling lost their home in the Eaton Fire after evacuating with their 3-year-old daughter, who will turn four soon. 'We went to bed feeling a little uneasy, and I was checking my phone every few minutes for updates,' Kiessling said. The next morning, Rhodes went outside to get the car ready. 'Within minutes, he came inside and said, 'We have to go right now,'' Kiessling said. 'It took four minutes for our house to go up (in flames).' They were one of more than 150,000 who were forced to flee in the greater Los Angeles area. They were only able to grab some clothes and important papers and drove about 40 miles away to stay with friends. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues 11 dead, all from Altadena Eleven people have died from the Eaton Fire, all of which were Altadena residents, NewsNation affiliate KTLA reported. Scenes of devastation have replaced what was once a thriving middle and working class community in Altadena. In a matter of days, thousands have lost their homes. In some cases, entire blocks are wiped off the map. Homes passed down from generation to generation are gone. 'Everything's gone, and it's just so devastating, just my whole neighborhood, both streets, I'm a corner house, and from the small street going down to the street going across, there's no homes, maybe one. And it's just, it's just devastating,' said Kimberly Grant, an Altadena resident and business owner, to NewsNation. Altadena town Councilmember Sylvia Vega detailed the devastation on NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning. 'When something happens, you want to be able to be able to go to your church, you want to be able to go to school and have some normalcy, and for so many in our community, they're not going to have that.' She has a message for her constituents. 'We will rebuild,' Vega said. 'We will survive.' Strained water supply The area is dealing with a water system issue, resulting in unsafe drinking water and a lacking supply. Power outages are widespread as well. The water still needs to be assessed. 'We need to know that our drinking water will be safe,' said Altadena Councilmember Milissa Morona, whose home was spared but neighbors weren't so lucky. 'If winds pick up, I fear I may lose my house as well,' she said. 'When I was leaving my house yesterday a couple days ago, there were tornado-type winds coming at me with fireballs. I don't know that they (firefighters) could have done anything.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/altadena-california-eaton-fire-destruction/	2025-01-12T09:54:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192352117.jpg?w=900
What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events	(NewsNation) — Jan. 20 marks the day President-elect Donald Trump's vision of becoming the U.S. president once again comes true. His inauguration coincides with Martin Luther King Jr. Day — a rare occurrence since MLK Day was made a national holiday in 1983. The only other time the two federal events have been on the same day was the inauguration of Bill Clinton in 1997. What is the Inauguration Day schedule? Every four years, the president-elect and vice president-elect are sworn into office on Jan. 20 in front of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. However, Trump’s inauguration has been moved indoors after forecasts showed bitter cold weather expected for Monday, according to NewsNation’s partner The Hill. Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will take the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda as opposed to the usual location at the west front of the Capitol. Procession to Capitol: By tradition, a procession to the Capitol will kick off the events. Pence said he congratulated Trump on his win at Carter’s funeral President Joe Biden, President-elect Trump and their spouses will travel to the White House, escorted by members of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC). The two presidents will meet briefly and then proceed to the Capitol for the swearing-in ceremonies. Swearing-in ceremonies: Vance will be sworn in first, followed by Trump. The swearing-in ceremony will begin at 11 a.m. CT or 12 p.m. ET. Inaugural address: The chief justice of the Supreme Court will deliver the oath to Trump, who will subsequently give his inaugural address. Every president since George Washington has delivered an inaugural address, according to the JCCIC.

Luncheon: The president, first lady, guests and members of the JCCIC will have a luncheon in the Capitol, a tradition since 1953. Military review and parade: Finally, the president and vice president will make their way to the east front steps of the Capitol where they will review the military troops, who will then lead a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The procession will include ceremonial military regiments, citizens’ groups, marching bands and floats. Past inaugurations Trump's second inauguration undoubtedly brings comparisons to past presidential welcomes. Trump chose not to attend President Joe Biden’s inauguration, making him the first president to skip the inaugural ceremony of his successor in 152 years. Trump will also be the first president sworn in with U.S. flags at half-staff. Flags are at half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter who passed away last month. Trump's inauguration will coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday honoring the civil rights icon on the third Monday of every January. Inauguration Day and MLK Day will be observed on the same day for the second time in history, with President Bill Clinton's second inauguration occurring on MLK Day in January 1997. Trump is expected to become the second president to serve nonconsecutive terms, with Grover Cleveland winning elections in 1884 and 1892.

Police detain 2 near VP Harris’ LA-area home for curfew violation	BRENTWOOD, Cali. (KTLA) — Two people were detained at Vice President Kamala Harris' Brentwood, California, home on Saturday, police confirmed to NewsNation affiliate KTLA. The Los Angeles Police Department said a call came into the West L.A. station around 4:40 a.m. —- during curfew hours, which were set amid the ongoing wildfires — reporting a potential burglary on the vice president’s property. Officers responded to the residence, located on Bundy Drive north of Sunset Drive, and found two individuals on the property. LAPD said officers detained the two people who were breaking curfew, but have since released them as they found no evidence that they were committing a crime. Details are extremely limited, police did not immediately say what the two people were doing on the vice president’s property or whether the incident would be further investigated. National Guard members and local enforcement from the LAPD, Santa Monica Police, and Airport Police Departments reminded residents that they will continue to patrol fire zones from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., ready to arrest anyone for trespassing, looting or any other type of violation. Brentwood, as well as communities in the San Fernando Valley, were growing areas of concern as the Palisades Fire began climbing inland over the mountains on Friday and Saturday. The Palisades Fire, already one of the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history, erupted on Tuesday, Jan. 7. As of Saturday evening, it had claimed 5 lives, burned 23,654 acres and was 11% contained. More than 5,000 structures, many of them homes, have been destroyed in the Pacific Palisades and Malibu. For more updates on the fire, click here. More than one dozen arrests related to suspected looting have already been reported within the Los Angeles area wildfire zones, authorities said last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/police-detain-2-near-vp-harris-la-area-home-for-curfew-violation/	2025-01-12T08:35:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-6-5-e1736696582730.jpg?w=800
Fire watchers' seek to protect Topanga Canyon homes	Lucie Jourdan, who is helping coordinate efforts for a group called 'The Watch,' joins NewsNation to discuss the group's work protecting the community amid the Palisades Fire. Operating under a mandatory evacuation order in Topanga Canyon, 'The Watch' uses an old-school relay system, relying on eyewitness accounts and limited social media connectivity to direct fire crews to critical areas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/fire-watchers-seek-to-protect-topanga-canyon-homes/	2025-01-11T18:04:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-3.jpg?w=900
Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issue...	(NewsNation) — California is battling not only wildfires but also looting, price gouging and challenges with insurance companies. Law enforcement officers have arrested more than 20 people on suspicion of looting in recent days. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna condemned the criminal activity, saying 'it's a despicable crime and you're going to go to jail, bottom line.' California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Saturday he is doubling the National Guard presence to approximately 1,700 troops to combat devastating wildfires. The expanded response includes more than 12,000 first responders and 1,500 pieces of firefighting equipment as multiple blazes continue to threaten the region. ‘Very dire’ conditions ahead for LA wildfires: Weather Service The crisis is compounded by insurance challenges. State Farm canceled 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades last July, representing 70% of their coverage in the area. In response, California has implemented a one-year moratorium on insurance companies canceling or failing to renew policies for homeowners affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Total damage from the devastating wildfires scorching Southern California could amount to $135 billion to $150 billion, according to AccuWeather. The wildfires were previously estimated to cost around $50 billion, $10 billion of which is expected to be insured, according to JPMorgan. California Attorney General Rob Bonta warned residents about potential scams and price gouging, which is illegal during a state of emergency. LA fire chief says city failed department amid ongoing wildfires Officials advise residents to verify credentials and avoid paying for services upfront. The insurance crisis extends beyond California. A Senate report found companies are withdrawing coverage across the country, including in Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama, the Carolinas and New England states, leaving thousands of Americans unable to secure mortgages. Insurers began dropping plans after 2017 and 2018 when back-to-back wildfires in California resulted in losses totaling $23 billion. Insurers paid out twice as much in claims as they received in premiums. That has left major insurers reluctant to do business in the state. Allstate dropped its business entirely in California in 2023, saying it would come back if regulatory changes were made to protect its bottom line. Insurance industry experts attribute the withdrawals to unprofitable risk levels in certain regions, creating a growing national housing accessibility challenge.

LA fire chief says city failed department amid ongoing wildfires	(The Hill) — Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said during an interview Friday that the city failed the department amid the ongoing wildfires in Southern California that have taken at least 11 lives and burned more than 37,000 acres. Crowley was interviewed by Fox11 on Friday and asked if the city of Los Angeles failed her department, referring to the Santa Ynez Reservoir being shut down and empty. The fire department chief, at first, did not answer the question from Fox11 reporter Gigi Graciette, telling her that the department is tasked with protecting the public. Graciette asked again. Crowley did not respond directly. After asking for a third time 'did they fail you?' Crowley responded 'yes.' When asked about the Santa Ynez Reservoir, Crowley said that when firefighters operate in the field, they expect to have water, but if there isn’t any available, 'they’re going to go find water.' 'So my stance on this is when a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water. We don’t control the water supply. Our firefighters are there to protect lives and property and to make sure that we’re properly trained and equipped,' Crowley said Friday. The reservoir in the Pacific Palisades was closed for repairs and empty as wildfires raged through the region, according to multiple media reports. The reservoir normally holds 117 million gallons of water. 'That’s my position on this. So if there’s no water, I don’t know how the water gets to the hydrants. Please defer that to DWP or whomever controls that part,' she added. 'But I can tell you the resiliency of our firefighters. If there’s no water, they’re going to go find water. They’re going to figure out a way to do the best they can with what they’ve got in a very dynamic situation.' The DailyMail reported Friday night that the Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, fired Crowley on Friday afternoon. Bass’s office denied the reporting on Friday night, telling The Hill in an emailed statement that the report 'is false.' LAFD public information officer Erik Scott then wrote on the social media platform X that Bass and Crowley met Friday, but clarified that the fire department head 'was not dismissed and is in full command' of the LAFD. 'Their foremost priorities continue to be fighting the current wildfires and safeguarding Angelenos,' Scott wrote just past midnight on Saturday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-fire-chief-says-city-failed-department-amid-ongoing-wildfires/	2025-01-11T15:11:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25010603828548-e1736603308713.jpg?w=900
What are the risks of wildfire smoke inhalation?	(NewsNation) — As multiple wildfires continue to scorch tens of thousands of acres in the Los Angeles area, people face dangerous air quality levels and exposure to smoke inhalation. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency Friday. Dr. David Hill, board chair of the American Lung Association, joined 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Saturday morning to discuss the health risks of smoke inhalation. 'These are widespread fires producing a lot of smoke that's toxic, and it's a danger to the entire public,' Hill said. 'Everyone breathes, so this is something everyone, particularly in the greater Los Angeles area, has to be taking seriously.' What are the risks of smoke inhalation? There are both short-term and long-term risks. The short-term risks include lung injury, particularly for high-risk groups. 'This is not just wood smoke that's burning. There are dangerous chemicals in houses and in schools and industrial facilities and all these buildings that are burning that are very toxic,' Hill said. High-risk groups include children, pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with preexisting conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease or diabetes. 'But again, anybody who's breathing this toxic smoke is at risk.' Long-term risks include a higher rate of asthma, worsening lung and heart disease and other complications. 'These particles are so small that they get deep into the lungs and cause inflammation and can also pass directly into the bloodstream and cause problems,' Hill said. 'So, we see an increased risk of Parkinson's disease of cognitive decline, which is why everyone needs to limit their exposure to this to the best degree.' How to protect yourself from smoke inhalation Per Hill's recommendations, people in smoky areas should do the following: Evacuate when urged or ordered to do so Pay attention to air quality indexes Stay indoors as much as possible Set air conditioning to recirculation when leaving home or another building Keep windows closed Close any fireplaces Run central A/C if it's available Wear an N-95 mask if going outside 'A cloth mask is not going to stop these particles from getting into your lungs,' Hill said. 'N95 and N100 masks are necessary.' Wildfire smoke can travel long distances. 'Even though you may not be under an evacuation order, it does not mean your air quality is going to be good locally.' Hill urged people to pay attention to air quality indexes available online at airnow.gov.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/wildfire-smoke-inhalation-risks/	2025-01-11T13:48:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/gettyimages-2192534400-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
