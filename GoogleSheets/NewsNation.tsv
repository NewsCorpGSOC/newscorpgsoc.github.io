The billionaires of Trump's proposed administration	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump is a money man, and the billionaire himself will lead a wealthy White House Cabinet should all of his nominations gain Senate approval. The President-elect has a net worth of $5.7 billion, as of Dec. 1, according to Forbes, and he has chosen a slew of fellow billionaires to serve in his second administration. His proposed Cabinet, with Senate confirmation, will include former professional wrestler and WWE co-founder Linda McMahon, Wall Street executive Howard Lutnick, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and hedge fund money manager Scott Bessent -- all billionaires. Donald Trump's new admin.: Who has he chosen so far? Their combined net worths total $10.7 billion, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report's calculations. That's $4.5 billion more than Trump's first-term Cabinet. In comparison, President Joe Biden's Cabinet total net worth was $118 million -- with an M. Trump also selected tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead his inaugural Department of Government Efficiency. These positions do not require Senate confirmation, but they raise the overall net worth of Trump's incoming administration to $344.4 billion.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/the-billionaires-of-trumps-proposed-administration/	2024-12-01T09:07:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Trump-jail_060624_Photo_getty.png?w=900
Heavy snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in a dee...	LOWVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in Buffalo. In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect snow off Lake Ontario can dump several feet of snow at a time, there was up to 46 inches (117 centimeters) in the Barnes Corners area. 'We just keep digging out,' Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said Sunday 'We were out all day yesterday, plowing.' Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck for much of the winter, 'and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a snowblower.' His advice? 'If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow down.' Mikaela Shiffrin suffers abdominal puncture wound in skiing crash In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and provide food and hot drinks. A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’ stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather Risk Communication Center in New York. 'Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over the stadium longer,' the center said in a post on the social media site X. A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy lake-effect snow has produced 'treacherous' conditions that are causing even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to clear city roads. The city estimated Sunday morning that there were 'about 100 cars throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of the way so plows can get through.' Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in western New York along a nearly 134-mile stretch to the Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday, with additional snowfall of 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimeters) possible. In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state to assist. 'I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle, but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy holiday weekend,' she said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more expected through Monday night. Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61 centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan. There were 27 inches (69 centimeters) of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 2 feet (61 centimeters) in Munising, in the eastern area. Lake-effect snow could add more than a foot (30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday. Gaylord, Michigan, received 24.8 inches (63 centimeters) of snow Friday, setting a new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous record of 17 inches (43 centimeters) was set March 9, 1942. The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80 acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809 hectares). It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort's season opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said. 'Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,' Hoeh said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/heavy-snow-and-numbing-temperatures-keep-parts-of-the-us-in-a-deep-freeze/	2024-12-01T08:24:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24336484174642.jpg?w=900
DACA recipients worry protection from deportation won't last anot...	PHOENIX (AP) — Reyna Montoya was 10 when she and her family fled violence in Tijuana and illegally immigrated to the U.S. Growing up in Arizona, she worried even a minor traffic violation could lead to her deportation. She didn't feel relief until 11 years later in 2012, when she received a letter confirming she had been accepted to a new program for immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. 'All of the sudden, all these possibilities opened up,' Montoya said, fighting back tears. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program granted her and hundreds of thousands of others two-year, renewable permits to live and work in the U.S. legally. But as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, after an unsuccessful bid to end DACA in his first term, the roughly 535,000 current recipients are bracing yet again for a whirlwind of uncertainty. Meanwhile, a years-long challenge to DACA could ultimately render it illegal, leaving people like Montoya without a shield from deportation. 'I have to take his (Trump's) words very seriously, that when they say ‘mass deportation,’ it also includes people like me,' said Montoya, who runs Aliento, an Arizona-based advocacy organization for immigrant rights. Uncertainty is nothing new for DACA recipients. As many matured from school age to adulthood, they have witnessed a barrage of legal threats to the program. DACA hasn't accepted new applicants since 2021, when a federal judge deemed it illegal and ordered that new applications not be processed, though current recipients could still renew their permits. The Biden administration appealed the ruling, and the case is currently pending. For those who secured and renewed DACA permits, the benefits have been life-changing. With DACA, Montoya for the first time was able to work legally, get health and dental care, and obtain a driver's license. Many recipients had hoped Vice President Kamala Harris would win the presidency and continue fighting for them. But the reelection of Trump, who has repeatedly accused immigrants of fueling violent crime and 'poisoning the blood' of the United States, has heightened their fears that DACA could end and they could face deportation. Out of caution, some are rushing to renew their permits, according to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which has been providing free legal aid to help them through the extensive process. Others are preparing for potential family separations. Phoenix native and DACA recipient Pedro Gonzalez-Aboyte said he and his immigrant parents, along with his two U.S.-born brothers, recently discussed the possibility of being split. Gonzalez-Aboyte recalled his parents, who immigrated from Mexico, saying that even if they were unable to stay in the country, 'as long as the three of you are here and you're OK, then that's what we want.' 'That was a very real conversation we had,' Gonzalez-Aboyte said. Officials for the Trump transition team did not respond to emailed requests for comment. While it is unclear how Trump could impact DACA this time, he has suggested scaling back other programs that offer temporary protection for immigrants and is staffing his incoming administration with immigration hardliners, including Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan. During his first term, Trump tried to rescind DACA. But in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded his administration ended the program improperly, though it didn't rule on the program's legality. But DACA's fate won’t be immediately left up to Trump, if at all. A three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — regarded as the country's most conservative appeals court — heard arguments in October concerning the legality of DACA. The case, initially filed by Texas and other Republican-led states in 2018, now focuses on a Biden administration rule intended to preserve and fortify DACA. Attorneys for DACA opponents argued that immigrants in the country illegally are a financial burden on states. Meanwhile, the Biden administration, along with intervenors, contend that Texas has not shown the costs it cites are traceable to the policy and, therefore, lacks standing. The panel doesn’t have a deadline to issue a ruling. Regardless, its ruling will likely be appealed, potentially elevating the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell University, said the most likely scenario is the panel affirming that DACA is illegal and that the case goes before the Supreme Court. He doesn't anticipate Trump immediately trying to end DACA but didn't rule out the possibility. 'I don't know that they could actually terminate the program any faster than the current ligation is going,' he said. 'They could still do it, but they've got an awful lot of immigration policy matters on their plate.' Yale-Loehr said the Biden administration is limited in how it could help DACA recipients at this stage, but it could enable recipients to renew their permits early and process them as quickly as possible. Greisa Martinez Rosas is a DACA recipient and executive director of United We Dream, a youth-led advocacy network for immigrants that boasts more than a million members nationwide. She said the immigrant rights movement has grown so much since Trump’s first term, and it’s been preparing for this moment for years, 'building a nimble and responsive infrastructure so that we will make shifts as threats emerge.' She said they’re calling on Americans to offer immigrants sanctuary, preparing to ensure people's physical and psychological safety in case of mass deportations, planning demonstrations and asking for help from the current administration. 'We still have a couple of months for the Biden administration to use every single tool at its disposal to protect and defend as many people as possible,' Martinez Rosas said at a recent press briefing.

Israeli strikes hit southern Lebanon, but tense ceasefire holds	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli jets Sunday launched an airstrike over a southern Lebanese border village, while troops shelled other border towns and villages still under Israeli control, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. The attacks come days after a US-brokered ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike in the village of Yaroun, nor did the Hezbollah militant group. Israel continues to call on displaced Lebanese not to return to dozens of southern villages in this current stage of the ceasefire. It also continues to impose a daily curfew for people moving across the Litani River between 5 pm and 7 am. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and the Lebanese military have been critical of Israeli strikes and overflights since the ceasefire went into effect, accusing Israel of violating the agreement. The military said it had filed complaints, but no clear military action has been taken by Hezbollah in response, meaning that the tense cessation of hostilities has not yet broken down. When Israel has issued statements about these strikes, it says they were done to thwart possible Hezbollah attacks. The United States military announced Friday that Major General Jasper Jeffers alongside senior U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein will co-chair a new U.S.-led monitoring committee that includes France, the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL, Lebanon, and Israel. Hochstein led over a year of shuttle diplomacy to broker the ceasefire deal, and his role will be temporary until a permanent civilian co-chair is appointed. Lebanon meanwhile is trying to pick up the pieces and return to some level of normal life after the war that decimated large swaths of its south and east, displacing an estimated 1.2 million people. The Lebanese military said it detonated unexploded munitions left over from Israeli strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Elsewhere, the Lebanese Civil Defense said it removed five bodies from under the rubble in two southern Lebanese towns over the past 24 hours. The first phase of the ceasefire is a 60-day cessation of hostilities where Hezbollah militants are supposed to withdraw from southern Lebanon north of the Litani River and Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon into northern Israel. Lebanese troops are to deploy in large numbers in the south, effectively being the only armed force in control of the south alongside UNIFIL peacekeepers. But challenges still remain at this current stage. Many families who want to bury their dead deep in southern Lebanon are unable to do so at this point. The Lebanese Health Ministry and military allocated a plot of land in the coastal city of Tyre for those people to be temporarily laid to rest. Dr. Wissam Ghazal of the Health Ministry in Tyre said almost 200 bodies have been temporarily buried in that plot of land, until the situation near the border calms down. 'Until now, we haven’t been able to go to our village, and our hearts are burning because our martyrs are buried in this manner,' said Om Ali, who asked to be called by a nickname that means 'Ali’s mother' in Arabic. Her husband was a combatant killed in the war from the border town of Aita el-Shaab, just a stone’s throw from the tense border. 'We hope the crisis ends soon so we can go and bury them properly as soon as possible, because truly, leaving the entrusted ones buried in a non-permanent place like this is very difficult,' she said. In the meantime, cash-strapped Lebanon is trying to fundraise as much money as it can to help rebuild the country the war cost some $8.5 billion in damages and losses according to the World Bank, and to help recruit and train troops to deploy 10,000 personnel into southern Lebanon. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri also called for parliament to convene to elect a president next month to break a gridlock of over two years and reactivate the country's crippled state institutions. — Chehayeb reported from Beirut.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israeli-strikes-hit-southern-lebanon-but-tense-ceasefire-holds/	2024-12-01T07:53:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/674c87870e6557.88729908.jpeg?w=900
Hamas releases new hostage video of American-Israeli Edan Alexand...	(NewsNation) — The parents of Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas for 421 days, are urging immediate action to secure the release of their son and other captives. Hamas released a propaganda video Saturday showing 20-year-old Alexander alive, marking his first proof of life since being kidnapped during the Oct. 7 attack that killed over 1,000 Israelis. 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us,' Alexander said, mentioning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent $5 million offer for the hostages’ return. Edan's mother, Yael Alexander, told demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening she was shaking upon seeing her son: 'I didn't see Edan for 421 days and to suddenly see him alive, when he cried, I just wanted to hold him.' An Israeli strike in Gaza kills World Central Kitchen workers. Israel says 1 was an Oct. 7 attacker The family is calling on President-elect Donald Trump and President Joe Biden to work together to negotiate the hostages' release. They stressed the urgency, noting that 101 hostages remain in captivity. Edan Alexander, who volunteered for the Israel Defense Forces after high school in 2022, was serving near the Gaza border when captured. In the video, he pleads for Trump to use U.S. influence to bring the hostages home. The U.S. National Security Council condemned Hamas, stating the war in Gaza could end immediately if the terrorist group agreed to release the hostages. Currently, Hamas continues to hold several Americans, including Itay Chen, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Omer Neutra, Gadi Haggai, and Keith Segal. American Hersh Golberg Polin was killed during the initial attack. Netanyahu has spoken with the Alexander family, suggesting conditions are right to negotiate a hostage release. Mother hopes to be reunited with toddler found alone at border '(Netanyahu) reassured me and promised that now, after reaching an arrangement in Lebanon, conditions are right to free you all and bring you home,' Yael said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently returned from Israel, reported that Trump is determined to secure the hostages' freedom and supports a ceasefire that includes a hostage deal. Trump has stated he wants the hostages returned before his potential inauguration on Jan. 20, warning that 'Hamas will be paying a big price' if they are not released. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count but say over half the dead were women and children.

Top 5 education policies Trump may pursue his second term	President-elect Trump has big changes coming for the education world in his second administration. While Trump’s education plans have not been fully laid out, the issues he wants to tackle would fundamentally change how schools operate, from potentially abolishing the Department of Education to advancing a federal school choice program. Here are the top five education policies Trump could enact: Abolishing the Department of Education The most talked about issue Trump has pushed in the education field is abolishing the federal Department of Education. The move is championed by supporters who see the department as a waste of taxpayer money and argue other agencies can take on its essential tasks. While Trump has not said how he would eliminate Education, Project 2025, a conservative blueprint designed for him, lays out a plan striking what it sees as unnecessary programs and moving others such as the Office of Civil Rights to the Justice Department. Homeschooling on the rise after pandemic: Study Killing the department would require buy-in from Congress, which will be under complete Republican control next year. 'I think, making education truly local, and by truly local, I mean parents' is needed, said Vicki Murray, director of the Center for Education at Washington Policy Center and part of Trump's transition team back in 2016. 'Because there's nothing more local than an empowered parent. So, I think that is the underlying theme of President Elect Trump's education policy areas,' Murray added. Federal school choice Federal school choice legislation is a major possibility in the next four years, with Trump citing it as one of his Education secretary nominee's top priorities. Linda McMahon will 'fight tirelessly to expand ‘Choice’ to every State in America,' Trump said in his nomination announcement. The Educational Choice for Children Act, previously introduced in Congress but never signed into law, aims to incentivize donations to nonprofit organizations that provide K-12 scholarships that parents can use to send their children to private schools or other educational pathways besides public schools. The legislation was previously signed on to by Trump’s running mate, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. Parents fume over ‘peculiar’ Las Vegas charter school lesson plan Jeanne Allen, founder and CEO of the Center for Education reform, sees the possibility of Trump 'creating a federal program or creating more appetite and ease of funding for school choice programs.' Opponents of school choice fear the federal government will try to impose a mandate on states that don't support the movement. 'We are definitely worried about how the incoming administration may push privatization at the federal level. Whether there will be any compelling states to have voucher programs is also something that we are monitoring,' said Qubilah Huddleston, the manager of Ed Trust’s policy positions on equitable school funding. Student loans Trump has made no specific promises on how he will handle student loan debt, but he has been openly critical of President Biden's efforts on the issue, signaling an end to relief. Biden forgave the most student debt in presidential history, at more than $170 billion. The president also created a new income-drive repayment plan called SAVE that has so far held up in the courts. The Department of Education is also currently going through the negotiated rulemaking process to forgive even more student loans for people in certain situations such as financial hardship. Trump could pull out of both of these initiatives, a likely scenario considering Republican lawsuits against them. In his first term, Trump wanted to phase out the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and limit borrower defense, but did not have support from Congress. 'I think student loans [...] should come under a lot more scrutiny, and I think that's a welcome area of inquiry and a long overdue debate. But the idea of free student loans, student loan forgiveness for some, but not for all, is not the correct policy path at all,' Murray said. Title IX and transgender students Trump has made it clear he will be making changes to Title IX and how transgender students are treated in schools. The president-elect wants to change Biden’s Title IX revisions that gave discrimination protections based on a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. He called the change a 'day one' priority. 'The left-wing gender insanity being pushed at our children is an act of child abuse. Very simple. Here’s my plan to stop the chemical, physical and emotional mutilation of our youth,' Trump said in a video back in January. He has also been open about his desire to ban transgender Americans from the sports teams and locker rooms they choose to use. He has 'been very vocal about withholding federal funds for colleges that have DEI policies and programs where biological males are allowed to compete in women's sports and be in women's locker rooms,' Murray said.

'Rather than indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual and political material, which is what we’re doing now, our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world,' Trump said in a September video. For K-12 schools, Trump has said teaching of critical race theory would result in funds taken away, although only a small fraction of funding for schools comes through the federal government. 'There's been a lot of controversy about politicization in the curriculum and in children's classrooms, whether that's Critical Race Theory, diversity equity, inclusion policies, failing to inform parents about their children's health decisions,' Murray said. 'We have to be very careful of that.' Federal money can have more sway at the college level, and Trump has threatened that cash over DEI programs, which some Republican-controlled states such as Florida have outlawed for state universities. The president-elect said he would 'tax endowments, impose budget reconciliation, and fine institutions ‘up to the entire amount of their endowment’ if they are perceived as having promoted ‘wokeism,’ [which] risks eroding academic freedom, institutional autonomy and the democratic purposes of higher education,' said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/trump-education-policies-dei/	2024-11-30T12:21:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Education-5-things_112824_AP_Alex-Brandon.png?w=900
Israeli strike in Gaza kills World Central Kitchen workers. Israe...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a car in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed five people including employees of World Central Kitchen, and the charity said it was 'urgently seeking more details' after Israel's military said it targeted a WCK worker who was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war. WCK said it was 'heartbroken' by the airstrike and that it had no knowledge anyone in the car had alleged ties to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, saying it was 'working with incomplete information.' It said it was pausing operations in Gaza. The charity's work in Gaza was temporarily suspended earlier this year after an Israeli strike killed seven of its workers, most of them foreigners. The Israeli military in a statement said the alleged Oct. 7 attacker had taken part in the assault on the kibbutz of Nir Oz, and it asked 'senior officials from the international community and the WCK administration to clarify' how he had come to work for the charity. The violence in Gaza raged even as a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appeared to hold, despite sporadic episodes that have tested its fragility. The strike on the vehicle highlighted what aid agencies call the dangerous work of delivering aid in Gaza, where the war has displaced much of the 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger. Palestinian health official Muneer Alboursh confirmed the strike. At Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, a woman held up an employee badge bearing the WCK logo, the word 'contractor' and the name of a man said to have been killed. Belongings — burned phones, a watch and stickers with the WCK logo — lay on the hospital floor. Nazmi Ahmed said his nephew worked for WCK for the past year. He said he was driving to the charity's kitchens and warehouses. 'Today, he went out as usual to work ... and was targeted without prior warning and without any reason,' Ahmed said. In April, a strike on a WCK aid convoy killed seven workers — three British citizens, Polish and Australian nationals, a Canadian-American dual national and a Palestinian. The Israeli military called the strike a mistake. That strike prompted an international outcry and the brief suspension of aid to Gaza by several groups, including WCK. Another Palestinian WCK worker was killed in August by shrapnel from an Israeli airstrike, the group said. Another Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a car near a food distribution point in Khan Younis, killing 13 people including children. Nasser hospital in Khan Younis received the bodies. 'They were distributing aid, vegetables, and we saw the missile landing,' said witness Rami Al-Sori. A woman sat on the ground and wept. Ceasefire appears to hold Efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have faltered repeatedly. But the U.S.- and France-brokered deal for Lebanon appears to be holding after it took effect on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel's military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities, Hezbollah or activists monitoring the conflict there. Israeli aircraft have struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, citing violations, several times since the truce. The Israeli strike in Syria came as insurgents breached the country's largest city, Aleppo, in a shock offensive that brought fresh uncertainty to the region. The truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah calls for an initial two-month ceasefire in which the militants are to withdraw north of Lebanon's Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. Many Lebanese, some of the 1.2 million displaced, streamed south to their homes, despite warnings by the Israeli and Lebanese militaries to stay away from certain areas. 'Day by day, we will return to our normal lives,' said Mustafa Badawi, a cafe owner in Tyre. The toll of conflicts Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said an Israeli drone strike on the village of Rub Thalatheen killed two people and wounded two others. It said another strike hit a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun, and Lebanon’s Health Ministry said three were wounded, including a 7-year-old. Israel's military said it had been operating to distance 'suspects' in the region, without elaborating. Israel says it reserves the right to strike against any perceived violations. Israel has made returning the tens of thousands of displaced Israelis home the goal of the war. But Israelis have been apprehensive about returning. 'No, it will not be like before,' said one Israeli evacuee, Lavie Eini. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas and its assault on southern Israel. Israel and Hezbollah kept up cross-border fire for nearly a year until Israel escalated with an attack that detonated hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. It then launched an intense aerial bombardment campaign that killed Hezbollah leaders including Hassan Nasrallah, and launched a ground invasion in early October. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. Hamas’ October 2023 attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. On Saturday, Hamas released a video of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander. Speaking under duress, Alexander referred to being held for 420 days and mentioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent $5 million offer for the hostages' return. 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us,' Alexander said. Netanyahu's office said the prime minister spoke with Alexander's family after the release of the 'brutal psychological warfare video' that held 'an important and exciting sign of life.' Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count but say over half the dead were women and children. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel, and Mroue reported from Beirut.

Trump may rely on acting secretaries if nominees fail to muster G...	President-elect Trump may need to rely on acting secretaries to fill out his Cabinet as a number of key nominations draw significant concern from key GOP senators. When Senate confirmations are in limbo, especially if there is pushback from lawmakers, presidents can slip nominees into acting roles for at least 210 days. Trump did so across more than 20 Cabinet-level jobs in his first term. Trump’s picks like Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for Health and Human Services secretary, among others, are sure to face some opposition from Senate Republicans. Hegseth, Kennedy, and Linda McMahon, the president-elect’s pick for Education secretary, all are expected to field questions from senators over allegations of sexual misconduct or enabling sexual abuse. Trump’s original pick for attorney general, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), dropped out of the confirmation process just over a week after being named amid allegations of having sex with minors, which he has denied. Senators will question other nominees, like Gabbard, over if they’re qualified for the role or have any conflicts of interests. By February 2020, acting secretaries under the Trump administration served a total of 2,736 combined days, across 22 Cabinet-level jobs, according to a Washington Post analysis. During his first four years in office, Trump had acting officials serve more than three times as much as former President Obama had during his eight years in office. Under Obama, there were 2,202 combined days in which acting officials served. 'I could foresee a situation where he definitely does that, given that he has a record of doing it.' one former Trump administration official said. 'I mean, Chad Wolf was there for how long?' The official was referring to Wolf’s extended stint as acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which lasted 14 months. Some lawmakers pointed in his direction as a prime example of why they are worried at the prospect of acting officials taking the helm of some departments and agencies b because Wolf was unable to carry out parts of Trump’s immigration plans. A federal judge in late 2020 invalidated his decision to limit work permits via the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for migrants illegally brought to the U.S. when they were children because Wolf did not have the legal authority to make such a move as acting secretary, rather than being confirmed by the Senate. 'Always a concern for that now,' one Senate Republican told The Hill. 'Biden had several acting, [and] acting cannot make some decisions.' The most glaring example of Trump’s penchant for relying on acting heads centered around the Office of Management and Budget where Russell Vought served as acting director for a year and a half before winning full Senate confirmation. He served in that role while then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney took on the role of acting White House chief of staff. Trump also relied on acting secretaries for sizable stretches elsewhere in his Cabinet. Patrick Shanahan became the longest-serving acting head of the Pentagon with his six-month tenure. Some took on big tasks, like Trump’s last acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller who made a trip to Afghanistan in December 2020 while the Trump administration was working to reduce the U.S. military forces in the country following Trump’s election defeat that year. Former Environmental Protection Agency Administer Andrew Wheeler eventually won full confirmation to lead the agency, but not before having the acting label attached for eight months. However, sources are indicating that Trump world and the transition team is more prepared for this go-around and not moving as haphazardly as 2017. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, said that the plan currently involves stacking departments and agencies to ensure that those underneath a potential acting secretary can keep them up and running effectively. 'You’re going to see people that may be entering an agency that hasn’t been there before, but the deputy secretary is going to be more experienced [and] more seasoned,' Mullin said. 'That’s why you’re going to see it stacked.' Acting roles fall under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which means they are subject to its time limitations and can only run an agency for so long before needing Senate confirmation. Once a vacancy occurs, an acting official is able to serve for 210 days — or nearly seven months — in the role, with that timeline potentially expanding depending on the fate of a Senate confirmation process. If a nominee is rejected, the acting official may serve in the role for an additional 210 days, with the clock resetting while another nominee is under consideration. President Biden’s acting labor secretary Julie Su, who was serving as deputy secretary before former Secretary Marty Walsh left the top post, was unable to win full Senate confirmation to succeed Walsh after moderate lawmakers refused to back her nomination, which also garnered universal GOP opposition. This has left her in her current posture throughout the remainder of the Biden administration. She has been able to serve as acting secretary indefinitely though because she was already confirmed by the Senate for her role as deputy secretary, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said last year. Despite his history, some predict Trump won’t rely on acting secretaries, given the GOP-control of the Senate by a three-vote margin. 'Presidents have generally only resorted to recess appointments and acting leaders after their own party has lost control of the Senate and they’re politically stuck,' said Bruce Mehlman, a GOP lobbyist and former official under President George W. Bush. 'I suspect president-elect Trump intends to get his nominees confirmed by the GOP Senate.' On top of that, selecting nominees that are sure to face tough confirmation fights brings their own challenges to the overall administration and can serve as a distraction from other top properties of the incoming president. A second former administration official during Trump’s first term warned that spending political capital to help controversial nominees puts the Trump agenda at risk. 'This is also related to the apparent bad decision to kick 2025 appropriations until next year with a CR. This will further complicate the confirmation process and take time and energy away from President Trump’s real agenda,' the second ex-official said. 'As in combat, conservation of resources should be a top concern.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/trump-may-rely-on-acting-secretaries-if-nominees-fail-to-muster-gop-support/	2024-11-30T07:07:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Acting_113024_AP_Evan-Vucci.png?w=900
Trump tariffs threaten to crack open North American economies	MEXICO CITY — President-elect Trump’s pledge to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada threatens to upend decades of North American integration, a bumpy process that’s recast the two U.S. neighbors as providers of raw and finished goods for the world’s biggest economy. In some ways, Canada and Mexico have traded places over the past three decades. Before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico was a mid-tier petrostate without a competitive industrial base. Now, its economy is dependent mostly on manufacturing, tourism, agricultural exports and cash sent home by Mexicans abroad. Meanwhile, Canada went from a small but advanced manufacturing economy to an oil and gas giant, funneling massive amounts of hydrocarbons to the United States. Those transformations have both taken place to fit neatly into the U.S. economy’s larger needs. But that three-way integration is facing headwinds, not least from Trump, who on Monday threatened United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) partners with 25 percent across-the-board tariffs on day one of his presidency in retaliation for their roles in migration and the illicit fentanyl trade. 'Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!' Trump posted on Truth Social. At risk, beyond the harmony of North American diplomatic relations, are the fundamentals of the continent’s manufacturing base. 'The value chains — the value chains have been designed around the context of integration,' said Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico’s former secretary of Economy and lead negotiator on the USMCA Value chains or supply chains — producing and assembling parts throughout the continent before putting them into a final product — have become a key competitive advantage for North American industry writ large, and the raison d’être for a broad segment of Mexican industry. Those chains only exist in Mexico thanks to massive infrastructure investments, ranging from road and rail connections to gas pipelines to industrial parks that can cover nearly 10,000 acres. And the value chains extend beyond automotive or TV manufacturers. For example, the gas pipelines in Mexico are pumping U.S. natural gas. Overall U.S. exports of the hydrocarbon, including pipeline exports and liquefied natural gas exports on ships, have ballooned since 2014, when the United States sold 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas abroad, to 7.6 trillion cubic feet in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Pipeline exports go exclusively to Canada and Mexico. In 2014, Canadian imports began to plateau at around a trillion yearly cubic feet of gas, and Mexican pipeline imports took off, reaching 2.24 trillion cubic feet in 2023, according to EIA. Though energy and manufacturing are by far the biggest segments in North American trade, food supplies have also gone through a massive transformation, opening markets for U.S. grain and Mexican produce that have boosted rural areas in both countries. 'These are American farmers’ three largest export markets,' said Farmers for Free Trade Board President Bob Hemesath, an Iowa corn, soybean and hog farmer, referring to Canada, China and Mexico. 'America exported $84.7 billion in food and ag to these three countries alone last year, constituting nearly half of all food and ag exports. Mexico and Canada also have been partners in USMCA and NAFTA, agreements that have grown U.S. ag exports to those countries by nearly 300 percent,' Hemesath added. 'We don’t yet know exactly what action President Trump will take when he enters office. But we do know that a renewed trade war will hurt American farmers. A trade war will mean retaliatory tariffs, lost ag trade markets, a leg up for farm exporters in South America and elsewhere, and billions in lost exports.' Trump, who opposed NAFTA, has in the past threatened to blow up the economic integration that resulted from the 1994 deal. He forced the negotiation of USMCA to replace NAFTA during his first term, and though the two deals had many similarities, at the USMCA signing ceremony he declared the end of 'the NAFTA nightmare' and called the new agreement a 'truly fair and reciprocal trade deal that will keep jobs, wealth and growth right here in America.' Renewed attacks against USMCA are frustrating for some of NAFTA and USMCA’s defenders, most of whom were not pining for a renegotiation of the original deal in 2017. 'Well, basically, what it loses is credibility. Because, as you remember, this agreement was negotiated by the Trump administration, and when a country is not backing its words, in this case, negotiated by the incoming president, well, the first thing you lose is credibility,' Guajardo said. 'Who is going to believe you next time you give your word to an agreement, regardless of the nature of the agreement?' That broader concern, with greater geopolitical considerations, is making some observers weary. 'Violating the terms of our own agreements only ruins our reputation and loses everyone's trust in the USA. And making our mutual defense alliances ‘pay as you go’ Mafia-style protection rackets will not help,' said a former U.S. trade negotiator who asked for anonymity to speak frankly. But there’s a broad recognition that the instability is a feature, not a bug, of Trump’s diplomatic style. Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) of Laredo, a vocal proponent of U.S.-Mexico trade, told NewsNation’s Blake Burman on 'The Hill' that Trump will at the very least get Mexico’s attention with the threats. 'Well, let me put it this way: Laredo’s the largest port; we handle 40 percent of all the trade between the U.S. and Mexico. I know this is a way to negotiate, get some leverage. I know that Mexico will come to the table,' said Cuellar. 'But nobody wants a 25 percent tariff on them, and the Mexicans are threatening to do the same thing, and we don’t wanna get into that.' In 2019, Trump successfully leveraged tariff threats against former Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to force Mexico to enhance its internal immigration enforcement. President Claudia Sheinbaum, López Obrador’s successor and protégé, responded to the renewed threats with a letter raising other grievances, including U.S. illicit gun exports and drug consumption, and vowing tit-for-tat tariffs on U.S. goods. Mexico is the biggest importer of U.S. goods, including energy products such as natural gas. 'President Trump, migration and drug consumption in the United States cannot be addressed through threats or tariffs. What is needed is cooperation and mutual understanding to tackle these significant challenges,' wrote Sheinbaum. 'For every tariff, there will be a response in kind, until we put at risk our shared enterprises. Yes, shared. For instance, among Mexico’s main exporters to the United States are General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford Motor Company, which arrived in Mexico 80 years ago. Why impose a tariff that would jeopardize them? Such a measure would be unacceptable and would lead to inflation and job losses in both the United States and Mexico.' Sheinbaum’s U.S.-Mexico vision — excluding Canada — was a mirror image of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s own reaction, touting U.S.-Canada relations and subtly taking digs at Mexico. Trudeau also reportedly met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday. 'Trump is always using divide and conquer-type techniques. At some point, I believe that that should be a well understood by the other two parties, it is a boat that we're all sharing. There are a lot of Canadian companies in Mexico,' Guajardo said. 'Canada has a lot to lose if Mexico is not in the agreement.' 'So regardless of political rhetoric, that is arising by the next elections in Canada, I think that at the end, most corporate Canadians and Mexico will have to look at this, as we did in the first negotiation,' he added. That bet that cooler heads will prevail also hinges on the incoming Trump administration’s appetite for risk. There is broad agreement among economists that a trade war with Canada and Mexico would raise prices for American consumers, but both countries’ relationships with the United States are asymmetrical, meaning they each stand to lose much more than Trump. And part of Canada’s argument against Mexico — that the Latin American country has a much more extensive trade relationship with China — could backfire, giving Mexico leverage in bilateral negotiations to say it will have no choice but to further expand those ties. Yet even that leverage would likely prove insufficient in the face of a Trump administration willing to tank North American integration. 'Mexico could probably negotiate a bilateral agreement or perhaps sectoral accords with the USA under new and most likely disadvantageous and asymmetric conditions,' said Victor Arriaga, a former Mexican diplomat and editor of a daily newsletter in Mexico on U.S. politics. 'China is no substitute for USMCA; in terms of costs and chain supplies, the U.S. market would still remain attractive. Access to the U.S. market of goods produced in Mexico with Chinese technology would eventually face difficulties. Historically, Mexico’s attempts to diversify trade partners have had limited success.' But consequences for the United States, even if commercially advantageous, could generate global shockwaves. 'When the U.K. left the EU it only screwed itself, but if we leave the USMCA and NATO and all our other alliances, it will screw the world,' said the former U.S. trade negotiator.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-threaten-to-crack-open-north-american-economies/	2024-11-30T06:51:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/riffs-Mex.Can_113024_AP_Evan-Vucci_2e752b.png?w=900
New York state and Michigan brace for lake-effect snow that could...	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The first big snow of the season threatened to bury towns in New York along lakes Erie and Ontario during a hectic holiday travel and shopping weekend. In Michigan, heavy lake-effect snow in northern parts of the state was expected to continue into the weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Gaylord. Some areas of the Upper Peninsula could see up to 3 feet (0.9 meters) of snow Sunday night through to Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Lily Chapman said. As flakes began flying Friday, New York state forecasters warned 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) of blowing and drifting snow could fall in Watertown and other areas east of Lake Ontario through Monday. After an unusually mild fall, as much as 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) of snow were possible along Lake Erie and south of Buffalo from lake-effect bands notorious for pummeling the region with snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) per hour. Lake-effect snow happens when warm moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. 'The lake is 50 degrees (10 degrees Celsius). We’re about six degrees above where we should be this time of year, that’s why we’re seeing these heavy lake-effect events,' Erie County Public Works Commissioner William Geary said. 'The outlook for the next two weeks into December, we’ll probably see some more.' New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a disaster emergency for the targeted counties, allowing state agencies to mobilize resources. Rapidly deteriorating conditions Friday caused closures along Interstate 90, and tandem and commercial vehicles were banned from Interstate 86 in western New York and much of U.S. Route 219 beginning Friday afternoon. 'There’s a considerable number of vehicles going off the road on the 219 currently,' Gregory Butcher, Erie County deputy director for preparedness and homeland security, said at an afternoon briefing. ATVs and snowmobiles were being placed around the county to help first responders if necessary, Butcher said. The Buffalo Bills called for volunteers to potentially shovel snow at Highmark Stadium, where over 2 feet (0.6 meters) of snow was possible before Sunday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers. Last year, a major lake-effect storm forced the NFL to push back the Bills wild-card playoff home game against Pittsburgh from Sunday to Monday. 'It’s going to be slow going, there’s no doubt about that,' Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said, adding the heaviest snow is expected to be over by kickoff. The team, meanwhile, was preparing to play in any conditions. 'We’re trying to stay on top of it,' coach Sean McDermott said Friday. The Bills are 9-2, their best start since 1992, and with a win Sunday they would clinch their fifth straight AFC East title. Lake-effect snow also covered parts of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in a system that is expected to last through the weekend. The area was blanketed in snow by Friday afternoon, with some places already measuring more than a foot (0.3 meters) of snow. 'We’ve got this westerly, northwesterly flow regime and this chilly air mass over the U.P.,' said Chapman of the National Weather Service. 'So it’s a pretty good setup for this long duration lake-effect snowfall event.' Gusty winds, especially near the Great Lakes, has impacted visibility in Michigan and Chapman urged caution on the roads. Joe DeLizio, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Gaylord, said visibility on roads was low but he hadn’t been made aware of any major accidents so far. 'Haven’t heard too much as far as problems, but obviously travel is pretty difficult,' DeLizio said. ___ AP Sports Writer John Wawrow contributed from Orchard Park, New York.

2 Tren de Aragua members tied to viral Aurora video arrested in N...	(NewsNation) — Two Tren de Aragua gang members tied to a viral video showing armed men at an Aurora, Colorado apartment complex were arrested in New York City this week, law enforcement sources confirmed to NewsNation. Danyeer Aramillo Meneses, 23, and Edilson Pena Angulo, 25 — members of the notorious Venezuelan street gang — were taken into federal custody during a Tuesday night raid, sources told NewsNation. Both men were in the U.S. illegally, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesperson said in a statement. Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua now in 16 states: Report The two Tren de Aragua members were allegedly among the armed men seen in a viral security camera video that garnered international attention. In the video, men can be seen walking up a stairwell carrying weapons at an Aurora apartment complex. Pena and Aramillo were also suspected of being involved in an Aug. 18 shooting in Aurora. Both men were charged with two felonies, first-degree burglary and menacing with a firearm, in the Aurora case but hadn't been arrested until now. Tren de Aragua's footprint increasing in the US How they got to New York City or when they arrived is unclear. Sources told NewsNation that the two are in federal custody but their federal indictments remain under seal so it remains to be seen what new charges they could be facing. U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) originally encountered Pena in El, Paso, Texas on April 29, 2023, after he entered the country illegally. USBP issued him a notice to appear and released him on his own recognizance, according to the ICE spokesperson. He was later arrested in Colorado on local charges. An immigration judge ordered Pena removed to Venezuela on Feb. 23, 2024, after he didn't appear in court, the spokesperson said. USBP encountered Aramillo on Sept. 10, 2023, in El Paso, Texas after he entered the United States illegally. He was issued a notice to appear and released. The Aurora Police Department issued an arrest warrant for Aramillo on local charges on Aug. 19, the ICE spokesperson said. Both men are now in ICE custody pending criminal and immigration proceedings. Tuesday's raid was carried out by an NYPD gang task force in coordination with federal agents. The latest arrests are part of an ongoing crackdown by law enforcement as the Venezuelan gang continues to expand its foothold in the United States.

10-year-old found alone at US-Mexico border on Thanksgiving	(NewsNation) — Texas State Troopers rescued a 10-year-old boy after he crossed the U.S.-Mexico border on Thanksgiving Day. The boy, from El Salvador, was ditched by smugglers and left crying in a remote area, unaware if he was in the U.S. or Mexico. The boy said his mother was already in the U.S. and was turned over to Customs and Border Patrol. The only thing the boy had on him was a phone, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. US faith-based missionaries build homes for Mexican poor south of the border 'As many of us are celebrating Thanksgiving with our families &amp; friends. Let’s not forget many children will not get to enjoy the holidays or see their families because they have been placed in a dire situation due to open border conditions, and many more who are trafficked across the southern border are exploited and exposed to a dangerous criminal environment during their journey to the US,' Texas DPS spokesperson Chris Olivarez, said on X, formerly Twitter. Earlier this week, Texas DPS troopers encountered a 4-year-old girl who was also smuggled across the border in Maverick County. She too was alone without her parents. She was carrying only a scrap of paper with a phone number and the name 'Mama Patty.' NewsNation’s Jorge Ventura was able to make contact with a woman in South Carolina who claimed to be the girl’s mother. She said she paid a smuggler $4,500 in Honduras to bring her daughter across the U.S.-Mexico border. Agents rescue 4-year-old girl, baby from smugglers near border 'I found a coyote and I paid for them to bring her to me,' she said. 'She came alone. It was just the coyote. The last time I talked to my daughter was Saturday, and I haven't heard anything since.' It's still unclear when the little girl could be released, or if she will be released to her mother in South Carolina.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/10-year-old-found-alone-us-mexico-border/	2024-11-29T10:21:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2155236116.jpg?w=789
Record Black Friday, holiday shopping expected despite inflation	(NewsNation) — A Black Friday shopping frenzy is expected once again this year. According to Adobe Analytics, consumers spent more than $77.4 billion online between Nov. 1-24, a 10% increase from the previous year.

Notre Dame Cathedral's 5-year rebuild post-fire: timeline	(NewsNation) — The Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris is set to reopen to visitors beginning Dec. 8, more than five years after an accidental fire destroyed the roof's iconic 12th-century spires and interior. Visited by more than 12 million people a year before the fire, the Notre Dame Cathedral had not had major repairs since the mid-1800s, according to the nonprofit Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris. Reconstruction began in 2022 after a two-year 'safety phase' to get the monument stable enough for workers. The restoration project raised $1 billion in pledged donations, with around $148 million remaining for future preservation, as of this month. Here's a timeline of the repairs to restore the 861-year-old Gotchic-era landmark to its beauty. Fire breaks out at Notre Dame Cathedral TOPSHOT - Smoke billows as flames burn through the roof of the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral on April 15, 2019, in the French capital Paris. A huge fire swept through the roof of the famed Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris on April 15, 2019, sending flames and huge clouds of grey smoke billowing into the sky. The flames and smoke plumed from the spire and roof of the gothic cathedral, visited by millions of people a year. A spokesman for the cathedral told AFP that the wooden structure supporting the roof was being gutted by the blaze. (Photo by Fabien Barrau / AFP) (Photo by FABIEN BARRAU/AFP via Getty Images) April 15, 2019: A fire erupted in the upper part of the cathedral, causing extensive damage to the wooden roof, upper walls and wooden spires. Many of the art and religious artifacts were moved to safety, though some suffered smoke damage. Officials at the time said the exact cause of the fire was unknown, but they believed either a short electrical circuit or a cigarette could have sparked the flames. Its stained-glass windows were spared, and no one died. April 17, 2019: French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to have the site rebuilt in five years, the Associated Press reported.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori, File) April 2019 - August 2021: The first step was the safety phase in which experts conducted assessments to determine the damage's extent and to secure the area to prevent further damage. A team of scaffolders, rope technicians, aerial platform workers and crane operators worked to remove the wooden spire at the top of the building, which weighed 200 tons and dangled over 300 feet high, threatening to collapse into the cathedral. Then, workers had to build a scaffolding structure inside to protect the vaults and supportive framework. This $197 million safety phase also included installing tarps above the vaults to protect them from rain and lead decontamination as well as wrapping and protecting gargoyles. June 2020: The pandemic halted work for a few months, but teams were still on track for their five-year timeline. August 2020: Restoration of the 8,000-pipe organ began. The artifact survived the fire but was covered in toxic lead dust, the Associated Press reported.

Apple’s iPads are probably the most likely to receive big discounts this Black Friday, as Apple wants to move inventory, especially of its older iPad Mini, Air and Pro models. We’re also likely to see discounts on previous models of Apple Watches, especially the Apple Watch 8 and Ultra first-generation, since the Series 9 and Ultra 2 just came out. MacBook Air laptops are also looking good for discounts this shopping season. Don’t look for iPhones to go on sale, at least not from the big-box retailers. Instead, check your cellular provider. That said, older models reduce in price when new lines are released, which makes them better deals right now. How to find the best deals on Apple products We’ll be updating this page frequently throughout the Black Friday shopping event. For more Black Friday Apple deals, check Mac blogs and Apple news sites, which often have their own sections dedicated to Apple discounts, as well as couponing and smart shopping sites.

Americans wrongfully detained in China back home for holidays	(NewsNation) — Three Americans held in China were released this week as part of a prisoner swap, just in time for the holidays. Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung landed on a military base Wednesday night in San Antonio, Texas. All of them had been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained by China. Officials and humanitarian aid groups said the three Americans were arrested on arbitrary and unlawful charges. Swidan was arrested on drug charges while on a business trip in Beijing in 2012. He had been sentenced to death. Kai Li and Leung were both imprisoned for espionage charges. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday morning that he spoke to all of the released Americans. 'I'm really happy they're home,' Biden said during a stop in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Mark Swidan's mom posted a picture of her son with the U.S. Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, and Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, on X, and thanked them both.

'My son, American Mark Swidan came off the plane to me last night after 12 years wrongfully detained in China.' Harrison Li, Kai Li's son, said he was thrilled that his father was on his way home along with Swidan and Leung. 'Thank you, @POTUS, and everyone that made this day possible at long last,' Harrison Li wrote. 'Please keep bringing them home.' China's foreign ministry said the U.S. returned four people, including at least three Chinese citizens held for 'political purposes.' Mel Gibson, an actor who has an been an advocate for Swidan’s release, posted a video thanking a number of people, including NewsNation anchor Elizabeth Vargas for continuing to shed light on the issue.

Amazon workers on strike from Black Friday to Cyber Monday	(WFXR) - Amazons workers across 20 countries, including the United States, are striking against what the organizing labor union calls anti-worker and anti-democratic practices. This is the fifth year UNI Global Union has spearheaded the 'Make Amazon Pay' movement with the aim to hold Amazon accountable for 'labor abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy.' US consumer price increases accelerated last month with inflation pressures resilient 'Bezos’s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers’ desire for justice – for union representation – can’t be stopped,' Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union, said. 'We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all. Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said the group is misleading and promotes a false narrative. 'The fact is at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities—all from day one. We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world, and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings,' Hards said. According to UNI, demonstrations are expected in major cities in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/amazon-workers-strike-black-friday-cyber-monday/	2024-11-28T14:44:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/2024-11-21T101736Z_1494844242_MT1PRA78274840_RTRMADP_3_PA-IMAGES.jpg?w=900
Northeast hit with rain, snow amid Thanksgiving Day festivities	The U.S. Northeast has been hit with a winter storm that has brought rain and snow amid Thanksgiving Day festivities and disrupted travel plans for those moving around on the holiday. A 'dynamic mid-latitude cyclone' is spreading scattered showers and thunderstorms onto the East Coast on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Moderate to heavy snow is likely to blanket parts of the interior Northeast while warnings and winter storm watches are in effect in parts of central New England, according to NWS. The Upper Great Lakes may get anywhere from four to eight inches of rain on Thursday. 'In the wake of this front, as temperatures cool further, lake effect snows should expand and intensify as they interact with record warm Great Lakes temperatures for late November,' NWS said while projecting that Florida will be mild to warm over the holiday. This year, over 80 million Americans are expected to travel for Thanksgiving, according to AAA. Nearly 72 million will be driving a car to their destinations to celebrate the holiday. With the winter storm hovering over the Northeast, winter storm advisories are issues in parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York. Rain has hit cities more south like Baltimore and Washington. Despite the rain in New York City, marchers kicked off the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade Thursday morning with a bevy of marching bands, clowns and performances from various artists. The parade saw 22 floats, 15 inflatables, 17 character balloons, 11 marching bands, 700 clowns, singers, performance groups and WNBA champion New York Liberty, The Associated Press (AP) reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/northeast-rain-snow-thanksgiving/	2024-11-28T13:17:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ThanksgivingMacysparade2024.jpg?w=900
Stowaway found on Delta flight from New York City to Paris	(NewsNation) — A Delta Air Lines passenger managed to board a flight from New York City to France without a ticket this week. The flight, Delta 264, was going from New York John F. Kennedy International Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on Tuesday. U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials said the woman bypassed ID and boarding pass checks before getting on the plane but did get physically screened for prohibited items, which she did not have, according to Reuters. 'TSA will independently review the circumstances of this incident at our travel document checker station at JFK,' TSA told Reuters in a statement. See the 10 worst airports for on-time Thanksgiving travel: Report It's unclear if the woman was arrested when the plane landed in France, but police were called to the airport. Delta said in a statement that it is conducting an 'exhaustive investigation' of what happened. 'Nothing is of greater importance than matters of safety and security,' a Delta spokesperson said. The company said it will not comment further at this time given the ongoing investigations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/stowaway-found-delta-flight-from-new-york-city-paris/	2024-11-28T13:08:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671c3af1901688.24453822.jpeg?w=900
Trump says he's planning 'large-scale' ad campaign on fentanyl cr...	President-elect Trump announced plans to launch a 'large-scale' ad campaign on Wednesday with the goal of educating Americans on the effects of fentanyl. 'I will be working on a large scale United States Advertising Campaign, explaining how bad Fentanyl is for people to use - Millions of lives being so needlessly destroyed. By the time the Campaign is over, everyone will know how really bad the horror of this Drug is,' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. The drug is considered a synthetic opioid that resulted in the death of 74,000 last year and 76,000 in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Biden administration created a Trilateral Fentanyl Committee with the U.S., Mexico and Canada to halt the transport of the illegal drug throughout the neighboring countries. President Biden also met with China’s President Xi Jinping in 2023, which resulted in resumed counternarcotics cooperation with the nation, where a majority of chemical precursors for fentanyl are manufactured. Trump hasn’t shared much on how he plans to approach the internal fentanyl crisis in his administration, but he has already warned foreign leaders that high tariffs would be put in place if drugs and illegal immigrants continue to enter the U.S. Trump promised to impose a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office until 'Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country.' He also urged China to give 'any drug dealers' caught shipping fentanyl into the United States the death penalty. If not, the former president said he would add an additional 10 percent on top of any other tariffs placed on the nation. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc responded to Trump’s comments by stating the country places 'the highest priority on border security.' Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum reportedly said she would send a letter to Trump with hopes of sparking an open line of communication. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, admitted 'no one will win a trade war or a tariff war.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fentanyl/trump-says-hes-planning-large-scale-ad-campaign-on-fentanyl-crisis/	2024-11-28T08:55:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zoom-TrumpMAGA_093024_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=900
Covenant House brightens Thanksgiving for homeless youth	(NewsNation) — As Americans gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, an estimated 4.2 million young people across the nation are struggling with homelessness. Covenant House, a national nonprofit organization that provides hope and support to unsheltered young people in cities like Chicago, is trying to brighten the holiday for those it serves.

Covenant House is not just a homeless shelter, but a sanctuary for the millions of American at-risk young people who do not have a permanent place to call home. At locations around the country, the shelters will be providing Thanksgiving meals for clients as part of ongoing efforts to help young adults get back on their feet. The organization has provided support services to more than 1.5 million clients since 1972. Covenant House offers job training as well as mental health support services that help to provide many of those at-risk teens a second chance. 'You have to make a bunch of short-term goals and long-term goals to help yourself,' Sonmontez Paramore, one of the clients Covenant House serves said. 'You can look at the resources, you can get all the help you need, but only you can really help yourself.' Much of Covenant House’s funding comes from its annual Sleep-Out event, a fundraiser that provides people with an idea of what it is like to experience homelessness. A recent event in New York City raised $1.2 million that helps Covenant House continue to serve the country’s youth.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/covenant-house-brightens-thanksgiving-for-homeless-youth/	2024-11-28T05:22:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/1bccc838-70bc-4ac3-a596-d043631475bc_59300e.jpg?w=800
Photos: 100 years of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade	(Stacker) - The 98th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will feature 28 clown crews, 26 floats, 16 giant balloons, 11 marching bands, five performance groups, three 'baloonicles'—cold-air inflatables driven down the parade route, and numerous performers. The parade in New York City, presented by department store chain Macy's, was first held in 1924 under the heading 'Macy's Christmas Parade' to promote holiday sales and spotlight the newly expanded and, at the time, largest in the world Herald Square store in Manhattan. The success of the event led organizers to turn the spectacle into an annual tradition. Each year, the parade ends outside the same Herald Square Macy's location. Stacker curated a selection of photographs from the past century of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to help illustrate the history of the iconic event. Bettmann // Getty Images The event has been televised nationally since 1953 on NBC. The parade at first featured Central Park Zoo animals escorted by Macy's employees and professional entertainers for 6 miles from 145th Street in north Manhattan's Harlem to Macy's. A quarter of a million onlookers lined the streets. Real animals were replaced with balloons in 1927; that same year, the name of the event was changed to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The longest-running parade float is the event's unofficial mascot, Tom Turkey. Tom features moving wings, head, and eyes and usually functions as the lead float in the parade. Bringing up the caboose in virtually all the parades is Santa Claus who ushers in the holiday shopping season with his arrival at Macy's Herald Square. The parade offers a glimpse into pop culture of the time, from beloved children's entertainment to hit Broadway shows and musical acts. The Radio City Rockettes, formed in 1925, have performed in the parade annually since 1957. In 1933, the outside temperature was 69 degrees F, the warmest it's been; 2018 was the coldest day in parade history at 19 degrees F. In 2022, for the first time, the event featured a trio of women hosts. Today, more than 44 million people tune in to watch the parade. Keep reading to learn more about the parade's history and see some iconic shots of the event. Bettmann // Getty Images 1924: Macy's first parade In Macy's first Thanksgiving parade, Santa Claus sat atop a float pulled by a team of horses down Broadway. That year floats, bands, and Central Park Zoo animals were featured in the procession. At the parade's end, Santa Claus was crowned 'King of the Kiddies' on Macy's balcony at the 34th Street entrance. Macy's quickly announced the parade would be an annual event. Underwood Archives // Getty Images 1928: Fish and tigers The large balloons that replaced live zoo animals in 1927 were filled with regular air and had no release valves—they were simply let go to pop in the air following the parade. 1928 marked the first year of Macy's inflating balloons with helium to allow them to float. They were also outfitted with valves so the helium could gradually escape rather than waiting for the balloon to inevitably pop, and featured a return address so anyone who found them could return them and receive a reward. In this photo from 1928, a 35-foot fish and 60-foot-long tiger were featured prominently in the parade. A $100 prize was offered for each balloon recovered after its release. Bettmann // Getty Images 1931: Hippo on parade The Thanksgiving parade enjoyed rapid growth throughout the 1930s, with more than 1 million revelors lining the parade route in 1933. In this 1931 photo, a giant hippopotamus balloon makes its way down Broadway. A blue hippo balloon—possibly this one—released after the parade was still at large several days later, thought to be somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean. George Rinhart/Corbis via Getty Images 1932: Balloon mishaps end rewards In this image, the Felix the Cat balloon is led down Broadway by its four handlers tailed by Terrible Turk and Willie Red Bird. The original Felix the Cat character balloon made its parade debut in 1927, but was destroyed after its post-parade release by a high tension wire in 1931. The Terrible Turk also was destroyed the same year by an electric sign. In 1932, Macy's Tom Cat balloon got stuck in the propeller of a plane when the aviator flying the plane tried recovering the balloon for a reward. While the plane eventually landed safely, that event marked the final year of releasing balloons after the parades and offering prizes for their return to Macy's. Camerique // Getty Images 1939: View from the top Pinnochio, Tin Man, and Uncle Sam make their way along the parade route in 1939. Mickey Mouse made his debut five years earlier with a balloon designed in part by Walt Disney; Mickey's handlers were also dressed as mice. New iterations of Mickey appeared over the next 70 years as the character evolved. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was canceled from 1942-1944 because of supply shortages during World War II, namely helium and rubber. Festivities returned in 1945. The Christmas classic 'Miracle on 34th Street' was released in 1947 and prominently features actual footage from the 1946 parade. 1948 marked the parade's first network television broadcast. Bettmann // Getty Images 1949: Teddy bear on parade The 23rd annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was held Nov. 24, 1949. In this photo, a teddy bear makes its way through Times Square. This parade marked the second appearance for the bear. Other balloons made their debut: Freida the Dachshund, Howdy Doody on the Flying Trapeze, and Macy's Hobo Clown. Bettmann // Getty Images 1952: Space explorer Macy's original character The Giant Spaceman made his debut in 1952's parade, measuring 70 feet long and 40 feet wide and weighing 600 pounds. More than 25 gallons of paint went into painting the astronaut. An estimated 2.25 million people lined the streets for the festivities that year. Bettmann // Getty Images 1955: Flying high Throngs of onlookers pack the sidewalks in Manhattan's Times Square during this 1955 parade. Mighty Mouse, an animated superhero created by Terrytoons, is seen in the back left of the photo. Mighty Mouse made his debut in the Thanksgiving Day parade in 1951; he appeared in 80 short films between 1942-1961. Bettmann // Getty Images 1958: 'I am what I am' Popeye makes his way through Times Square in the 1959 parade. A year earlier, another helium shortage meant balloons were inflated with air and hung from construction cranes to make their way through the parade route. Also in 1958, the first celebrity performances were added with the Benny Goodman sextet. Live music proved a challenge technically and logistically. The parade was transitioning to the now-familiar lip syncing by 1964.

The year marks the first balloon featuring Bullwinkle Moose and the first year for floats with Pinocchio, The Racetrack Grandstand, Cinderella, Peacock, Ferris Wheel, Brigadoon, Meet the Mets, and Santa's Sleigh. Several years later, in 1968, Macy's creative team figured out how to design floats up to 40 feet tall and 28 feet wide that could fold into 12.5-by-8-foot boxes for strategic transportation from New Jersey to Manhattan via the Lincoln Tunnel.

In the coming years, safety concerns troubled '90s-era parades—namely the wind. Strong gusts in 1993 pushed a Sonic the Hedgehog balloon into a Columbus Circle lamppost that broke and hurt a child and off-duty police officer. Four years later, intense winds caused a Cat in the Hat balloon to hit a lamppost, hurling debris into the air that fractured the skull of a spectator who spent 24 days in a coma. The incident, among others, led then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to form a task force. Evan Agostini/Liaison // Getty Images 1995: 'Soaring Spirit' The Soaring Spirit Canoe float, pictured here in 1995, made its debut in the parade in 1986.

See the 10 worst airports for on-time Thanksgiving travel: report	(NEXSTAR) – Depending on what airport your friends or relatives are flying out of, you may want to show a little extra compassion this Thanksgiving. A new study by travel site Kayak ranked the nation's top 50 airports – those with the highest search volumes – by the percentage of flight delays last year on both Thanksgiving and Christmas. While many large, bustling airports landed among the least on-time – think New York's JFK, or Chicago's ORD – the data showed that the size of the airport wasn't always a reliable indicator of delays. The worst in the country was relatively tiny FLL in Fort Lauderdale, where 34% of Thanksgiving flights (and 39% on Christmas!) were delayed. Photo said to show Amelia Earhart’s plane is something else entirely, exploration company says SFO was also among the ten worst, with 24% of flights delayed on Thanksgiving, but travelers who flew out of San Jose likely had a far smoother experience. SJC ranked fifth for the most on-time airports with only 12% of flights delayed last Thanksgiving.

The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) is already bracing for a Thanksgiving travel rush that is expected to break records. The TSA is preparing to screen roughly 2.9 million people on Wednesday and over 3 million on Sunday. Airlines must pay you back for flight cancellations, major delays. How much will you get under new rule? 'These will likely be some of the busiest travel days in U.S. history,' Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Monday. As for dodging flight delays, Kayak's study revealed a clear pattern – the earlier the better. On Thanksgiving last year, delays affected just 10% of flights departing at 5 a.m., a number that nearly doubled by 10 a.m. Overall, however, delays are down in recent years. Kayak found that Thanksgiving cancellations in 2023 dropped by a whopping 28% compared with 2022 – a trend that will hopefully continue in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/see-the-10-worst-airports-for-on-time-thanksgiving-travel-report/	2024-11-28T03:54:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24331776304738.jpg?w=900
Israel says ceasefire with Hezbollah violated, fires on south Leb...	BEIRUT (AP) — At least two people were wounded by Israeli fire in southern Lebanon on Thursday, according to state media. The Israeli military said it had fired at people trying to return to certain areas on the second day of a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. The agreement, brokered by the United States and France, includes an initial two-month cease-fire in which Hezbollah militants are to withdraw north of the Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. The buffer zone would be patrolled by Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said two people were wounded by Israeli fire in Markaba, close to the border, without providing further details. It said Israel fired artillery in three other locations near the border. There were no immediate reports of casualties. An Associated Press reporter in northern Israel near the border heard Israeli drones buzzing overhead and the sound of artillery strikes from the Lebanese side. The Israeli military said in a statement that 'several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire.' It said troops 'opened fire toward them' and would 'actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement.' Israeli officials have said forces will be withdrawn gradually as it ensures that the agreement is being enforced. Israel has warned people not to return to areas where troops are deployed, and says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah if it violates the terms of the truce. A Lebanese military official said Lebanese troops would gradually deploy in the south as Israeli troops withdraw. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media. The ceasefire agreement announced late Tuesday ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that began a day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets, drones and missiles in solidarity. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict steadily intensified for nearly a year before boiling over into all-out war in mid-September. The war in Gaza is still raging with no end in sight. More than 3,760 people were killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. Some 1.2 million people were displaced in Lebanon, and thousands began streaming back to their homes on Wednesday despite warnings from the Lebanese military and the Israeli army to stay out of certain areas. Some 50,000 people were displaced on the Israeli side, but few have returned and the communities near the northern border are still largely deserted. ___ Frankel reported from northern Israel.

Someone was controlling' Hannah Kobayashi, sister says	(NewsNation) — The sister of missing Hawaii woman Hannah Kobayashi said Wednesday that the cryptic text messages Hannah's family received may have been sent by someone else stating it 'feels like someone was controlling her.' 'Intuitively knowing her and being so close to her my entire life, I just know this is absolutely not like her,' Sydni Kobayashi told NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' The family continues to search for Hannah Kobayashi, who was last seen in Los Angeles on Nov. 11 after missing a connecting flight from Maui to New York. Sydni Kobayashi pleaded for compassion and continued support describing her family's anguish as they search for Hannah while mourning the suicide of their father, Ryan Kobayashi. Hannah Kobayashi: Timeline of Hawaiian woman’s disappearance She revealed they are receiving thousands of tips and remain hopeful about finding her, though they are cautious about releasing details to protect the ongoing investigation. Sydni Kobayashi told NewsNation that her sister is 'an amazing and beautiful person' who would never intentionally cause her family distress. Ryan Kobayashi had been searching for his daughter in Los Angeles for nearly two weeks before taking his own life. Sydni described her father as a 'loving, caring, kind-hearted individual' who 'fought until his last breath' to find his daughter. 'We ask that you just give our family some grace,' Sydni said. 'Imagine if it was your loved one.' Hannah Kobayashi may have been taken by stranger: Former FBI agent The disappearance of Hannah Kobayashi Kobayashi was last seen on Nov. 11 after missing a connecting flight from Maui to New York while traveling to visit her aunt. She was reportedly seen at the Grove shopping mall and at a LeBron James event before sending cryptic text messages claiming she had been 'tricked' and that 'Deep State hackers' had stolen her funds. The family said they found the texts suspicious and her phone appeared to have been turned off after sending them. Kobayashi was then seen again the following day at Los Angeles International Airport, speaking to a ticket agent. Kobayashi made two Venmo payments on Nov. 9 — one with a bow-and-arrow emoji and another with the word 'reading.' Later that day, Kobayashi was captured on surveillance exiting the subway system near the stadium where the LA Lakers play. That metro stop is not on the same line that goes to LAX, meaning she would have had to change lines to get to that area. Hannah Kobayashi surveillance video ‘alarmed’ family: Aunt Searching for Hannah Kobayashi Kobayashi was in areas with significant video surveillance that police could be reviewing to find her. The search has been further complicated by the death of Kobayashi's father, Ryan, who took his own life after spending 13 days searching for his daughter. According to the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit, Kobayashi is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs about 140 pounds. She has brown hair and eyes and fair skin with freckles as well as a tattoo that says 'knife' on her forearm. Authorities continue to investigate the disappearance. Anyone with information is urged to contact local law enforcement.

Judge denies Diddy bond request	(NewsNation) — The New York federal judge overseeing Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ criminal case ruled to deny bail Wednesday on the music mogul’s bond request. Combs has been detained for more than two months on charges of racketeering, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. He was denied bail in September and earlier this month when the judge deemed Combs a flight risk because of his money and connections. His attorneys again made their case for bail on Friday. A redacted letter addressed to the judge claimed attorneys found 'even more new information that warrants reopening the bail proceedings.' Menendez brothers set for virtual court appearance Monday Combs’ attorneys say the technology available to him in jail is inadequate for his preparation for a tentative May trial. They’ve proposed conditions, including using a GPS monitor and putting one of Combs’ mansions up as collateral. Prosecutors said Combs has been attempting to intimidate witnesses from behind bars and worry he would continue to interfere with the case if he were released. A man called 911 for help during a home invasion. Las Vegas police fatally shot him Combs’ indictment came after months of speculation about a possible federal investigation tied to civil lawsuits alleging abuse and sexual assault spanning more than 30 years. Diddy indictment The indictment alleges Combs lured in women with promises of a romantic relationship before using intimidation and threats to have them engage in prostitution at reported so-called 'freak offs.' There, victims were allegedly drugged and told to engage in sex acts with male sex workers for an extended period, while someone filmed them. Combs allegedly kept some of the videos, sometimes without the victims’ knowledge. According to the indictment, Combs and the victims often required IV fluids afterward due to physical exertion.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/judge-denies-diddy-bond-request/	2024-11-27T15:06:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6716aaedd9f4e0.63292151.jpeg?w=900
Mexican drug cartels allegedly used crypto to launder money	(NewsNation) — A DEA investigation into Mexican drug cartel money laundering operations found members allegedly utilized the cryptocurrency company Tether to complete illicit transactions, federal court documents said. Tether is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency operation by market capitalization. More than $15.7 million in cryptocurrency was withdrawn during 452 transactions from a single account believed to be involved in the operation, government officials allege. Potato cartel’ conspired to spike frozen potato prices: Lawsuits Investigators noted in the complaint that professional money launderers use a variety of methods to accomplish their goals, including trade-based money laundering, bulk currency smuggling, and virtual currency trading. Cryptocurrency is generally defined as electronically sourced units of value that can be purchased with, sold for, or used as a substitute for currency that is regulated by government agencies, court documents stated. Cartels use cryptocurrency to hide their cash flow Robert Almonte, a former U.S. Marshal and deputy chief with the El Paso Police Department, told NewsNation that cartels have taken advantage of modern technology, including cryptocurrency, to enhance their criminal endeavors. As appears to be the case with Tether, cartel members often hire professional cryptocurrency money launderers to move the money and then pay them a commission based on the total amount of cash they launder, Almonte said. Once the money from the drug proceeds is moved around, it eventually ends up back in cartel hands to further finance their global operations, he added. 'It's difficult to track the cryptocurrency and the exchange of the cryptocurrency,' Almonte said. 'In many cases, these money launderers are moving it around several times before it reaches its final destination. So that's one of the main reasons they are using cryptocurrency because it is so hard to detect.' Why money laundering through crypto is hard to track Almonte said that traditional methods of moving money back and forth between Mexico and countries like the U.S. and China often slow cartel business down and can be more easily traced. By using cryptocurrency, funds move at a faster pace, which can make the work of federal agents investigating cartels much more difficult. Prolific Mexican cartel leader allegedly faked his own death to live ‘life of luxury’ The civil complaint states that cryptocurrency can be quickly transmitted between parties and across national borders. Many cryptocurrencies, including Tether, use what is called a 'blockchain' which provides a ledger of every transaction that is conducted using the network. The blockchain does not list the names of those involved in the transaction but lists the date and time of the transaction, which public addresses were accessed during the transaction, and how much cryptocurrency was exchanged, court documents show. The complaint states that proceeds from the sale of narcotics are returned to drug traffickers within the 'source countries' using various methods, including cryptocurrency. As part of the operation, federal investigators said that drug traffickers contact professional money launderers who are responsible for collecting the currency within the consumer countries and deposit the money into the U.S. banking system. Investigations like this can help spotlight the need for other firms to safeguard themselves against becoming an unknowing agent for the cartels, Almonte said. 'Whatever comes up with technology, be assured the cartels are going to tap into it,' he told NewsNation. 'That's going to get law enforcement not only to look into those types of companies, but look at them more often.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/mexican-drug-cartels-allegedly-crypto-launder-money/	2024-11-27T13:26:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66fc3dbb842f55.56189526.jpeg?w=900
Mother hopes to be reunited with toddler found alone at border	(NewsNation) — Agents have encountered 100 unaccompanied children at the southern border since Sunday, including one child carrying a scrap of paper with a name and telephone. Originally reported as a two-year-old girl, the child's mother says she is actually four. The girl's story touched millions after it was shared by the Texas Department of Public Safety. The unnamed girl had a note with her when she encountered agents, with a phone number and first name. WATCH: Texas builds border wall at ranch it wants to gift Trump for deportations NewsNation was able to contact a woman who says she is her mother. She is already in the U.S. and said she left her child in the hands of criminal smugglers in Honduras and Mexico in hopes of being reunited. The girl is currently in the custody of U.S. Border Patrol officials, who notified the mother that her daughter had been found alone at the border. The woman, whose first name was Patty, according to the paper, was emotional when asked about her daughter. 'I found a coyote and I paid for them to bring her to me,' the woman said. 'She came alone. It was just the coyote. The last time I talked to my daughter was Saturday, and I haven't heard anything since they told me the coyote had already handed her over to another coyote, but I don't know anything else about her.' The woman said she paid coyotes who normally charge $4,500 to get someone into the U.S. Patty said she did not know the smugglers she paid to bring her child to the U.S. and said they stopped answering her calls as her daughter got closer to the border. Trump ‘border czar’ willing to ‘jail’ Denver mayor over deportation position 'I had one of their numbers, but they're not answering me,' Patty said. 'They told me they were done with their job delivering my daughter to immigration.' Patty said she was happy to hear the news that her daughter is now in the U.S. and is waiting for federal officials to release her daughter to her in South Carolina. While the girl's story attracted attention, scenes of young children traveling alone are becoming the new normal along the border. Texas Trooper Sgt. Cardova was the first to encounter the girl. He told NewsNation that, as a father, it immediately reminded him of his own kids. He said he didn't understand how a parent could place their own daughter in the hands of smugglers and felt it was important to share with Americans so they could grasp the reality of what happens along the border. Russian migrants being denied access to asylum process: attorney Patty said she had previously been deported, along with her daughter, after making the trip to the U.S. from Honduras. She then came back alone with a smuggler and saved enough money while in the U.S. to pay smugglers to bring her daughter to the country. It remains unclear when the girl will be released to her mother.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/mother-hopes-reunited-toddler-alone-border/	2024-11-27T12:16:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_cfc1a1.jpg?w=900
Trump Cabinet appointees targeted in violent threats: transition ...	(NewsNation) — Several people who have been nominated for Cabinet positions in President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration have reportedly been targeted in 'violent, unAmerican' threats to their lives and those of their family members, Trump’s transition team said Wednesday. The threats were reportedly made Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, a Trump transition team spokesperson said. The attacks ranged from bomb threats to 'swatting.' 'President Trump and the Transition (team) are focused on doing the work of uniting our nation by ensuring a safe and prosperous future,' the spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement. 'With President Trump as our example, dangerous acts of intimidation and violence will not deter us.' Harris campaign is ‘self-congratulatory’: DNC committee member In response, law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted, Leavitt said. NewsNation has not yet confirmed with law enforcement that the threats took place. In a social media post on Wednesday, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, R-New York, wrote that they received word Thursday morning that their New York residence was the target of a bomb threat. Stefanik, Trump's pick for UN Ambassador, wrote that she, her husband, and their 3-year-old son were driving from Washington to New York when they were informed of the threat. She said that New York State Police and other law enforcement along with the U.S. Capitol Police, responded immediately 'with the highest levels of professionalism.' 'We are incredibly appreciative of the extraordinary dedication of law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe 24/7,' Stefanik wrote. 'We want to share our best wishes to the Update NY community for a happy and safe Thanksgiving. We are especially grateful to our law enforcement officers and military families are are on duty over the holidays.' A recent CBS News/YouGov poll, meanwhile, shows that 59% of the people surveyed approve of the way Trump is handling his transition back to the White House. For instance, 44% of those asked thought Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would be a good choice for Secretary of State. There were 47% who felt that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a good choice to be Secretary for Health and Human Services, and 33% thought the same of Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense. Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence was thought of as a good choice by 36% of people. Leavitt did not say how many Cabinet nominees had been targeted or which of those people nominated for spots in Trump's admininstration reportedly received threats. This is a developing story.

China releases 3 Americans in prisoner swap	(NewsNation) — China has released three American prisoners who were detained for at least eight years, White House officials confirmed Wednesday.

Fugitive on FBI’s ‘Most Wanted Terrorist’ list captured after more than 20 years on run Full details of the swap were not immediately clear. The news comes about two months after China released 68-year-old California pastor David Lin, who was detained for almost 20 years. 'We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People’s Republic of China,' a State Department spokesperson said. 'Soon they will return and be reunited with their families for the first time in many years. Thanks to this Administration’s efforts and diplomacy with the PRC, all of the wrongfully detained Americans in the PRC are home.'

US economy grows at 2.8% pace in third quarter on consumer spendi...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The American economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September on strong consumer spending and a surge in exports, the government said Wednesday, leaving unchanged its initial estimate of third-quarter growth. The Commerce Department reported that growth in U.S. gross domestic product — the economy's output of goods and services — slowed from the April-July rate of 3%. But the GDP report still showed that the American economy — the world's largest — is proving surprisingly durable. Growth has topped 2% for eight of the last nine quarters. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Still, American voters — exasperated by high prices — were unimpressed by the steady growth and chose this month to return Donald Trump to the White House to overhaul the nation's economic policies. He will be supported by Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.5%% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period and fasted growth since the first quarter of 2023. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at a 7.5% rate, most in two years. Still, the third-quarter growth in both consumer spending and exports was lower than the Commerce Department initially estimated. But growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. By contrast, spending on equipment surged. When he takes office next month, President-elect Trump will inherit an economy that looks broadly healthy. Growth is steady. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. Inflation, which hit a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022, has fallen to 2.6%. That is still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, but the central bank felt satisfied enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark interest rate in September and again this month. Most Wall Street traders expect the Fed to cut rates again in December. Mexico suggests imposing its own tariffs in response to Trump's The public still feels inflation's sting: Prices are about 20% higher than they were in February 2021, just before inflation started picking up Trump has promised an economic shakeup. On Monday, for example, he vowed to slap new import taxes on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Mainstream economists view such taxes — or tariffs — as inflationary. That is because they are paid by U.S. importers, who then seek to pass along the higher costs to their customers. Wednesday's report was the second of three looks at third-quarter GDP. The Commerce Department will issue the final report on Dec. 19. © Copyright 2023 Associated Press.

Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire appears to hold and Lebanese begin str...	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — A ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah appeared to be holding Wednesday, as residents in cars heaped with belongings streamed back toward southern Lebanon despite warnings from the Israeli and Lebanese military that they stay away from certain areas. If it holds, the ceasefire would bring an end to nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated in mid-September into all-out war and threatened to pull Hezbollah's patron Iran and Israel into a broader conflagration. It could give some reprieve to the 1.2 million Lebanese displaced by the fighting and the tens of thousands of Israelis who fled their homes along the border with Lebanon. 'They were a nasty and ugly 60 days,' said Mohammed Kaafarani, 59, who was displaced from the Lebanese village of Bidias. 'We reached a point where there was no place to hide.' The U.S.- and France-brokered deal, approved by Israel late Tuesday, calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance. Israel says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah should it violate the terms of the deal. The deal would not address the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, where Israel is still fighting Hamas militants in response to the group’s cross-border raid into southern Israel in Oct. 2023. But President Joe Biden on Tuesday said his administration would make another push in the coming days to try to renew efforts for a deal there. Lebanese are streaming south despite warnings Hours before the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon took effect, Israel launched broad strikes that shook the Lebanese capital Beirut and a volley of rockets from Hezbollah set off air raid sirens across a large swath of northern Israel. But after the ceasefire began early Wednesday, quiet appeared to take hold, prompting waves of Lebanese to head home. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned displaced Lebanese not to return to their villages in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said forces opened fire to push back vehicles that were entering a restricted area. The Lebanese military asked displaced returning to southern Lebanon to avoid frontline villages and towns near the border where Israeli troops are still present until they withdraw. But some videos circulating on social media show displaced Lebanese defying these calls and returning to villages in the south near the coastal city of Tyre. Israeli troops were still present in parts of southern Lebanon after Israel launched a ground invasion in October. On the highway linking Beirut with south Lebanon, thousands of people drove south with their belongings and mattresses tied on top of their cars. Traffic was gridlocked at the northern entrance of the port city of Sidon. Residents will return to vast destruction wrought by the Israeli military during its campaign, which flattened villages where the military said it found vast weapons caches and infrastructure it says was meant to launch an Oct. 7-style attack on northern Israel. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. Hezbollah emerges from the war battered and bloodied, with the reputation it built by fighting Israel to a stalemate in the 2006 war tarnished. Yet its fighters still managed to put up heavy resistance on the ground, slowing Israel’s advance while continuing to fire scores of rockets, missiles and drones across the border each day. 'This is a moment of victory, pride and honor for us, the Shia sect, and for all of Lebanon,' said Hussein Sweidan, a resident returning to Tyre in southern Lebanon, who said he saw the ceasefire as a victory for Hezbollah. Sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard at a main roundabout in the city, as people returning honked the horns of cars and residents cheered. Some Israelis are concerned the deal doesn't go far enough In Israel, the mood was far more subdued, with displaced Israelis concerned that the deal did not go far enough to rein in Hezbollah and that it did not address Gaza and the hostages still held there. 'I think it is still not safe to return to our homes because Hezbollah is still close to us,' said Eliyahu Maman, an Israeli displaced from the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, which is not far from the border with Lebanon and was hit hard by the months of fighting. On Wednesday morning, Kiryat Shmona remained quiet on a cold, rainy day. A handful of people milled about, inspecting damage from earlier rocket attacks, including to the roof of a bus. The town’s shopping mall, which had been hit before, appeared to have new damage, and a rocket was seen stuck in the ground next to an apartment building. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel, more than half civilians, as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. A significant return of the displaced to their communities, many of which have suffered extensive damage from rocket fire, could take months. But Israel can claim major victories in the war, including the killing of Hezbollah’s top leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of its senior commanders, as well as the destruction of extensive militant infrastructure. A complex attack involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, widely attributed to Israel, appeared to show a remarkable degree of penetration of the secretive militant group. The kinds of massive, long-range rocket barrages that many Israelis had feared before the war never fully materialized, either because they were destroyed by Israeli strikes or Hezbollah held them in reserve. Hezbollah also failed to launch any ground attacks across the border, despite evidence presented by the Israeli military that it had invested heavily in preparing for such operations. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

(NewsNation) — The disappearance of Hannah Kobayashi has taken a tragic turn, with experts suggesting she may have been 'snatched' and her father dying by suicide during the search, according to law enforcement and search professionals. Former FBI agent Jennifer Coffindaffer and Dog the Bounty Hunter told NewsNation they believe Kobayashi, 30, may have been taken by a stranger after unusual circumstances surrounding her last known movements in Los Angeles. Kobayashi was last seen on Nov. 11 after missing a connecting flight from Maui to New York. She was reportedly seen at the Grove shopping mall and at a LeBron James event before sending cryptic text messages claiming she had been 'tricked' and that 'Deep State hackers' had stolen her funds. Coffindaffer said law enforcement is carefully reviewing extensive surveillance footage from the airport and train station where Kobayashi was last seen.

Obama, Pelosi did not want Kamala Harris to be nominee: Democratic megadonor Li, on behalf of confused voters and disappointed donors, has been speaking out about the party’s financial woes and frustrations. She called party leaders 'detached from reality' after they discussed how more than $1 billion was spent during the nearly 110-day campaign during an interview with 'Pod Save America' Tuesday. 'They failed to mention that hundreds of millions of dollars went to them and their friends right through these consulting firms. These consultants were the primary beneficiaries of the Harris campaign, not the American people,' Li said. Li said the many in the inner workings of the party share similar frustrations in the aftermath of the election. Kamala Harris disqualified ‘forever’ over Democratic overspending: Donor The Harris campaign can still raise money to recoup some of these debts and pay those who still need it. According to the Federal Election Commission, some House and Senate campaigns end with outstanding debts, such as those owed to campaign vendors. Roll Call, in March 2023, reported that 18 members of the House and Senate started the year with campaign committees with at least $100,000 in unpaid bills. 'If they [the DNC] don't have an explanation as to what happened with the billions of dollars and why hundreds of millions went to consultants, ice cream, private jets, celebrities, I don't think donors are going to be willing to give again,' Li said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/dnc-harris-campaign-self-congratulatory/	2024-11-26T14:01:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672bffe3aa48e7.87321731.jpeg?w=900
Appeals court agrees to end Trump’s classified documents case	The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday granted a request from special counsel Jack Smith to drop President-elect Trump’s Florida documents case, ending the battle to charge him over retaining records with classified markings after leaving office. The order fulfills a request from Smith to end an appeal in the case as it relates to Trump though the case continues for his two co-defendants – valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira. The move comes after Smith similarly moved to dismiss without prejudice Trump’s election interference case, in both cases noting Trump’s coming inauguration and a DOJ policy that bars the prosecution of sitting presidents. In the classified documents case, Smith was fighting a ruling from Judge Aileen Cannon that tossed the case, determining that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed. Legal observers saw the appeal as having a fair chance of success. Cannon’s decision counters 50 years of prior rulings regarding special counsel regulations, and the court has previously reversed one of her decisions. Nonetheless, it brings to an end for Trump a serious case focused largely on his conduct after leaving the White House. It was potentially the stronger of Smith’s two cases after a Supreme Court ruling that determined former presidents retain broad immunity for their conduct while in office. Prosecutors brought both Espionage Act and obstruction of justice charges against Trump after he repeatedly refused requests to return White House records, including defying a subpoena. An unprecedented search of his estate at Mar-a-Lago returned more than 300 documents with classified markings, with photos showing boxes stored in a bathroom and even on a ballroom stage.

5 tips to avoid overspending this holiday season	(NewsNation) — The holiday shopping season is in full swing, and that means an urge to spend, but there are steps you can take to keep your finances on track. Between gifts, food and decorations, consumer spending on the winter holidays is expected to hit a record $902 per person this year, according to the National Retail Federation. But the holiday fanfare can also lead to pressure, pushing families to spend beyond their means. Best Prime Day Deals for 2024: -- Best Black Friday deals to shop from home -- Top holiday discounts under $100 -- Apple products marked down for Black Friday BestReviews is reader-supported and may earn an affiliate commission. Nearly half of Americans feel the most stressed about their finances around the holidays, and this year, about a third of consumers are heading into the shopping season with more than $5,000 in debt, according to a recent CreditKarma report. 4 ways to improve your credit score A separate NerdWallet survey found many credit card users, nearly 30%, are still paying off last year's holiday debt. 'It's really important for people to remember that the holiday season will end, a New Year is coming, and they're still going to have to come face to face with their finances,' said Elizabeth Ayoola, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. Here are five things you can do to avoid overspending this holiday season. Here are 4 tips to get out of credit card debt 1 - Set a budget (and expectations) Ayoola recommends creating a holiday budget and breaking it into separate spending buckets like gifts, travel, food and decorations. Once you have a spending limit for each category, track your expenses and stick to it. According to NerdWallet's survey, just 27% of holiday shoppers have a strict budget for the amount they will spend on gifts this year. If you're unsure where to start, look at what you spent last year. Analyze your previous card statements to understand your habits and identify areas you want to improve. Most importantly, be honest with yourself — and your loved ones — about what you can afford. A transparent family conversation can go a long way. 'Setting those expectations can take the pressure off of you,' Ayoola said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a free budgeting tool to track expenses. NerdWallet also has an online budget worksheet. 2 - Avoid 'spaving' this holiday season Many online retailers offer free shipping once you spend a certain amount, but that deal, and others like it, can also lead to a common pitfall known as 'spaving' — spending more to save more. Credit Karma's survey found that 40% of Americans are more likely to 'spave' while holiday shopping. And nearly as many, 37%, say they typically spend money on themselves while shopping for others. Online deals can be especially tempting during the holidays when companies ramp up their web promotions, but be careful not to overextend, chasing savings with bonus items outside your budget. According to NerdWallet, nearly 30% of consumers bought something they weren't planning on during an annual sales event in the past year. Shopping with intention and sticking to a plan is one way to prevent spaving. Another tactic: Link to specific items on your wish list. 'By linking to the products you want, you can easily add those to your shopping cart without having to peruse the site, which often tempts us to add more than we need to our shopping carts,' Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, said in an email. 3 - Consider paying with cash NerdWallet's survey shows most shoppers (74%) plan to use a credit card for at least some of their holiday gift purchases this year, but research suggests paying with cash may be a better option. That's because studies have shown consumers tend to spend more when they use payment methods other than cash. Part of that is due to a psychological effect known as the 'pain of paying.' It hurts more to hand over physical cash than to swipe a card, and that negative emotion can cause us to spend less. Shopping with credit is especially expensive this year, with some store cards charging upwards of 35% interest. Rates on traditional credit cards are also at record highs. 'With high interest rates on many credit cards, it may not be a smart idea because of all of the interest that you're going to stack up,' Ayoola said. Total credit card debt rose to a record $1.17 trillion last quarter, and according to TransUnion, the average debt per borrower now stands at at $6,380. 4 - Take a break from social media More than a quarter of consumers (27%) in Credit Karma's survey said social media pushes them to overspend during the holidays. That was especially true for Gen Z (46%) and millennials (37%). If you find it hard to resist those highly-targeted digital ads — or feel extra pressure to 'keep up with the Joneses' — consider logging off Facebook and Instagram until the holidays are over. The same logic applies to promotional emails. Don't be afraid to unsubscribe from stores you like to shop at — you can always sign up again later. If you don't want to log off TikTok or Instagram, you can also tweak your account settings to show fewer personalized ads. You might find yourself less tempted to shop. 5 - Create shopping hurdles Spending money has never been easier, so make it harder if you're trying to cut back. Create small obstacles and inconveniences to stop impulse buys. One tip: Remove your credit card details from your web browser so you have to manually enter them each time. 'This will add an extra layer back into your decision-making process, helping you think before you purchase,' Alev said. It could be worth going a step further. 'I've even blocked websites where I know I tend to impulse spend,' Ayoola said. Above all, Ayoola thinks it's helpful to look ahead and set financial goals for the new year. From there, work backward to ensure your holiday spending aligns. 'That way, I have something to look forward to and to reel me back in from spending,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/5-tips-holiday-season/	2024-11-26T12:39:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1245099697-e1727888555636.jpg?w=800
Middle East latest: Israel's Netanyahu announces support for a ce...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he would recommend his Cabinet adopt a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as Israeli warplanes struck across Lebanon, killing at least 23 people. The Israeli airstrikes and evacuation warnings were in a sign that Netanyahu aims to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Hezbollah, meanwhile, had resumed its rocket fire into Israel, triggering air raid sirens across the country's north. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, in support of the Palestinian militant group. That has set off more than a year of fighting escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon and an Israeli ground invasion of the country’s south. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israeli military bases, cities and towns, including some 250 projectiles on Sunday. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, where more than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded in the 13-month war between Israel and Hamas, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. ——— Here's the Latest: Netanyahu recommends his Cabinet approve a Hezbollah cease-fire proposal JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he would recommend his Cabinet adopt a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as Israeli warplanes struck across Lebanon, killing at least 23 people. The Israeli military also issued a flurry of evacuation warnings — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah down to the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. For the first time in the conflict, Israeli ground troops reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River, a focal point of the emerging deal. In a televised statement, Netanyahu said he would present the ceasefire to Cabinet ministers later on Tuesday, setting the stage for an end to nearly 14 months of fighting. Netanyahu said the vote was expected later Tuesday. It was not immediately clear when the ceasefire would go into effect, and the exact terms of the deal were not released. The deal does not affect Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, which shows no signs of ending. Israeli strikes in Lebanon’s south and east kill at least 13 people BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state media said Israeli strikes on Tuesday killed at least 10 people in Baalbek province the country’s east. At least three people were killed in the southern city of Tyre when Israel bombed a Palestinian refugee camp, said Mohammed Bikai, a representative of the Fatah group in the area. He said several more people were missing and at least three children were among the wounded. He said the sites struck inside the camp were 'completely civilian places' and included a kitchen that was being used to cook food for displaced people. Israelis protest for a Gaza hostage release deal JERUSALEM — Dozens of Israeli protesters took to a major highway in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening to call for the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, as the country awaited news of a potential ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah. Protesters chanted 'We are all hostages,' and 'Deal now!' waving signs with faces of some of the roughly 100 hostages believed to be still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are thought to be dead. Most of the other hostages Hamas captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack were released during a ceasefire last year. The prospect of a ceasefire deal in Lebanon has raised desperation among the relatives of captives still held in Gaza, who once hoped that the release of hostages from Gaza would be included. Instead of a comprehensive deal, the ceasefire on the table is instead narrowly confined to Lebanon. Dozens of Israelis were also demonstrating against the expected cease-fire, gathering outside Israel’s military headquarters in central Tel Aviv. One of the protesters, Yair Ansbacher, says the deal is merely a return to the failed 2006 U.N. resolution that was meant to uproot Hezbollah from the area. 'Of course that didn’t happen,' he says. 'This agreement is not worth the paper it is written on.' G7 leaders endorse Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire and insist Israel follow international law FIUGGI, Italy — Foreign ministers from the world’s industrialized countries said Tuesday they strongly supported an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and insisted that Israel comply with international law in its ongoing military operations in the region. At the end of their two-day summit, the ministers didn’t refer directly to the International Criminal Court and its recent arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over crimes against humanity. Italy had put the ICC warrants on the official meeting agenda, even though the G7 was split on the issue. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, isn’t a signatory to the court and has called the warrants 'outrageous.' However, the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said all the other G7 countries were signatories and therefore obliged to respect the warrants. In the end, the final statement adopted by the ministers said Israel, in exercising its right to defend itself, 'must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including international humanitarian law.' And it said all G7 members — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – 'reiterate our commitment to international humanitarian law and will comply with our respective obligations.' It stressed that 'there can be no equivalence between the terrorist group Hamas and the State of Israel.' The ICC warrants say there's reason to believe Netanyahu used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. Israel strikes in central Beirut kill at least 7 people and wound 37 BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on Tuesday levelled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded in Beirut, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. It was not immediately clear if anyone in particular was targeted, though Israel says its airstrikes target Hezbollah officials and assets. The Israeli military spokesman issued a flurry of evacuation warnings for many areas, including areas in Beirut that have not been targeted throughout the war, like the capital’s commercial Hamra district, where many people displaced by the war have been staying. The warnings, coupled with fear that Israel was ratcheting up attacks in Lebanon during the final hours before a ceasefire is reached, sparked panic and sent residents fleeing in their cars to safer areas. In areas close to Hamra, families including women and children were seen running away toward the Mediterranean Sea’s beaches carrying their belongings. Traffic was completely gridlocked as people tried to get away, honking their car horns as Israeli drones buzzed loudly overhead. The Israeli military also issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut’s suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Independent Israeli commission blames Netanyahu and others for October 2023 attack TEL AVIV, Israel — The independent civilian commission of inquiry into the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel has found Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly responsible for the failures leading up to the attack, alongside former defense ministers, the army chief and the heads of the security services. The civil commission presented its findings today after a four-month probe in which it heard some 120 witnesses. It was set up by relatives of victims of the Hamas attack, in response to the absence of any state probe. The commission determined that the Israeli government, its army and security services 'failed in their primary mission of protecting the citizens of Israel.' It said Netanyahu was responsible for ignoring 'repeated warnings' ahead of Oct. 7, 2023 for what it described as his appeasing approach over the years toward Hamas, and for 'undermining all decision-making centers, including the cabinet and the National Security Council, in a way that prevented any serious discussion' on security issues. The commission further determined that the military and defense leaders bear blame for ignoring warnings from within the army, and for reducing the army’s presence along the Gaza border while relying excessively on technological means. On the day of the Hamas attack, the report says, the army’s response was both slow and lacking. The civil commission called for the immediate establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack. Netanyahu has opposed launching a state commission of inquiry, arguing that such an investigation should begin only once the war is over. Israeli ground troops in Lebanon reach the Litani River JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says its ground troops have reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River — a focal point of the emerging ceasefire. In a statement Tuesday, the army said it had reached the Wadi Slouqi area in southern Lebanon and clashed with Hezbollah forces. Under a proposed ceasefire, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the Israeli border. The military says the clashes with Hezbollah took place on the eastern end of the Litani, just a few kilometers (miles) from the border. It is one of the deepest places Israeli forces have reached in a nearly two-month ground operation. The military says soldiers destroyed rocket launchers and missiles and engaged in 'close-quarters combat' with Hezbollah forces. The announcement came hours before Israel’s security Cabinet is expected to approve a ceasefire that would end nearly 14 months of fighting. Israeli airstrikes hit buildings near Beirut airport BEIRUT — Israeli jets Tuesday struck at least six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday, including one that slammed near the country’s only airport. Large plumes of smoke could be seen around the airport near the Mediterranean coast, which has continued to function despite its location beside the densely populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah’s operations are based. The strikes come hours before Israel’s cabinet was scheduled to meet to discuss a proposal to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The proposal calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Tuesday’s airstrikes. EU top diplomat calls for urgent aid to Gaza FIUGGI, Italy — EU top diplomat Josep Borrell, whose term ends Dec. 1, said he proposed to the G7 and Arab ministers who joined in talks on Monday that the U.N. Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries have been completely impeded. 'The two-state solution will come later. Everything will come later. But we are talking about weeks or days,' for desperate Palestinians, he said. 'Hunger has been used as an arm against people who are completely abandoned.' It was a reference to the main accusation levelled by the International Criminal Court in its arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Borrell said the signatories to the court, including six of the seven G7 members, are obliged under international law to respect and implement the court’s decisions. Host Italy put the ICC warrants on the G7 agenda at the last minute, but there was no consensus on the wording of how the G7 would respond given the U.S., Israel’s closest ally, has called the warrants 'outrageous.' Italy, too, has said it respects the court but expressed concern that the warrants were politically motivated and ill-advised given Netanyahu is necessary for any deal to end the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Like it or not, the International Criminal Court is a court as powerful as any national court,' Borrell said. 'And if the Europeans don’t support International Criminal Court then there would not be any hope for justice,' he said.

Obama, Pelosi did not want Kamala Harris to be nominee: Democrat ...	(NewsNation) — Democratic megadonor John Morgan joined 'CUOMO' on Monday night to discuss the failed Harris-Walz campaign, claiming former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not want Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee to replace President Joe Biden. Biden stepped down from the presidential race in July, amid pressure from high-ranking Democratic figures. He endorsed Harris no less than an hour later, while former President Obama took five days to endorse Harris on his X page. Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi did not want Kamala Harris 'He did not want to go gently,' Morgan said of Biden. 'He nominated her, basically Obama did not want her. Obama did not endorse her for five days, Pelosi did not want her.' According to Morgan, Biden's endorsement of Harris was an 'F you' to Obama and Pelosi. Democratic overspending disqualifies Harris ‘forever’: Megadonor 'I think it was to say, F you to Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and every representative that was pushing him out... and I think he was pissed,' Morgan told Cuomo. No vote for Kamala Harris as Democratic nominee Morgan said another stumbling block for the Democrats was that voters did not choose Harris in the primaries or caucuses and instead was set in motion by Biden's decision to swiftly nominate his No. 2. 'Pelosi told her California delegation, there will be a conference, there will be a caucus, there will be a convention,' Morgan said, a point touched upon by many Republican politicians and commentators during the process. 'We basically ran on this deal where 'democracy, democracy!' And then we didn't have democracy in picking our nominee.' You can watch the full interview with Morgan on CUOMO in the player below. The failure of Kamala Harris' campaign Morgan, who admitted he did not personally donate to Harris's campaign, criticized the way the campaign handled its funds, saying it could put her presidential future in doubt. Morgan's critique comes amid multiple reports the Harris campaign is $20 million in debt after a lavish spending spree. The megadonor claimed those alleged squandered campaign funds should permanently disqualify her from running for president again. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? 'The same thing is going to follow Harris for the rest of her career. She cannot be trusted with the money, and the donors are going to be, like, ‘Where is this money?'' he said. Lindy Li, a member of the DNC finance committee, told NewsNation’s Rich McHugh the internal strife and monetary confusion at the center of the party led some staffers to leave altogether. The Harris campaign has denied there are any outstanding debts or bills. Morgan argued that despite Harris's performance in the presidential debate against President-elect Donald Trump, her history showed she was unsuitable to take on the Republican party this election cycle. 'We already saw what she looked like on the national stage,' Morgan said. 'Look, she's got to be talented to have done what she did in California. I'll give her that. 'But she was not ready for prime time, and then they rolled her out in prime time, and she got destroyed.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/obama-pelosi-did-not-want-harris-democratic-megadonor/	2024-11-26T09:59:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2180864136.jpg?w=900

Mexico suggests it would impose its own tariffs to retaliate agai...	MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn’t stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border. Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem. 'One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,' Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border. She said Tuesday that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting 'caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.' She also said Mexico had worked to stem the flow of drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, despite an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States. She said the flow of drugs 'is a problem of public health and consumption in your country’s society.' Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. 'If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,' she said. Sheinbaum’s bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term. Back in late 2018, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border — and received other countries’ deported migrants — and Trump backed down on the threats. But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump. However, it's not clear how serious Trump’s threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it’s not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt. 'It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,' Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. 'Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,' Sheinbaum said. 'I hope our teams can meet soon.' Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,' he wrote, complaining that 'thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,' even though violent crime is down from pandemic highs. He said the new tariffs would remain in place 'until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!' 'Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,' he went on, 'and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-mexico-suggests-it-would-impose-its-own-tariffs-to-retaliate-against-any-trump-tariffs/	2024-11-26T06:58:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6745dd41adb339.50622463.jpeg?w=900
Israel bombards central Beirut as its leadership prepares to vote...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli warplanes struck central Beirut and the city's southern suburbs on Tuesday, raising palls of smoke over the Lebanese capital ahead of a planned vote by Israel's leadership on whether to accept a U.S.-brokered ceasefire aimed at ending more than a year of fighting with Hezbollah. The Israeli military also issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut's suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah down to the last moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Israeli ground troops also reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River for the first time in the conflict— a focal point of the emerging ceasefire. A ceasefire was still not a sure thing, but Israel’s security Cabinet, meeting Tuesday afternoon, was expected to approve the U.S.-backed proposal. Lebanese officials have said Hezbollah also supports the deal. If approved by all sides, the deal would be a major step towards ending the Israel-Hezbollah war that has inflamed tensions across the region and raised fears of an even wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's patron, Iran. The deal calls for a two-month initial halt in fighting and would require Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops would return to their side of the border. Thousands of Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor all sides’ compliance. But implementation remains a major question mark. Israel has demanded the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations. Lebanese officials have rejected writing that into the proposal. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz insisted on Tuesday that the military would strike Hezbollah if the U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, doesn’t provide 'effective enforcement' of the deal. 'If you don’t act, we will act, and with great force,' he said, speaking with U.N. special envoy Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said Tuesday that Israel’s security concerns had been addressed in the U.S.-French-brokered deal. 'There is not an excuse for not implementing a ceasefire. Otherwise, Lebanon will fall apart,' Borrell told reporters in Fiuggi, Italy, on the sidelines of a Group of Seven meeting. He said the U.S. would chair a ceasefire implementation committee, and France would participate at the request of Lebanon. Bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs continues Even as Israeli, U.S, Lebanese and international officials have expressed growing optimism over a ceasefire, Israel has continued its campaign in Lebanon, which it says aims to cripple Hezbollah’s military capabilities. An Israeli strike on Tuesday levelled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta - the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. There were no immediate report of casualties. It was not immediately clear if anyone in particular was targeted, though Israel says its airstrikes target Hezbollah officials and assets. Earlier, Israeli jets struck at least six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday. One strike slammed near the country’s only airport, sending large plumes of smoke into the sky. The airport has continued to function despite its location on the Mediterranean coast next to the densely populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah’s operations are based. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in the suburbs, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where UNIFIL is headquartered. Other strikes hit in the southern city of Tyre, where the Israeli military said it killed a local Hezbollah commander. The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, just a few kilometers (miles) from the border. Previous ceasefire hopes were dashed Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the Israeli border. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest Iranian-backed force in the region, would likely significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of a direct, all-out war between Israel and Iran. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it dropped that condition. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have been exchanging barrages ever since. In early September, Israel escalated its campaign of bombardment and sent troops into Lebanon, vowing to put an end to Hezbollah fire. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Hezbollah fire has forced some 50,000 Israelis to evacuate homes in the country’s north, and its rockets have reached as far south in Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers died fighting in the ground offensive in Lebanon. After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted that there could be last-minute hitches that either delay or destroy an agreement. 'Nothing is done until everything is done,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. While the ceasefire proposal is expected to be approved if Netanyahu brings it to a vote in his security Cabinet, one hard-line member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a 'big mistake' and a 'missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.' ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-bombards-beirut-suburbs-as-its-leadership-prepares-to-vote-on-ceasefire-with-hezbollah/	2024-11-26T05:41:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6745d04fa61e23.09179355.jpeg?w=900
Tom Homan, Trump's new border leader, meets with Texas Gov. Greg ...	(NewsNation) — The nation’s incoming border leader Tom Homan is heading to Texas, where’s expected to tour the southern border with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. They’ll be in Eagle Pass on Tuesday, which has been a focus of the state's Operation Lone Star program. Trump pledges Mexico, Canada, China tariffs over border, fentanyl Abbott says Homan is the man for the job — and so does President-elect Donald Trump, who appointed him Homan to the position. Touring the border Homan and Abbott will begin their tour at a Texas military base along the banks of the Rio Grande. Border officials say migrant crossings are down thanks to seasonal trends, federal executive action and Operation Lone Star. 'Priorities for the mass deportation operation are public safety threats and national security threats, Homan said. He’ll be visiting National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers stationed on the border in areas like Edinburg. It’s a region Ron Vitello, a former U.S. Border Patrol chief and retired Immigration and Customs Enforcement director knows firsthand. 'It's well known for drug trafficking,' Vitello said. 'It has, for generations, been a place where cartels have elected used to smuggle a lot of drugs.' Land for mass deportations In that same well-known area, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham is hosting a 'border wall construction kick-off' event. Buckingham is offering a 1,400-acre ranch to the incoming Trump administration for mass deportation facilities. 'We think it's so important for our communities to shut down this trafficking this mass migration of illegal immigrants and get our community safe again,' she said. Homan has promised drastic changes in U.S. border security, including mass deportations on day one of the Trump administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/morninginamerica/tom-homan-border-visit-wall-construction/	2024-11-26T05:01:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HomanTom_061322_AP_Matt-York_4abc2b-e1731322259758.jpg?w=900
Biden proposes Medicare and Medicaid cover costly weight-loss dru...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning. The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure. While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade. 'It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,' U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. 'It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.' The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag. Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese — someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher — would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease. Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese. Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs. The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound to treat obesity. People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat. The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies. Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships. 'For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,' Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-biden-proposes-medicare-and-medicaid-cover-costly-weight-loss-drugs-for-millions-of-obese-americans/	2024-11-26T03:43:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6745b56c72e325.67875198.jpeg?w=900
Trump pledges Mexico, Canada, China tariffs over border, fentanyl	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump on Monday proposed aggressive economic measures against Mexico, Canada and China over concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trump called for a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, citing the influx of migrants and drugs across the United States' borders. 'As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.' The former president also addressed the issue of fentanyl, specifically targeting China's role in the drug trade. How will Trump’s tariffs impact everyday Americans? Trump claimed he had previously discussed the matter with Chinese representatives, who reportedly promised the 'maximum penalty' of death for drug dealers. However, he alleged that no substantial action was taken. As a result, Trump proposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese products, which would be layered on top of existing trade restrictions. Trump pledged during his campaign to impose import taxes of 10 to 20% on all foreign goods, with tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. Canada, Mexico and China are the U.S.’s largest trading partners. Trump’s threat comes days after he announced he would nominate investor Scott Bessent as his Treasury secretary. His selection makes Bessent a key player in implementing Trump trade’s agenda and attempting to keep markets calm amid the expected disruption. American farmers brace for new tariffs under Trump The former president rattled financial markets and key U.S. trading partners throughout his first term with his tariff agenda. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum — including from Canada and Mexico, two close U.S. allies — citing national security concerns. He also compelled both countries to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with terms meant to boost U.S. manufacturing and improve compliance with labor laws. Trump’s most aggressive actions, however, were focused on China. The former president imposed tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods as he pressured Beijing to renegotiate major aspects of the U.S.-China economic relationship.

2-year-old migrant crosses border alone looking for parents in US	(NewsNation) — A 2-year-old girl from El Salvador, traveling alone with nothing more than a piece of paper bearing a phone number, was found by Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) officials, spotlighting the growing crisis of unaccompanied migrant children at the U.S. southern border. Lt. Chris Olivarez told NewsNation that the child was part of a larger group of 60 unaccompanied minors encountered in Eagle Pass ranging in age from 2 to 17 years old. The toddler carried a single piece of paper with a phone number and a name, claiming her parents were already in the United States. 'We don't know who this little girl is going to end up with or who is that person behind that phone number,' Olivarez said. An August Department of Homeland Security report revealed that more than 32,000 unaccompanied children failed to attend immigration hearings between 2019 and 2023, with another nearly 300,000 never receiving a court date. Trump’s mass deportation plans create anxiety among immigrants The child was examined for signs of abuse and turned over to Border Patrol, with her ultimate destination uncertain. Olivarez speculated that increased migration might be linked to potential political changes, suggesting 'desperation to get more kids across by themselves' as a new administration approaches. The Texas DPS reported encountering 211 immigrants in Maverick County, including the 60 unaccompanied children and six immigrants from Mali and Angola. 'This is a stark example of the precarious journey these children make,' Olivarez said in a post on X, highlighting the risks of human trafficking and the vulnerability of unaccompanied minors. National Guard training for mass illegal crossings at border The agency claims to have rescued over 900 children during Operation Lone Star from potential abandonment and human smuggling. Last week, Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, released a report claiming that 'failures' by President Joe Biden’s administration have led to the 'exploitation and abuse of migrant children.' Cassidy launched a formal investigation more than a year and a half ago into the administration’s policies on the treatment and care of unaccompanied children after he said he noticed an alarming rise in illegal child labor.

People are available to talk 24/7. (NewsNation) — The search continues for Hannah Kobayashi, a Hawaiian woman who disappeared after missing a connecting flight to New York at the Los Angeles International Airport. Loved ones have flown to California to form a search party following concerning texts and radio silence from Kobayashi, with volunteers joining the mission as the case grows nationally. According to the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit, Kobayashi is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs about 140 pounds. She has brown hair and eyes and fair skin with freckles as well as a tattoo that says 'knife' on her forearm. Father of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi found dead near LAX Here’s a timeline retracing key moments in Kobayashi's disappearance. Hannah Kobayashi misses connecting flight Nov. 8, 2024: On a trip from Hawaii to New York, Kobayashi misses her connecting flight at LAX. She tells her family she will sleep at the airport that night, with many of her loved ones assuming she's on standby for another plane to New York. Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi went missing. She was last seen in downtown Los Angeles, California. (Los Angeles Police Department) Hannah Kobayashi visits The Grove shopping mall Nov. 9, 2024: The next day, Hannah texted them to say she was sightseeing in Los Angeles, planning to visit The Grove shopping mall and downtown LA, her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, told The Associated Press. Hannah Kobayashi attends Nike event Nov. 10, 2024: Kobayashi posted to Instagram from a Nike event at the same shopping center. A video obtained by the family shows Hannah Kobayashi strolling through the event that day wearing headphones. Hannah Kobayashi texts family; phone turns off Nov. 11, 2024: The Monday after she missed her connecting flight, Kobayashi returned to LAX, according to a USA Today interview with Pidgeon. She told the outlet that Kobayashi spoke to an American Airlines agent between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m., but never boarded a flight. That same day, Kobayashi sends her family 'strange' and 'alarming' texts. One said: 'I got hacked, stripped of my identity, I can’t fly.' Another reads: 'I got tricked pretty much into giving away my funds for someone I thought I loved. I’ve been on the streets.' Family seeks help in search for missing Utah man Pidgeon told NewsNation her niece's phone has been off since the day those texts were sent. 'No one has heard from her. Not a single person has heard from her. And that is unlike Hannah. Hannah checks in,' Pidgeon explained. 'I speak to her two to three times a week. You know, about music, about dancing, you know, a sunset that she saw. You know, she’s just that person. She’s so communicative,' she added. Surveillance footage shows Hannah Kobayashi Nov. 11, 2024: Family members say Kobayashi was spotted on surveillance video around 10 p.m. in downtown LA near the Pico Metro Station. That's roughly a block away from the Crypto.com Arena and near LAX. Pidgeon said the unreleased surveillance footage showed Kobayashi was not alone and that she did not look well in the video. Kobayashi was wearing the same clothing she had worn when she arrived from Maui. Pidgeon told NewsNation that Kobayashi had 'no reason' to visit the metro stop so late at night 'unless she was misled, unless she was forced to or, unfortunately, now we’re thinking, unless she was drugged.' It's unknown when the surveillance video was shown to Kobayashi's family, and it has not yet been released to the public. Family files missing person report for Kobayashi Nov. 12: Following the alarming texts, Kobayashi's family files a formal missing persons report in California. The LAPD Missing Persons Unit posts on social media about her disappearance. Concerned loved ones rally outside Crypto.com Arena Nov. 21, 2024: The rally, held just blocks from where Kobayashi was last seen, calls for her return home. It takes place the same day as the Los Angeles Lakers and Orlando Magic's game, a move to hopefully find new leads in her case. Since there is no hard evidence of a crime or foul play, the family fears her case is not a priority to officers. Hannah Kobayashi's aunt: Police taking case seriously Nov. 22, 2024: Pidgeon tells NewsNation's 'Banfield' that the entire family is playing the 'waiting game' as police have started taking her disappearance more seriously. Unsolved Ohio: Columbus woman missing for nearly seven years Hannah Kobayashi's father found dead near LAX Nov. 24, 2024: Ryan Kobayashi, the father of missing woman Hannah Kobayashi, was found dead in a parking lot near Los Angeles International Airport around 4 a.m. In a statement posted on Facebook by the RAD Movement, a nonprofit organization that works to find people, the organization confirmed the 58-year-old 'tragically took his own life.' The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office and LAPD confirmed his identity. The family said the loss has compounded their suffering 'immeasurably.' 'What the family needs most in this difficult time is for all communities to rally around them with support, compassion, and prayers,' the statement said. 'Please be considerate with your comments and posts. The trauma they are enduring is profound, and they now face the additional burden of grieving the loss of their family’s pillar and navigating next steps.'

Canada braces for surge of immigrants hoping to move from US	(NewsNation) — Canada is bracing for a surge of immigrants to cross the United States' northern border as President-elect Donald Trump continues to press for the largest domestic deportation in American history after he takes office in January. Canadian officials are preparing to add more border patrols and vehicles and plan to set up emergency reception facilities along the border of New York state and the province of Quebec in anticipation of the large number of new arrivals, The New York Times reported. The plans come amid Trump’s pledge to use U.S. military assets and state and local law enforcement to locate and apprehend immigrants with criminal convictions. Meanwhile, Tom Homan, Trump’s appointed 'border czar,' the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has claimed that the northern border may be vulnerable because of insufficient checks that are made on people attempting to enter the U.S. During Trump’s first term in the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau conveyed that his country would be friendly to asylum-seekers at a time when Trump pushed to tighten security along the southern border and threatened to separate families. However, Trudeau recently announced that Canada will significantly reduce the number of immigrants it allows into the country. The Associated Press reported that Trudeau’s Liberal government had come under fire for plans to allow up to 500,000 new permanent residents to enter Canada in each of the next two years. Texas DPS launches first border mounted patrol unit Last week, however, Trudeau said that the figure would drop to 396,000 new permanent residents in 2025 and 380,000 in 2026, the AP reported. In 2027, the number of new permanent residents will drop to 365,000, the prime minister vowed. 'In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn’t get the balance right,' Trudeau told reporters in Toronto, according to the AP. 'Immigration is essential for Canada’s future, but it must be controlled, and it must be sustainable.' Trump responded to Trudeau’s new plans to limit new permanent residents on social media. 'Even Justin Trudeau wants to close Canada’s Borders,' Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform, according to the AP. Trump’s mass deportation plans create anxiety among immigrants Despite the limits announced by the prime minister last week, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have announced plans to bolster the number of agents and vehicles it has along the Canadian border. The agency anticipates a spike in new arrivals into Canada even before Trump is sworn into office on January 20, a spokesman for the agency told the New York Times. 'We knew that if Mr. Trump came into power, the status quo at the border would change,' Sgt. Charles Poirier said. In addition to the Royal Canadian Police, other national security agencies have been preparing for an influx of immigrants moving north in anticipation of Trump’s plan to begin the mass deportation efforts, The New York Times reported. Canadian authorities are also planning to draw up an agreement between Canada and the U.S. to send people seeking asylum back across the border after they cross over, the report said. The newspaper reported that the pact designates both countries as 'safe third countries' so that when asylum-seekers travel from one country to the other, they can be sent back.

Menendez brothers resentencing hearing moved to January	(NewsNation) — A judge is allowing more time for the incoming Los Angeles District Attorney to consider the Menendez brothers case before moving forward with a possible resentencing. The outgoing DA recommended resentencing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. A hearing date was initially set for December, but the judge has now pushed the resentencing hearing to the end of January. Woman charged after car left hanging from parking garage The judge did allow testimony from two elderly witnesses in the family on Monday, one in her 90s and another in her 80s, The murder of Jose and Kitty Menendez In 1989, Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot and killed in their Beverly Hills, California, home. The crime shocked the public and initial speculation included the possibility that it was a mob hit related to Jose Menedez's work in the entertainment industry. Lyle and Erik Menendez were arrested months after their parents' death. During the investigation and their trials, media attention focused on their behavior following the murders, including spending money on apartments, designer clothes and cars. The brothers' first trial ended in a mistrial and in 1994, both men were given life sentences without the possibility of parole. The trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez Defense attorneys argued that both Lyle and Erik Menendez had been sexually abused by their father from a young age and were afraid for their lives. At the time of the murders, both men were legally adults, something the prosecution pointed to as a reason they could have left home instead of killing their parents. Prosecutors characterized the crime as one of greed because they believed they were being written out of their parents' will. 4 kids die in crash when driver takes photo of Florida welcome sign In the first trial, witnesses for the defense included cousins who said they were aware the brothers were being sexually abused. In the second trial, testimony around alleged abuse was limited as were the number of witnesses that could be called. Another controversial element of both trials was evidence from the brothers' psychiatrist, Jerome Oziel, in the form of tapes of therapy sessions. The tapes were allowed after Oziel alleged they had threatened him, allowing him to break patient confidentiality. However, the tapes were initially brought to the attention of investigators not by Oziel himself, but by his former mistress who was also a patient of his. Resentencing recommendation for Lyle and Erik Menendez Last month, Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón announced he supported resentencing the brothers to a sentence of 50 years to life, which would make them eligible for parole immediately. The announcement came following increased public attention to the decades-old case, much of it from social media, with many of the advocates being younger users who weren't alive when the case first took place. Father of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi found dead near LAX Other factors include additional evidence that has been unearthed that supports the claims of sexual abuse and changes in how society understands childhood sexual abuse. At the time of the trial, some suggested it wasn't possible for boys to be abused and there was less public discussion about the long-term psychological impacts of that kind of abuse.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/menendez-brothers-resentencing-january/	2024-11-25T12:16:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6722c1e6434b13.34519485.jpeg?w=900
Trump's mass deportation plans create anxiety among immigrants	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump and his 'border czar' Tom Homan have promised swift action in apprehending and removing immigrants who entered the United States illegally, stoking fear among some asylum seekers who worry they will be forced to leave the country in which many are just starting to settle. Deportation doesn’t set well with Anangela Hernandez, who is among the more than 50,000 immigrants sent to Chicago from Texas. She arrived from Venezuela via Texas with her husband and two children in January. Hernandez agrees immigrants with criminal convictions should not have refuge here. But she worries, like others awaiting asylum or temporary protective status, that she and her family could be targeted by the new administration. Confessions of a cartel hunter: Man frees 200 sex trafficked victims 'Our fear is that the new president comes with other expectations as far as immigrants are concerned,' Hernandez told NewsNation in Spanish. Trump has pledged the largest domestic deportation in American history. Trump and Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), insist their initial primary focus will be criminals who pose a security threat. Tom Homan speaks as Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump listens at a primary election night party in Nashua, N.H., Jan. 23, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke/ File) But Homan doesn’t stop there. 'If you’re in the country illegally, you’re in violation of law, so you’re not off the table,' Homan told NewsNation’s 'CUOMO.' Immigrants worry for their future under Donald Trump Although she entered the country via the CBP One app, Hernandez understood her chosen means of entry came with no long-term guarantees. Hernandez and her husband recently appeared in court in Chicago to submit their asylum application months after receiving their work permits. Although she is convinced the couple is on the right track toward legal U.S. residency, Trump and Homan’s comments stir up emotions. 'He should not go against good working people,' Hernandez said. Homan told 'CUOMO' that the current asylum system allows too many migrants to enter the U.S. based on an initial screening with a 'very low' threshold of proof. In a '60 Minutes' interview this fall, Homan was asked about how mass deportations could happen without separating families. He replied, 'That's not a problem. Families can be deported together.' That is especially concerning for Leticia Alvarez, who arrived in Chicago after making the journey from Venezuela while pregnant. She gave birth to a daughter in March in a Chicago hospital but endured much of her pregnancy alone after her husband, Lisandro Escola, was held in a detention center for seven months in Texas after the couple surrendered after crossing the border. Leticia Alvarez gave birth to her daughter in March in a Chicago hospital after she and her family arrived in late 2023 from Venezuela. (Photo courtesy of Leticia Alvarez) Alvarez previously told NewsNation that she remains uncertain why her husband was detained. He was released just weeks before the couple’s daughter arrived. Knowing that she along with Escola, her infant daughter, husband, and sister could be forced to leave under Trump’s mass deportation plan is difficult enough, she said. But considering the amount of time Escola was detained in Texas creates more anxiety because of Trump’s and Homan's promise to prioritize convicted immigrants. 'It’s something that worried me and that still worries me and my husband,' she told NewsNation in Spanish last week. 'And we’re all that he has,' she also said. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, along with other leaders of Democratic-led sanctuary cities have pledged to protect immigrant families from mass deportation efforts. Homan and Trump have responded by saying that sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts will risk losing federal funding. Despite the threats, Hernandez told NewsNation she refuses to live in fear as an example to her 10-year-old son and 7-year-old son. Instead, she said she and will continue to put trust in the system they used to enter the country. 'We are Venezuelans with a good heart and a faith that is greater than anything else and if we are here, it is because (God) allowed us to be,' Hernandez said in Spanish. 'We cannot wait, nor can we be rushed into something that has not happened yet.' The effort to help protect migrants In Denver, officials with the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said immigrants are bracing for what is coming under Trump. The new administration’s promises and rhetoric surrounding immigrants have created an environment of uncertainty, stress, and fear, the group’s development director, Marine Brichard, said. CIRC recently hosted more than 150 immigrants for a post-election briefing in which many of these concerns were voiced. The organization is planning workshops that instruct immigrants to know the difference between ICE agents and police and to help them understand their legal rights should they appear in court or face deportation. 13 migrants rescued from remote, rugged area of Big Bend Lisa Koop, the national director of legal services for the National Immigration Justice Center, told NewsNation that immigrants have good reason to be fearful. She said they should be considering an action plan that includes speaking to an immigration attorney to better navigate uncertain times. Koop’s office has received an uptick of inquiries from immigrants who are in various stages of waiting for asylum or temporary protective status. Even for those who have been granted immigration protection that affords them some levels of due process, Koop said many fear that could all be stripped away once Trump takes office. 'To me, it’s a great sadness that our country maybe no longer feels like a welcoming place of refuge or is choosing not to be a place of refuge in some ways,' Koop said. Koop believes the process could be expedited because Trump has a better understanding of his presidential power as he prepares for a second White House term. In practice, Koop said enforcement of mass deportation could happen in cycles if officials carry through with targeting convicted immigrants first and then considering others later. But she doesn’t believe that makes everyone else safe. 'I think there is a pretty broad fear and concern about what comes next,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/trumps-mass-deportation-anxiety-immigrants/	2024-11-25T11:24:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1258485376.jpg?w=900
Special counsel moves to dismiss election interference, documents...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal judge on Monday to dismiss the case accusing President-elect Donald Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, citing longstanding Justice Department policy shielding presidents from prosecution while in office. The move announced in court papers marks the end of the Justice Department's landmark effort to hold Trump accountable for what prosecutors called a criminal conspiracy to cling to power in the run-up to his supporters' attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Justice Department prosecutors, citing longstanding department guidance that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, said the department’s position is that 'the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.'

'That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,' the prosecutors wrote in Monday’s court filing. Federal prosecutors also moved Monday to abandon the classified documents case against Trump in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution. The announcement in an appeals court filing in Florida came shortly after a similar filing to dismiss the case accusing Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. The move amounts to a predictable but nonetheless stunning conclusion to a criminal case that just one year ago had been seen as the most perilous legal threat that he faced. It reflects the practical consequences of Trump’s victory, ensuring he enters office free from scrutiny over his hoarding of top secret documents and conduct that prosecutors said had jeopardized national scrutiny. The dismissal had been foreshadowed in recent weeks by the revelation that special counsel Jack Smith was evaluating how to wind down both that case and a separate pending prosecution he brought charging Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Justice Department legal opinions dating back decades say sitting presidents cannot be indicted or prosecuted while in office. The Justice Department believes Trump can no longer be tried in accordance with longstanding policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted. Trump has cast both cases as politically motivated, and had vowed to fire Smith as soon as he takes office in January. The 2020 election case brought last year was once seen as one of the most serious legal threats facing the Republican as he vied to reclaim the White House. But it quickly stalled amid legal fighting over Trump’s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution for acts he took while in the White House. The U.S. Supreme Court in July ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, and sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which allegations in the indictment, if any, could proceed to trial. The case was just beginning to pick up steam again in the trial court in the weeks leading up to this year’s election. Smith’s team in October filed a lengthy brief laying out new evidence they planned to use against him at trial, accusing him of using 'resorting to crimes' in an increasingly desperate effort to overturn the will of voters after he lost to President Joe Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/special-counsel-moves-to-dismiss-election-interference-case-against-president-elect-donald-trump/	2024-11-25T10:33:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24311784190911-e1732559417189.jpg?w=800

Biden pardons turkeys Peach and Blossom as Thanksgiving tradition	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden pardoned the national Thanksgiving turkeys on Monday, as families throughout the United States prepare for their own holiday feasts. Biden pardoned this year’s turkeys Peach and Blossom on the White House South Lawn. The event marked the 77th anniversary of the tradition. Thanksgiving travel: Which dishes are TSA-approved? 'I’m thinking about that arduous trip you guys made,' Biden said. 'And you’re still standing. That trip is 1,100 miles and takes 16.5 hours. Through it all, they stayed calm. They gobbled on — and they’re still gobbling.' Peach, a 4-month-old and 41-pound turkey, loves eating his favorite snack— tater-tot-topped hotdish. While, Blossom, also 4 months old and 40 pounds, prefers cheese curds, according to the National Turkey Federation. The birds will go on to the Minnesota Agricultural Interpretive Center after their pardons and are expected to attend the center’s waffle breakfast and Turkey Trot on Friday. Several former presidents have pardoned turkeys for the Thanksgiving holiday, but the event didn’t become a formal tradition until 1989 under former President George H. W. Bush.

Father of missing Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi found dead near LAX	If you or a loved one are experiencing mental distress, please call or text 988 for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. (NewsNation) — The father of Hanna Kobayashi, a Maui woman who went missing in California, was found dead near Los Angeles International Airport early Sunday morning. At 4 a.m. Sunday, officers responded to the 6100 block of West Century Boulevard for a death investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. An investigation by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office revealed the decedent to be 58-year-old Ryan Kobayashi, according to the LAPD. NBC LA reports that he died after jumping from a parking structure. In a statement posted on Facebook by the RAD movement, a non-profit organization that works to find people, the family said the loss has compounded their suffering 'immeasurably.' 'What the family needs most in this difficult time is for all communities to rally around them with support, compassion, and prayers,' the statement said. 'Please be considerate with your comments and posts. The trauma they are enduring is profound, and they now face the additional burden of grieving the loss of their family's pillar and navigating next steps.' The RAD movement wrote that Hannah Kobayashi's family wants the public to remain focused on looking for her. 'It is crucial for everyone to remain vigilant in their efforts to locate Hannah,' the RAD movement said. Menendez brothers set for virtual court appearance Monday Search for Hannah Kobayashi Hannah Kobayashi, 31, was going from Hawaii to New York to visit family but missed a connecting flight in Los Angeles on Nov. 8, 2024. Earlier sightings of her include one at the Grove Shopping Center, where Kobayashi posted to Instagram from a Nike event on Nov. 10. A video obtained by the family shows Hannah Kobayashi strolling through the event that day wearing headphones. Family members say she was also spotted on surveillance video in downtown LA near a Metro stop about a block away from the Crypto.com Arena. When Hannah Kobayashi went back to LAX on Nov. 11, her family started receiving what they say were 'strange' and 'alarming' text messages from her. One said, 'I got hacked, stripped of my identity, I can’t fly.' Another read, 'I got tricked pretty much into giving away my funds for someone I thought I loved. I’ve been on the streets.' The family filed a formal missing persons report on Nov. 12. According to the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit, Kobayashi is 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and weighs about 140 pounds. She has brown hair and eyes, and fair skin with freckles, as well as a tattoo that says 'knife' on her forearm.

Senators sound alarm over TSA face scan technology	(NewsNation) — Travelers at dozens of airports can expect to have their faces scanned with the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) facial recognition technology. A bipartisan group of senators is sounding the alarm over the technology this morning, calling it 'out of control.' AAA predicts an uptick in travelers this holiday season, putting security technology and TSA manpower to the test at busy airports. Facial recognition technology will be used in a few dozen airports, and the TSA0 plans to expand it to more than 430 airports. Forecasts warn of possible winter storms across US during Thanksgiving week Not everyone feels comfortable with its test run before a full review. Senators Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and John Kennedy, R-La., along with bipartisan support, sent over a letter last week to the TSA inspector general, asking the office to look into the facial recognition technology. They feel it poses risks to passengers' civil liberties. 'This technology will soon be in use at hundreds of major and mid-size airports without an independent evaluation of the technology's precision or audit of whether there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect passenger privacy,' the letter stated. The TSA declined to comment on any discussions with the inspector general but said it will cooperate fully with any possible audit that may happen. TSA Administrator David Pekoske says biometrics such as facial recognition will eventually be required across the board for its efficiency and efficacy. Thanksgiving travel: Which dishes are TSA-approved? For now, the TSA and its administrator stress facial recognition is optional and in no way mandatory. They told NewsNation the technology is the most secure form of identity verification and that they do not retain any personal data from passengers. If you want to opt out of a face scan at an airport, all you have to do is tell the TSA you decline facial recognition. You can proceed normally through security by presenting an identification document, such as a driver's license or passport.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/senators-alarm-tsa-face-scan-technology/	2024-11-25T05:52:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/TSAGettyImages-2166907456-e1724161672354.jpg?w=800
Trump transition: Poll shows people approve of picks for new admi...	(NewsNation) — Lawmakers and leaders have been making their case for and against some of the people President-elect Donald Trump is picking for his incoming administration. A CBS News/YouGov poll, meanwhile, shows that 59% of the people surveyed approve of the way Trump is handling his transition back to the White House. For instance, 44% of those asked thought Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would be a good choice for Secretary of State. There were 47% who felt that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a good choice to be Secretary for Health and Human Services, and 33% thought the same of Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense. Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence was thought of as a good choice by 36% of people. What did Brendan Carr, Trump’s FCC chair pick, say in Project 2025? Although Trump's current selections for agency heads and cabinet picks were rated as a net-positive by those who took CBS' poll, the news outlet notes many had not heard enough about the nominees to rate them yet. There was also a clear partisan divide — however, fewer than half of Democrats polled say they're feeling motivated to actively oppose Trump at this stage. Along with the new administration, Americans are also feeling optimistic about Trump's policies. According to the poll, 44% of people thought that Trump's actions would make food and grocery prices drop, and 35% thought they would cause them to go up. On immigration, 57% are in favor of Trump's planned mass deportations of migrants in the country illegally. When it comes to who should carry those deportations out, 82% said immigration and border patrol agencies should do it; 64% want to leave it to federal law enforcement, and 40% think it should be the U.S. military.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-transition-people-approve-new-admin-picks/	2024-11-25T04:45:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24310038373142-e1731155969822_e32711-e1732201082917.jpg?w=900
Charlotte airport workers strike at outset of busy Thanksgiving t...	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Service workers at Charlotte Douglas International Airport have gone on strike during a busy week of Thanksgiving travel to protest what they say are unlivable wages. Employees of ABM and Prospect Airport Services cast ballots Friday to authorize the work stoppage in North Carolina, which a spokesperson said began Monday morning. Officials with Service Employees International Union announced the impending strike in a statement early Monday, saying the workers would demand 'an end to poverty wages and respect on the job during the holiday travel season.' ABM and Prospect Airport Services contract with American Airlines to provide services including cleaning airplane interiors, removing trash and escorting passengers in wheelchairs. Workers say they previously raised the alarm about their growing inability to afford basic necessities, including food and housing. They described living paycheck to paycheck, unable to cover expenses like car repairs while performing jobs that keep countless planes running on schedule. 'We’re on strike today because this is our last resort. We can’t keep living like this,' ABM cabin cleaner Priscilla Hoyle said in a statement. 'We’re taking action because our families can’t survive.' Several hundred workers were expected to walk off the job and continue the work stoppage throughout Monday. Most of them earn between $12.50 and $19 an hour, which is well below the living wage for a single person with no children in the Charlotte area, union officials said. Charlotte Douglas International Airport officials have said this holiday travel season is expected to be the busiest on record, with an estimated 1.02 million passengers departing the airport between last Thursday and the Monday after Thanksgiving. In addition to walking off the job, striking workers plan to hold an 11 a.m. rally and a 1 p.m. 'Strikesgiving' lunch 'in place of the Thanksgiving meal that many of the workers won’t be able to afford later this week,' union officials said. 'Airport service workers make holiday travel possible by keeping airports safe, clean, and running,' the union said. 'Despite their critical role in the profits that major corporations enjoy, many airport service workers must work two to three jobs to make ends meet.' ABM said it would take steps to minimize disruptions from any demonstrations. 'At ABM, we appreciate the hard work our team members put in every day to support our clients and help keep spaces clean and people healthy,' the company said in a statement last week. Prospect Airport Services said last week that the company recognizes the seriousness of the potential for a strike during the busy holiday travel season.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/ap-charlotte-airport-workers-plan-to-strike-during-busy-thanksgiving-travel-week/	2024-11-25T02:24:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/674450f1353b36.02415033.jpeg?w=900
Forecasts warn of possible winter storms across US during Thanksg...	WINDSOR, Calif. (AP) — Another round of wintry weather could complicate travel leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, according to forecasts across the U.S., while California and Washington state continue to recover from storm damage and power outages. In California, where two people were found dead in floodwaters on Saturday, authorities braced for more rain while grappling with flooding and small landslides from a previous storm. The National Weather Service office in Sacramento, California, issued a winter storm warning for the Sierra Nevada through Tuesday, with heavy snow expected at higher elevations and wind gusts potentially reaching 55 mph (88 kph). Total snowfall of roughly 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast, with the heaviest accumulations expected Monday and Tuesday. The Midwest and Great Lakes regions will see rain and snow Monday and the East Coast will be the most impacted on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, forecasters said. A low pressure system is forecast to bring rain to the Southeast early Thursday before heading to the Northeast. Areas from Boston to New York could see rain and breezy conditions, with snowfall possible in parts of northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. If the system tracks further inland, there could be less snow and more rain in the mountains, forecasters said. 'The system doesn’t look like a powerhouse right now,' Hayden Frank, a meteorologist with the weather service in Massachusetts, said Sunday. 'Basically, this is going to bring rain to the I-95 corridor so travelers should prepare for wet weather. Unless the system trends a lot colder, it looks like rain.' Frank said he isn't seeing any major storm systems arriving for the weekend anywhere in the country so travelers heading home Sunday can expect good driving conditions. Temperatures, however, will get colder in the East while warming up out West. More rain expected after deadly 'bomb cyclone’ on West Coast Two people died in the Pacific Northwest after a rapidly intensifying ' bomb cyclone ' hit the West Coast last Tuesday, bringing fierce winds that toppled trees and power lines and damaged homes and cars. Hundreds of thousands lost electricity in Washington state before powerful gusts and record rains moved into Northern California. Fewer than 25,000 people in the Seattle area were still without power Sunday evening. Two bodies were found Saturday in Sonoma County wine country, north of San Francisco, authorities said. Someone walking on a trail near Santa Rosa found the body of a man in a swollen creek, according to the sheriff's department. Hours later, rescue crews recovered a body inside a vehicle bobbing in floodwaters in nearby Guerneville, Deputy Rob Dillion said. Investigators are trying to determine if the deaths were storm-related. Santa Rosa saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 12.5 inches (32 centimeters) of rain by Friday evening, the National Weather Service in the San Francisco Bay Area reported. Vineyards in nearby Windsor were flooded. Forecasters said the risk of flooding and mudslides remained as the region gets more rain starting Sunday. But the latest storm won't be as intense as last week's atmospheric river, a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land. 'However, there’s still threats, smaller threats, and not as significant in terms of magnitude, that are still going to exist across the West Coast for the next two or three days,' weather service forecaster Rich Otto said. As the rain moves east throughout the week, Otto said, there’s a potential for heavy snowfall at higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, as well as portions of Utah and Colorado. California's Mammoth Mountain, which received 2 feet (.6 meters) of fresh snow in the recent storm, could get another 4 feet (1.2 meters) before the newest system clears out Wednesday, the resort said. Northeast gets needed precipitation Into Thanksgiving, parts of the Midwest and East Coast can expect to see heavy rain, and there’s potential for snow in Northeastern states. A storm last week brought rain to New York and New Jersey, where wildfires have raged in recent weeks, and heavy snow to northeastern Pennsylvania. The precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions after an exceptionally dry fall. 'It’s not going to be a drought buster, but it’s definitely going to help,' said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York. Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains. Higher elevations reported up to 17 inches (43 centimeters), with lesser accumulations in valley cities including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Around 35,000 customers in 10 counties were still without power, down from 80,000 a day ago. In the Catskills region of New York, nearly 10,000 people remained without power Sunday morning, two days after a storm dumped heavy snow on parts of the region. Precipitation in West Virginia helped put a dent in the state’s worst drought in at least two decades and boosted ski resorts as they prepare to open in the weeks ahead.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-forecasts-warn-of-possible-winter-storms-across-us-during-thanksgiving-week/	2024-11-24T18:34:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6743e2d005fa46.62812347.jpeg?w=900
Donald Trump Jr., Elon Musk joke about purchasing MSNBC	(The Hill) -- Donald Trump Jr. and tech billionaire Elon Musk joked on Friday about purchasing MSNBC. It started with Trump Jr., President-elect Trump’s oldest son, sharing a meme about MSNBC being up for sale. Trump Jr. quote-tweeted the meme Friday on X and said 'Hey @elonmusk I have the funniest idea ever!!!' 'How much does it cost,' Musk replied. Musk later responded to the viral interaction, saying the sale would be 'the most entertaining outcome,' while suggesting it would be 'ironic.' Senate Intelligence Committee to ask Gabbard ‘lots of questions’: Lankford The exchange occurred just two days after Comcast, one of the largest media conglomerates in the nation, said it planned to spin off NBCUniversal assets, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, to 'create a new publicly traded company.' Comcast did not mention any indication it would be open to selling MSNBC. Musk’s exchange with Trump Jr. is similar to one he had with a Twitter user in 2017 after he was encouraged to purchase the social media platform. 'How much is it' Musk wrote in December of 2017. In 2022, he bought the social media platform, which was later renamed to X, for $44 billion. Popular podcaster Joe Rogan chimed in on the banter on Friday, telling Musk on X that if the billionaire would buy MSNBC, Rogan would like to replace MSNBC star host Rachel Maddow. New Arizona Democrat weighs in on her win and Harris’s loss 'If you buy MSNBC I would like Rachael Maddow’s job,' Rogan wrote. 'I will wear the same outfit and glasses, and I will tell the same lies.' Some of MSNBC’s hosts, including Maddow, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, have been long-time critics of Trump. The co-hosts of MSNBC’s 'Morning Joe' said on Monday that they went to Mar-a-Lago last week to meet with Trump to discuss toning down the political rhetoric and unifying the country. Brzezinski said it was the first time they met face-to-face with the president-elect in seven years, a meeting that sparked backlash from critics and viewers. Following Trump’s win in the 2024 presidential election over Vice President Harris, MSNBC viewership is down 38 percent, The Wrap reported on Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/musk-msnbc-comcast-trump/	2024-11-24T16:23:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318569633728-e1731532012925_3d1ae4-e1732493115731.jpg?w=800
GOP rep pushes back on Hegseth’s idea to fire 'woke' generals	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) pushed back on Pete Hegseth’s idea to fire 'woke' generals, noting that they are only considered 'woke' because of the Biden administration. Bacon joined NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt on 'The Hill Sunday,' where he noted that as a member of the House, he’s not going to have a say when Hegseth undergoes the Senate confirmation process as President-elect Trump's nominee for Defense secretary. Still, he believes some senators will take issue with some of his 'character issues,' including multiple marriages, infidelity and sexual assault allegations. 'I think I’m in agreement with 90% of what he has to say. I would like to push back on one thing though,' Bacon said, noting Hegseth’s idea for generals. During an interview, President-elect Trump’s new Defense secretary pick outlined proposals to 'fire' the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other 'woke' generals. Hegseth argued that anyone involved with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts has 'got to go.' Bacon noted Sunday that many of those generals may not have wanted to push DEI efforts but were instructed by President Biden to do so. 'He’s the commander in chief and they’re gonna follow the orders of the civilian leadership proposal,' he said.

Drones detected near 3 US bases in England last week: Air Force	(NewsNation) — Small drones were spotted last week around three U.S. Air Force bases in eastern England, the military branch confirmed Saturday. Between Wednesday and Friday, multiple unidentified drones were detected near RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell, which are used by American forces. The drones were actively monitored after being seen near and over the three bases, U.S. Air Forces Europe said in a statement. 'To protect operational security, we do not discuss our specific force protection measures but retain the right to protect the installation,' the Air Force told the Associated Press. 'We continue to monitor our airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets.' 2016 UFO mystery has been solved, Pentagon says The Air Force didn’t identify who was behind the incursions but said base officials determined there was no impact on residents or critical infrastructure. 'We take threats seriously and maintain robust measures at defence sites. This includes counter-drone security capabilities,' a British Ministry of Defense spokesperson told NewsNation. 'We won’t comment further on security procedures.' The Pentagon confirmed with NewsNation that it is looking into the unidentified drones.

What did Brendan Carr, Trump’s FCC chair pick, say in Project 202...	(NewsNation) — Brendan Carr, Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for chair of the Federal Communications Commission, outlined what he wants to see happen at the agency in a chapter for Project 2025. In a statement released after Trump won the election, Carr said 'the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth' — all topics he touched on in Project 2025. Project 2025 is a handbook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, as well as other organizations, outlining what policies and practices they want the next presidential administration to implement. While Trump disavowed the plan on the campaign trail, many people who have worked closely with the President-elect and helped shaped his last administration are involved with the plan. Along with Carr, there are several contributors and authors to Project 2025 whom Trump has chosen for his incoming administration including Russell Vought and Tom Homan. Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt maintained in a statement to the Associated Press that Trump did not have anything to do with Project 2025, and that his nominees and appointments are 'whole-heartedly committed to President Trump’s agenda, not the agenda of outside groups.' Carr was appointed to the FCC by Trump in 2017, and currently serves as one of its commissioners. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Brendan Carr wrote FCC chapter in Project 2025 The objectives Carr outlined in Project 2025 include 'reining in big tech, protecting America's national security, unleashing economic prosperity and holding government accountable.' Those who Carr considers 'big tech' are companies such as Google, Facebook and Youtube, who he says 'attempt to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.' 'The FCC has an important role to play in addressing the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market,' Carr wrote. Section 230 Supporting legislation that 'scraps Section 230's current approach' is part of addressing big tech, Carr said. Section 230 is a section of the Communications Act of 1934 that makes it so online platforms are not held liable for content posted by their users, and so these companies can remove posts that violate their services' standards. In Project 2025, Carr advocated for the FCC working with Congress on 'more fundamental Section 230 reforms that go beyond interpreting its current terms.' Some of the reforms Carr has in mind are ones that prohibit discrimination against what he said were core political viewpoints. 'Transparency rules' are another requirement Carr wants to impose on tech companies. The FCC presently has a rule that broadband providers have to provide disclosures about practices that shape Internet traffic. Carr in Project 2025 suggests that the FCC take a similar approach to 'Big Tech,' and use Section 230 and the Consolidated Reporting Act as potential sources of authority. Progressives begin search for a new leader National Security Although Trump has said he opposes prohibiting TikTok in America, Carr wrote that he wants to address its 'threat to U.S. national security.' Saying the app 'provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information' provided to users, Carr said a new administration should ban TikTok. TikTok says on its website that while its parent company ByteDance Ltd. was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, about 60% of it is owned by global investors, 20% by co-founders and 20% by employees 'around the world.' Earlier this year, Democratic President Joe Biden signed a law mandating ByteDance divest from TikTok or it would be banned. Auchincloss: Senate must reject ‘dangerous’ RFK Jr. as HHS head Carr also wants the Trump administration to create a more 'regular and timely process' for reviewing entities that have ties to China, and have the FCC do a better job of ensuring that a list of communications equipment and services that pose a risk to natural security stays up to date. Loopholes allowing companies such as China Telecom that are banned from operating in the United States to continue providing very similar services in America should be closed, Carr wrote. Economic Opportunity When it comes to boosting economic prosperity, Carr wrote that one of the most 'significanttechnological developments of the past few years' has been low-earth orbit satellites like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's StarLink and Amazon's Kuiper. 'This technology can beam a reliable, high-speed Internet signal to nearly any part of the globe at a fraction of the cost of other technologies,' Carr wrote. 'The FCC should expedite its work to supportthis new technology by acting more quickly in its review and approval of applications to launch new satellites. Otherwise, the U.S. risks ceding space leadership to entities based in countries with more friendly regulatory environments.' Reuters reports that Carr was a harsh critic of the FCC’s decision not to finalize nearly $900 million in broadband subsidies for Starlink. It's a decision Reuters said the incoming FCC chair said would likely not be revisited. Carr also wrote that the FCC and new administration need to work together to develop a national spectrum strategy identifying specific airwaves that can be freed for commercial wireless services. House passes Social Security bill, will the Senate? Eliminating Regulations As a 'New Deal-era agency,' Carr wrote, the FCC's history of regulation is heavy-handed rather than allowing 'competition and market forces to produce optimal outcomes.' Rapidly evolving market conditions favor eliminating these regulations, Carr argued, including many of the FCC's media ownership rules. 'Ultimately, FCC reliance on competition and innovation is vital if the agency is to deliver optimal outcomes for the American public,' Carr wrote. 'The FCC should engage in a serious top-to-bottom review of its regulations and take steps to rescind any that are overly cumbersome or outdated.' Dr. Oz’s disputed health claims could jeopardize Senate confirmation Project 2025 ethics concerns Democrats sent a letter this summer to the inspector general of the FCC saying that Carr contributing to Project 2025 violates ethics rules. 'Given the close ties between Project 2025, Trump, and his re-election campaign, it is deeply troubling that Commissioner Carr would use his official title and position to author part of the political playbook for a Republican presidential candidate,' the lawmakers wrote at the time, according to NewsNation partner The Hill. Carr said in a statement to The Hill that he cleared his work on the project with the FCC's ethics office before participating. 'I made clear to Heritage that I would only be participating in my personal capacity,' Carr said in the statement. Reactions to Carr as potential FCC chair Trump's choice of the next head of the FCC drew praise and criticism. Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron wrote in a statement that Carr has been campaigning for the job 'with promises to do the bidding of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.' 'While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact-check him during the campaign,' Aaron wrote. The self-described 'center-left tech industry policy' group 'Chamber of Progress' chastised Carr's agenda in Project 2025 as 'extremist' and a way to attack content moderation. 'Brendan Carr has clearly stated that he plans to attack Section 230 and force online platforms to carry sludge,' Chamber of Progress Founder and CEO Adam Kovacevich said in a statement. 'That’s why Democrats need to defend Section 230, which protects content moderation and keeps the Internet from becoming a cesspool.' Trump taps Brooke Rollins to head USDA Calling Carr a 'friend,' former FCC Chair Ajit Pai wrote on x that he was a 'brilliant' adviser and general counsel for the agency, and has been a 'superb commissioner.' Current Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel issued a statement congratulating Carr after he was announced as Trump's selection for the next FCC leader. 'From his time here, I am confident that Commissioner Carr is familiar with the staff, the responsibilities of this new role and the importance of continued U.S leadership in communications,' Rosenworcel wrote.

What's next for Kamala Harris?	Questions are swirling over Vice President Harris’s next move as she readies to exit the White House in the wake of her loss to President-elect Trump. Early polling suggests Democrats want to see Harris back in the running for the Oval Office in 2028, despite her defeat this cycle. But some in the party speculate the vice president could seek another office — for starters, the governor’s mansion in California — or pursue avenues outside electoral politics to help bolster the resistance against a second Trump term. 'She still has a long career ahead of her,' said Democratic strategist Kate Maeder. 'She’s young for politics in this country, and I think that folks are really excited to see what she does next, because she’s built such a powerful following around her, and I think that that will carry through after the election.' Election Day was a bruising night for Democrats. Trump swept all of the swing states and made inroads in blue strongholds as most of the country shifted rightward, and the GOP secured both chambers of Congress to pave way for a trifecta of power in Washington next year. But in her speech conceding the 2024 race to her Republican rival, Harris stressed she will never give up on 'the fight that fueled' her fast-tracked bid. The outgoing vice president, 60, 'still has a fight in her,' Maeder said. 'Whether it’s around public policy or it’s fighting the good fight in the private sector, I think it’s left to be seen.' Harris is among a small handful of vice presidents in recent history who tried for the presidency and lost, and each took different paths in the aftermath, noted Joel Goldstein, a professor emeritus at Saint Louis University’s law school and an expert on the vice presidency. Richard Nixon mounted an unsuccessful bid for California governor before his comeback White House win in 1968, and Hubert Humphrey returned to the Senate. Al Gore never ran for political office again, focusing on environmental activism and earning the Nobel Peace Prize. 'So there’s a lot of different options available to her,' Goldstein said. 'I would think that if she wants to remain active in presidential politics, that that's certainly something that's open to her … if that’s the course she wanted.' A poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times this month found nearly half of California voters would be likely to support her if she were to enter the 2026 gubernatorial race. 'If she decided she wanted to run for president in 2028, she would start out as a favorite,' said Jim Kessler, a co-founder of the left-center think tank Third Way. 'I don’t think a prohibitive favorite, but definitely someone who would start out on top, would be able to raise money, is known by voters, and who acquitted herself very well in her short campaign against Trump.' But early lists of possible 2028 contenders are already crowded with Democratic rising stars, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.A stacked field might make it difficult for Harris to re-seize the momentum she saw this year. 'I think she would struggle to win a primary in 2028 and that's just too long to go between now and then … when you have so many of the people sitting out there who are going to run, likely to run,' said Democratic strategist Fred Hicks. Instead, there might be another opening for Harris in her home state of California, which is already seen as a bastion of blue-state resistance to the incoming Trump term. Newsom is term-limited and ineligible to seek reelection when his seat is up in 2026, leaving the governor’s mansion up for grabs. A poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times this month found nearly half of California voters would be likely to support her if she were to enter the 2026 gubernatorial race. Doing so could put her in 'a prime position to fight against Trumpism for the latter part of his term,' Hicks said. Newsom’s office has said California officials are ready to 'Trump-proof' state laws, and the state attorney general is similarly on alert to resist controversial Trump policies. But both the governorship and the AG seat will be on the ballot in 2026. As she campaigned for the White House this year, Harris touted her experience as a prosecutor in California. She served as San Fransisco district attorney and then state attorney general, making history as the first woman, first African American and first Asian American in both offices.She ascended in 2017 to the U.S. Senate, where she represented the progressive stronghold until she joined the Biden administration. Running for a four-year term as governor would likely take Harris out of 2028 contention, but it wouldn’t necessarily mean she’d never try for the Oval Office again, Hicks said, pointing to 2032 and stressing Harris’s young age relative to Trump and Biden, both more than 20 years her senior. But regardless of which path Harris picks, 'she can and should become the face of the Democratic resistance,' Hicks contended. Attorney and Democratic strategist Abou Amara said the California governor’s race, another presidential run or even a step into the advocacy world all look like they’re on the table for Harris, but 'Goal No. 1' is to 'really preserve flexibility as she moves forward.' 'Another part of this question is: What does she want her capstone to be on her political career?' Amara said. And as the dust settles on 2024, experts also expect Harris may wade into the Democratic Party’s soul-searching efforts and tell her own story of what happened in the race. After her 2016 loss to Trump, for example, Clinton chronicled her bid in a memoir aptly titled 'What Happened.' 'I think that will absolutely be part of the next eight to 12 months, to decompress what happened,' Amara said. 'I expect her, whether it be through speeches or writing a book, to really lay out her understanding of what happened. Because Democrats are going to squabble back and forth with different theories … but I think it would be important to hear directly from her.' Experts and Democratic operatives alike stressed that, just a couple weeks past Election Day and two months before the White House changes hands, it’s early to peer into the crystal ball for Harris’s future. Still, the consensus prediction is that the outgoing vice president will stay in the game and remain a change-maker figure for the party as it rebuilds post-2024. 'I do think that she deserves some well-earned time to rest and think about her next steps,' Maeder said. 'I think that she proved to the Democratic Party and to the nation that she has something to offer when it comes to leadership and the next generation of leadership that the Democratic party is so hungry for. And so what she does next, I think that’s left to be seen.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/whats-next-for-kamala-harris/	2024-11-24T10:27:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/harris-next-move_mueller_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
Progressives begin search for a new leader	Progressives are debating who should lead their movement as they seek to remake the Democratic Party in a new populist mold following devastating losses in November. Initial conversations are starting to take place on the left among political strategists, activists and sources close to lawmakers about who is poised to advocate for their flank in the coming Trump era. Some believe the progressive left is at its best without a dominant figurehead tethered to Washington, instead shifting much of the power and influence within the movement to the grassroots. 'The progressive movement is strongest when we aren’t over-reliant on any single leader to guide us forward,' said Usamah Andrabi, spokesperson for Justice Democrats. After helping to identify and recruit progressive candidates from working-class backgrounds, Andrabi says he sees an upside 'when we build the collective power of the people that no amount of corporate influence or super PAC spending can break.' As progressives prepare to face an incoming Republican-controlled Senate and House, some believe there’s even more of an imperative to seize on the anger felt toward Democrats who lost both the executive and legislative branches of government and channel it towards a search for a strong leader. 'They’re especially not going to care now that the Democrats got handed so thoroughly,' said Nina Turner, who co-chaired Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt) 2020 campaign. 'They’re going to say they don’t want more of the same.' 'The Democrats need an opposite and equal force in terms of celebrity,' Turner said, referring to President-elect Trump. Finding that 'celebrity' figure — a charismatic leader who resoundingly rejects corporatism — has its challenges in a capitalist country. But progressives like Turner are urging fellow leftists to look beyond places like the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which is thought of as a go-to pool of liberal talent, for rising stars. 'Very few of them have charisma,' Turner said. 'They have a title that gets media attention. But they can’t motivate.' 'Trump was an anomaly in that,' she continued. 'He was able to galvanize in a moment when people were desperate for change. And we’re right back in that moment now.' 'To me, the progressive left has the strength because this is our moment. The masses of people on the Democratic side or people who would lean Democrat, they’re over mainstream Democrats,' she said. 'They’re saying ‘y’all lost.’ Who builds a monument to the losers?' Figures on the outside are, for now, operating on a smaller scale than those who hold office. Alternative media personalities like Cenk Uygar, Kyle Kulinski and Turner herself are being talked about in some circles, along with ex-Squad members and former Reps. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), who have ties to urban activism. Progressives close to Sanders privately agree that at 83, he likely won't be at the top of the ticket again and have begun whispering about who could realistically take up his economic populist message and potentially have his blessing. But many also believe they need to turn to their existing talent to find someone who could replace him. In the House, two young congresswomen, Reps. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), 36, and Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), 41, are being quietly discussed, along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who also served as a top advisor for Sanders’s 2020 campaign, and the much better-recognized Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Meanwhile, Sens. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) have been critical of Democrats in the past few weeks, creating post-election buzz about their future aspirations. Murphy, who has worked with Sanders on anti-war initiatives, publicly agreed with some of the Vermont senator’s critiques of the corporate influence of the party, while Fetterman said he would consider voting for several of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. Both approaches went against the establishment Democratic ethos, which is to resist Trump wholeheartedly and not appear too critical of the centrist election playbook. Campaign operatives who have spent the past cycles getting progressive candidates ready for prime time, however, believe this is their chance to change up the Democratic blueprint and encourage fresh talent to step up. To get there, they’ll face several key tests, including the 2026 midterms, and before that, the race to lead the Democratic National Committee. Conversations about 2028 could be informed by that choice. While some believe the top DNC job is largely symbolic — it doesn’t have sway over legislation, for example — it will be the first tangible marker of the ideological direction of a party out of power in early January following the losses this fall. 'Progressives are weighing our options, but it’s clear the fight right now is for party leadership,' said one senior Democratic source directly familiar with current talks around the early list of names. Progressives are pushing for Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, the state party chairs of Wisconsin and Minnesota, respectively, but are already fearful that a bigger national figure, Rahm Emanuel, a staunch centrist who served as Chicago mayor and former President Obama’s chief of staff, is the front-runner. Martin has officially declared his candidacy, while Wikler has so far been quiet. 'If the DNC opts for Rahm Emanuel, good luck,' the source said. 'You will see a max exodus from the party.' Ocasio-Cortez, whose megaphone reverberates far beyond Congress, also shared her distress over Emanuel’s name being floated. 'There is a disease in Washington of Democrats who spend more time listening to the donor class than working people,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X. 'If you want to know the seed of the party’s political crisis, that’s it.' Another moderate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, has also tossed his name into the race. The ideological battle to helm the DNC is expected to foreshadow the ongoing fights that have centrists blaming progressives for their losses and vice versa. It’s also happening amid some smaller fights among progressives themselves, who are debating how much to prioritize things like personal identity over economic class. Governors are historically considered to be prime presidential candidates-in-training, and many statewide Democratic executives are expected to play a key role in the anti-Trump effort. But while traditional Democrats in the party eye up leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, progressives don’t see many names who meet their populist criteria. One exception, some note, is Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who was considered on Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate shortlist. By sheer geography alone, the 46-year-old presides over one of the top 10 rural states in the country. 'The guy who, I don't know, who is impressing me right now is Beshear,' said one former Sanders 2016 adviser who worked on issues affecting rural voters. 'He has a solid list of economic accomplishments. And did not shy away from the cultural stuff,' the former adviser said. 'He might be able to make the argument ‘I'm proof caring for these other things doesn’t mean you can't deliver for everyday people where it really matters. The pocketbook.’'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/progressives-begin-search-for-a-new-leader/	2024-11-24T10:23:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/progressives_trudo_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
Auchincloss: Senate must reject ‘dangerous’ RFK Jr. as HHS head	Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) urged the Senate to reject Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a Friday op-ed for the Boston Globe. 'Now Donald Trump is setting Kennedy up to 'go wild' as secretary of health and human services. Kennedy is not just unqualified, he is dangerous — particularly for children. The Senate must reject him,' said the Massuchusetts leader who now occupies the seat previously held by Joe Kennedy III, the great nephew of former president John F. Kennedy. Auchincloss’s remarks about RFK echo the concerns of other lawmakers and Kennedy family members alike as Carolina Kennedy also raised questions about her cousins' appointment. He called on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to decide whether Kennedy should be confirmed based on qualifications rather than politics before citing his previous claims about vaccines. Trump rounds out health team with CDC, FDA picks 'Kennedy claims that ‘no vaccine is safe and effective. The evidence indicates that vaccines have saved the lives of 146 million young children in the past half-century,' Auchincloss wrote. 'Measles, smallpox, diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, rubella, and polio used to infect hundreds of thousands of American children every year.' RFK Jr. is currently on leave from his post as the Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Health Defense organization, which was founded to promote anti-vaccine efforts. He was heavily criticized for a documentary that spread false narratives about vaccines being linked to children with autism, among other things. 'If Kennedy is charged with overseeing the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he will fuse his personal brand with organs of state to pump out quackery and conspiracy,' Auchincloss stated. Trump taps Brooke Rollins to head USDA 'Kennedy won’t only attack vaccines. Other targets include fluoride, which he pledges to 'remove from public water' although it has drastically improved children’s dental health; new medicines for cancer and Alzheimer’s, which he impugns as pharmaceutical poison; and high-speed internet, which he speculates causes 'leaky brain.'' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also condemned RFK Jr.’s nomination, claiming his leadership would take the country back to the 1700s, while others have raised concerns with LGBTQ healthcare as Republicans remain open to his stance on abortion rights. Analysts say RFK Jr. would have a hard time taking vaccines completely off the market but he could repeal vaccine funding, legal protections and revoke recommendations. 'Chaos is what America will get unless Senate Republicans actually do speak truth to power,' Auchincloss concluded. 'They must tell Trump that Kennedy is dangerous, and reject his Cabinet nomination.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/auchincloss-rfk-jr-senate-confirmation/	2024-11-23T18:07:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/auchinclossjake_010423gn_w.jpg?w=900
Trump taps Brooke Rollins to head USDA	President-elect Trump announced that he will nominate Brooke Rollins to be the Secretary of Agriculture on Saturday, building upon a hefty list of Cabinet picks. 'Brooke’s commitment to support the American Farmer, defense of American Food Self-Sufficiency, and the restoration of Agriculture-dependent American Small Towns is second to none,' Trump wrote in a release, lauding her family’s background in farming and early involvement with Future Farmers of America in addition to 4H. Rollins joined the former president’s Economic Advisory Council in 2016 and currently serves as the president and CEO of America First Policy Institute, a think-tank for the former president manned by previous staffers. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? In 2021, she launched a $10 million campaign against Biden’s economic agenda and spoke out in favor of Trump’s second White House bid when he fell under scrutiny in the media as GOP members criticized the party’s ticket. 'For every one former Trump official or staffer that now says negative things, you have hundreds that worked for him, that worked in the White House and in the administration that would love the opportunity to go back and work for him again, and would do so in a heartbeat,' Rollins stated. Her selection comes just a day after Trump announced Scott Turner, another America First Policy Institute leader would join his administration as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Trump's pick of Rollins came as somewhat of a surprise — it was expected that the president-elect would select former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) to serve as secretary of Agriculture. Loeffler will still serve as co-chair of Trump’s second inaugural committee along with real estate mogul Steve Witkoff.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-taps-brooke-rollins-to-head-usda/	2024-11-23T14:28:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24301715288890-e1732397691339.jpg?w=900
5 things to know about former NFL star Scott Turner, Trump's pick...	President-elect Trump announced his nomination of former NFL star Scott Turner for Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Friday. 'I am pleased to nominate Scott Turner, from the Great State of Texas, as the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),' Trump wrote in a press release. Turner has a background in politics and unsuccessfully ran for a California Senate seat in 2006. A few years later he was elected to the Texas House where he served two terms from 2013 to 2017. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Here's what you need to know about the NFL star turned politician: HUD budget cuts Turner will follow in the steps of Ben Carson, who led HUD during Trump’s first administration. Carson helped put proposed budget cuts to the agency’s Community Development Block Grant program, the public housing capital fund and the HOME grant program for more affordable housing before Congress, according to NPR. Many of those measures failed but may be reintroduced when Trump takes office, especially since Republicans have a majority in both the House and Senate. Carson authored an approach to HUD in the controversial Project 2025 playbook, which Trump denies being connected to. The proposal suggests banning undocumented immigrants from living in federal housing and repealing parts of the Fair Housing Act which aims to prevent segregation as reported by NPR. NFL Career Turner spent 9 years in the NFL where he played as a defensive back for the Washington Redskins, San Diego Chargers and Denver Broncos. He also played in college for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he was drafted upon graduation in 1995 as a seventh round pick. Trump has a history of enlisting major NFL stars to bolster his campaign including Brett Favre in addition to receiving endorsements from Pittsburgh Steelers greats Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell. Turner served in Trump’s first administration During Trump’s first term, Turner led the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. The former president said that in the role he sparked 'an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country's most distressed communities' in his Friday night announcement. Turner is the first Black appointee to Trump’s cabinet in his second administration. He still needs to be confirmed by the Senate. Turner heads a Trump think-tank Turner currently works as chair of the Center for Education Opportunity at America First Policy Institute. The organization works as a think tank for the former president and employs his trusted staffers like Linda McMahon, who will head the Department of Education. It was founded three years before the end of Trump’s first term in 2017. He serves as a pastor Prestonwood Baptist Church in Texas currently lists Turner as an associate pastor. In the past, he has also worked as a 'chief inspiration officer' for a software company according to Yahoo News. In that role he served as a professional mentor, pastor, and councilor for the employees and executive team.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/scott-turner-nfl-trump/	2024-11-23T14:13:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP19107714769162_7974ee-e1732384798456.jpg?w=900
Trump taps Rollins as agriculture chief, completing proposed slat...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he will nominate former White House aide Brooke Rollins to be his agriculture secretary, the last of his picks to lead executive agencies and another choice from within his established circle of advisers and allies. The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate, which will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office Jan. 20, 2025. Rollins would succeed Tom Vilsack, President Joe Biden’s agriculture secretary who oversees the sprawling agency that controls policies, regulations and aid programs related to farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition. Rollins, an attorney who graduated from Texas A&amp;M University with an undergraduate degree in agricultural development, is a longtime Trump associate who served as White House domestic policy chief during his first presidency. The 52-year-old is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration. Rollins previously served as an aide to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and ran a think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. She worked as a litigation attorney in Dallas and also clerked for a federal judge in the Northern District of Texas after earning her law degree from the University of Texas. The pick completes Trump’s selection of the heads of executive branch departments, just two and a half weeks after the former president won the White House once again. Several other picks that are traditionally Cabinet-level remain, including U.S. Trade Representative and head of the small business administration. Rollins, speaking on the Christian talk show 'Family Talk' earlier this year, said Trump was an 'amazing boss' and confessed that she thought in 2015, during his first presidential campaign that he would not last as a candidate in a crowded Republican primary field. 'I was the person that said, ‘Oh, Donald Trump is not going to go more than two or three weeks in the Republican primary. This is to up his TV show ratings. And then we’ll get back to normal,’' she said. 'Fast forward a couple of years, and I am running his domestic policy agenda.' Trump didn’t offer many specifics about his agriculture policies during the campaign, but farmers could be affected if he carries out his pledge to impose widespread tariffs. During the first Trump administration, countries like China responded to Trump’s tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like the corn and soybeans routinely sold overseas. Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war. President Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms. The USDA oversees multiple support programs for farmers; animal and plant health; and the safety of meat, poultry and eggs that anchor the nation’s food supply. Its federal nutrition programs provide food to low-income people, pregnant women and young children. And the agency sets standards for school meals. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has vowed to strip ultraprocessed foods from school lunches and to stop allowing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beneficiaries from using food stamps to buy soda, candy or other so-called junk foods. But it would be the USDA, not HHS, that would be responsible for enacting those changes. In addition, HHS and USDA will work together to finalize the 2025-2030 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. They are due late next year, with guidance for healthy diets and standards for federal nutrition programs. ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

White House mostly mum after defeat	The White House has taken its show largely behind closed doors after Vice President Harris’s stinging defeat to Donald Trump. Harris has all but disappeared from the public eye, jetting off to Hawaii after a few scarce appearances around Washington following her massive loss on Nov. 5. President Biden, meanwhile, managed to keep the press at arm’s length during a recent six-day foreign trip and held meetings and events at the White House upon his return that normally would have been at least briefly on camera. The lack of engagements give a window into what a lame duck White House may look like in its final months. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was pressed this week about Biden not taking questions from the media during his trip. She suggested that he could 'engage' more before the new year but the president is known for largely avoiding questions from the media. 'I get that you all want to hear from the president. I get that. I understand that,' she said. 'And I'm not saying that you won’t. You will. He will certainly continue to engage with all of you.' The lack of visibility for Biden could prove problematic for his legacy in the final months of his administration, Michael LaRosa, former special assistant to the president and press secretary to first lady Jill Biden said. 'I really wish he would start talking to the press, holding news conferences, and engaging with the media more frequently as I always believed he should be doing,' LaRosa said. 'But they appear to think they can shape his legacy by producing scripted or rehearsed events for the next few weeks.' 'Given his unceremonious and slapdash passing of the torch last July and the results of the election, one would think he would want to start framing his legacy on his terms, in his own words, and telling his story,' he added. Biden stunned the political world when during a June debate he gave such a poor performance that members of his own party ultimately convinced him to drop his reelection bid. He threw his support behind Harris, whose campaign skyrocketed out of the gate but resulted in another Democrat, and woman, losing to Trump’s brand of brash politics. Since the election, Harris has largely stayed out of public view aside from a concession speech she gave the day after, an appearance at Arlington National Cemetery on Veteran’s Day and a brief stop at the White House during a foreign leader visit. She left for Hawaii on Tuesday and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. As president of the Senate, Harris, who can cast tie-breaking votes in the upper chamber, was also missing earlier this week when Senate Democrats pushed through Biden’s judiciary nominees before Republicans take over. The White House was also faced with questions this week about Harris and the appearance of her being on vacation while hundreds of Democratic staffers braced for being jobless in January when the GOP will take over the House and Senate as well. 'The vice president has taken time off to go spend time with her family. I don’t think there's anything wrong with that. I think she deserves some time to be with her family and to have some downtime,' Jean-Pierre said. 'She has worked very hard… for the last four years, and her taking a couple of days to be with her family, good for her.' Back at the White House, Biden this week held a meeting with Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper to discuss hurricane relief efforts there. Such meetings typically come with a brief on-camera appearance but the White House did not make public that the meeting was occurring until later in the evening after it was over. It marked an unusual way to convey a closed-door meeting about a topic the president addressed multiple times publicly, including during a visit to Cooper’s state. That same day, Biden also held a private ceremony to give the Medal of Freedom to former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. Those ceremonies are typically public – and make for compelling photo opportunities – but Richards was diagnosed in 2023 with a glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain tumor that Beau Biden died from. Such ceremonies can be requested to be private by families of the recipient. Biden was back on camera on Thursday when he held an event for the Boston Celtics. But by Friday, the White House again went dark for much of the day. Biden and first Lady Jill Biden hosted a dinner on the South Lawn - but officials were silent about what the dinner is in honor of for days. The answer ultimately came in something else that White House should have touted in their favor, which was to thank longtime supporters. Despite Biden being on his way out, staying largely out of the spotlight will do little to tame increased scrutiny on his age and mental fitness, including questions being raised about his ability to serve out the remainder of his term. Some Republicans suggested Biden resign when he dropped out from the 2024 race in July but those calls are being renewed since Harris’s loss. Pollster Nate Silver publicly asked this week if Biden is competent enough to be the president. La Rosa said that Biden not being in the public eye doesn’t do him any favors. 'If we can't hear from him and if we don't see him actively making the case for himself in unscripted and unchoreographed situations, the age issue would never go away,' LaRosa said. LaRosa noted that when Biden wasn’t active with media during the Democratic primary in 2019, the first lady stepped in before the COVID-19 pandemic forced him into a 'bunker' during the general election. LaRosa suggested the first lady could push Biden to be accessible again before January. 'The bunker mentality did not serve him or the presidency well and I hope in these final weeks, the first lady steps in again, lets him off the leash, and let Biden be Biden at the end of his long career,' he said. 'He didn't come this far by being shy. Why now?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-mostly-mum-after-trump-defeat/	2024-11-23T14:11:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/biden-closed-doors_gangitano_illo_SamanthaWong-GregNash.jpg?w=900
House Oversight Democrats slam Trump for nominating Project 2025’...	Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, and committee member Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) condemned President-elect Trump for tapping Project 2025 co-author Russell Vought to serve as the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during his second administration. 'After vehemently denying his links to Project 2025 through the campaign, the President-elect just tapped its lead architect, Russell Vought, to run his coming all-of-government purge as Director of the Office of Management and Budget,' the lawmakers said in a joint statement. Vought served as Trump’s OMB deputy director during Trump's first term in the Oval Office. Vought penned the chapter on the Executive Office of the President of the United States — which largely references OMB — in The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a 'governing agenda' filled with conservative priorities and insight from scholars and policy experts. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Trump on the campaign trail sought to distance himself from the playbook, previously saying he has 'nothing to do with it,' especially as it came under fire for some of its more controversial policies. Democrats launched a campaign earlier this year to push back on Project 2025, forming a task force to fight what they said is a threat to the institutions of American democracy and government. In their statement, Raskin and Stansbury hit Vought on decisions he made while serving Trump's first administration, like carrying out an executive order signed by Trump in 2020, which took aim at diversity training for government workers by prohibiting the teaching of 'divisive concepts.' 'As Democratic Members of the House Oversight Committee, the headquarters of resistance to this plan, we will fight Vought’s radical agenda, act to protect vital government services the American people depend on, and stand up to defend our fellow citizens who are honorable federal workers every step of the way,' they said in the statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/house-oversight-democrats-slam-trump-for-nominating-project-2025s-lead-architect/	2024-11-23T14:10:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/raskinjamie_060324gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Neil deGrasse Tyson dismisses Musk’s Mars dreams: ‘I don’t see it...	(The Hill) — Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said he doesn’t think Elon Musk’s vision for space travel to Mars is realistic during a Friday night episode of HBO's 'Real Time with Bill Maher'. 'I don't see it happening until governments judge that it's geopolitically in our interest,' he said in conversation with Donna Brazile and Andrew Young. 'But I believe President-elect Trump has some interest in Mars, so you might have another conversation in a couple of months,' the scientist added. 'At some point, somebody has to pay for it, and just being interested in something is not the same thing as paying for it.' Musk fired back suggesting that a trip to Mars would not just help respective countries but could solve age old problems for humanity. Trump watches as Musk’s SpaceX launches Starship rocket 'Wow, they really don’t get it. Mars is critical to the long-term survival of consciousness,' he wrote in response to the clip on X. 'Also, I’m not going to ask any venture capitalists for money. I realize that it makes no sense as an investment,' he said, responding to deGrasse Tyson's claims that venture capitalists would not invest in space travel to Mars. 'That’s why I’m gathering resources.' NASA has worked alongside Musk for years. His company SpaceX has a $3.6 billion contract with the agency and an $11.8 billion agreement with the Department of Defense over the past 10 years, according to the New York Times analysis. In a post earlier this year, the tech-giant said his starship to Mars would make life 'multiplanetary' and added that the Department of Government Efficiency which he now co-heads with Vivek Ramaswamy is the 'only path to extending life beyond Earth.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/neil-degrasse-tyson-musk-mars/	2024-11-23T13:42:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP20276676837937-e1732396937524.jpg?w=800
Bezos, Musk rivalry heats up ahead of Trump’s second term	A social media spat between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos this week underscored a sharpening rivalry between two of the world’s richest men at a time when both are trying to grow their sprawling businesses empires in President-elect Trump’s second term. 'Just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock,' Musk wrote Thursday of his fellow Tech mogul on X, the social platform he owns. 'Nope. 100% not true,' Bezos, who posts on social media less frequently, replied. Observers say the dynamic between Bezos and Musk could get more tense. Musk in particular has endeared himself to Trump, part of a larger rightward shift among Silicon Valley leaders. 'It goes to show the split between different approaches among the tech community,' GOP strategist Chris Johnson told The Hill. 'There are a lot of folks like Elon...who have sort of embraced the right as the ‘move fast and break things’ party for better or for worse.' Musk and Bezos have decidedly different personalities and political views. The Tesla founder is a bona fide social media influencer, who posts dozens of times a day on X, a platform he owns, and sits regularly for interviews with friendly hosts and media personalities. Bezos has kept a much lower profile since founding Amazon and purchasing the Washington Post, opting to communicate through corporate representatives and in polished remarks to investors and employees. Musk has been seen as a leading voice within Silicon Valley on the right in recent years and this month landed a government-adjacent role under Trump to co-lead an initiative tasked with slashing government spending and regulations. Leaders of major tech companies – including Bezos – are taking note of Musk’s growing prominence in Trump’s orbit. Many of these Silicon Valley leaders, reacting to sweeping changes to the economy Trump is promising, made a series of calls to the then GOP candidate in the days before the election, looking to shore up relations with his incoming administration. The social media tiff between Musk and Bezos this week shows Musk’s alliance with Trump, coupled with the success of his tech ventures, has gotten Bezos’ attention, observers say. 'Now that Democrats are out of power, I think he’s in a weird spot in his political leanings, his political relationship to D.C. and also his relationship with these new tech guys that have embraced the GOP,' Johnson said of Bezos. Representatives for Bezos and Musk declined to comment. Bezos has come under attack from Trump and the right more generally, for years. His ownership of the Washington Post, a publication that made a name for itself during Trump’s first term with aggressive coverage of the former president, has earned Bezos regular scorn from conservative critics. There are, however, signs of change at the Post, which earlier this month shocked the political and media world by not endorsing a candidate for president. Bezos personally made the decision to kill an editorial, which had been drafted and backed Vice President Harris, sparking concerns the billionaire was attempting to appease Trump. In an op-ed defending the move, Bezos brushed aside suggestions he was trying to curry favor with Trump or help his businesses. 'You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests,' Bezos wrote. 'Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other.' The billionaire’s latest counter punch at Musk on social media and any future rebuffing of the eccentric conservative might get Trump’s attention and mend fences with the president-elect, Johnson suggested. 'It helps him [Bezos] to engage with Elon,' he said, adding, 'Ultimately, Trump likes people who fight and people who believe in themselves and people who embrace conflict as a way to solve problems and move forward.' This is far from the first time Musk and Bezos have clashed in the public eye, with several of their recent feuds centered around their competing aerospace companies. 'If I were Bezos, I’d be worried. It’s not just Elon Musk’s alliance with the incoming president, it’s the fact that his rocket development is years behind schedule of SpaceX,' said Mark Whittington, an author who studies space, politics and policy. Musk’s SpaceX leads the aerospace and rocket industry, hosting nearly 100 launches last year and deploying thousands of its Starlink internet satellites. It is reportedly on track to be valued at $255 billion if discussions to sell insider shares go through and holds a nearly billion-dollar contract to bring down the International Space Station. Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Bezos, has lagged behind SpaceX when it comes to rocket launches and has yet to reach orbit or fly a national security mission. It is in direct competition with SpaceX and United Launch Alliance for $5.6 billion worth of Pentagon contracts over the next five years. Bezos reignited the feud over the companies last June, when he filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration to limit Starship launches, citing environmental concerns. Musk at the time called the move an 'obviously disingenuous response,' nicknaming the company 'Sue Origin' at the time. And in 2021, Bezos sued NASA over awarding a lunar lander contract to SpaceX, but ultimately lost the suit. Musk meanwhile has made a regular habit of feuding with or needling leading business executives with more progressive politics. He famously challenged Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder whose company is known today as Meta, to a cage match last summer and shared social media jokes mocking billionaire Mark Cuban on social media as he voiced support for Harris. Personal jabs aside, those aware of the dynamic say the fight between Musk and Bezos is merely part of a larger, more consequential struggle for the unofficial title of the world’s top innovator and most powerful man. 'Musk’s SpaceX is still dominant right now,' said Whittington. 'Bezos is and in fact every other rocket company has been kind of following in SpaceX’s footsteps and Bezos is not happy about that.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/bezos-musk-rivalry-heats-up-ahead-of-trumps-second-term/	2024-11-23T04:45:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Billionaires_103124_AP_Sean-Simmers-and-Evan-Agostini.png?w=900
Trump selects former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon to lead CDC	President-elect Donald Trump tapped former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon (R) to serve as the director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during his upcoming administration. 'I am thrilled to announce that former Congressman, Dr. Dave Weldon, is nominated to serve as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),' Trump said in a press release, which he posted on Truth Social on Friday evening. Weldon, a medical doctor and Army veteran, was a seven-term lawmaker until 2008. While in Congress, Weldon served on several committees, including Appropriations, Health and Human Services, Education and Labor, and Science. He returned to practicing medicine and working as a consultant after not seeking reelection. 'The current Health of America is critical, and CDC will play a big role in helping to ensure Americans have the tools and resources they need to understand the underlying causes of disease, and the solutions to cure these diseases,' Trump said in the release.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/trump-selects-former-florida-rep-dave-weldon-to-lead-cdc/	2024-11-22T18:00:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP05032103488.jpg?w=900

Trump names Chavez-DeRemer for Labor secretary	President-elect Trump has tapped Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.), to serve as Labor secretary in his new administration. Chavez-DeRemer had the backing of the Teamsters before she was officially picked by Trump. She served for one term in the House and lost her reelection bid to Democrat Janelle Bynum in November. Trump’s pick for Labor is one of his last Cabinet picks. Trump’s victory over Vice President Harris was in part fueled by working-class Americans, who shifted back towards the Republican Party in 2024. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien addressed the Republican National Convention in July after big labor has historically backed Democrats. Teamsters then announced in September that it would skip its presidential endorsement last cycle and opted to not back Trump or Harris. Chavez-DeRemer is one of a few other Republican members of Congress to be named for Trump’s Cabinet, including Reps. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) for United Nations ambassador, Mike Waltz (Fla.) for national security adviser, and Matt Gaetz (Fla.) for attorney general. Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination though does not impact the GOP House majority for next Congress because she lost her reelection bid.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-names-chavez-deremer-for-labor-secretary/	2024-11-22T17:32:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/chavezderemerlori_090924gn01_w.jpg?w=900

President-elect Donald Trump tapped Project 2025 co-author Russell Vought to serve as the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during his second administration. Vought served as Trump's OMB deputy director during his first term in the Oval Office. 'I am very pleased to nominate Russell Thurlow Vought, from the Great State of Virginia, as the Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB),' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday. 'He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term - We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation, and it was a Great Success!' he added in the post.

Trump expected to name investor Scott Bessent as Treasury secreta...	President-elect Trump is expected to tap hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to serve as Treasury secretary in his new administration, a source confirmed to NewsNation. Bessent, founder and CEO of hedge fund Key Square Group, served as an economic adviser to the Trump campaign, often appearing on financial talk shows to argue in favor of the president-elect's economic policies. He would be subject to confirmation in the GOP-controlled Senate, where he would need 51 votes to clear the upper chamber. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal after Trump's victory, he touted the markets’ response to Trump’s win, arguing it shows their 'unambiguous embrace of the Trump 2.0 economic vision.' 'Markets are signaling expectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans,' Bessent wrote. He emerged as a front-runner for Treasury secretary after billionaire investor John Paulson bowed out of contention and after Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who was also angling for the job, was picked to be Commerce secretary. Bessent would lead the president-elect’s economic team, which will be tasked with imposing an aggressive tariff regime meant to shake up global trade while keeping financial markets calm amid the disruption. The president-elect ran on the notion of turning the economy around, a campaign promise that resonated with voters tired of inflation, and has proposed a general tariff of 10 to 20 percent on all imported goods in order to pull investment into the U.S. and bolster domestic industry.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-expected-to-name-investor-scott-bessent-as-treasury-secretary-pick/	2024-11-22T15:37:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24227790611973-e1731449683126.jpg?w=900
Meet the informant saving hundreds of cartel sex trafficking vict...	(NewsNation) — A man who says he’s rescued 200 sex trafficking victims has a message for the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels: He’s hunting them. The man, who goes by Sebastian, says he’s an unpaid confidential informant for federal agencies. Trafficking situations often start with a family south of the border trying to cross into the United States illegally and paying the cartels about $15,000 per person, he said. You can watch the full story TONIGHT during Elizabeth Vargas Reports at 5/4C. Find your channel here. 'If the young lady is pretty, woman or child is attractive, and they feel that they could sell that child or traffic that person … they'll just outright kidnap that person,' Sebastian said. Prolific Mexican cartel leader allegedly faked his own death to live ‘life of luxury’ 'And if they are with family members, they will either try to strategically say, ‘Well, she's going go into a separate car,’' he continued. 'And then when they keep the girl, they'll just tell the family member, ‘You know what? The cops pulled us over. They took her away. Immigration has her.’ And then that's it. They never hear from her.' None of the girls make any money, Sebastian said. Some are promised eventual release if they work enough to make $50,000 to $100,000. But those goalposts are always moving, he said. 'A lot of women die,' Sebastian said. 'A lot of women are murdered.' When traffickers are done with a person, they‘ve been known to take them to the outskirts of the city and kill them, he said. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes 'They knew the faces the names of the Johns, which were politicians, police officers, business owners, and obviously, the names and faces of the traffickers,' Sebastian said. Sebastian's services are a race against time and, although the gig doesn’t pay, it does afford him certain protection. That includes a network of intel and support that he said has been life-saving. One agency warned Sebastian they'd learned his identity had been compromised and to skip the job. As the director of rescue operations at New Hope Foundation International, his work is mostly funded by donations to the nonprofit. These are the methods he can disclose. 'Once they trust you, they start offering you girls,' Sebastian said. He befriends traffickers and poses as a so-called John or a client who pays for sexual services. Reaching the women and never touching them while remaining inconspicuous is a challenge. 'I tell them that I'm diabetic,' he said. 'Because we don't have Viagra, I cannot get an erection. So I don't want to touch a girl. I don't want them touching me. So that's the way we get ourselves, not into bad situations.' Sometimes, he gifts women and children cellphones. 'They say, ‘Oh, I like your phone.’ (and I say) ‘Oh, yeah, that's cool. I'm gonna get another one. Would you like to keep this one if I get the new one?’ And then say yeah,' Sebastian said. 'It's a $400 to $600 phone and they'll get it for free. Little do they know that (through) coordinated efforts with the government, that phone has tools in there to monitor everything.' Cellphones are often what crack the cases and give the government what it needs to bust trafficking operations. Diddy to appear in court, make case to be released on bail NewsNation spoke with Kevin Metcalf, a former federal agent and director of the human trafficking response unit at the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office. According to Metcalf, Sebastian has the trust, resources and network 'to do things we can’t.' 'When we tell him, for example, there's a 13-year-old girl and we don't know if we can keep her safe, he can reach out and make sure that happens,' Metcalf said. 'Even for government officials, we struggle to do things like that.' Leon Worthen is a former director of operations at Naval Special Warfare. He said he's worked 12 cases with Sebastian, using him in reconnaissance. 'He is definitely the real deal,' Worthen said. 'He has the ability, the fearlessness, the courage and the bravery to put himself in harm's way when it comes to rescuing a victim of trafficking or abuse, and every single time, the results are amazing.'

Sen. Mullin is lone lawmaker blocking general’s promotion: Source...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — A promotion for the general who was the last U.S. service member out of Afghanistan was put on hold by Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., NewsNation sources confirm. Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue, who oversaw the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2020 was nominated to lead the U.S. Army in Europe and Africa. A source familiar with the confirmation process said it’s their understanding that Mullin held up the promotion, with his objection directly related to Donahue’s role in Afghanistan. A NewsNation request for comment on Friday morning was not immediately returned. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved nearly 1,000 promotions, including Donahue’s, earlier this week. Who is Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue? A career special operations veteran, Donahue is known as the last U.S. service member out of Kabul, with his image captured in a hazy, night vision photo as he stepped on the last U.S. military aircraft out of Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 30, 2021. Donahue was in charge of the 82nd Airborne while it secured the airfield at the airport, an often chaotic scene as Americans and refugees raced to evacuate Afghanistan before an Aug 31, 2021, deadline to leave. What is the promotion process? Donahue, President Biden’s nominee to head the U.S. Army in Europe and up for promotion to four-star general, was one of nearly 1,000 military promotions the Senate Armed Services Committee approved on Tuesday. Donahue’s name, however, was ​​not included in the promotions approved Thursday by the Senate before it left Washington, D.C., not to return until after the Thanksgiving Day holiday. While his blocked military promotion is unusual, as officer promotions are typically uncontroversial and easily passed by the Senate, it’s not unheard of. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) last year blocked several hundred general and flag officer promotions for months over his objection to the Pentagon’s policy of reimbursing those for travel costs when seeking an abortion out of the state in which they are based. Though a hold can still be bypassed via a vote by the full Senate, it’s seen as unfavorable given that it can eat up floor time.

Gaetz says he will not return to Congress	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said Friday he will not return to Congress after resigning his House seat last week, despite having withdrawn from consideration to be President-elect Trump’s attorney general — but added he is 'not going anywhere.' 'I'm still going to be in the fight, but it's going to be from a new perch. I do not intend to join the 119th Congress,' Gaetz told conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, later adding it is a 'pretty poetic time' to allow Florida’s 1st District to have new representation. There were questions about whether Gaetz may try to return to Capitol Hill for the 119th Congress — and whether he would want to — given the careful wording used in his letter announcing his resignation from the 118th Congress last week. But he put an end to that speculation less than a day after it began. 'I've got other goals in life that I'm eager to pursue; my wife and my family. And so, I'm going to be fighting for President Trump. I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have,' Gaetz said. 'But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.' Gaetz’s decision to not return to Congress also keeps him out of the jurisdiction of the House Ethics Committee, which has been wrestling since his resignation with whether to release the report resulting from its years-long investigation of him on allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and more.He has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. The Ethics panel on Wednesday — before Gaetz had removed himself from attorney general consideration — declined to release its report, with the committee's Republicans voting against doing so, but left open the possibility of opting to release it at a later date. But Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), the chair of the committee, said Thursday that Gaetz no longer being in the running for attorney general 'should end the discussion' of whether the panel should release the report. Two House Democrats have also made moves to try to force House votes requiring the Ethics panel to release its report, and they have vowed to continue with pushing for a vote when Congress returns from Thanksgiving. It is not clear what the Florida lawmaker does next, but Gaetz has plenty of options aside from returning to the House. Those include Trump appointing him to a position that does not require Senate confirmation, exploring a run for governor of Florida, or even launching a media career. What’s next for Matt Gaetz: 5 possibilities 'Don't worry — I'm not going anywhere. I'm not taking off for like, you know, tropical excursion for the rest of my life. I am here to help save this country,' he said Friday. 'We need a leadership structure under President Trump that's going to allow for durability of our movement and the ability to continue this great realignment of our politics. So, I'll play a part in that. I plan to be a big voice,' Gaetz added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/gaetz-says-he-will-not-return-to-congress-but-staying-in-the-fight/	2024-11-22T09:41:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_082624gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Who is Pam Bondi, Trump's nominee for Attorney General?	(NewsNation) — After Matt Gaetz withdrew from nomination as Donald Trump's attorney general, the president-elect named Pam Bondi as his next pick. 'I have known Pam for many years — She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!' Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday. Bondi, who used to serve as Florida's Attorney General, wasn't initially on anybody's short-list for the national position. However, Trump's announcement Thursday got a positive reaction from senators, such as Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who called Bondi a 'grand slam, touchdown, hole in one, ace, hat trick, slam dunk, Olympic gold medal pick' on X. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Pam Bondi's background Bondi was a prosecutor for nearly two decades in the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office before becoming Florida's first female attorney general in 2010. She served as Florida's Attorney General for eight years. She campaigned for the state's top legal office by challenging then-President Barack Obama’s signature health care law and calling for her state to adopt Arizona's controversial 'show me your papers' immigration law. As Attorney General in Florida from 2011-2019, Bondi was vocal on human trafficking issues and urged tightening state laws against traffickers. After that, she worked as a lobbyist for Ballard Partners. Trump's incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles was a partner at the Florida-based firm. While working at Ballard Partners, Bondi lobbied for a Kuwaiti firm, the Associated Press reported, citing Justice Department foreign agent filings and congressional lobbying documents. Bondi registered as a foreign agent for the government of Qatar because of her work related to anti-human-trafficking efforts leading up to the 2022 World Cup. In addition, Bondi represented the KGL Investment Company KSCC, a Kuwaiti firm also known as KGLI. She lobbied the White House, National Security Council, State Department and Congress on immigration policy, human rights and economic sanctions issues, the AP wrote. Trump and Bondi's relationship Sources tell NewsNation that Bondi is very trusted by Trump and that she spends a lot of time at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump's first impeachment defense team when he was accused in 2020 of abuse of power for allegedly pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Trump was ultimately not convicted. This year Bondi was among a group of Republicans who showed up in New York to support Trump at his hush money criminal trial. Family fears missing woman Hannah Kobayashi was trafficked People close to the president-elect tell us that Bondi is somebody very trusted by Trump. She spends a lot of time at Mar a Lago. She was a senior adviser on Trump's first impeachment defense team, and this year, she was also among a group of Republicans who showed up in New York to support Trump at his hush money criminal trial. 'I'm a prosecutor, former prosecutor, yet all the rights here go to the defendant, because it's his liberty at stake, and that has not been happening in this courtroom, this case should have never, ever been brought,' Bondi said at the time. Shortly after the second apparent assassination attempt on Trump, Bondi appeared on NewsNation's 'Dan Abrams Live' to discuss it. Her hope for the trial, Bondi said, is that the alleged attempt 'is going to be prosecuted wisely and smartly by the feds.' 'I can't imagine anyone in this country who wouldn't want this monster locked up forever,' she said, referring to suspect Ryan Wesley Routh.

Diddy to appear in court, make case to be released on bail	(NewsNation) — Music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs will appear in court for a pretrial hearing, making another bid to be released from jail on bail. Combs has been detained for more than two months after being charged with racketeering, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. He was denied bail in September when the indictment was unsealed, and again earlier in November as the judge deemed him a flight risk due to his money and connections. Diddy private eyes confront influencers about possible payments On Thursday, Combs argued that a video of him allegedly attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016 was edited and not an accurate portrayal of what happened at the Los Angeles Hotel. Prosecutors have pointed to the video as evidence of Combs trafficking Ventura and an example of the danger Combs could pose to women if released on bail. They alleged he was trafficking Ventura as part of a 'freak off,' alleged events detailed in the indictment where Combs reportedly forced women to engage in sex acts with male prostitutes for an audience with the events sometimes lasting for days. Combs' defense team argued that an edited video was not related to a 'freak off' but showed a domestic dispute between the couple. Lawyers for Combs offered to bring a forensic video analyst to court on Friday during arguments regarding Combs' release. Police warn of sophisticated holiday scam artists targeting consumers The judge has already rejected an effort to consider handwritten jailhouse notes from Combs which prosecutors wanted to use to argue against granting release. In addition to criminal charges, Combs is also facing multiple lawsuits from women who say he abused them and forced them to participate in sex acts against their will.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-court-friday/	2024-11-22T09:02:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1756336143.jpg?w=900
Thanksgiving travel: Which dishes are TSA-approved?	(NewsNation) — You can’t bring the carving knife, but if you’re traveling for Thanksgiving, your macaroni, meats and cookies can join you on a flight. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released a list of approved dishes travelers can bring through airport security. Although most foods can be carried through TSA checkpoints, some dishes may need to be packed with checked baggage. Thanksgiving will cost less this year, here’s which items are cheaper Generally, solid food can go through checkpoints hassle-free, but 'if you can spill it, spread it, spray it, pump it or pour it' (and it’s larger than 3.4 ounces), it’ll need to go in a checked bag. Common Thanksgiving foods that can be carried through a TSA checkpoint include baked goods, meats, stuffing, casseroles, macaroni and cheese, fresh fruit, candy and spices. Items like cranberry sauce, gravy, canned fruits or vegetables, preserves, jams and jellies, and maple syrup, should be carefully stored with your checked bags. The TSA is projected to screen 18.3 million people from Tuesday, Nov. 26 to Monday, Dec. 2 — up 6% from this time last year. The Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and the following Sunday, are poised to be the busiest travel days.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/thanksgiving-travel-tsa-approved-dishes/	2024-11-22T08:54:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/655d0a484f1226.34582149.jpeg?w=900
New York judge delays Trump hush money sentencing	President-elect Trump’s sentencing in his New York criminal case will not go forward as planned next week as his attorneys push to dismiss the prosecution following his election victory. Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the trial proceedings, announced the adjournment in a letter Friday. The judge halted the case to accept additional written briefing on Trump’s argument that his return to the White House compels the court to toss his 34-count felony conviction entirely. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) is opposing that request. Instead, Bragg floated that Merchan could freeze the proceedings while Trump is in office, meaning the conviction would remain on the books but sentencing wouldn’t occur until 2029, at the earliest. Merchan ordered Trump to file his formal motion asking for dismissal by Dec. 2 and Bragg to respond by Dec. 9. The judge will then decide how to proceed. Though both sides agreed to delay the sentencing, the new schedule aligns with Bragg’s request. Trump had asked for a slower timeline that would push the dismissal battle closer to his inauguration. The Hill has reached out to the district attorney's office for comment. Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson and incoming White House communications director, called the ruling a 'decisive win' for the former and future president. 'President Trump won a landslide victory as the American People have issued a mandate to return him to office and dispose of all remnants of the Witch Hunt cases,' he said. 'All of the sham lawfare attacks against President Trump are now destroyed and we are focused on Making America Great Again.' The former president’s criminal defense strategy long rested on delaying until after the election. Trump successfully staved off trial in his other three criminal prosecutions, and in the only case that did reach a verdict, the New York hush money case, he successfully pushed the sentencing until after voters headed to the ballot box. The jury’s verdict made Trump the first former U.S. president convicted of a felony. When he returns to the White House, he would become the first person to assume the nation’s highest office with such a criminal record — if the conviction stands. With his White House victory secured, Trump’s team now believes his criminal cases must be tossed. They have moved most aggressively to pull the plug on the hush money case, given that Trump’s sentencing date of Nov. 26 was rapidly approaching on. '[D]ismissal of this case is necessary under the Constitution and federal law to facilitate the orderly transition of Executive power — and in the interests of justice — following President Trump's victory in the Electoral College and the popular vote in the 2024 Presidential election,' Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, whom the president-elect recently nominated to senior Justice Department roles, wrote in a letter last week. The jury of 12 New Yorkers in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money deal his ex-fixer made with a porn actor ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Though Trump could face jail time, such a sentence is rare for first-time offenders on charges like his, and he is expected to seek a delay of any punishment pending a lengthy appeal. Before sentencing, Merchan was also set to rule on whether the verdict can stand following the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. Merchan delayed his ruling — and the sentencing — until shortly after the election and then put it on hold upon Trump’s electoral win. Both will remain on hold at least until the judge decides how to proceed in the wake of Trump’s election. His imminent return to the White House has already pumped the brakes on his other criminal prosecutions. Courts agreed to special counsel Jack Smith’s requests to halt his federal election subversion case and his appeal seeking to revive his documents case as prosecutors assess how to wind down the cases. In Georgia, where Trump is accused of attempting to subvert the state’s 2020 presidential election results, an appeals court without explanation took a scheduled oral argument in a defense challenge off the calendar.

What will Mike Huckabee focus on if confirmed as Israel ambassado...	(NewsNation) — If confirmed by the Senate to be ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee said it would 'be an honor' to represent the continuation of the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords, which President-elect Donald Trump helped broker, aimed to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations. On 'Morning in America,' Huckabee said the job is all about carrying out responsibilities assigned by the president. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'An ambassador doesn't get to make policy. He's there to represent the policy,' Huckabee said. 'An ambassador serves at the pleasure of the President.' Huckabee's nomination comes during the Israel-Hamas war. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed 44,056 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Parts of Gaza have been decimated and more than 2.3 million people driven from their homes. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage. The world’s top war crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

Putin says Russia attacked Ukraine with a new missile that he cla...	The Kremlin fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine on Thursday in response to Kyiv's use this week of American and British missiles capable of striking deeper into Russia, President Vladimir Putin said. In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at ten times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik — Russian for hazelnut tree. He also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. 'We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,' Putin said in his first comments since President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the green light this month to use U.S. ATACMS missiles to strike at limited targets inside Russia. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed that Russia’s missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate range missile based on it’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile. 'This was new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield, so that was certainly of concern,' Singh said, noting that the missile could carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. The U.S. was notified ahead of the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels, she said. The attack on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro came in response to Kyiv's use of longer-range U.S. and British missiles in strikes Tuesday and Wednesday on southern Russia, Putin said. Those strikes caused a fire at an ammunition depot in Russia's Bryansk region and killed and wounded some security services personnel in the Kursk region, he said. 'In the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond decisively and in kind,' the Russian president said, adding that Western leaders who are hatching plans to use their forces against Moscow should 'seriously think about this.' Putin said the Oreshnik fired Thursday struck a well-known missile factory in Dnipro. He also said Russia would issue advance warnings if it launches more strikes with the Oreshnik against Ukraine to allow civilians to evacuate to safety — something Moscow hasn’t done before previous aerial attacks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially said Russia hadn’t warned the U.S. about the coming launch of the new missile, noting that it wasn't obligated to do so. But he later changed tack and said Moscow did issue a warning 30 minutes before the launch. Putin's announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed that Russia had used an intercontinental ballistic missile in the Dnipro attack, which wounded two people and damaged an industrial facility and rehabilitation center for people with disabilities, according to local officials. But American officials said an initial U.S. assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that the use of the missile was an 'obvious and serious escalation in the scale and brutality of this war, a cynical violation of the UN Charter.' He also said there had been 'no strong global reaction' to the use of the missile, which he said could threaten other countries. 'Putin is very sensitive to this. He is testing you, dear partners,' Zelenskyy wrote. 'If there is no tough response to Russia’s actions, it means they see that such actions are possible.' The attack comes during a week of escalating tensions, as the U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine's use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons. The Ukrainian air force said in a statement that the Dnipro attack was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. 'Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,' Zelenskyy said hours before Putin's address. 'And how afraid he is.' Russia was sending a message by attacking Ukraine with an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of releasing multiple warheads at extremely high speeds, even if they are less accurate than cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles, said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. 'Why might you use it therefore?' Savill said. 'Signaling — signaling to the Ukrainians. We’ve got stuff that outrages you. But really signaling to the West ‘We’re happy to enter into a competition around intermediate range ballistic missiles. P.S.: These could be nuclear tipped. Do you really want to take that risk?’' Military experts say that modern ICBMs and IRBMs are extremely difficult to intercept, although Ukraine has previously claimed to have stopped some other weapons that Russia described as 'unstoppable,' including the air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile. David Albright, of the Washington-based think tank the Institute for Science and International Security, said he was 'skeptical' of Putin’s claim, adding that Russian technology sometimes 'falls short.' He suggested Putin was 'taunting the West to try to shoot it down ... like a braggart boasting, taunting his enemy.' Earlier this week, the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use the U.S.-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow. Days later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the U.S., said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that Russia’s formal lowering of the threshold for nuclear weapons use did not prompt any changes in U.S. doctrine. She pushed back on concerns that the decision to allow Ukraine to use Western missiles to strike deeper inside Russia might escalate the war. ″They’re the ones who are escalating this,' she said of the Kremlin — in part because of a flood of North Korean troops sent to the region. More than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes. Analysts and observers say the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare. Putin has also warned that the move would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. 'It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,' said Peter Ricketts, a former U.K. national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Emma Burrows in London, and Zeke Miller and Lolita C.

Trump picks Pam Bondi for next attorney general	President-elect Trump has named former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his next nominee to the lead the Department of Justice (DOJ). Bondi was a swift pick just hours after former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) withdrew himself from consideration for the role. 'For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore. Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again. I have known Pam for many years — She is smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter, who will do a terrific job as Attorney General!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Bondi served as attorney general of Florida from 2011 to 2019 under then-Gov. Rick Scott. She is the chair of the Center for Litigation at the America First Policy Institute, a right-wing think tank working with the Trump transition team on the administration’s agenda. She is also a partner at Ballard Partners, the lobbying firm at which Trump’s incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles worked. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump’s first impeachment defense team, a role for which she took a leave from Ballard Partners. She then rejoined the firm, which was founded by Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard, the former 2016 chair of Trump Victory. She steps in for Gaetz, who was named Trump’s pick for attorney general just a week ago and immediately became the president-elect’s most controversial Cabinet choice. Gaetz was previously investigated by the Justice Department as part of a broader sex trafficking probe, including allegations involving an underage woman. The department ultimately decided not to pursue charges, and Gaetz has strongly denied any wrongdoing. While he cited that his nomination was becoming a distraction to the Trump transition team, his withdrawal suggests he had realized he was unlikely to win the votes necessary to be confirmed in the Senate after meeting with members of the upper chamber this week.

What's next for Matt Gaetz: 5 possibilities	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) political future is up in the air following his announcement that he is taking his name out of the running to be attorney general in the Trump administration. Gaetz was under intense scrutiny over past investigations by the Justice Department (DOJ) and the House Ethics Committee. The DOJ was investigating Gaetz as a part of a broad sex trafficking probe, including allegations involving underage women, though it declined to file charges. Gaetz has vigorously denied those accusations. The former congressman was also the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and drug use. 'While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,' Gaetz wrote on social platform X. Here are five possibilities for what could come next for Gaetz. Another role in Trump administration While Gaetz took himself out of the running to be attorney general, President-elect Trump still could appoint him to an administration post, in the White House or elsewhere, that would not require a Senate confirmation hearing. By choosing Gaetz, Trump would have a high-profile defender in his administration without having to go through a messy confirmation process. Senate Republicans were warning that confirmation hearings on Gaetz would be like 'Kavanaugh on steroids,' referring to the hearings in 2018 for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. If Gaetz were to take on another role in the Trump administration, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) would have to set a date for a special election for Gaetz’s seat in the state’s 1st Congressional District. DeSantis has already instructed the Florida secretary of state to set a schedule for the special election, but a date has not yet been determined. The 1st District is a red seat and would likely see a competitive Republican primary. A number of Republicans have already lined up to run in the special election for Gaetz’s seat. Gubernatorial run Gaetz has been among the Republicans floated to run for governor once DeSantis’s term ends in 2026. But a gubernatorial run for Gaetz would come with baggage. 'Gaetz is damaged goods and donors should line up behind someone else,' said Dan Eberhart, a Florida-based Republican donor. 'It’s time for Gaetz to practice law,' he added. A gubernatorial run, however, could still prompt problems for Gaetz up on Capitol Hill. One House Republican, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said there would likely still be a push for more information regarding the allegations against Gaetz, including the Ethics Committee's report. 'If he puts himself out there to run for governor, which is kind of the one everyone seems to think he’s gonna run for, I do think that if not this report, at least some information needs to come out because people need to know who they’re electing,' the lawmaker said. Reps. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) and Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) were also floated for the position, but with Waltz being appointed to serve as Trump’s national security adviser, Gaetz would likely face off against Donalds in a primary. 'Right now, the best-positioned person to be the next governor of Florida is Byron Donalds,' said Ford O’Connell, a Florida-based GOP strategist. Return to House of Representatives Gaetz resigned his seat for the current 118th Congress, but his resignation letter left some wiggle room for Gaetz to return for the 119th Congress that starts on Jan. 3, 2025, since he was reelected to the seat. 'I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration,' Gaetz wrote in his letter. Now that he is no longer pursuing the attorney general position, his intentions may change. It is unclear whether Gaetz could return unilaterally, but some congressional sources believe he can. If not, Gaetz has easily won reelection, and he could likely win a special election. Of course, Gaetz may not even want to return to the House. His wife, Ginger Gaetz, reposted his statement on X about withdrawing from attorney general consideration with a photo of the two on the Capitol steps that was captioned: 'The end of an era.' Being in the House would also mean that the House Ethics Committee would again have jurisdiction over him — and nullifying thorny questions about whether it is appropriate to release a report on a former member. The panel investigated Gaetz on and off for years over allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other matters. Gaetz has vigorously denied the allegations, and the Department of Justice declined to charge him after investigating related matters. Several House Republicans do not want to see Gaetz, who threw the House into chaos when he voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), back in the halls. 'No one wants him back,' one House Republican told The Hill with a chuckle. 'I think that he can get sworn in, I mean he was elected by his district, he has every right. So, I don’t think we could stop him. But he’s not loved, that’s for sure.' 'A collective good riddance from many right-of-center members!' another House Republican told The Hill in reaction to Gaetz’s withdrawal. Media career While there are several paths Gaetz could pursue in government and politics, the Florida Republican could also take a stab at a career in media — an industry in which he already has experience. Gaetz has been a regular presence on TV and other media for years, vigorously defending Trump. In 2021, Gaetz started his own show, the 'Firebrand with Matt Gaetz' podcast, where he gives a 'behind-the-scenes look into the Swamp of Washington without the spin of Fake News and Deep State influence,' according to the show’s description. According to YouTube, he just published his 173rd episode. Gaetz has also occasionally found himself sitting at the anchor desk at other conservative outlets. He has guest-hosted former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s 'War Room' podcast, and been a fill-in host on Newsmax. When discussing his appointment to be attorney general, Newsmax host Greg Kelly referenced the Florida Republican’s time holding the fort for shows on the network. 'Matt Gaetz is a special guy. He's incredibly smart, eloquent, bold, unafraid. He's also the occasional fill-in host on this program. No kidding,' Kelly said, adding: 'I am so honored that we gave him his start, didn't we? No. Matt Gaetz flattered us with his services here at Newsmax, and he is unafraid. And he knows his stuff when he takes on the swamp.' One media watcher is predicting that Gaetz will land at a Newsmax anchor desk when all is said and done. 'I'm guessing Matt Gaetz ends up as a Newsmax host,' Aaron Rupar wrote on X. Appointment to Senate Shortly after Gaetz took his name out of the ring to be attorney general, some floated the possibility that Gaetz could fill Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) seat in the Senate after Rubio is confirmed as secretary of State. The two are former colleagues in the House, and Gaetz helped prepare DeSantis in debate preparation when he first ran for governor in 2018. But the two were on different sides in the 2024 primary. Gaetz backed Trump in the Republican presidential primary last year shortly before DeSantis challenged Trump. The decision on who will fill Rubio’s seat lies with DeSantis, and Gaetz has not been among the names floated for the position. DeSantis is said to be considering his chief of staff James Uthmeier, state Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and state Attorney General Ashley Moody. Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, has been floated by a number of prominent lawmakers and has expressed interest in the position. A scenario in which DeSantis appoints her to the Senate could be viewed as an olive branch to the president-elect. There would be another chance at the Senate in 2026 when the special election for Rubio’s seat is held, but that scenario seems like it would present the same challenges that a statewide run for governor would. 'He’s toxic for the same reasons,' Eberhart said when asked about the possibility of Gaetz going for the Senate seat. 'If he wants back in, he’s gonna need to run on his own.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/whats-next-for-matt-gaetz-5-possibilities/	2024-11-21T15:42:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_022924ar02_w_8ed45c.jpg?w=900
73% worry Social Security won't pay promised benefits: Survey	(NewsNation) — A majority of Americans expect to rely on Social Security benefits when they retire, but according to a new survey, most are worried they won't get them. A Bankrate survey found that more than half (53%) of nonretired U.S. adults expect to count on their Social Security checks to cover necessary expenses in retirement. At the same time, 73% are concerned they won't receive their promised benefits when they retire. Those fears are not unfounded: Social Security is facing a financial shortfall. In roughly a decade, Social Security recipients could see their benefits cut by hundreds of dollars a month if Congress doesn't take action. While it's highly unlikely federal lawmakers will let that happen, so far, they have opted to kick the can down the road, avoiding major changes that could be politically unpopular. Experts say the longer Congress waits, the more drastic the changes will have to be later on. 'There’s a vast divide between Americans’ concern about the looming Social Security funding shortfall and the lack of serious and thorough conversation among elected officials about what to do about it,' Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. 'The result is that the American public’s financial well-being is not being tended to.' Keep in mind: Even if Congress does nothing — and the trust funds that pay out Social Security benefits run out — retirees will still receive a monthly check, but it could be lower than what was promised. The Brookings Institution says today’s financing challenge is 'at least double' what it was in 1983, the last time Social Security was in dire straits. Back then, insolvency was just months away before Congress stepped in. How much do retirees rely on Social Security? Bankrate found that more than three-quarters (77%) of current retirees are reliant on Social Security to pay necessary expenses, including 62% who said they are 'very reliant.' The rising cost of living has hit seniors on fixed incomes especially hard in recent years. Among beneficiaries 65 and older, about 12% of men and 15% of women rely on Social Security to meet 90% of their needs, according to government data. Social Security is meant to replace about 40% of past earnings, but roughly 4 in 10 retirees receive more than 50% of their income from the program. A recent AARP survey suggests retirees could be even more reliant on Social Security in the years ahead, with 20% of adults 50-plus saying they have no retirement savings. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to ease the burden by ending taxes on retirees benefits, but experts say that would require bipartisan buy-in and is unlikely to happen. What is the average retirement check? In October, the average monthly benefit for a retired worker was $1,924, according to the Social Security Administration. Retirees will see a 2.5% bump in January thanks to the annual cost-of-living adjustment. The size of your monthly retirement check is based on several factors, including how long you worked, how much you made over your career and when you started collecting. You can calculate your estimated benefit here. There's no perfect age to start collecting benefits because everyone's circumstances are different, but research suggests it's typically better to wait until age 70. At that point, you can receive up to 124% of your full Social Security benefit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/workers-worry-social-security/	2024-11-21T15:00:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6707efe6621806.04044092.jpeg?w=900
Police report reveals assault allegations against Hegseth, Trump'...	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) — A woman told police that she was sexually assaulted in 2017 by Pete Hegseth after he took her phone, blocked the door to a California hotel room and refused to let her leave, according to a detailed investigative report made public late Wednesday. Hegseth, a former Fox News personality and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be defense secretary, told police at the time that the encounter had been consensual and denied any wrongdoing, the report said. News of the allegations surfaced last week when local officials released a brief statement confirming that a woman had accused Hegseth of sexual assault in October 2017 after he had spoken at a Republican women’s event in Monterey. 'The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared,' Hegseth told reporters Thursday at the Capitol, where he was meeting with senators to build support for his nomination. The report does not say that police found the allegations were false. Police recommended the case report be forwarded to the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office for review. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said Thursday that her office declined to file charges in January of 2018 because they didn't have 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt.' Tim Palatore, Hegseth’s attorney, has said the woman who made the allegations was paid an undisclosed sum in 2023 as part of a confidential settlement to head off the threat of what he described as a baseless lawsuit. The 22-page police report was released in response to a public records request and offers the first detailed account of what the woman alleged to have transpired — one that is at odds with Hegseth’s version of events. The report cited police interviews with the alleged victim, a nurse who treated her, a hotel staffer, another woman at the event and Hegseth. The woman’s name was not released, and The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually assaulted. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition said Thursday that the 'report corroborates' what Hegseth’s legal team has been saying 'all along.' Investigators were first alerted to the alleged assault, the report said, by a nurse who called them after a patient requested a sexual assault exam. The patient told medical personnel she believed she was assaulted five days earlier but couldn’t remember much about what had happened. She reported something may have been slipped into her drink before ending up in the hotel room where she said the assault occurred. Police collected the unwashed dress and underwear she had worn that night, the report said. The woman’s partner, who was staying at the hotel with her, told police that he was worried about her that night after she didn’t come back to their room. At 2 a.m., he went to the hotel bar, but she wasn’t there. She made it back a few hours later, apologizing that she 'must have fallen asleep.' A few days later, she told him she had been sexually assaulted. The woman, who helped organize the California Federation of Republican Women gathering at which Hegseth spoke, told police that she had witnessed the TV anchor acting inappropriately throughout the night and saw him stroking multiple women’s thighs. She texted a friend that Hegseth was giving off a 'creeper' vibe, according to the report. After the event, the woman and others attended an after-party in a hotel suite where she said she confronted Hegseth, telling him that she 'did not appreciate how he treated women,' the report states. A group of people, including Hegseth and the woman, decamped for the hotel’s bar. That’s when 'things got fuzzy,' the woman told police. She remembered having a drink at the bar with Hegseth and others, the police report states. She also told police that she argued with Hegseth near the hotel pool, an account that is supported by a hotel staffer who was sent to handle the disturbance and spoke to police, according to the report. Soon, she told police, she was inside a hotel room with Hegseth, who took her phone and blocked the door with his body so that she could not leave, according to the report. She also told police she remembered 'saying ‘no’ a lot,' the report said. Her next memory was of lying on a couch or bed with a bare-chested Hegseth hovering over her, his dog tags dangling, the report states. Hegseth served in the National Guard, rising to the rank of major. After Hegseth finished, she recalled he threw a towel at her and asked if she was 'OK,' the report states. She told police she did not recall how she got back to her own hotel room and had since suffered from nightmares and memory loss. At the time of the alleged assault, Hegseth, now 44, was going through a divorce with his second wife, with whom he has three children. She filed for divorce after he had a child with a Fox News producer who is now his third wife, according to court records and social media posts by Hegseth. His first marriage ended in 2009, also after infidelity by Hegseth, according to court records. Hegseth, who joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 before becoming co-host of 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' left the network after Trump announced his intention to nominate him. Hegseth said he attended an after party and drank beer but did not consume liquor, and acknowledged being 'buzzed' but not drunk. He said he met the woman at the hotel bar, and she led him by the arm back to his hotel room, which surprised him because he initially had no intention of having sex with her, the report said. Hegseth told investigators that the sexual encounter that followed was consensual, adding that he explicitly asked more than once if she was comfortable. Hegseth said in the morning the woman 'showed early signs of regret,' and he assured her that he wouldn’t tell anyone about the encounter. Hegseth’s attorney said a payment was made to the woman as part of a confidential settlement a few years after the police investigation because Hegseth was concerned that she was prepared to file a lawsuit that he feared could have resulted in him being fired from Fox News, where he was a popular host. The attorney would not reveal the amount of the payment. ___ Slodysko reported from Washington and Linderman from Baltimore.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-police-report-reveals-assault-allegations-against-hegseth/	2024-11-21T14:46:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673fb9786c66b5.78382331.jpeg?w=900
Family fears missing woman Hannah Kobayashi was trafficked	(NewsNation) — The family of a woman who has been missing for over a week says they fear she may have been trafficked. Hannah Kobayashi was on her way to New York from Hawaii but missed her connecting flight in Los Angeles on Nov. 8, 2024. Her family says they received suspicious texts from the missing 31-year-old and says she was spotted on surveillance video in downtown LA near a Metro stop about a block from where the Los Angeles Lakers play. She was accompanied by an unidentified person. 4-year-old Florida boy found dead after vanishing from park A rally is planned for Thursday afternoon outside the Crypto.com Arena as her family searches for Kobayashi. Her aunt, Larie Pidgeon, said the unreleased surveillance footage showed Kobayashi was not alone and that she did not look well in the video. Kobayashi was wearing the same clothing she had worn when she arrived from Maui. Earlier sightings included one at the Grove Shopping Center, where Kobayashi posted to Instagram from a Nike event on Nov. 10. In a video obtained by the family, Kobayashi is seen strolling through the event that day wearing headphones. Her relatives are especially concerned about text messages from Kobayashi's phone on Nov. 11. One stated, 'I got hacked, stripped of my identity, I can't fly.' Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Another said, 'I got tricked pretty much into giving away my funds for someone I thought I loved. I've been on the streets.' According to Pidgeon, the wording in the text is suspicious, and the phone has been turned off since Nov. 11. 'Time is of the essence, and it's dwindling, so we are terrified,' Pidgeon said. 'We're thinking of things like, was she abducted? I hate to say it, but the word 'trafficked.'' Posters and flyers are plastered throughout the area. Another question focuses on the Metros top, which does not connect to LAX. You have to make a connection from another line, which has left the family wondering if someone brought her to the area by the stadium. Family pleads for help finding pregnant Indiana woman who vanished in October The family filed a formal missing persons report on Nov. 12, and police confirmed there is an investigation underway. Since there is no hard evidence of a crime or foul play, the family fears her case is not a priority to officers. Her family is focusing their search in the area around the arena and are hoping the rally, right before a Lakers game, will lead to new leads.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/family-fear-hannah-kobayashi-trafficked/	2024-11-21T14:04:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HannahKobayashi.jpg?w=229
Veronica Butler autopsy released after judge’s ruling	(NewsNation) — The autopsy of a Kansas woman has been released after a judge denied a motion that would have kept it sealed. The report says Veronica Butler, 27, suffered about 30 cuts and stab wounds throughout her body. There was also one blunt force injury to the top of her head and possible stun gun marks to the lower neck. Investigators said her body was found in a freezer under a concrete slab buried up to 8 feet below ground and sealed with yellow ratchet straps. Investigators said they also found clothing, a stun gun, a roll of tape and a sheathed knife. Kansas moms killings: What we know Butler and Jilian Kelley, 39, were killed earlier this year after they traveled from Hugoton, Kansas, to pick up Butler’s children in Oklahoma. The women never made it to the children. They disappeared March 30, and their bodies were found about two weeks later. Five people have been arrested and charged in the case, including the children’s grandmother. Tifany Adams, 54; her boyfriend Tad Cullum, 43; Cora Twombly, 44; and her husband Cole Twombly, 50; and Paul Grice, 31, have each been charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder. Wrangler Rickman, the father of the two children, had legal custody but was in a rehabilitation facility, so the children were living with Adams at the time of the disappearance. Exclusive: Kansas moms murder suspects kept apart in jail Police have described the two women as more acquaintances than friends. NewsNation reported that Kelley was the supervisor of the childhood visits for Butler. Family members, who have been asked to postpone media interviews until the police tell them otherwise, say the two women were involved in their community and their churches.

Pentagon admits some UAP sightings still unexplained	(NewsNation) — The Pentagon recently said it solved one of the most high-profile videos of a UFO, revealing that the famed 'GOFAST' video was a trick of the eye. The unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP) was spotted by a jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2016 off the East Coast, appearing to fly at high speeds. But in a Senate hearing, the director of the Pentagon testified the object was an ordinary one, appearing to be moving very fast and very close to water due to an optical illusion known as parallax. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action Nick Pope, who investigated UFOs for the British Ministry of Defense, said he believes it is a good thing for the Pentagon to resolve cases like that one. 'This is good news because then they can move on to the ones that, even by their own admission, they can't explain,' he told NewsNation. The Pentagon maintains that there is no evidence UAPs are connected to extraterrestrial life, though believers think otherwise. Pope said it's a good sign that AARO is ramping up efforts to work with the academic and scientific communities to study sightings, noting that 99% of cases can be eliminated as conventional objects. What do UFOs look like? The best plan, he said, is to eliminate those and focus on the cases that are left. 'It only takes one of these cases to be the real thing, something genuinely extraterrestrial, and it will change our world forever,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/pentagon-some-uap-sightings-unexplained/	2024-11-21T12:42:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/NAVAIR_GOFAST_video_poster_5fe476.jpg?w=900
Daniel Penny trial: Pathologist disputes chokehold death finding	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — A forensic pathologist testified Thursday in defense of the military-trained commuter charged with killing Jordan Neely. A New York City medical examiner determined that Daniel Penny’s chokehold killed Neely, an agitated, mentally ill man whom Penny and some other riders found threatening. But the defense's pathologist, Dr. Satish Chundru, told jurors that Neely's medical records and bystander video didn't show telltale signs of known types of fatal chokehold. Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general Among the discrepancies, he said: The location and extent of bruising on Neely's neck and the small amount of petechiae — small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding — on his eyelids. He said Neely died from 'the combined effects' of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Penny, 26, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. His defense says the Marine veteran and architecture student was defending himself and a car full of subway riders. Neely, 30, sometimes entertained subway riders as a Michael Jackson impersonator. But he also had a history of psychiatric and drug problems and a criminal record that included assaulting a woman at a subway station. Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett’s conviction When they crossed paths in a subway car on May 1, 2023, Neely was begging for money, shouting about being willing to die or go to jail, and making sudden movements, according to witnesses. Penny has said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, 'I will kill.' Penny put his arm around Neely's neck, took him to the floor and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving at roughly the last minute.

Donald Trump could create first 'crypto czar'	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is considering adding a new position to his administration: the nation’s first-ever 'crypto czar.' The role would oversee cryptocurrency policy and regulation and act as a liaison between Congress and the White House. Trump's top team is meeting with bitcoin and crypto experts to discuss the role. Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general Trump has several crypto businesses himself and, during his campaign, had promised to make the United States the crypto capital of the world by creating a bitcoin strategic reserve.

The idea is in its early stages. Bloomberg reports that many of the conversations are in their initial processes, and there are still discussions about whether the role would be a specific White House administrative role or more of a 'czar' position, which is more colloquial for someone being a point person to spearhead a certain topic. What’s clear is that Trump has spoken very positively about the issue of cryptocurrency on the campaign trail and even gave remarks at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, this summer. 'If crypto is going to define the future, I want to be mined, minted and made in the USA,' Trump said. 'It's not going to be made anywhere else. Bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say. It’s going to the moon. I want America to be the nation that leads the way, and that's what's going to happen. You’re going to be very happy with me.' The price of bitcoin in just the past month has skyrocketed since the election. That’s largely because there are a lot of cryptocurrency investors who remain optimistic that this administration will be favorable to bitcoin and to cryptocurrency in the future. Sanctuary cities plan to resist Trump’s mass deportation plans Sen. Debbie Stabenow from Michigan has been trying to push cryptocurrency legislation since this summer and has encountered some roadblocks — both from within her own party as well as from across the aisle. She’s looking for ways to offer regulations and consumer protections, trying to make a push, according to Politico, before the new session comes into effect and Republicans take the majority in the Senate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-first-crypto-czar/	2024-11-21T11:30:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182554552.jpg?w=900
Are athletes being targeted by transnational crime ring?	(NewsNation) — The FBI is investigating whether a recent spate of burglaries at the homes of high-profile professional athletes is connected to a transnational crime ring. Last month, the homes of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce were broken into within days of each other, according to law enforcement reports. Mahomes said he couldn’t provide many details because the investigation is ongoing. Kelce’s losses included $20,000 in cash, according to a police report. In November, the home of Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis was burglarized by at least two people. That incident was captured on Portis’ home surveillance system. Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett’s conviction In September, burglars broke into the home of Minnesota Timberwolves player Mike Conley, stealing jewelry. NBC News reports the FBI is working to figure out if a transnational crime ring — possibly one from South America — is responsible. 'Referring to them as gangs kind of brings up this vision of street gangs,' retired FBI agent Bobby Chacon told NewsNation. 'These are not gangs in that sense. They are more organized rings or cells of thieves that are very highly trained.' The gang’s modus operandi, however, may end up giving them away, according to Chacon. 'The more sophisticated some of these groups actually become easier to find ... because they leave a signature, some type of thing that either enables them to defeat a sophisticated security system or get into a house in a certain way,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/athletes-targeted-transnational-crime-ring/	2024-11-21T11:06:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24318678707600.jpg?w=900
Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua now in 16 states: Report	(NewsNation) — The Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua has spread to 16 U.S. states, according to a New York Post report citing an internal Department of Homeland Security memo. The gang has reportedly established a presence in Virginia, Montana, Wyoming, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.

The New York Post cited internal communication from the Department of Homeland Security and shared a partial image of a memo in its reporting. NewsNation has not reviewed the memo or independently verified the report. GOP senator: Using military for deportations would be ‘huge mistake’ The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to NewsNation’s request for comment. Earlier this week, House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., issued a statement warning that the gang was operating in Tennessee. Green blamed President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it 'intentionally threw our borders wide open' and 'gutted interior enforcement.' 'Tennesseans — and our entire country — shouldn’t be forced to live in fear of heinous gangs because of this administration’s inability to secure our borders,' Green said. The gang started in a prison in the Venezuelan state of Aragua nearly a decade ago. It’s since expanded into what the Justice Department calls a 'transnational criminal organization.' The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the group in July, freezing assets and blocking transactions in the U.S. Several high-profile cases, including the death of 12-year-old Texas girl Jocelyn Nungaray, have fueled speculation about alleged migrant gang crimes. As for confirmed instances of TdA crimes in the U.S., some local leaders say the issue has been blown out of proportion. Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman refuted Trump’s comments about the city being a 'war zone.' 'The reality is that the concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been grossly exaggerated,' Coffman wrote in an Oct. 8 Facebook post. 'The incidents were limited to several apartment complexes in this city of more than 400,000 residents.' Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border Colorado Democratic Governor Jared Polis also pushed back on Trump’s rhetoric. In a statement to NewsNation local affiliate KDVR, he called Aurora an 'incredible city with two straight years of rapidly declining crime.' Aurora police have acknowledged that 'components of Tren de Aragua' are operating in the area and have identified at least 10 known members. Multiple studies analyzing crime data have shown that immigrants commit crimes at a much lower rate than U.S. citizens. That’s true for both violent and nonviolent crimes.

Matt Gaetz withdraws from nomination as attorney general	(NewsNation) — Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has withdrawn his name from the running for attorney general following controversy over his nomination. Gaetz announced on X he had made the decision to withdraw after meeting with Senators for feedback. 'While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1,' he said. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Gaetz resigned from his seat in the current Congress once he was nominated and said at the time he would not be sworn into his seat in the upcoming Congress on Jan. 3, 2025. However, now that he has backed out of the nomination, it is technically possible he could choose to take up the seat again. If Gaetz does not return to the House, Florida will hold a special election to fill the vacant seat. Many had expressed doubts over Gaetz's nomination due to an ongoing investigation by the House Ethics Committee and the fact that he's faced allegations of sex trafficking and soliciting a minor. The Justice Department declined to charge Gaetz after investigating him for sexual conduct and illicit drug use. The Ethics Committee had been getting close to releasing the report on Gaetz when he resigned, halting the process because the committee doesn't typically release reports on former lawmakers. There has been mounting public pressure for the committee to break with that precedent, however, in the face of Gaetz's nomination. Speaker Johnson: Capitol bathrooms restricted by ‘biological sex’ On Wednesday, the committee met to discuss the issue but failed to reach a consensus. A hacker released documents purportedly from the investigation to The New York Times, which included testimony from a woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 and he was an adult. Another document allegedly from the investigation appeared to show Gaetz paying money for sex. If Gaetz were to take his seat up again, the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over him would resume along with the investigation and possible consequences based on the findings. This is a developing story.

Illinois Supreme Court reverses actor Jussie Smollett's convictio...	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — The Illinois Supreme Court has reversed the conviction of actor Jussie Smollett. The former 'Empire' actor took his case to the Illinois Supreme Court in September in a last-ditch effort to have his 2021 conviction overturned. The court cited Smollett's second prosecution after his charges were initially dropped as the main reason why his conviction was overturned. 'Today we resolve a question about the State’s responsibility to honor the agreements it makes with defendants. Specifically, we address whether a dismissal of a case by nolle prosequi allows the State to bring a second prosecution when the dismissal was entered as part of an agreement with the defendant and the defendant has performed his part of the bargain. We hold that a second prosecution under these circumstances is a due process violation, and we therefore reverse defendant’s conviction,' the Illinois Supreme Court wrote in its ruling. Smollett was convicted of falsely reporting a 2019 hate crime against him in 2021. Smollett, who is Black and gay, alleged his attackers shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him before putting a noose around his neck on a freezing night in Streeterville. He was found guilty of five counts of disorderly conduct for setting up the attack. Testimony at his trial indicated he paid two brothers, whom he knew from the set of the TV show, $3,500 to carry out the 'attack.' But prior to his conviction, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx initially dropped his 16 charges in Apr. 2019 — which is the basis of Thursday's Supreme Court ruling. Foxx, who recused herself from the case after she communicated with a Smollett relative during the probe, reiterated that she welcomed of an independent investigation into the way she and her office handled the case. That came in Aug. of 2019, when Cook County Judge Michael Toomin’s appointed former U.S. attorney Dan Webb as special prosecutor. Previous: Jussie Smollett found guilty on 5 of 6 counts of disorderly conduct Webb led the prosecution efforts the second time around and Smollett was found guilty of five of six disorderly conduct charges on Dec. 9, 2021. Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, 30 months of probation, and ordered to pay more than $130,000 in restitution. So far, he has served six days of that sentence. According to the ruling's conclusion, the Illinois Supreme Court cited Bill Cosby's case as one that also generated 'significant public interest.' The court went on to allude to Smollett's original charges being dropped and said while 'many people' were dissatisfied with that — it 'would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people detrimentally relied.' In addition to the aforementioned public interest, Cosby's case was cited from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania regarding enforcing a prosecutorial promise not to prosecute. 'It cannot be gainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true that no such interest, however important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring that the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution does not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons,' the court wrote regarding Cosby. The Appellate Court of Illinois denied Smollett’s request to toss his conviction in December of last year. The Illinois Supreme Court noted that Chief Justice Theis and Justice Cunningham did not take part in the consideration or decision of Smollett's case. Special prosecutor Dan Webb sent the following lengthy statement, saying he disagreed with the decision. 'We are disappointed in the Illinois Supreme Court’s decision today to overturn Jussie Smollett’s convictions and sentence, including the award of over $120,000 in restitution to the City of Chicago for its overtime expenses in investigating Mr. Smollett’s fake hate crime. We respectfully disagree with the Court’s factual and legal reasoning which upends long-standing Illinois precedent. Indeed, the Special Prosecutor’s brief to the Illinois Supreme Court was replete with Illinois case law that would not preclude a second, new prosecution following a dismissal without prejudice via nolle prosequi. Even the Illinois Supreme Court agreed in its opinion that its holding today was not explicit in earlier Illinois decisions. Make no mistake—today’s ruling has nothing to do with Mr. Smollett’s innocence. The Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury’s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct. In fact, Mr. Smollett did not even challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him in his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. My office spent nearly two years developing evidence and working closely with the Chicago Police Department to prepare that case for trial. It is very important I point out that today’s decision is also not the result of any error or conduct by the Office of the Special Prosecutor, the trial court, or the Chicago Police Department. In fact, the events that led to the Illinois Supreme Court to reverse Mr. Smollett’s conviction occurred 5 months before I was appointed as Special Prosecutor. Rather, today’s decision is only possible because of the unprecedented resolution of Mr. Smollett’s initial case by the Cook County State’s Attorneys’ Office (CCSAO) in March 2019, which the Illinois Supreme Court determined barred Mr. Smollett from any further prosecution. The Illinois Supreme Court reached this decision notwithstanding the fact that the CCSAO dismissed the initial Smollett case via a nolle prosequi, which does not bar re-prosecution under Illinois law, and Mr. Smollett’s own lawyers told the public immediately following the dismissal of his initial case in March 2019 that there was 'no deal' with the CCSAO. As previously set forth in my 63-page, very detailed Special Prosecutor’s Public Summary Report, my office developed evidence of substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures by the CCSAO in prosecuting and resolving the initial 2019 Smollett case, and also found that State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx and other CCSAO prosecutors made multiple false and/or misleading statements to the public. Those significant failures and false and/or misleading statements by State’s Attorney Foxx’s office led Cook County Judge Michael B. Toomin to appoint me as Special Prosecutor in order to restore the public’s faith in Illinois’ criminal justice system. In fact, there was a public clamor to have a well-respected trial lawyer and law firm agree to become a special prosecutor in order to help restore the public’s confidence in the Cook County judicial system. My law firm, Winston &amp; Strawn LLP, accepted the appointment pro bono with no compensation to the firm in order to give back to the City of Chicago. Our Winston &amp; Strawn lawyers fulfilled this mandate by devoting over 5 years and more than 15,000 hours in examining the original Smollett investigation and bringing new charges, which yielded a unanimous jury conviction of Mr. Smollett in 2021 on five felony counts of wrongful misconduct. Nothing about today’s decision upsets the work undertaken by the Special Prosecutor’s office, or the overwhelming evidence underlying the jury’s verdict that Mr. Smollett faked a hate crime and reported it as a real hate crime to the Chicago Police Department. Despite today’s ruling, the City of Chicago remains able to pursue its pending civil lawsuit against Mr. Smollett in order to recoup the over $120,000 in overtime expenses the Chicago Police Department incurred for investigating Mr. Smollett’s fake hate crime. I want to provide a special thanks to Deputy Special Prosecutors Sean G. Wieber, Samuel Mendenhall, and the entire team at Winston &amp; Strawn who assisted in this matter, for all of their dedication and efforts over the years. Today’s ruling does not change how deeply proud I am of the work my Special Prosecutor’s office accomplished; nor does it undermine the jury’s verdict, and most importantly, it does not clear Jussie Smollett’s name—he is not innocent.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/illinois-supreme-court-reverses-actor-jussie-smolletts-conviction/	2024-11-21T08:43:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Bookingphoto2-e1732203524508.jpg?w=900

JD Vance, R-Ohio, speaks during a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News, with Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Sen. JD Vance was chosen to be Trump’s running mate in July, with Trump announcing him as the Republican National Convention kicked off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Republican from Ohio gained national prominence through his bestselling memoir, 'Hillbilly Elegy.' During his time in the Senate, Vance, who was once one of Trump's biggest critics, later became one of the fiercest defenders of Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' agenda, especially when it comes to foreign policy, trade and immigration. What Trump’s administration could mean for education In 2021, he secured Trump’s endorsement during the Senate primary to fill the vacancy left by retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Vance then won the general Senate race against Democratic candidate Tim Ryan and took office in January 2023. Susie Wiles, White House chief of staff West Palm Beach, FL - November 6 : Susie Wiles speaks with Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump after he was declared the winner during an election night watch party at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida in the early hours of Wednesday, Nov. 06, 2024. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Susie Wiles is a longtime Republican strategist and the leader of Trump's 2024 campaign who worked alongside the president-elect in 2016. Wiles will be the first woman to be a White House chief of staff. Since her start as a scheduler for Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign, she's also worked for Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. She is the daughter of the late NFL player turned broadcaster Pat Summerall.

'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.'

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Miller is one of Trump's longest-serving aides. A senior adviser in Trump's first term who crafted many of the president-elect's speeches, The Associated Press reports Miller's been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, including the move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018. After Trump left office, Miller became president of America First Legal, which the AP says was fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union that challenged the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others. Tom Homan, 'border czar' Homan will be charged with overseeing the United States' borders.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Homan, as 'border czar,' is expected to make deportation a top priority. At the Republican National Convention, he said that he had a message to the 'millions' of undocumented migrants in the country: 'You better start packing now.' As acting director of ICE from January 2017 through June 2018, Homan backed Trump's zero tolerance policy at the border in his first term, which resulted in thousands of families being separated at the southern border. He's previously said that workplace raids would resume in the Trump administration. Before joining ICE, Homan was a police officer in West Carthage, New York, and later had positions as a Border Patrol agent, investigator and supervisor. Former Democratic President Barack Obama appointed Homan to be the executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2013.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Trump's pick for ambassador to the United Nations, was elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 30 in 2014, making her the youngest woman elected to Congress in United States history at the time. She currently serves as chair of the House Republican Conference, a position she was chosen for when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,' Trump said in a statement. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.' Stefanik said she had a conversation with Trump where she told him 'how deeply humbled' she was to accept the nomination. 'I stand ready to advance President Donald J. Trump’s restoration of America First peace through strength leadership on the world stage on Day One at the United Nations,' Stefanik said on X Monday. Lee Zeldin, EPA administrator FILE - Former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., speaks at a rally in Concord, N.H., Jan. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Attorney Lee Zeldin was chosen Monday to be Trump's administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. From 2015 to 2023, he served New York’s 1st Congressional District as a U.S. representative, and he ran for governor of the state in 2022, losing to current Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. Zeldin was on active duty in the United States Army for four years and is currently a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. 'Lee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies,' Trump said in a statement. 'He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.' What to know about Trump’s inauguration Zeldin said on X that 'it is an honor' to join the administration. 'We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,' Zeldin said. 'We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.' Mike Waltz, national security adviser Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) leaves a closed-door House Republican conference meeting on Tuesday, January 10, 2023. Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., to be his national security adviser, according to multiple reports. Waltz, a Green Beret combat vet and longtime Trump surrogate, has held office in his native Florida since 2019, when he took over DeSantis' post in the state's 6th Congressional District. The 50-year-old has called for Europe to do more to support Ukraine and for the U.S. to be more stringent with its support, aligning with a key foreign policy goal of the president-elect. He has also been a staunch critic of the Biden administration’s 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. The position doesn't require Senate confirmation, meaning Waltz will assume his role as soon as Trump is inaugurated. Trump went through multiple national security advisers during his first term. Michael Flynn was in the role for just a few weeks before resigning amid controversy over his conversations with Russia. Others to hold the post included H.R. McMaster, John Bolton and Robert O’Brien. Marco Rubio, secretary of state FILE - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks with members of the media, Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) Trump has chosen Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to be his secretary of state, saying that he will be a 'strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior.' The longtime politician, 53, will serve as the 47th president's top diplomat. He's considered one of the most conservative senators in Congress despite his position on immigration reform having diverged from the party’s consensus at one point. In terms of foreign policy, Rubio supported U.S. interventions in Iraq and Libya and has been supportive of sanctions against Iran. He has warned against China’s influence in the global sphere, supporting higher tariffs to limit the country’s ability to export cheaper products to the U.S. Close Thank you for signing up!

Kristi Noem, Homeland Security secretary FILE- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem speaks in Oxon Hill, Md., Feb. 23, 2024. Longstanding social media accounts belonging to Gov. Noem and reaching hundreds of thousands of followers appear to have been deleted without explanation Monday, July 8. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Trump has chosen South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to serve as the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security during his second term, The Hill confirmed. Noem said Friday that Democratic governors who have pledged to resist Trump’s immigration policies are being 'extremely irresponsible' and should instead seek dialogue with the incoming administration. She has been supportive of the Justice Department’s decision to suspend investigations into Trump, saying it was 'a good first step' toward restoring faith in federal law enforcement agencies. As governor, Noem has faced ups and downs with tribal governments in South Dakota. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? She offered emergency assistance after flooding in 2019, moved the state Office of Indian Education from the state Department of Education to the state Department of Tribal Affairs, has been banned from many of the nine reservations at different times and shifted funding so the state’s law enforcement training program could conduct the first-ever class for tribal officers this year.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Trump announced Tuesday he will nominate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel. Huckabee served as governor from 1996 to 2007, and ran for president in the 2008 and 2016 Republican primaries. Calling Huckabee a great public servant, governor and 'Leader in Faith' for many years, Trump said in a statement he 'loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him.' His daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is the current governor of Arkansas. Steven C.

'Steve is a Highly Respected Leader in Business and Philanthropy, who has made every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous. Steve will be an unrelenting Voice for PEACE, and make us all proud,' Trump's statement reads. Witkoff, a real estate investor and founder of the Witkoff Group, is the president-elect's golf partner. He was with Trump at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, when a second attempt was made on the Republican's life back in September. Trump also tagged Witkoff to co-chair his inaugural committee alongside Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.. John Ratcliffe, director of the CIA FILE - In this Dec. 9, 2019, file photo, Rep.

(Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool) Trump has tapped his former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe to serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 'From exposing fake Russian collusion to be a Clinton campaign operation, to catching the FBI’s abuse of Civil Liberties at the FISA Court, John Ratcliffe has always been a warrior for Truth and Honesty with the American Public. When 51 intelligence officials were lying about Hunter Biden’s laptop, there was one, John Ratcliffe, telling the truth to the American People,' the president-elect said in a statement obtained by NewsNation. Before he replaced Dan Coats to be Trump's highest ranking intelligence official, Ratcliffe served as a representative in Texas from 2019 to 2020.

Trump announced McGinley as White House counsel Tuesday, praising him as a 'smart and tenacious lawyer who will help me advance our America First agenda.' 'He served in my first term as White House Cabinet Secretary and played a major role in our election victory as the RNC’s Outside Counsel for Election Integrity. Bill has served as General Counsel at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has been a partner at two international law firms, and will work with me as we Make America Great Again!' the announcement from Trump reads.

(Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) Trump nominated Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense Tuesday, appointing the 44-year-old 'Fox &amp; Friends' co-host to be the nation's principal defense policymaker. If confirmed, he would be the second youngest ever to hold the position. Sources told NewsNation's Kellie Meyer that Pentagon officials are 'shocked,' with one source referring to Hegseth as young and inexperienced. A Pentagon press corps member added that they 'didn't see this coming.' Trump administration picks may limit House majority Hegseth served as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, according to his website. 'Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country. Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in his announcement. The Princeton and Harvard grad has authored multiple books and outwardly supported Trump's military endeavors in the past, including his decision to kill Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, department of government efficiency Trump tagged billionaire ally Elon Musk and former rival Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 'Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,' Trump said in an announcement obtained by NewsNation. The president-elect referred to DOGE as 'The Manhattan Project' of his presidency, adding that the pair will 'work together to liberate our Economy, and make the U.S. Government accountable to 'WE THE PEOPLE.'' A comment from Musk was also included in the announcement: 'This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!' Trump predicted their restructuring of the government to finish no later than July 4, 2026 — the nation's 250th anniversary.

Clayton, an attorney at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who specializes in mergers and capital-raising, is a political independent who developed a reputation while at the SEC for trying to forge consensus with the agency's Democratic commissioners. Clayton is likely to be seen as a somewhat unconventional pick for the office known for high-profile financial crime prosecutions, as he does not have any criminal law experience.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) Trump has chosen North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to head the Interior Department. In 2016, Burgum ran for governor, his first campaign for elected office. He touted a message of 'reinventing' government as the state dealt with a massive revenue shortfall. In a major upset, Burgum defeated North Dakota’s longtime attorney general in the Republican gubernatorial primary. He handily won his first term in the strong Republican state, which has about 784,000 residents. He was easily reelected in 2020. Burgum ran for president from June to December 2023. He campaigned on priorities of energy, economy and national security, but dropped out after his bid failed to resonate. He appeared in two Republican debates — including the first, which he attended after hurting his Achilles tendon playing basketball. He drew attention for his campaign offering $20 gift cards to people who would donate $1 to his campaign so he would have enough individual donors to make the debate stage. In January, before the Iowa caucuses, he endorsed Trump. The same month, he declined to seek a third term as governor.

Sergio Gor, White House personnel Trump appointed Sergio Gor, an ally and business partner of his son, Donald Trump Jr., to run the White House’s personnel office in his new administration. Gor is slated to lead the Presidential Personnel Office, an important position given Trump’s desire to stock his administration with loyalists and root out any individuals who may not follow through with his agenda. The office helps identify and put forward appointees to fill thousands of jobs across the federal government. 'Awesome news. Sergio will be great!' Trump Jr. posted on the social platform X about news of Gor’s appointment. Gor is a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and co-founded a publishing company with Trump Jr. that has published books by the president-elect and conservative personalities such as Charlie Kirk and Peter Navarro.

In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal after Trump’s victory, he touted the markets’ response to Trump’s win, arguing it shows their 'unambiguous embrace of the Trump 2.0 economic vision.' 'Markets are signaling expectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans,' Bessent wrote. Russ Vought, Office of Management and Budget director Russell Thurlow Vought will once again be part of a Trump White House, with the president-elect tapping him to serve as Office of Management and Budget director. Vought held the same role during part of Trump's first administration, from July 2020 to January 2021. Before becoming OMB's acting director from 2019 to 2020, he was the agency's deputy director in 2018. 'Russ knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government, and he will help us return Self Governance to the People,' Trump posted on Truth Social. 'We will restore fiscal sanity to our Nation, and unleash the American People to new levels of Prosperity and Ingenuity.' Vought is also a co-author of Project 2025, the nearly 1,000-page conservative playbook from The Heritage Foundation. Vought penned the chapter on the Executive Office of the President of the United States — which largely references OMB. 'After vehemently denying his links to Project 2025 through the campaign, the President-elect just tapped its lead architect, Russell Vought, to run his coming all-of-government purge as Director of the Office of Management and Budget,' Democrats on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee said in a joint statement.

Side hustles becoming a necessity for some Americans	(NewsNation) — Having a second job used to be associated with greater financial freedom but, for many Americans, side hustles have become a necessity. No longer just a means for spare cash, side gigs are an important contribution to many household incomes. Matthew Kallish is among those with a second full-time job. After working a graveyard shift at a New Jersey hotel, he then heads back for another eight hours of work as a mailman. Man wins $650K on lottery ticket using numbers tied to late wife 'It’s definitely a struggle,' Kallish said. 'Staying up all night, which is a struggle in itself, and then knowing that you’re coming to work another whole shift at another job.' More than one-third of people with a so-called side hustle need the work to afford living essentials like rent and groceries, according to a BankRate survey. 'It’s hard,' Kallish said. 'With the cost of gas and groceries. Sometimes, at the end of the week, all the big bills are paid but we’re waiting until Friday to go grocery shopping because there’s only so much money to go around — even with both jobs.' Financial expert Rachel Cruz says Americans struggling to make ends meet should pause investing while paying off debt and sell things they don’t use or need. Skipping a vacation or going one month on 'no spending' can help ease the burden. Burning the candle at both ends shouldn’t be a long-term solution, she said. 'It’s easy to wander into debt and really hard to get out,' she said. 'So those two to three extra jobs to keep you afloat to be able to get you out of debt are key. But once you're out of debt and you have an emergency fund in place, then my hope would be that your full-time job can take care of your living expenses and you can still live below your means.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/side-hustles-necessity-some-americans/	2024-11-21T05:51:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/fdf78e6255a04e2da5ca885c746999d3.jpg?w=900
Egregious patterns of abuse' in Florida migrant facility: ACLU	(NewsNation) — A migrant woman with a history of mental illness spent a month in solitary confinement at a Florida detention center and experienced abuse and neglect, a civil rights complaint filed last week alleges. The woman, named only as Ana, suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression, yet her intake forms at the Baker County Detention Center in Macclenny, Florida, categorized her as having no 'major mental illness such as . . . major depressive (disorder),' the ACLU of Florida said in the complaint, co-filed with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization. Still, she was placed in isolation in a 'filthy' and 'dark' cell without a mattress, according to the complaint, which was submitted to the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Ana, a 33-year-old domestic violence and human trafficking survivor from an unspecified Spanish-speaking country, arrived at Baker in May 2023 under U.S. Immigrations and Enforcement custody. Her intake forms incorrectly identify English as her spoken language, the complaint says. The language barrier and lack of translation services exacerbated her abusive experience in the detention center. The jail operates in part as an immigration detention facility and has faced multiple civil rights suits since 2022. This year, a Baker officer was convicted of sexual battery on an inmate and sentenced to 25 years. 'Ana’s experiences at Baker illustrate many of the most egregious patterns of abuse at the facility, including sexual abuse in the form of voyeurism, abuse of solitary confinement,' the complaint says, 'the improper use of force and restraints, denial of mental health care, denial of access to counsel, failure to provide language access services and incomplete and falsified records.' Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border A Florida lawmaker wants the facility shut down. 'What I saw was horrible. I saw conditions that no human should have to live in,' said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., in an Instagram video call with the ACLU of Florida on Monday. Frost said he visited the ICE facility before. 'We are talking about the medical unit. The problem here too is a lot of that medical unit is being used to house people, or being used as a solitary confinement,' Frost said. 'Do what’s right — shut down this facility.' Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden praised the facility's staff in a Facebook post Monday from the Baker County Sheriff's Office page, saying, 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated Detention staff. They do an outstanding job, and I am incredibly proud of their unwavering commitment to the citizens of Baker County.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/florida-migrant-facility-aclu-complaint/	2024-11-21T05:29:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66fae40d3095e1.75671394.jpeg?w=900
City of Asheville lifts boil water notice seven weeks after Helen...	(NewsNation) — Asheville, North Carolina, residents can safely drink from the tap now that the citywide boil water notice has been lifted, the city's water department announced Tuesday. The announcement came more than seven weeks after Helene, the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. since Katrina, swept through the Southeast. Officials had been flushing the water system for a week until Saturday when no raw or untreated water remained, according to city spokesperson Clay Chandler. They tested 120 samples over the weekend. 'Customers may resume normal usage of the water system. It is no longer advisable to use bottled water for consumption,' Chandler said at a news conference. National Weather Service releases Helene wind damage assessment The storm damaged water lines at the North Forth Reservoir, Asheville's water source, forcing residents to rely on bottled water for drinking, cooking and bathing for close to 55 days. The city expects a surge in water demand, so residents should avoid large-volume usage, including filling bathtubs, watering yards and taking long showers. Western North Carolina was hit hard when Helene struck Sept. 27, wiping out infrastructure and knocking out power for weeks. At least 42 people died in Buncombe County where Asheville is located. Schools remained closed for about a month due to undrinkable water and road repairs. 'We understand that an initial disruption in water service, followed by not having potable water out of the tap, was disruptive and frustrating, and we thank you for hanging in there with us,' Chandler said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/asheville-north-carolina-boil-water-notice-helene/	2024-11-21T05:06:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/helene_aid_093024ap01_w.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — David Smith, the ex-husband of Susan Smith and father of the two boys she murdered, expressed 'much relief' Wednesday upon learning that Susan had been denied parole. Susan Smith was convicted of two counts of murder in 1994 after allowing her car to roll into a South Carolina lake with her sons, Michael and Alex, inside. In the days leading up to the parole hearing, David shared that he had 'spoken' to his sons in his own way. 'We had a lot of discussions,' he revealed exclusively on Banfield. 'Time heals some wounds. But for me, personally, time does not heal the loss of a child,' Smith said. During 'Banfield's' one-hour exclusive episode, Smith shared never-before-seen images of Michael and Alex Smith.

Smith’s voice shook as she spoke to board members over a video call and expressed remorse for the boys’ deaths. She told the parole board that she’s a Christian and asked them to show her 'that same kind of mercy, as well.' 'I know that what I did was horrible,' she said, wiping her eyes. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it. I love Michael and Alex with all my heart.' Trump’s border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes Smith was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for the deaths of her 3-year-old son Michael and 14-month-old Alex. She initially told police a carjacker took off with her children still inside the vehicle. The case drew international attention as Smith pleaded with the media and public to help locate her children for nine days. Eventually, Smith admitted she strapped her two sons into car seats and drove onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, where she let the vehicle roll into the water with her sons still in the back seats. 'I didn’t lie to get away with it,' Smith said through tears. 'I really didn’t. I was just scared. I didn’t know how to tell the people who loved them that they’d never see them again. How could I tell David he couldn’t see his sons again?' 'I’m sorry,' she continued. 'I know that’s not enough. I know it’s not. I know they just sound like words, but they come from my heart.

Idaho college killings: Kohberger can face death penalty if convi...	(NewsNation) — Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, can face the death penalty if convicted, a judge has ruled. Kohberger's defense team sought to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment, but Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied its request. The trial for Kohberger is set to begin in August. Susan Smith up for parole 30 years after killing her sons Kohberger, 29, is charged in the deaths of four University of Idaho students who were found stabbed to death in an off-campus house in November of 2022. The deaths of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, shocked the small town of Moscow, Idaho. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths. This journey for justice for Kaylee, Maddie, Xana, and Ethan has been filled with highs and lows. Some days, we are hopeful that justice will be served; other days, we are overwhelmed with hopelessness and sadness. Today is a day for hope! The past two years in front of Judge Judge have been marked by frustration and disappointment—whether it was failing to pronounce the victims' names correctly, laughing in the courtroom, or entertaining every absurd motion or argument the defense could muster. That has been our reality. But now, we feel hopeful once again. We finally have a judge who appears prepared, thoughtful, and well-versed in the legal process. There is a newfound level of seriousness that has been absent for far too long. So, when we learned today that the motions to challenge the death penalty were denied, we were overjoyed—not just for our family, but for our friends, supporters, and everyone who has shed a tear, made a donation, or listened to the story of these beautiful children who were so senselessly taken from us. Justice is moving forward, and we pray that one day, in the not-so-distant future, it will be served. Thank you once again to everyone for your unwavering support and prayers, and a special thank you to the people of Boise, who have welcomed us with open arms.

Trump's border crackdown: Law enforcement preps for changes	NewsNation) — Patrolling more than 1,900 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border falls under federal jurisdiction, but if President-elect Donald Trump bulks up manpower to go after immigrants who entered the country illegally as he has pledged, local law enforcement agencies could also be called into action. Trump has doubled down on plans for the largest domestic deportation in American history, focusing initially on immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. As Trump’s inauguration draws closer, agencies on the front lines of border crimes and the entry of millions of immigrants expect a noticeable shift. Illegal crossings down 70% along US-Mexico border Republican Sheriff Mark Dannels in Arizona’s Cochise County says intensified federal attention to the border crisis will provide relief to his 100 deputized officers who patrol 6,200 square miles of rural desert that runs 83 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border. Cochise deputies have made 4,000 arrests in the past 35 months involving border crimes including human and drug smuggling. Dannels says officers are stressed and have risked serious injury and death in apprehending offenders. The incoming administration has created optimism, the sheriff said. 'You’ve got a president who has already made it very clear …and comes with a report card of border security being a priority – that he’s going to come in and do the federal government’s job. And that is, do what you’re supposed to do,' Dannels told NewsNation. Border sheriffs expect help from Trump administration Cochise County already partners with 100 federal and state agents and officers at a unique operations station to patrol 83 miles of the border. Border crossings aren’t the main issue for Cochise County deputies, as many of the migrants that come through the county head to urban areas. Instead, deputies are tasked with tackling crime at the border, such as drug smuggling. In almost three years, the department has arrested 4,000 people for border-related crimes, Dannels said most of them are Americans working with the cartels. Receiving more White House support will allow deputies to get back to 'doing what they do best,' Dannels said. 'We’ve covered the bill,' Dannels said. 'It’s time for them to reimburse us and cover their own debt and do their job.' Trump’s immigration grand strategy casts wide net Some agencies speculate that removing an estimated 11 million immigrants could cost the federal government nearly $970 billion over 10 years. Texas is prepared to offer up 1,400 acres of land to build a detention facility to aid Trump with his mass deportation efforts, according to a letter obtained by NewsNation. Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham sent the letter to Trump offering the land, which is located in the Rio Grande Valley sector near the U.S. Mexican border. Buckingham told Trump that her office is prepared to cooperate with ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Border Patrol for the facility. Immigrants captured in Terrell County, Texas, are illuminated after being found by local sheriff's deputies.

He told NewsNation he’s ready for backup considering the fact his small department covers 2,300 square miles of territory and 54 miles along the border. Terrell County experienced a 417% jump in border apprehensions in fiscal year 2022, Cleveland said. The department already has existing relationships with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Texas Department of Public Safety. Cleveland knows that under Trump’s leadership, his department will benefit from increased support — even if it is asked to assist federal agents with locating and apprehension of illegal immigrants as is authorized under ICE’s 287 (g) Immigration and Nationality Act. 'We’re not afraid to be in the fight,' Cleveland said. Laredo police dismiss reports Guy Fieri, Sammy Hagar lost 4,000 cases of tequila in heist Joe Frank Martinez was recently elected for his fifth term as sheriff in Val Verde, Texas, which shares 150 border miles with Mexico along the Rio Grande River. His department includes four deputies to police the 3,200 square miles that make up the county. In 2021, roughly 3,000 mostly Haitian immigrants congregated under an international bridge for two weeks, creating an emergency in Del Rio and for Martinez’s small department. Although Val Verde County has seen immigrant encounters diminish since 2023, Martinez acknowledges more needs to be done. That’s especially true in a rural area of Texas where protective structures – like Trump’s unfinished border wall – have fallen into disrepair and include gaps. Martinez, a Democrat, says even though significant border encounters aren’t particularly problematic for his department these days, it doesn’t mean that’s the case everywhere. 'This shouldn’t be a red or blue issue,' Martinez said. 'I think that both sides need to come together and come up with a solution. If (a border wall) is the solution that is going to keep our community safe, I’m for it.' Where state laws prohibit local enforcement of immigration In California, which has been among the states affected most by illegal border crossings, local law enforcement officials are limited in their ability to make arrests of those entering the state. The CBP San Diego sector reported more than 9,500 migrant arrests in a single week in April of this year. It marked the first time since 1999 that the sector tallied the most arrests of any region, the Los Angeles Times reported. That number grew to 14,436 in August, according to CBP data cited by the Washington Office on Latin America. Despite the number of arrests made along the border by federal agents, California state law defines the role of agencies including the San Diego Sheriff’s Department. A department spokesman told NewsNation that local deputies are regularly used to assist immigrants who have already crossed the border and need humanitarian aid. However, the department’s involvement stops there, leaving any immigration enforecement work to the feds. The spokesman said any change in department policy would require a change to state law. Should that happen, the spokesman said the department would review the amendments and its current policies before considering any changes. The spokesman declined to speculate what could happen under Trump. 'We support the efforts of the United States Border Patrol, who have an extremely challenging and dangerous job,' the spokesman said.

Sanctuary cities plan to resist Trump's mass deportation plans	(NewsNation) — Ahead of a Donald Trump presidency, leaders in sanctuary cities insist they will not aid any mass deportation plans after Inauguration Day. In states like Colorado, Illinois and New York, where hundreds of thousands of migrants have been bused from the southern border by GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, officials have doubled down on their promise to protect newcomers. Los Angeles became the latest city to approve sanctuary status after the City Council unanimously approved a measure this week. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The ordinance prohibits the use of city resources for federal immigration enforcement. It could also mean potential legal battles as the Trump administration prepares to use ICE and the military to carry out the campaign promise of mass deportations. An estimated 1.8 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally live in California, more than any other state, with nearly a million in Los Angeles County. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass expedited the sanctuary city ordinance as resistance to Trump's mass deportation plan. In Chicago, where more than 50,000 new arrivals have been sent since 2022, Mayor Brandon Johnson has characterized Trump as a tyrant and says the city’s police force has enough work to do without assisting in apprehending immigrants convicted of serious crimes. 'We’re not going to bend or break or cower to someone’s threat,' Johnson told reporters after the election. 'We’re going to stand up and unite around our shared values, and (residents) have my assurance that I’m going to protect the families of this city.'

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Johnson previously targeted his anger at Abbott, who threatened to keep sending busloads of immigrants to cities like Chicago until the White House committed to securing the southern border. But Trump and Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Trump’s 'border czar,' are promising to withhold federal funding if Democrat-run cities don’t cooperate, leading some leaders in those places to push back even harder. Survey: Nearly half migrants experienced gun violence in home countries 'Our city’s police department is not going to (double) as ICE agents — we’re just not going to do that,' Chicago’s mayor said. 'It’s a dangerous precedent where members of communities begin to feel unsafe with their local police department.' Chicago police declined to make anyone available for an interview with NewsNation. In response to Democratic pushback in cities like Chicago, Homan has issued a warning. 'If you’re not going to help us, get the hell out of the way because we’re going to do it,' Homan told Fox News. The standoff has created some backlash in Chicago, where Johnson’s stand to remain a welcoming city for immigrants isn’t shared by some other city leaders. 'We need those funds like you wouldn’t believe,' Alderman Anthony Napolitano told NewsNation. 'The city is in so much disarray … it’s been catastrophic for the city of Chicago, and if you take away those federal funds, it’s only going to get worse for us here.' The pushback against Operation Aurora In Colorado, which Trump targeted during his presidential campaign over the presence of migrants and alleged migrant gang activity at an Aurora apartment complex, officials are also bracing for what could be coming. Trump told supporters that he would deport violent criminals by sending 'elite squads' of federal agents to 'hunt down, arrest and deport' every single illegal alien. He called the plan 'Operation Aurora,' referencing the Denver suburb. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis told Colorado Public Radio that while he welcomes federal assistance in tracking down and apprehending immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes or belong to gangs, the state’s support for Trump’s plans ended there.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) 'Obviously, it would devastate our economy and our society if someone were to come in and forcibly take our neighbors away from us,' Polis told the station. As far as local police involvement in Trump’s proposed crackdown on immigrant criminals, Aurora’s police department says it will remain focused on dealing with local law enforcement. 'As we always have, we will work with our federal partners and follow federal law and directives as they apply to our community,' an Aurora city spokesman said in a statement provided to NewsNation. Trump’s immigration grand strategy casts wide net Police in Denver, where around 45,000 migrants have been sent by Abbott since 2022, told NewsNation that it does not assist with the enforcement of federal immigration policy as part of city statutes. In addition, a department spokesperson said Denver police do not ask witnesses or victims of crime about immigration status, removing a potential barrier to reporting crimes and holding offenders accountable. Tom Homan targets New York City’s approach New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams has denounced Trump’s mass deportation plans for a city that has spent more than $5 billion in housing costs for the more than 200,000 migrants that have been sent there since 2022. The New York Times reported that Manuel Castro, New York’s commissioner of migrant affairs, has vowed not to follow 'the instructions of the federal government in cases of mass deportations.' Like other sanctuary cities, New York has provisions in place to limit its participation with federal immigration enforcement. That doesn’t prohibit ICE from apprehending immigrants who reside in New York City but who are not U.S. citizens, the report said. While ICE’s 287(g) Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes local police departments to deputize officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement efforts, the New York Police Department does not participate in those efforts, The New York Times reported. Since 2014, the city has declined to honor ICE detention orders that would involve the city’s police department holding immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been charged with crimes in custody until they can be picked up. However, under New York law, criminals who have been convicted of 170 serious offenses — including murder and rape — are not protected. But Homan has pledged to send more federal agents to apprehend convicted immigrants in New York should city officials refuse to cooperate. 'We’re going to do the job,' Homan said in an interview with Fox News. 'We’re going to do the job with you or without you.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/sanctuary-cities-trump-deportation-plans/	2024-11-20T16:33:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/AP23212663498953.jpg?w=900
Musk, Ramaswamy lay out plans for 'mass' federal layoffs, rule ro...	(The Hill) — Tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy said Wednesday that their brand-new government efficiency panel will identify 'thousands' of regulations for President-elect Donald Trump to eliminate, which they argue will justify 'mass head-count reductions' across government. The pair, who were named co-chairs of the panel last week, laid out their plans for the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. What is Elon Musk’s plan for DOGE? 'The two of us will advise DOGE at every step to pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings,' they wrote. 'We will focus particularly on driving change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws.' Musk and Ramaswamy pointed to several recent Supreme Court decisions that have taken aim at the power of the administrative state, arguing that a 'plethora of current federal regulations' exceed agency authority and could be on the chopping block. Slashing regulations should allow for 'at least' proportional cuts to the government workforce, they argue. 'A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy,' the pair wrote in the op-ed. 'Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited,' they added. Musk and Ramaswamy preemptively addressed arguments about civil service protections that could potentially block Trump from firing federal workers. 'The purpose of these protections is to protect employees from political retaliation,' they wrote. 'But the statute allows for ‘reductions in force’ that don’t target specific employees. The statute further empowers the president to ‘prescribe rules governing the competitive service.’ That power is broad.' Elon Musk is hiring for DOGE. Here’s the type of people he wants to recruit 'With this authority, Mr. Trump can implement any number of ‘rules governing the competitive service’ that would curtail administrative overgrowth, from large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area,' they added. Government workers are already mobilizing in the face of potential mass cuts, reportedly hiring lawyers and preparing public campaigns while also hoping Congress will step in, according to Reuters. DOGE also hopes to take aim at 'unauthorized' federal funding, which could impact everything from veterans’ health care and opioid addiction treatment to NASA, The Washington Post reported. The op-ed seemingly seeks to address widespread skepticism about the ability of Musk and Ramaswamy’s panel to enact change. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

However, Musk’s close relationship with the president-elect could be influential. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO played a key role in Trump’s campaign, contributing millions of dollars to his own pro-Trump super PAC and getting out on the campaign trail. Trump said he can’t run in 2028 unless the GOP figures ‘something’ out: Could that happen? Since Trump’s decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month, Musk has remained close at hand; the billionaire tech mogul joined the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago on election night to watch the results roll in and later received a shoutout in Trump’s victory speech. Musk has spent much of his time at the Palm Beach, Fla., resort over the past two weeks, reportedly weighing in on Trump’s Cabinet picks and attending meetings, including those with world leaders. He also hosted Trump in Texas to observe the launch of a SpaceX rocket Tuesday afternoon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-musk-ramaswamy-mass-layoffs/	2024-11-20T15:50:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24291821306487_17af5f-e1732133362308.jpg?w=800
Thanksgiving will cost less this year, here's which items are che...	(NewsNation) — Thanksgiving dinner will cost less this year thanks to lower turkey prices, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual survey released Wednesday. The survey found that a classic feast for 10 will cost $58.08 this year, a 5% decrease from 2023 and down from a record high of $64.05 in 2022. It's the second year in a row that American families can expect to spend less on Thanksgiving dinner, but the cost is still almost 20% higher than before the pandemic in 2019. 'We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America’s families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,' AFBF President Zippy Duvall said in a statement. This year's decline is partially due to lower turkey prices, which have dropped 6% from a year ago despite a bird flu outbreak. 'The American turkey flock is the smallest it’s been since 1985 because of avian influenza, but overall, demand has also fallen, resulting in lower prices at the grocery store for families planning a holiday meal,' AFBF economist Bernt Nelson said in a statement. How will Trump's tariffs impact everyday Americans? How much does Thanksgiving food cost in 2024? Thanksgiving staples, like pumpkin pie mix, vegetables and sweet potatoes, are less expensive than a year ago. The cost of whole milk has dropped more than other items, falling 14% from a year earlier because of favorable weather conditions for dairy farmers, AFBF said. Meanwhile, a pound of frozen peas is down to $1.73, an 8% decline from 2023. But it's not all good news. The survey found some prices, particularly processed food, have gone up. Corporate greed not the main driver of inflation: Fed study Items like dinner rolls and cubed stuffing saw an 8% increase due to higher labor costs. Cranberry prices have also shot up, almost 12% year over year, though that's still in line with historical averages, the AFBF said. There were also regional differences in the cost of a meal. Those celebrating in the West can expect to spend at least 15% more than the rest of the country: $67.81 for a party of 10. Southern dinners will cost the least at $56.81, followed closely by the Northeast at $57.36 and $58.90 in the Midwest, according to the survey. Grocery inflation has slowed down The AFBF's report is a promising sign that Americans are finally seeing some relief at the grocery store. Since Jan. 2021, grocery bills are up more than 22%, according to government inflation data. However, the rise in grocery prices has slowed significantly since the start of 2024, hovering around a 1% annual rate. The American Farm Bureau Federation’s 39th annual Thanksgiving dinner survey comes from Farm Bureau shoppers who checked store prices between Nov. 1 and 7 across all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The AFBF said the shoppers didn't take advantage of special promotions and collected the data before most grocery chains started discounting turkey prices. Here’s how Thanksgiving prices compare to a year ago, according to the AFBF: 16-pound turkey: $25.67 (-6.1%) 14 ounces of cubed stuffing mix: $4.08 (+8.2%) 2 frozen pie crusts: $3.40 (-2.9%) Half pint of whipping cream: $1.81 (+4.7%) 1 pound of frozen peas: $1.73 (-8.1%) 1 dozen dinner rolls: $4.16 (+8.4%) Misc. ingredients to prepare the meal: $3.75 (-5.1%) 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix: $4.15 (-6.5%) 1 gallon of whole milk: $3.21 (-14.3%) 3 pounds of sweet potatoes: $2.93 (-26.2%) 1-pound veggie tray (carrots &amp; celery): $.84 (-6.4%) 12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries: $2.35 (+11.8%)	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/thanksgiving-dinner-costs-this-year/	2024-11-20T13:04:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/meal.jpg?w=900
Speaker Johnson: Capitol bathrooms restricted by 'biological sex'	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled support Tuesday for a Republican effort to ban Democrat Sarah McBride — the first transgender person to be elected to Congress — from using women’s restrooms in the Capitol once she's sworn into office next year. 'All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,' a statement from Johnson said in part. A resolution proposed Monday by GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina would prohibit any lawmakers and House employees from 'using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.' Mace said the bill is aimed specifically at McBride, who was elected to the House this month from Delaware. Nancy Mace: Capitol transgender bathroom rules protect women 'It’s the height of hypocrisy and gaslighting to tell women, you lose your rights, and then a man walks in the room. I don’t think so,' Mace said Tuesday on NewsNation’s 'On Balance.' 'I’m very socially sensible, but this is about women’s safety. It’s about women’s security, it’s about women’s privacy, and we have rights.' The debate over whether transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms that align with their gender identity has been prevalent across the U.S. and was a focal point of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from girls and women’s bathrooms at public schools and in some cases other government facilities. McBride was elected to the House this month after building a national profile as an LGBTQ+ activist and raising more than $3 million in campaign contributions from around the country. She became the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention in the United States in 2016 when she spoke at the Democratic National Convention. 'We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care and child care, not manufacturing culture wars,' McBride said. 'Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible, and that’s what I’m focused on.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mike-johnson-capitol-bathrooms-restricted-biological-sex/	2024-11-20T11:54:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2184995458.jpg?w=900
Gaetz meets with GOP senators as Dems ask FBI for more info	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, has launched an effort to secure his embattled nomination, meeting behind closed doors Wednesday with GOP senators who have questions about sexual misconduct and other allegations against him. Gaetz’s move came as Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray asking for 'the complete evidentiary file' from the agency’s investigation into allegations of sex trafficking of minors against Gaetz. The Democratic senators, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, say the allegations against Gaetz are 'significant' in light of his associate, Joe Greenberg, having pleaded guilty to the sex trafficking charge for which the Florida Republican was also investigated. Republicans on Ethics Committee weigh ‘unenviable’ Gaetz report decision 'In order for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty in this instance, we must be able to thoroughly review all relevant materials that speak to the credibility of these serious allegations against Mr. Gaetz,' the senators wrote in their Wednesday letter to Wray. The senators wrote that 'the grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government.' The letter was signed by Durbin and Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Conn.; Sheldon Whitehouse, R.I.; Amy Klobuchar, Minn.; Mazie Hirono, Hawaii; Laphonza Butler, Calif.; Chris Coons, Del.; Peter Welch, Vt.; Cory Booker, N.J.; and Alex Padilla, Calif. As Gaetz and senators holed up near the Senate, members of the House Ethics Committee were expected to be meeting to discuss the findings of a long-running investigation of their former colleague. Attorneys involved in a civil case brought by a Gaetz associate were notified this week that an unauthorized person accessed a file shared between lawyers that included unredacted depositions from a woman who said Gaetz had sex with her when she was 17 and a second woman who says she saw the encounter, according to attorney Joel Leppard. Trump interviewing candidates for FBI chief, Vance says in later-deleted social media post While House Speaker Mike Johnson has said the Ethics Committee should not release the report — since Gaetz swiftly resigned his congressional seat — several GOP senators have indicated they want all information before having to make a decision on how they would vote. Sen. Tommy Tuberville told NewsNation he’s waiting for more facts to come out. 'I'm fully supportive of (Gaetz). I just say, make sure you're transparent,' Tuberville said. 'We don't need things popping up. I'm not into rumors, because I know how this place is, they will ruin you in a heartbeat with rumors. But I'm all in with facts. And if it's all factual in terms of something that could be construed as criminal, then of course, I won't vote for it, but and (Gaetz) knows that.' As soon as the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3, when Republicans take majority control, senators are expected to begin holding hearings on Trump's nominees, with voting possible on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.

Susan Smith denied parole after serving 30 years for sons' murder...	Editor's note: This article mentions suicide and domestic violence. People seeking help or experiencing a crisis can dial 988 to reach the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline or 1-800-799-7233 to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline. (NewsNation) — A South Carolina parole board denied Susan Smith’s release Wednesday, nearly 30 years after she received a life sentence for murdering her 3-year-old and infant sons. Smith’s voice shook as she spoke to board members over a video call and expressed remorse for the boys’ deaths. She told the parole board that she’s a Christian and asked them to show her 'that same kind of mercy, as well.' 'I know that what I did was horrible,' she said, wiping her eyes. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it. I love Michael and Alex with all my heart.' Toys &amp; pics of Michael &amp; Alex Smith at John D.

Campbell/Getty Images) Smith was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for the deaths of her 3-year-old son Michael and 14-month-old Alex. She initially told police a carjacker took off with her children still inside the vehicle. The case drew international attention as Smith pleaded with the media and public to help locate her children for nine days. Eventually, Smith admitted she strapped her two sons into car seats and drove onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, where she let the vehicle roll into the water with her sons still in the back seats. 'I didn’t lie to get away with it,' Smith said through tears. 'I really didn’t. I was just scared. I didn’t know how to tell the people who loved them that they’d never see them again.

Hannah Kobayashi: Family searches for woman who went missing in L...	(NewsNation) — Family members of Maui woman Hannah Kobayashi are in Los Angeles to search for her after the 31-year-old went missing on a trip to California earlier this month. According to the Los Angeles Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, Kobayashi is 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and weighs about 140 pounds. She has brown hair and eyes, and fair skin with freckles, as well as a tattoo that says 'knife' on her forearm. Kobayashi's family last heard from her on Nov. 11, when she started sending them 'alarming' text messages, NewsNation local affiliate KTLA reported. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator What is known about Hannah Kobayashi's disappearance KTLA wrote that Kobayashi, on Nov. 8, missed a connecting flight from Los Angeles to New York City, where she was planning to visit family. The day after, Kobayashi decided to go to The Grove shopping center for a two-day Lebron James event, which she posted about on Instagram. While she was at The Grove on Nov. 9, Kobayashi was seen by employees at the Taschen bookstore, Larie Pidgeon, Kobayashi's aunt, told USA Today. New video, texts shows Laken Riley’s last moments On Nov. 11, according to the Los Angeles Times, Kobayashi went back to Los Angeles International Airport, though without getting onboard a flight. Family members confirmed to KTLA that they also saw footage of Kobayashi near the Pico Metro Station in downtown Los Angeles. 'I miss her,' Kobayashi's father Ryan said in an interview with KTLA. 'Just want her to know that, and just want her to reach out — anything.' Kobayashi sent 'strange' text messages, family says Pidgeon said it was when Kobayashi went back to the airport that she started sending the family 'alarming' text messages. 'She mentioned feeling scared, and that someone might be trying to steal her money and identity,' her aunt said to KTLA. 'Strange, cryptic messages — things about the matrix, it was so unlike her. And then all of a sudden, no more communication.' Kobayashi's sister started a GoFundMe to assist with search efforts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/hannah-kobayashi-maui-woman-missing-los-angeles/	2024-11-20T07:00:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/HannahKobayashi.jpg?w=229
Republicans on Ethics Committee weigh 'unenviable' Gaetz report d...	Republicans on the House Ethics Committee are barreling into a no-win situation ahead of their expected meeting Wednesday to discuss their report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), weighing a high-stakes decision that will reverberate throughout Washington. The gathering for the panel — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — comes as the debate over releasing their report into Gaetz, President-elect Trump’s pick for attorney general, has reached a fever pitch. One one side, Democrats on the committee — and several Republicans in Congress — say the report contains information that the public and senators should know as they consider whether to make Gaetz the head of an agency that once investigated him. On the other end is Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who is arguing that releasing the report — which is the culmination of a roughly three-year investigation — could damage the House since the panel would be in the rare, but not unprecedented, situation of publishing information on a former member. Caught in the center of that conversation are the Republicans on the panel, led by committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.), who have not yet disclosed where they stand despite incessant questions from reporters. Guest has only confirmed that the report exists and that all members of the committee have access to it. 'There’s not enough money in the world to pay me to serve on the Ethics Committee right now,' one House Republican said. 'Those members are definitely in an unenviable position.' With all Democrats expected to support releasing the report, just one Republican would be needed to achieve a majority vote and unleash the body of work. The committee is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, a structure intended to ensure that the panel — which polices its own members — does not act as a partisan weapon. Members of the panel have not confirmed that they will vote on the report's release Wednesday, but Democrats on the committee say they want to hold that referendum when they gather as a full group for the first time since Gaetz’s nomination and resignation. Members of each party have huddled separately since last week’s developments. Such a vote, however, would force the GOP lawmakers into a tough position: vote to release the report and risk being the target of Trump’s wrath, or side with Gaetz — whom many Republicans loathe — and keep the allegedly damaging information private as the former congressman moves forward in the confirmation process to become attorney general. Other Republicans are aware of those circumstances — and relieved they are not in the same position. A second House Republican said they do not envy the situation Republicans on the panel are in. 'I also wouldn’t want to be in a train wreck even if I survived,' they added. A third House Republican, however, said the predicament is not very complicated. They predicted that there is a good chance enough GOP members on the committee vote to release the report because several of the members clearly dislike Gaetz and will not be deterred by potential backlash. 'I don't think it's going to cause them a lot of heartache,' the member said, adding that the more moderate GOP members of the panel are used to taking tough votes, and can 'take that vote all day and still get reelected and walk around here.' Wednesday’s meeting comes as pressure is mounting on both sides of the disclosure debate. Rep. Susan Wild (Pa.), the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, told reporters Monday that she had read the report and that she thinks it should be released. On Tuesday, 97 Democrats penned a letter to the panel asking that it 'immediately release' the report out of concern that concealing the information could 'jeopardize' the Senate’s confirmation process. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) responded with a succinct 'yes' when asked if the panel should release its report publicly. A number of Republicans have echoed the desire to release the report, at least to the senators considering his confirmation. 'I think we need to see it for confirmation purposes,' Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who has harshly criticized Gaetz in the past, told reporters Tuesday. Mullin is close with former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was ousted in a coup led by Gaetz. Mullin said he has talked to McCarthy multiple times over the last week but declined to share the former Speaker’s thoughts on Gaetz. Johnson, meanwhile, has consistently — and strongly — reiterated the Gaetz Ethics report should not see the light of day because the Florida Republican does not currently serve in the House. 'Matt Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress, and so we don’t issue Ethics reports on nonmembers,' Johnson reiterated on Tuesday. 'I think it’s an important guardrail for us to maintain for the interest of the institution.' Johnson said that he has spoken to Gaetz since his resignation but they have not discussed the reporting, contending that it would not be 'appropriate' to talk about the matter with him. 'This is my own opinion and I expressed the opinion before I talked with Matt,' Johnson said. The conversation surrounding Gaetz’s Ethics report broke out last week, after Trump shocked Washington and selected the Florida Republican to be attorney general. Gaetz resigned from Congress shortly after the pick. Johnson, who broke the news of Gaetz’s departure, told reporters that he was leaving early to quicken the process for filling his seat in the lower chamber. The development, however, came days before the House Ethics Committee was scheduled to vote on releasing the Gaetz report, raising questions about the true motive behind his resignation. The Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating similar matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said last week, adding that 'most people' in the House GOP conference believe he departed to try to stop the report from coming out. Gaetz’s departure has muddied the path forward for the Ethics Committee, throwing the panel into a crisis as it debates the precedent that releasing the report may set. The Speaker has argued that such a move would break a long-standing 'rule' of the panel not publishing information on former members of Congress, even though there are previous examples of the current situation. In 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. And in 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee released its preliminary report into former Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) after he departed the chamber. Johnson, however, rejected past circumstances, arguing that they were aberrations of the norm. 'It’s a very important rule that should be maintained,' Johnson said last week. 'If it's been broken once or twice it should not have been because that would be a Pandora’s box. I think it’s a very important position to maintain regardless of what the circumstances [are].'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-on-ethics-committee-weigh-unenviable-gaetz-report-decision/	2024-11-20T04:48:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn03_w.jpg?w=900
Jose Ibarra trial Day 4: Defense expected to call final witnesses	(NewsNation) — Defense attorneys will call their last witnesses on the fourth day of the trial for Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley earlier this year. Jose Ibarra, 26, will not be one of these witnesses. After being read his rights in both English and Spanish, Jose Ibarra chose not to testify on his own behalf. Diego Ibarra, Jose's brother, was called to the witness stand on Tuesday, but was rushed off after the court learned his lawyer did not want him to speak because of the fake green card case against him. It is possible Diego Ibarra will be called back to the stand Wednesday. Diddy hit with 5 new lawsuits, including alleged teen sexual assault On Feb. 22, Riley was reported missing when she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus in Athens. UGA police arrested Jose Ibarra the next day. Before prosecutors wrapped up their case, attorneys revealed brand new video from the last time 22-year-old Riley was seen alive, showing her running on a trail on the University of Georgia's campus just minutes before she dialed 911. Another video, which the prosecution said showed Jose Ibarra on the morning Riley died, allegedly showed Ibarra lurking around the trail and trying to break into a young woman's apartment. Approximately one hour after this video was taken, prosecutors said, Jose Ibarra and Riley's cell phones pinged at identical locations near the scene of the crime. A minute-by-minute timeline of Riley's final moments was revealed through calls and texts from her phone. At 8:55 a.m. that morning, Riley texted her mother, 'Good morning, about to go for a run if you're free to talk.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security Then, at 9:03 a.m., Riley called her mom, who did not pick up. Riley's moms soon followed up with a number of calls and texts that her daughter did not answer. 'Please call me, I’m worried sick about you,' one of those texts by Riley's mother said. To close their case, the state asked a DNA specialist what she discovered when examining Laken Riley's fingernails. The DNA specialist said fingernail samples matched a profile of Jose Ibarra's blood found on a jacket found in a dumpster. The defense is questioning the prosecution's timeline by calling other witnesses — like a runner who says he saw someone like Jose Ibarra on the trail — although his timeline does not match up identically to the one that's been presented by prosecutors. Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan national who Customs and Border Patrol sources tell NewsNation has ties to the Tren De Aragua gang, would spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence charges.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-day-4/	2024-11-20T04:25:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24323563549427.jpg?w=900
Nancy Mace: Capitol transgender bathroom rules protect women	(NewsNation) — Republican Rep. Nancy Mace said she's going to 'fight like hell' for a resolution that would keep Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom. 'It's the height of hypocrisy and gaslighting to tell women, you lose your rights, and then a man walks in the room. I don't think so,' Mace said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'I'm very socially sensible, but this is about women's safety. It's about women's security, it's about women's privacy, and we have rights.' On Monday, Mace introduced a resolution requiring all individuals in the Capitol complex to use bathrooms matching their sex assigned at birth, a move that has sparked controversy as McBride, the first openly transgender House member, prepares to take office. The measure charges the House sergeant-at-arms, William McFarland, with enforcing the ban, according to text previewed by The Hill, but it is unclear how the House’s chief law enforcement officer will determine who can and cannot use the Capitol’s facilities. House Republicans signal support for proposal to ban bathroom access for 1st transgender member State laws that bar transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity often rely on anonymous complaints, a notoriously unreliable enforcement mechanism. LGBTQ+ rights activists in May flooded a tip line designed to alert officials in Utah to possible violations of the state’s bathroom ban with thousands of false complaints. Trump picks Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary Mace is pushing for the measure to be included in the rules package for the 119th Congress or for it to be brought to the floor and voted on as a standalone rule outside the package. If the bill, however, is not included in the 119th Congress rules package or brought to the floor as a standalone rule, Mace would force a vote on the legislation, the source said. The House is set to vote on a rules package for the next Congress in early January, which will require a majority vote for passage. Republicans are poised to have a razor-thin majority when the next session gavels in. McBride, who is set to assume her new position early next year, said on X that Mace’s resolution is 'a blatant attempt' to 'distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.' This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars. Delawareans…&mdash; Sarah McBride (@SarahEMcBride) November 19, 2024 'We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care and child care, not manufacturing culture wars,' McBride said. 'Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible, and that’s what I’m focused on.'

Diddy hit with 5 new lawsuits, including alleged teen sexual assa...	(NewsNation) — Five new lawsuits accusing Sean 'Diddy' Combs of sexual abuse were filed Tuesday by Texas lawyer Tony Buzbee, according to court documents obtained by NewsNation. One woman alleges that at 18 years old, she was drugged and coerced into performing oral sex on Combs and his bodyguard outside a Halloween party at a New York City nightclub in 2001. Another woman says that at 17 years old, she attended a Fourth of July party in 2004 where Combs sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious, according to the lawsuit. Combs and two of his bodyguards approached the victim after the assault and threatened her, telling her that she 'would be in danger if she spoke about what had occurred,' stating that he 'ran New York and would ruin her,' the lawsuit alleges. 'The Buzbee Law Firm, along with co-counsel AVA Law Group and New York local counsel Curis Law, is filing five more cases today alleging aggravated sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation against Sean 'Diddy' Combs and those entities with whom he has been affiliated,' Buzbee shared on Instagram. Diddy court witness says he saw 8 sex tapes with at least 2 celeb minors Buzbee added that 'several other individuals are referenced in the case filings but are not at this time formerly named as defendants. The cases are being brought for conduct that occurred as far back as the year 2001.' Buzbee said the conduct allegedly took place in New York and Miami, adding that three of the victims are male and two are female. 'We will let the allegations in the filed complaints speak for themselves, and will work to see that justice is done,' Buzbee said. 'We expect to be filing cases weekly naming Mr. Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings.' In October, Buzbee, a lawyer from Houston, announced he was representing 120 people who plan on filing lawsuits saying they have experienced sexual misconduct from Combs, including 25 minors. Buzbee said the alleged victims are 60 men and 60 women, of whom 25 were minors at the time of the alleged misconduct. The youngest, Buzbee said, was 9. 'I imagine there’s a myriad of people who are nervous,' Buzbee said. 'You can’t hide skeletons in the closet forever.' Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 'led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes. ' Combs is currently seeking to be placed on house arrest through a $50 million bail package. Last week, prosecutors said Combs has been trying to dodge scrutiny of his jailhouse communications while orchestrating social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials he views are helpful to his case. They said he also has contacted witnesses through third parties.

Texas offers Trump 1,400 borderland acres for deportation plans	(NewsNation) — Texas officials have offered to lease more than 1,400 acres of state-owned borderland to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration to construct deportation facilities, according to a letter from the Texas General Land Office (GLO) obtained Tuesday. Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham in a letter to Trump said, ' I am writing to formally offer 1,402 acres of land in Starr County, Texas, to be used to construct deportation facilities.' The property, located approximately 35 miles west of McAllen in Starr County, was recently acquired by the GLO. The letter reveals that within 24 hours of the Oct. 23 purchase, Buckingham approved a 7,681-foot border wall easement across the property. National Guard training for mass illegal crossings at border The letter details GLO's recent border security initiatives, including 'Operation Flat Top,' which secured a 170-acre island in the Rio Grande previously described by state authorities as 'the most dangerous part of the Texas border.' Buckingham stated the land could be used for 'processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history' in cooperation with federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol. The Texas GLO, which oversees 13 million acres of state lands, confirmed the offer through a spokesperson. This comes as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott plans to expand buoy barriers across the Rio Grande to stop migrants from crossing the southern border despite border crossings dropping in the state. Senate report claims Biden failures in protecting migrant children Abbott has maintained that Texas will have a proactive versus reactive stance at the border and will be prepared should a surge happen ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Border officials are now training for an expected surge in migrant crossings before President-elect Donald Trump takes the White House. The Texas National Guard is holding exercises in conjunction with the Texas Department of Public Safety along the Southern border in Eagle Pass on Tuesday. These proactive measures began last week with groups split to cover more ground across the vast Southern border.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-trump-land-deportation/	2024-11-19T17:26:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ecf60a2ec438.97773877.jpeg?w=900
Trump expected to name Linda McMahon as education secretary: Repo...	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Linda McMahon as education secretary, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing four sources familiar with the matter, putting the former pro-wrestling mogul at the helm of a department Trump has proposed abolishing. McMahon, who had been in the running for commerce secretary, headed up the Small Business Administration in Trump's first administration and was a major donor and early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The co-founder and former CEO of the WWE professional wrestling franchise, she resigned from the SBA in 2019 to lead the pro-Trump spending group America First Action. She also chairs the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-friendly think tank. Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election. McMahon had been in the mix to head the Commerce Department, but Trump on Tuesday instead chose her transition team co-leader - Cantor Fitzgerald Chief Executive Howard Lutnick - for that post. Now she will lead an agency Trump said on the campaign trail that he would abolish, although he likely lacks authority to do it without congressional approval.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/linda-mcmahon-education-secretary/	2024-11-19T16:19:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2161971102.jpg?w=900
Floridians face slow recovery after back-to-back hurricanes	(NewsNation) — In Treasure Island, Florida, just west of Tampa, residents are still struggling to recover after being hit by back-to-back hurricanes. Areas off the Gulf of Mexico were hit first by Hurricane Helene, then, a few weeks later, by Hurricane Milton. Now, communities are struggling, with locals packed into hotel rooms that are usually filled with snowbirds this time of year. Floridians are frustrated with how slow the process has been. The two storms came 13 days apart, and almost two months after Hurricane Helene, damage is still visible. How to help Helene and Milton survivors In one apartment complex, sand is still pushed up in banks against the wall, and a couch that came through one of the windows thanks to a powerful storm surge is still visible. About 2,000 homes and businesses on Treasure Island alone were impacted by the storms. One resident told NewsNation she was frustrated by the struggle to get permits for repairs. She and her mother own a number of apartment complexes and have had annual renters back out and vacation bookings canceled all the way through January. The city of Treasure Island has had more than 700 requests for permits since the storms when it usually manages around 1,600 a year. For officials at all levels, local, state and federal, it's been difficult to keep up with demand, and they are asking people to be patient. 'We've never had to really do it on this large of a scale, and so the city is figuring out, the states' figuring it out,' said city spokesperson Jason Biesel. 'People are realizing what it means to live on a barrier island to have to go through all this rebuilding process, and so it's just been a learning experience for everybody.' Biesel said that it was terrible to see the damage to homes and businesses but asked for people to be patient. At another hotel, the general manager told NewsNation that 100% of the occupancy in the 96-room hotel is due to people who have been displaced in the community. Live: Congress questions FEMA about hurricane relief The Federal Emergency Management Agency is actually picking up the tab for those people through January if needed. The city has given a rough timeline of summer of 2025 for full recovery in a community that relies heavily on tourism, with an $11 billion dollar impact in Pinellas County alone. Anywhere from 11 to 15 million people come through, and this is usually the time of year when many people winter in the area. However, with bars, restaurants and hotels too damaged to operate or occupied by those who have been displaced, there are fewer options for snowbirds who would usually come to the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-slow-recovery-hurricanes/	2024-11-19T14:14:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176610127.jpg?w=900
Susan Smith up for parole 30 years after killing her sons	(NewsNation) — Thirty years after she killed her two children, Susan Smith is now eligible for parole, raising the question of whether she will get out of prison. Susan Smith initially told law enforcement that a man carjacked her and took off with her two children still inside the car in 1994. Smith, who is white, identified the carjacker as Black when she described the alleged late-night carjacking near Union, South Carolina. RFK Jr.’s support of raw milk sheds light on debate Smith pleaded with the media and public for help locating three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex, attracting international attention to the case. For nine days, she appeared on TV begging for help. But elements of her story didn't add up, including her description of the carjacking and why the carjacker would release her but keep her young children. Eventually, Smith admitted to strapping her two sons into car seats in the back of her car and driving it onto a boat ramp at a South Carolina lake, letting the vehicle roll into the water with her children inside, Smith said she was having an affair and the man that she was cheating with didn't want kids. Now, 30 years later, Smith is eligible for parole. That angers investigators like Union County Sheriff Jeff Bailey, who says Smith deserves to spend every day of her life behind bars, even if she's already been locked up for 30 years. 'Those kids didn't have a chance and I don't think she deserves one,' Bailey said. 'She still killed her kids, that is the bottom line That is [her] blood, [she] chose to let them go into the water and drown. That is a horrible death.' Smith's parole hearing is set for Wednesday morning, where she will make her case for release. Las Vegas home invasion suspect wanted police to kill her: Docs During the trial, Smith's lawyers said she was experiencing a mental breakdown and had intended to stay in the car with her sons but had exited at the last minute. Smith has also made claims that her then-husband abused her, something he has denied. During her time in prison, Smith has faced trouble multiple times, for everything from using drugs to having sex with prison guards.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/susan-smith-up-parole-30-years/	2024-11-19T13:04:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/05/gettyimages-525637762-594x594-2.jpg?w=594
40 inmates are on federal death row. Advocates want Biden to spar...	(NewsNation) — Hundreds of anti-capital punishment groups are calling on President Joe Biden to commute federal death row sentences during his remaining months in office fearing a renewed 'execution spree' under President-elect Donald Trump. 'Suddenly the whole world has changed and if Joe Biden doesn't commute these sentences, then Donald Trump is going to kill them,' Abraham Bonowitz, the executive director of anti-capital punishment group Death Penalty Action, said. The group has spearheaded a coalition of more than 350 groups that sent Biden a letter 24 hours after the election saying they have 'renewed concern and urgency' with Trump coming into office in less than two months. Which of Biden’s executive orders does Trump plan to undo? They ask Biden to commute death sentences to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 'We can't trust the government with the power to do this and to get it right, and not just in making sure that it's the right person who committed the crime, but also to be fair in the application of the death penalty,' Bonowitz said. There are currently 40 inmates on federal death row and the group includes Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Tree of Life mass shooter Robert Bowers and Dylan Roof, who murdered nine members of a Black South Carolina congregation in a racially motivated attack. Prior to the election, Trump signaled that his new administration would not shy away from the death penalty. 'We’ve never had (such) massive amounts of drugs pouring into our country,' he said during a campaign event in Arizona. 'And by the way, you’ll never solve the problem without the death penalty.' The Biden administration did not return requests for comment from NewsNation. Trump’s record on executions During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death, with the last execution taking place days before Biden took office. The number far surpasses executions under any president for more than a century. Prior to July 2020, the federal government hadn’t executed anyone in 17 years. In the case of Brandon Bernard — who was convicted of killing an Iowa couple and executed in December 2020 — Trump himself agreed that there might be valid reasons not to proceed, reported the AP. Former President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Trump’s administration also approved the use of pentobarbital in lethal injections despite evidence it might cause pulmonary edema, a painful condition akin to drowning. Fourteen states have also used pentobarbital in executions and five more are considering using it, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Trump will use ‘military assets’ to remove illegal migrants An autopsy report obtained by the AP for Corey Johnson, convicted of seven drug-related killings in 2021, concluded that during his execution he suffered pulmonary edema. The report showed that so much fluid rushed up his trachea that some exited his mouth. In his second term, Trump indicated he would expand the death penalty for migrants accused of killing U.S. citizens and law enforcement officers, as well as people convicted of drug and human trafficking. 'These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,' Trump said, referring to drug traffickers during an event kicking off his campaign. The Trump campaign did not return requests for comment by NewsNation. Is the death penalty right or wrong? Rev. Sharon Risher’s mother, two cousins and a childhood friend were killed in the Charleston Mother Emanuel Church shooting in 2015 by Roof, who sits on death row. She was the first to sign the letter asking Biden for the commutations. 'Killing Roof is not going to bring my family back. It's not going to erase all the grief and heartache that I have had, and all it's going to do is compound that feeling of wanting somebody to die,' Risher said. Risher has requested a meeting with Biden on behalf of the groups pushing for commutation. She believes the only way of forgetting Roof is to lock him up without any possibility of parole.

(Grace Beahm/The Post And Courier via AP, Pool, File) 'There will be no appeals, no more hearing from him again, he will be lost in obscurity when it comes to me and that's the best I can hope for, without wanting him to be killed or anybody to be killed,' she said. Trump has promised ‘concealed carry reciprocity.’ What would it do? While Risher is working with the groups pushing to commute death penalty sentences, other victims' family members argue the penalty serves justice. Michele Rosenthal, who lost her brothers in the 2018 Tree of Life massacre that left 11 dead, said she supported the Justice Department's decision to pursue the death penalty in a 2023 interview with Union Progress. 'This massacre was not just a mass murder of innocent citizens during a service in a house of worship,' she said. 'The death penalty must apply to vindicate justice and to offer some measure of deterrence from horrific hate crimes happening again and again.' Seven of the nine families who lost loved ones in the massacre sent a letter in July 2021 to Attorney General Merrick Garland reflecting their support of the death penalty. Can Biden commute all federal death sentences? Biden has the power to commute all the sentences under blanket clemency until his last day in office, said Corinna Barrett Lain, a law professor at the University of Richmond who’s written a forthcoming book on lethal injection. If he doesn’t, Trump 'can move very, very quickly' on executions if that is his priority, she said. There is still a legal process that needs to be followed prior to an execution which includes obtaining a death warrant and that will face expected legal challenges, but it’s not likely those challenges 'would get their due regard' as evidenced during the last Trump administration, she said.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) The Supreme Court cleared all legal obstacles during Trump’s first term to greenlight executions, even in a case where the appellate court still hadn’t issued a ruling, deemed 'highly unusual' by SCOTUSblog. Across 13 executions the Supreme Court vacated 22 states of executions and injunctions, Lain said. 'The stays of execution were reversed without opinion, without resolution of the constitutional claims on the merits, without explanation, and the prisoners were promptly executed,' she said. While campaigning in 2020, Biden promised to abolish the federal death penalty but has done little to fulfill that pledge after stepping into office. His Justice Department announced a moratorium on federal executions in 2021, which halted executions but the department has since pushed for the death penalty against the suspects charged with mass shootings in Pittsburgh and Buffalo.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/death-row-inmates-trump-biden/	2024-11-19T11:16:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/01/AP22011097759203.jpg?w=900
Trump's hush money case should be paused, prosecutors say	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The case in which Donald Trump was convicted on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star should be paused in light of his election victory to allow Trump to seek dismissal, New York prosecutors said on Tuesday. Trump, 78, is hoping to enter office for a second term unencumbered by any of the four criminal cases he has faced and which some said would derail his 2024 candidacy to return to the White House. Manhattan DA opposes Trump’s bid to dismiss hush money conviction Trump was convicted in May of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, who denies it. The case marked the first time a U.S. president - former or sitting - had been convicted of or charged with a criminal offense. Trump had been scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, but Merchan last week put all proceedings in the case on pause at the request of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. The prosecutors had asked for more time to consider next steps in the case, citing the need to balance the 'competing interests' between having the criminal case go forward and protecting the office of the president. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case, which he has long portrayed as a politically motivated attempt by Bragg, a Democrat, to interfere with his campaign. His defense lawyers urged Merchan to dismiss the case, arguing that having it loom over him while he was president would cause 'unconstitutional impediments' to his ability to govern. Trump's lawyers also argued his conviction should be vacated and the charges dismissed because of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July that presidents cannot be prosecuted over their official acts, and that evidence of their official acts cannot be used in trials over personal behavior. Georgia appeals court cancels arguments in Trump’s bid to disqualify Fani Willis Bragg's office said that its case dealt with purely personal conduct. Falsification of business records is punishable by up to four years in prison. Before he was elected, experts said it was unlikely - but not impossible - that Trump would face time behind bars, with punishments such as a fine or probation seen as more likely. Trump's victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election made the prospect of imposing a sentence of jail or probation even more politically fraught and impractical, given that a sentence could have impeded his ability to conduct the duties of the presidency. Trump was indicted on three separate slates of state and federal charges in 2023, one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. A Florida-based federal judge in July dismissed the documents case. The Justice Department is now evaluating how to wind down the federal election-related case. Trump also faces state criminal charges in Georgia over his bid to reverse his 2020 loss in that state, but the case remains in limbo.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/trump-hush-money-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels/	2024-11-19T10:03:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/Trump-Stormy_AP_Mary-Altaffer-Steven-Hirsch.png?w=900
Hacker gains access to testimony in Gaetz investigations: reports	A hacker gained access to witness testimony related to investigations into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who resigned from Congress last week after President-elect Trump tapped him for attorney general, multiple news outlets reported Tuesday. The unidentified person, using the name 'Altam Beezley,' downloaded the information on Monday afternoon, according to The New York Times, which was the first to report on the breach. The file contained 24 exhibits and is said to include testimony from a woman who said she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17, and testimony from another woman who said she witnessed the encounter, according to The Times. The Times and CBS News reported that the file is part of a civil defamation case. The Times also reported it includes sealed files from the Justice Department and House Ethics Committee. The materials do not appear to have been made public. Interest in the files may be at an all-time high, given Gaetz's looming confirmation process. The Ethics Committee has been investigating Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating the same matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. The Florida Republican resigned from Congress as the release of the Ethics Committee’s report was imminent, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill last week. While the panel doesn't generally release information about former lawmakers, the committee is facing mounting pressure to make its findings public. Senators on both sides of the aisle have said they would like to see the report as they mull whether to confirm Gaetz as the nation's top prosecutor, and on Monday Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee, said she thinks the report should be released.

RFK Jr.'s support of raw milk sheds light on debate	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, has long been a proponent of natural food choices. One includes raw milk, which has become mainstream in the health and wellness communities recently. Kennedy has admitted when he drinks milk it is solely the unpasteurized variety. Last month, he proclaimed on X the 'FDA's war on public health' would come to an end, including 'aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.' ‘I’m being framed’: Fired FEMA worker Marn’i Washington speaks out The FDA wrote about 'the dangers of raw milk' in May, suggesting it 'can harbor dangerous germs that can pose serious health risks to you and your family.' An April article from the CDC says pasteurization is 'crucial for milk safety, killing harmful germs that can cause illness.' The CDC adds raw milk 'can carry dangerous germs such as Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and others that cause foodborne illness, often called 'food poisoning.' It adds that 2,645 illnesses and 228 hospitalizations occurred between 1998 and 2018 from drinking raw milk. Some champion positive health returns from drinking unpasteurized milk, including raw milk farmer Cliff McConville. 'I can tell you that I used to get sick like three times a year, like, you know, with colds or flu, and I almost never get sick anymore,' McConville said. Farmers and raw milk advocates argue that the dairy industry is against raw milk because it's bad for their bottom line. Conversely, health advocates argue that we have the tools to make milk safer now, and ignoring that is a step backward.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/rfk-support-raw-milk-debate/	2024-11-19T09:51:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2174504226.jpg?w=900
Should women serve in combat roles?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, sparking controversy over Hegseth's experience and his comments about women in combat. The Defense Secretary nominee has said he doesn't believe women should serve on the front lines in combat roles, raising the possibility he could try to roll back policies that allow women in those jobs. Former U.S. Army Sgt. Kayla Williams served on the front lines in Iraq as a linguist. She told NewsNation that at the time, women were limited in terms of combat roles, which made her work more challenging. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'We know that what really didn't work was to not have women directly assigned to these units, to have women like me just be attached so we hadn't trained as we fought,' she said. 'I didn't know their standard operating procedures. Those programs that had to be stood up like the cultural support teams to fill that gap were just inadequate.' Williams said it is essential that women be able to join the military in all aspects, especially when the service is facing a recruiting shortage. Former U.S. Army Maj. Chase Spears disagrees, saying that while women have proven they can meet the physical standards required for combat roles, they are built differently and still shouldn't be eligible to fill those positions. 'The question is, can women endure the standard day after day, week after week, month after month,' Spears said. Fear of mass deportations spreads in immigrant communities Spears claimed women do poorly in combat roles and said inclusion hasn't made the military more lethal. Williams noted that while women may not always be as strong as men, they bring different skills to the table that can also be critical, like agility. 'We know from examples like the woman recently completing the Appalachian Trail many, many hours faster than anyone else ever has, that women have real advantages when it comes to endurance,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/women-combat-roles/	2024-11-19T08:51:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e3ab600fe155.65196006.jpeg?w=900
Okla. Superintendent: I have 'freedom to express' religious belie...	(NewsNation) — Oklahoma Superintendent Ryan Walters defended a controversial video he required public school superintendents to play for students where he prays over Republican President-elect Donald Trump, saying Tuesday that he has 'religious beliefs as well that I get the freedom to express.' In a video to announce the creation of the Education Department's Office of Religious Freedom and Patriotism, Walters said he prays 'for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country.' According to a press release, the new office is meant to 'oversee the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism.' ‘I’m being framed’: Fired FEMA worker Marn’i Washington speaks out Speaking on 'Morning in America,' Walters said he made it 'crystal clear' in the video that students don't have to pray if they don't want to. 'We all have the free exercise of our religious beliefs that was essential in the foundation of this country,' Walters said. 'We're going to protect that.' The office of state Attorney General Gentner Drummond issued a statement Friday saying Walters isn't able to issue a mandate that schools watch the video. 'Not only is this edict unenforceable, it is contrary to parents’ rights, local control and individual free-exercise rights,' the statement said. Some school districts, including two of the state's largest, said they do not plan to show the video to students. Walters already faces two lawsuits over his June mandate that schools incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for students in grades 5 through 12. 'Look, every county here voted for President Trump. We want to have prayer back in school,' Walters said. 'President Trump won an overwhelming election speaking unapologetically about getting our schools back on track. Protecting religious liberty is absolutely crucial in that.'

Live: Day 3 in trial of Jose Ibarra	(NewsNation) — The trial for Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, could be ending soon. Prosecutors say they only need half a day more, and the defense says it only plans to call a few witnesses themselves — including Jose Ibarra's brothers, Diego and Argenis. Diego and Argenis Ibarra, who, like Jose are Venezuelan citizens, have been in federal custody since February on charges they had fake green cards. The defense was instructed to bring the brothers to Athens, Georgia one full day ahead of schedule. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Tuesday marks the third day of the trial. Over the previous two days, the prosecution has called 19 witnesses. Riley's roommates, police officers and FBI agents all testified. On Monday, police showed body camera footage of the moment they first made contact with Jose Ibarra. Police said they noticed scratches and cuts all over his arms. In video footage from the police, Jose Ibarra was not able to explain where those injuries came from. Prosecutors say these are clear defensive wounds from when Riley was fighting for her life. A technological analysis of Riley's watch revealed the exact moment the 22-year-old stopped dead in her tracks before launching an emergency call to police that was abruptly hung up. An FBI agent said in court Monday that GPS location data from Jose Ibarra's phone puts him in an identical spot as Riley at the exact moment she died. Rep. Nancy Mace introduces Capitol bathroom bill restrictions Defense attorneys for Jose Ibarra continue to say it's still possible someone else might be responsible for the crime. The defense team pointed to the fact that Jose Ibarra and his brothers, who lived together in a one-bedroom apartment near the crime scene, shared clothes like hats and jackets that have been seen on surveillance videos. Jose Ibarra is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. If convicted, faces the possibility of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The 26-year-old has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Riley was reported missing on Feb. 22 when she didn't return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. UGA police arrested Jose Ibarra the next day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jose-ibarra-trial-day-three/	2024-11-19T04:52:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24323563549427.jpg?w=900
Congress to question FEMA about hurricane relief	(NewsNation) — Congress will hear from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Tuesday, following reports that the agency withheld hurricane recovery aid from supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. ET with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Questions will focus on the agency’s preparedness and response to recent disasters, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton. NewsNation will stream the event live here. Trump to attend SpaceX ‘Starship’ launch in Texas: Sources A FEMA worker was fired earlier this month after she directed others helping hurricane survivors not to go to homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Donald Trump, according to the agency’s leader. 'This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,' Criswell said in a statement at the time. 'This was reprehensible.' The fired employee, Marn’i Washington, is accused of telling her survivor assistance team not to go to Florida homes with pro-Trump yard signs. Washington told NewsNation she believes she’s being used as a scapegoat for a common agency practice. The instruction to avoid certain houses with certain campaign signs came from her direct superior based on previous team encounters, Washington said, adding that 'safety precautions are not politically driven.' Several recent hostile encounters happened at homes with Trump campaign signs, she said. 'I’m being framed. There’s no violation of the Hatch Act,' Washington said. 'I was simply following orders.'

Top Democrat on House Ethics panel says Gaetz report should be re...	Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, said she thinks the panel’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) should be released. Wild answered 'yes' when asked whether the panel should release its report on Gaetz, who President-elect Trump nominated to be attorney general last week. 'We have a scheduled meeting on Wednesday, and it remains to be seen what the chairman's agenda is for that, but I believe we should vote on whether we're to disclose it or not,' Wild said. Wild, who is leaving Congress at the end of the year after being defeated by Republican challenger Ryan Mackenzie, said that she expected all Democrats to vote in favor of releasing the report. On the evenly split panel with five Republicans and five Democrats, it would take at least one Republican to side with Democrats to vote to release the report. 'Everybody on the committee now has the report, so they've got the opportunity to be reviewing it,' Wild said. Asked about the possibility of releasing the report only to the Senate, Wild said: 'Either you are going to disclose it or you're not going to disclose it.' Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), the chair of the Ethics Committee, declined to confirm details about the meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Guest did say that he has read the report on Gaetz, and that other members on the panel 'have the ability to read the report.' He declined to offer his thoughts on what the Gaetz report said. The Ethics Committee investigated Gaetz for years over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other claims. Gaetz, whom the Justice Department declined to charge after investigating the same matters, has vigorously denied wrongdoing. Gaetz abruptly resigned from his seat the same day he was announced as Trump's attorney general pick. A source told The Hill that his resignation came just two days before the committee was scheduled to meet to vote to release the report, but that meeting was later canceled. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has publicly advocated against releasing the report, since Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress and the committee traditionally does not investigate former members. 'I think that would be a Pandora's box. I don't think we want the House Ethics Committee using all of its vast resources and powers to go after private citizens,' Johnson said Sunday on CNN’s 'State of the Union.' While such a move is very rare, there is precedent for the committee releasing a report after a member resigned. In 1987, the committee released its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. Senators on both sides of the aisle have said they want to see the report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/top-democrat-on-house-ethics-panel-says-gaetz-report-should-be-released/	2024-11-18T16:34:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/wildsusan_110424gn02_w.jpg?w=900
2 women tell Ethics panel Matt Gaetz paid them for sex, attorney ...	(The Hill) -- Two women testified before the House Ethics Committee that former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) paid them to have sex, according to the attorney representing them. Joel Leppard, a Florida-based attorney, made the disclosure in an interview with ABC News that was published Monday. The article does not include the identities of his clients, both of whom are older than 18. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? Leppard said the House Ethics Committee and his clients went one by one through a series of Venmo transactions. 'That’s correct,' Leppard told ABC News's Juju Chang when asked if both his clients testified that they were paid by Gaetz to have sex. 'The House was very clear about that and went through each. They essentially put the Venmo payments on the screen and asked about them. And my clients repeatedly testified, ‘What was this payment for?’ ‘Well that was for sex.’' The revelation marks the latest piece of information Leppard has disclosed since President-elect Trump nominated Gaetz to serve as attorney general and the Florida Republican subsequently resigned from the House. Last week, Leppard told ABC News that one of his clients testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with a minor. 'She testified in July of 2017, at this house party, she was walking out to the pool area, and she looked to her right, and she saw Rep. Gaetz having sex with her friend, who was 17,' Leppard said. Leppard told ABC News that the client told the panel she believed Gaetz ended that sexual relationship when he learned the girl was a minor. The House Ethics Committee — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — had been investigating Gaetz on and off for roughly three years, probing whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. The Hill reached out to Gaetz for comment on Leppard’s remarks. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition, called the allegations 'baseless' in a statement. 'Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He’s the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration,' Pfeiffer said. 'The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing. The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz.' Gaetz’s resignation from Congress has raised questions about whether the Ethics Committee’s highly anticipated report on the Florida Republican will become public. A number of lawmakers in both parties have called on the panel to release it — which would require a majority vote — but others, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), have pushed for it to remain private. Leppard is one of the voices calling on the Ethics Committee to release its report on Gaetz. Last week he said, 'As the Senate considers former Rep. Gaetz's nomination for attorney general, several questions demand answers.' 'What if multiple credible witnesses provided evidence of behavior that would constitute serious criminal violations?' he added. Former primary challenger to Gaetz considering bid for now-open seat Johnson, meanwhile, has argued that because Gaetz is no longer in Congress, the Ethics Committee’s report is moot. He also warned that releasing the body of work would open a 'Pandora’s box' of the panel releasing reports on individuals who no longer serve in the lower chamber. 'What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,' Johnson told CNN’s 'State of the Union' in an interview Sunday. 'There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to nonmembers of Congress. I think that would be a Pandora's box.' The 9 GOP senators who could derail Trump’s Cabinet picks While releasing an Ethics report after a lawmaker has departed the House is rare, it is not unprecedented. In 1987, the panel published its report on former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he had left the chamber. The House Ethics Committee is slated to meet Wednesday, a source told The Hill, during which the Gaetz report is likely to be discussed. The focus around Gaetz’s Ethics investigation comes after the Department of Justice declined to charge the then-congressman with any crimes in 2017, after its probe had concluded. Investigators had questioned if witnesses at the center of the case would be seen as credible before a jury, according to multiple outlets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/matt-gaetz-ethics-panel/	2024-11-18T16:06:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn01_w-e1731971603796.jpg?w=800
Trump picks Sean Duffy to be transportation secretary	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he is naming former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as his nominee to be transportation secretary, as he continues to roll out picks for his Cabinet. Duffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump’s most visible defenders on cable news — a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and was chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is now co-host of a show on Fox Business, the 'Bottom Line.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? In his announcement Monday, Trump noted that Duffy is married to a Fox News host, calling him 'the husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News.' Trump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress 'to maintain and rebuild our Nation’s Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!' Duffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor, despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed time to care for the needs of his family of nine children, posting on social media that his youngest child had a heart condition.

Trump to attend SpaceX 'Starship' launch in Texas: Sources	Sources have confirmed President-elect Donald J. Trump will be visiting Brownsville Tuesday to watch the sixth SpaceX launch. The team of U.S. Representative for District 34 Vicente Gonzalez confirmed to NewsNation local affiliate KVEO that Trump will be in attendance Tuesday as space enthusiasts, locals and out of towners watch SpaceX attempt to launch the Starship rocket. Two sources also confirmed his attendance to NewsNation's Libbey Dean. Musk’s bold plans for ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ face roadblocks Local flight restrictions read: 'The Federal Aviation Administration has issued temporary flight restrictions over Brownsville and Boca Chica, Texas area for a VIP visit that coincides with the SpaceX launch window for a test of its massive Starship rocket from its launch facility on the Gulf of Mexico. The flight restrictions put in place over Trump’s home in Palm Beach, Florida when he is there will be lifted briefly while the Texas security measures are in place.' Trump won the Rio Grande Valley, where the launch will take place. Leading up to the Nov. 5 election, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk showed support for Trump while on the campaign trail. He's since been tapped to to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) along Vivek Ramaswamy. This is SpaceX's sixth attempt at launching Starship, and this time around, it aims to expand the envelope on Starship and booster capabilities. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? 'Objectives include the booster once again returning to the launch site for catch, reigniting a ship Raptor engine while in space, and testing a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,' SpaceX stated.

Diddy's lawyers say his jail cell was unlawfully raided	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ attorneys have accused prosecutors of engaging in 'outrageous government conduct' alleging that they seized notes and other 'privileged attorney-client' material from the music mogul’s jail cell and are using it to keep him locked up. In a letter requesting an immediate hearing, his lawyers alleged Monday that prosecutors gathered 'privileged material, including the defendant’s own written notes' during a raid on Combs’ cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. They said those materials were cited in papers the government filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday in a bid to keep the music mogul locked up before his May 5 trial. What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? 'This search and seizure are in violation of Mr. Combs’ Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights,' the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian. 'The targeted seizure of a pre-trial detainee’s work product and privileged materials – created in preparation for trial – is outrageous government conduct amounting to a substantive due process violation,' they added. They demanded prosecutors answer who authorized the search of Combs’ cell, where personal effects and paperwork were seized. Subramanian gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. ET Monday to respond to Comb’s lawyers and set a hearing on the matter for Tuesday afternoon.

' Combs is currently seeking to be placed on house arrest through a $50 million bail package. On Friday, prosecutors said Combs has been trying to dodge scrutiny of his jailhouse communications while orchestrating social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials he views are helpful to his case. They said he also has contacted witnesses through third parties.

White House rejects claim it's 'adding fuel' to Russia’s war on U...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The White House rejected the Kremlin’s claim Monday that it is adding 'fuel to the fire' by authorizing Ukrainian forces to use U.S.-supplied missiles inside Russia. 'The fire was lit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,' deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, said. 'So, I think this notion of fuel on the fire is, frankly, a side issue to the main issue, which is Russia waging a war of aggression across a sovereign border, into Ukraine, and continuing to do so.' 'I would put the question back to Russia about who's actually putting fuel on the fire here, and I don’t think it’s the Ukrainians,' Finer said. President Joe Biden has given Kyiv the green light to use long-range weapons – known as Army Tactical Missile Systems or ATACMS – which would enable strikes deep inside Russian territory, easing previous restrictions on Western-made weapons. What does Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range US weapons mean? The announcement came Sunday after the U.S. had frequently said it would not lift its ban on Ukraine’s use of American weapons against Russia, citing fear of escalation. The United States has provided Ukraine with more than $56 billion in military aid since Russia’s invasion in Feb. 2022, according to the Department of Defense. With two months left in office, Biden’s shift in U.S. policy came in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying more than 10,000 North Korean troops into Moscow’s fight. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov criticized the Biden administration for 'adding fuel to the conflict,' before recalling Putin’s statement in September in which he said that Ukraine’s use of U.S. weapons to attack Russia would put NATO at war with Moscow. 'If this decision is taken, it will mean nothing less than the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine,' Putin said at the time. 'This will be their direct participation, and this, of course, will significantly change the very essence, the very nature of the conflict.' President-elect Donald Trump has not commented on Biden’s decision, but his son, Donald Trump Jr., lambasted it. 'The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,' he wrote on X. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine within 24 hours without specifying how. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky seemingly agreed with this Friday, saying he is certain his country’s war with Russia would end 'faster' once Trump becomes U.S. president.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/white-house-russias-war-ukraine-missiles/	2024-11-18T12:30:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1680847188.jpg?w=900
Diddy tried to reach out to witnesses from jail, prosecutors alle...	(NewsNation) — Prosecutors said in a court document last week that Sean 'Diddy' Combs tried to contact potential witnesses for his upcoming sex trafficking trial from jail. 'The defendant has continued to engage in a relentless course of obstructive conduct designed to subvert the integrity of these proceedings,' prosecutors said in a court filing asking the judge to reject Combs' $50 million bail request. 'The defendant has shown repeatedly — even while in custody — that he will flagrantly and repeatedly flout rules in order to improperly impact the outcome of his case.' Jail calls showed that Combs asked family members to reach out to potential victims and witnesses, prosecutors said in the filing. They also accused Combs of orchestrating social media campaigns 'aimed at tainting the jury pool' and trying to publicly leak materials that could help his case. Part of this campaign included having his children post a video to their social media accounts showing them gathered to celebrate Combs' birthday, the court filing said. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator During a nationwide sweep of Bureau of Prison facilities, investigators found notes from Combs' cell phone that included communications with a woman identified in the court filing as Witness 2. 'It is clear that when the defendant reinitiated contact with Witness 2 in September 2024, his purpose was to ensure that Witness 2 was on his side,' prosecutors wrote. The strong inference to be drawn from Combs' communication with Witness 2 is that he paid her after she posted a statement denying allegations of violence by him. NewsNation reached out to Witness 2 for comment. In their own filing, Combs' lawyers argued that the prosecutors' search and seizure of their clients' notes violated his rights, according to Billboard. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users 'The targeted seizure of a pre-trial detainee’s work product and privileged materials — created in preparation for trial — is outrageous government conduct amounting to a substantive due process violation,' Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said in the filing.

House Ethics Committee to meet Wednesday amid debate over Gaetz r...	Members of the House Ethics Committee will meet Wednesday, a source confirmed to The Hill, as the panel weighs whether it should release its report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whom President-elect Trump plans to nominate to serve as attorney general. The source, however, cautioned that the huddle may be delayed, since details about the meeting leaked early Monday morning. The panel scrapped plans to gather this past Friday for an unclear reason. House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) told Politico the meeting had been postponed, not canceled. A spokesperson for the Ethics Committee declined to comment. The debate over whether the panel should publish its report on Gaetz is heating up in the Capitol. Lawmakers from both parties are calling for its release for the sake of transparency and ahead of confirmation hearings, while others — including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) — argue the final product should remain private because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. Johnson reaffirmed that position Sunday. 'What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,' Johnson told CNN’s 'State of the Union' in an interview. 'There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to nonmembers of Congress. I think that would be a Pandora's box.' The committee — which is known for conducting its business in secrecy — had been investigating for roughly three years whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other allegations. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. The probe came to an abrupt end when Gaetz left the House on Wednesday, since the panel does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress. But the committee can still release its report into Gaetz if it wishes, a move that is rare but not unprecedented; in 1987, the panel released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he has resigned from Congress. Such a move would require a majority vote on the panel. Lawmakers who sit on the Ethics Committee have been mum about how they plan to handle the question of releasing the report. The panel was initially scheduled to meet Friday of last week and vote on releasing it, a plan that was set before Trump announced Gaetz as his attorney general pick and the Florida Republican immediately resigned from Congress on Wednesday. Some members have questioned whether Gaetz left the House early to stop the investigation from advancing. 'It’s very suspicious that he all of a sudden resigned, because other members who are being nominated for posts have not resigned,' Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) said last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/house-ethics-committee-to-meet-wednesday-amid-debate-over-gaetz-report/	2024-11-18T09:17:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_060524jg03_w.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. faces resistance as Trump's pick to lead HHS	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could face some resistance as he seeks Senate confirmation to be Republican President-elect Donald Trump's Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. When he announced Kennedy as his pick to lead the department, Trump said the former independent presidential candidate will 'play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.' As part of his 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda, Kennedy is looking to do a complete system overhaul of the agencies that regulate health and food. He's called for stricter pesticide regulations and made a vow to get processed foods removed from school lunches. Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? On vaccines, Kennedy has said he wants a re-examination of their safety data. Health and medical experts raised concerns to NewsNation partner The Hill about Kennedy's influence on the Trump administration, as he has spread misinformation about vaccines before. In an interview with NBC News, Kennedy denied being anti-vaccine and said that he wouldn't 'take them away' from those who want one. 'I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them,' Kennedy told the news outlet earlier this month. Kennedy will likely face political pushback from senators during his confirmation as HHS Secretary. Democratic senators such as Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts criticized Kennedy as Trump's choice to head the department. 'Dangerous. Unqualified. Unserious,' Markey wrote. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., posted on X that Kennedy potentially being in charge of Health and Human Services 'could not be more dangerous.' 'There's no telling how far an anti-vaxxer (and) fringe conspiracy theorist like RFK Jr. could set America back in terms of public health, reproductive rights, research, &amp; more,' she said. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users On the other hand, some Republican lawmakers celebrated Kennedy's nomination. 'RFK Jr. has championed issues like healthy foods and the need for greater transparency in our public health infrastructure,' Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement Thursday, The Hill reported. 'I look forward to learning more about his other policy positions and how they will support a conservative, pro-American agenda.' Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said on X that he could not be happier with Kennedy. 'He’s a brilliant, courageous truth-teller whose unwavering commitment to transparency will make America a healthier nation,' Johnson wrote. Some lobbyists in the food and health industry are planning ways to stop the Senate from confirming Kennedy, Politico reported. Others are currying favor in case they aren't successful, the news outlet writes. According to Reuters, shortly after news of Kennedy's nomination came down, shares of vaccine makers including Pfizer and Moderna fell by as much as 2%. Processed food stocks decreased as well, CNBC wrote.

Live: Oxford shooting victims' families demand investigation	(NewsNation) — Almost three years after the Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, the parents of the victims say the fight for justice is far from over. The parents are pressuring the state to conduct and fund a new investigation, hoping to force some people to talk who didn't want to before. It's been nearly three years since Ethan Crumbley gunned down four students and injured several others using a gun gifted by his father. It's the first case in which the parents of a suspect have been held legally accountable. The families don't feel like a thorough investigation was ever done in this case. It was clear after the shooting who was responsible for it so from an investigative standpoint, the case was closed, they knew who did it. But these families want Michigan lawmakers to fund an investigation into the how and the why behind the tragedy. Read more: Crumbleys’ sentence ‘about accountability’: Father of victim The hope is that the answer will provide a sort of roadmap for legislation that will prevent this tragedy from repeating itself. This court case is not entirely over, despite the convictions. Ethan was 15 when he gunned down his fellow classmates with a semi-automatic weapon. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and an additional 24 years. The now-18-year-old is asking the court to consider a lesser sentence. His appeal requests an expert witness to be able to testify to Ethan Crumbley's rough childhood, and suggests he may suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome. The deadline for prosecutors to respond to his request is Tuesday. Ethan Crumbley's parents are also serving time for involuntary manslaughter in the shooting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/gun-violence/oxford-shooting-michigan-parents-demand-state-investigation/	2024-11-18T06:56:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/666387f314df88.15051825.jpeg?w=900
The 9 GOP senators who could derail Trump’s Cabinet picks	(The Hill) - Multiple Republican senators are looming as potential obstacles to President-elect Trump's controversial Cabinet picks, especially his two most polarizing choices: former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump has had a rocky relationship in the past with a handful of Republicans senators who won’t likely give him the same deference as loyal allies such as Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who last week called on his GOP colleagues to 'get out of the way' and approve Trump's nominees. Senators who could derail Trump's Cabinet nominations Trump can afford three defections within the Senate GOP conference and still get his picks confirmed. Federal workers brace for Trump overhaul of civil service But four Republican senators would be enough to sink any of his nominees, and two moderates — Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, — have already voiced deep reservations about Gaetz, who was embroiled in a federal sex trafficking investigation, of leading the Justice Department. Here are the senators that could stymie Trump’s nominees. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 11: Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) speaks during the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on the Special Diabetes Program on July 11, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for JDRF) Murkowski signaled her likely opposition to Gaetz soon after he was announced as Trump’s pick to serve as attorney general. 'I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general,' she told reporters. Murkowski, who didn’t vote for either Trump or Vice President Harris, would likely be skeptical of Trump’s choice of Kennedy to head the Department of Health and Human Services. The Alaska senator, who serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, used social media to promote vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she also voted in December 2021 to overturn the vaccine mandate for private businesses. Trump will use ‘military assets’ to remove illegal migrants She expressed surprised over Trump’s choice of Pete Hegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host, to head the Department of Defense. 'Wow. … I’m just surprised. I'm not going to comment on whether it's good, bad or indifferent. I’m just surprised because the names that I’ve heard for secretary of Defense have not included him,' she said. Murkowski was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump of inciting insurrection during his 2021 Senate impeachment trial. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 04: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) speaks during the 2024 Government Day Reception hosted by Breakthrough T1D at the Kennedy Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building on June 04, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Breakthrough T1D) Collins is the only Republican senator up for reelection in 2026 in a state that Harris won, and she immediately expressed her skepticism about Gaetz serving as the nation’s next attorney general. 'I was shocked by the announcement,' she said of Gaetz’s nomination. 'I’m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing. Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but I’m certain that there will be a lot of questions.' Collins will closely review Trump’s nomination of Kennedy, as she also sits on the HELP Committee. Collins told The New York times that she found some of Kennedy’s past statements 'alarming.' Cheryl Hines’ friends ‘concerned’ 'I’ve never even met with him or sat down with him or heard him speak at length,' she said before Trump formally announced his nomination of Kennedy. But she said that Kennedy 'would be a surprising choice' to head the nation’s health services, given his long track record of claiming that vaccines pose serious health concerns and his push to remove fluoride from public water, something that many lawmakers view as a fringe issue. Sen.-elect John Curtis, R-Utah WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 13: U.S. Senator-elect John Curtis (R-UT) arrives for the Senate Republican leadership elections at the U.S. Capitol on November 13, 2024 in Washington, DC. The Senate Republicans elected Sen. John Thune (R-SD) as Majority Leader, Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) as Assistant Majority Leader, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) as Republican Conference Chair, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) as Republican Policy Committee Chair, Sen. James Lankford as Republican Conference Vice Chair and Sen. Tim Scott (R-FL) as National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair for the 119th Congress. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Curtis will be filling the seat of retiring Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and he has the reputation of a practical centrist who is expected to approach his job in the same thoughtful and measured way that Romney did during his six years in the Senate. Curtis heads the Conservative Climate Caucus and has pushed back against climate skeptics, arguing that conservatives have a role to serve as 'good stewards' of the environment. He favored censuring Trump for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, but he voted 'no' on impeachment during his tenure in the House, urging colleagues to 'tone down the rhetoric and calm the tensions.' Curtis doesn’t have a great relationship with Gaetz, who traveled to Utah in March to campaign against him in the Senate Republican primary. Pentagon fails 7th audit in a row but says progress made Gaetz accused Curtis on the campaign trail of 'weakness' and a 'willingness to prioritize foreign interests abroad' and 'special interests in the halls of Washington.' Curtis has already signaled he would not support putting the Senate into an extended recess to allow Trump to circumvent the confirmation process by making recess appointments. 'Senator-elect Curtis believes that every president is afforded a degree of deference to select his team and make nominations,' Curtis’s chief of staff, Corey Norman, told KSL TV in Salt Lake City. 'He also firmly believes in and is committed to the Senate’s critical role to confirm or reject nominations based on information and insight from confirmation hearings.' Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 08: U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), ranking Member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, participates in a hearing on prescription drugs costs at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 08, 2024 in Washington, DC. The Committee heard testimony on drug pricing from the heads of several drug manufactures including Joaquin Duato, CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Robert Davis, CEO of Merck, and Chris Boerner, CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Cassidy will be one of only three Republican senators still serving next year who voted to convict Trump on the impeachment charge of inciting insurrection. Cassidy is known as a principled politician who’s not afraid to buck Trump or tackle politically dangerous issues, such as reforming Social Security to extend its solvency. But the Louisiana lawmaker is up for reelection in 2026 and faces a potential primary challenge given his vote to convict Trump. He will likely serve as chair of the HELP Committee next year, giving him jurisdiction over Kennedy’s nomination to head Health and Human Services. Cassidy, a doctor, has disputed claims attempting to link vaccines and autism as 'fake news.' Trump taps FCC commissioner Brendan Carr to chair the agency 'As a doctor who has spent my life trying to bring health to the people of Louisiana, I strongly endorse immunizations,' he said in 2019. 'There is no linkage to autism that has ever been made by a credible scientist.' Cassidy's Health panel will hold a hearing on Kennedy but the Senate Finance Committee will handle Kennedy's paperwork and vote to advance him to the floor, according to a Republican source familiar with the process. Cassidy dodged questions about Gaetz’s nomination to head the Justice Department but did not appear to be impressed by Trump’s choice of Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense, given his career in television and lack of experience managing large organizations such as the Pentagon. 'Who?' Cassidy said when asked Tuesday about Hegseth becoming the next secretary of Defense, expressing the same bewilderment that several GOP senators voiced about Trump’ s unorthodox choice when news of it broke Tuesday. Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind. WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 04: U.S. Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) speaks on the economy during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on May 04, 2022 in Washington, DC. The group of Senators spoke out about Biden's economic agenda and blamed his administration for rising inflation. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Young is a serious legislator who doesn’t like to be asked about Trump’s latest provocative statements on Truth Social. But while Young doesn’t often talk about the controversies that constantly swirl around Trump, he’s made clear in the past that he’s not a fan. He did not endorse Trump for president in 2024 and has criticized him for refusing to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal. Manchin postelection: ‘There is a need for a third party’ He also faulted Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol but did not vote to convict him. Young was one of several Republican senators, along with Collins, Murkowski and Cassidy, to vote for a 2022 bill to address gun violence. Gaetz said at the time that any Republican senator who supported the measure would be 'a traitor to the Constitution,' a statement that won’t endear him to the senators whose support he needs to win confirmation. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 14: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) talks to reporters following the weekly Senate Republican policy luncheon in the U.S. Capitol on February 14, 2023 in Washington, DC. Republicans were critical of President Joe Biden's response to the U.S. Military's downing of four unidentified objects that entered North American airspace in the last eight days and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) re-emphasized that the country would not default on its debts by failing to raise the debt limit. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Ernst told The Hill that Gaetz has an 'uphill climb' to securing enough votes to win confirmation, and she’s taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s choices of Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, to serve as director of national intelligence and Hegseth to lead the Defense Department. Ernst said she wants to meet with Gabbard before forming any judgments about her nomination. 'I’ve had a relationship with her. It might be a little unconventional, but at the same time she might bring value to us too. So we’ll have to sort through all that,' she said. Asked about Gabbard’s past statements defending Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Putin, Ernst said, 'We’ll have to talk about that.' Pension, perks await retiring US presidents Ernst is also up for reelection in 2026. While Trump won Iowa in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, former President Obama carried it in 2008 and 2012. Democrats may target her seat simply because they don’t have many other promising options on the electoral map. Ernst lost her race to become Senate Republican Conference chair to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and may be more inclined to break with her party now that she will no longer be a member of the elected leadership. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 19: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) speaks at a news conference on the Supreme Court at the U.S. Capitol Building on July 19, 2023 in Washington, DC. Senators with the Senate Judiciary Committee held the press conference to discuss Senate Judiciary Chairman Richard Durbin's (D-IL) upcoming ethics bill. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Tillis is not afraid to play the role of Republican maverick if he feels strongly about a nominee or an issue, and he’s already suggesting that Gaetz might not have much support in the Senate. 'It'll just be interesting to see what his organic base is,' Tillis said of the nominee. 'At the end of the day, Congressman Gaetz, he'll have a hearing, but I'm all about counting votes and I would think that he's probably got some work cut out for him to get a good strong vote.' 'We're not going to get a single Democrat vote,' he said. Tillis will be one of the Senate Democrats’ top targets in 2026 if he decides to run for reelection in North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won by 3.5 percentage points over Harris. Trump’s team drawing up list of Pentagon officers to fire: Report Tillis, who represents more than 90,000 active-duty service members in his home state, which is also home to Fort Liberty — formerly known as Fort Bragg — says Hegseth will need to answer some tough questions at his confirmation hearing. 'I think he’s just got to go through the vetting process and withstand what I’m sure is going to be an interesting murder board in the Senate Armed Services Committee,' he told reporters. Tillis acknowledged Hegseth’s lack of experience leading large organizations will be something he needs to address at his confirmation hearing. 'Those are all things you got to have good, sound answers for. It’s a large, complex, very, very important agency,' he said. 'We’ve got to see all the vetting. There’s a lot of work that’ll go into between now and the time he actually comes before the committee.' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 05: Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) walks to the Senate Chambers for a nomination vote at the U.S. Capitol Building on December 05, 2022 in Washington, DC. Congress faces multiple legislative hurdles before their holiday recess including passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and government funding for 2023. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Cornyn pledged to get Trump’s nominees through the Senate quickly when he was running against Senate Republican Whip John Thune, S.D., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to become the next Senate majority leader. Cornyn, however, lost that race, which could give him more freedom to criticize Trump’s picks, especially if he doesn’t think they’re qualified for the highest-profile Cabinet roles. He joked to reporters that he and Sen. Mitch McConnell, Ky., who will retire as Senate GOP leader, are now 'liberated' as they won’t have elected leadership positions in 2025, giving them more latitude to push back against flawed nominees. Cornyn, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has called for members of his panel to have full access to the findings of the House Ethics Committee’s investigation of Gaetz for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Elon Musk is hiring for DOGE. Here’s the type of people he wants to recruit He warned that if there’s evidence of wrongdoing, Gaetz could become 'an embarrassment to the president.' 'We need to get access to everything,' he said, breaking with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who said Friday that he will 'strongly request' that the House Ethics panel stick to its practice of not releasing a report about a member who has resigned from the House, as Gaetz did this past week. Cornyn also appeared surprised that Trump picked Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence, given her past statements disputing the U.S. government’s claim that Assad used chemical weapons against his own people and defending Putin’s stated rationale for invading Ukraine. Cornyn, however, is up for reelection in 2026 and is likely to face a conservative primary challenger. This might give him reason to be cautious in criticizing Trump’s nominees, but even so, he’s not likely to shy away from standing his ground on Trump’s most controversial picks, such as Gaetz. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 23: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks during a press conference following the Republicans weekly policy luncheon on January 23, 2024 in Washington, DC. Negotiations over border security, military aid to Ukraine and Israel, and the government budget continue this week on Capitol Hill. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) McConnell will be one of the most interesting Senate wild cards next year given his deep skepticism of Trump’s character and many of his policy positions. McConnell has served as Senate majority or minority leader for the past 18 years, which saddled him with the responsibility of preserving unity within the GOP conference. As majority leader during Trump’s first four years in office, he played a leading role in confirming Trump’s nominees to the executive and judicial branches. He counts his role in confirming three conservative justices to the Supreme Court under Trump among his greatest career accomplishments. Yet McConnell, an institutionalist and defense hawk, is not likely to rubber-stamp Trump’s nomination of Gaetz to head the Justice Department if he thinks it would undermine public confidence in the nation’s top law enforcement institution. Cruise line offers 4-year journey to ‘skip forward’ in wake of US presidential election 'Looking at his track record, he’s never cowed to Trump on things, especially as they relate to the Senate and the Senate’s role,' said a Senate Republican aide. McConnell rejected Trump’s call in 2018 for Senate Republicans to abolish the filibuster to improve the chances of passing his legislative agenda at the time. Given his role as a defender of Senate prerogatives, he will likely counsel against putting the Senate in an extended recess to allow Trump to make recess appointments. McConnell will carefully examine Gabbard’s statements about Russia, given the leading role he has played directing U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

US immigration judges ordered 7K Mexicans deported last month	McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) - Over 7,100 Mexican nationals were ordered deported from the United States in October - that's more than any other nationality group, according to new data. Head of renowned migrant center wants to work with new administration U.S. immigration judges ordered the deportations, which are the most in a decade and culminate a trend in rising number of Mexicans ordered removed from the country, according to data released Friday from Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC.) Guatemalans, Honduras, Nicaraguans and Ecuadorians were the next most foreign nationals ordered by judges deported from the United States in October, TRAC found. Over 7,100 Mexicans were deported from the United States in October. (TRAC Graphic) An analysis of immigration cases found two-thirds, or 66% of all Mexicans who applied for asylum in the United States were ordered deported - that's way above the 37% of Mexican nationals who were ordered sent back in October 2023, with the remainder allowed to stay in the United States while their immigration cases played out, TRAC says. Trump to call on Border Patrol for help with deportations, expert says In October, U.S. immigration judges granted asylum relief to 2,471 immigrants, or 66% of cases heard, following their merit hearings, TRAC reports. October marked the first month of Fiscal Year 2025, and so far this fiscal year, there were 87,620 new immigration cases filed, and 81,472 cases closed, TRAC says. (TRAC Graphics) The immigration case backlog now tops 3.72 million, that's down slightly from 3.71 million in Fiscal 2024.

Laken Riley trial: Forensic, technology experts to testify	(NewsNation) — Jose Ibarra, the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, is scheduled to be in court Monday for the second day of his trial. Nine witnesses were called to testify on Friday in Athens-Clarke County Superior Court. The prosecution is expected to pick right back up where it left off Monday morning, with experts called to explain how fingerprints found on Riley's phone match Jose Ibarra's. They are also expected to talk about how Riley's watch data matches up to video evidence the prosecution has collected over the last nine months which points to Jose Ibarra. Prosecutors say Jose Ibarra's DNA was found under 22-year-old Riley's fingernails. Jose Ibarra's defense attorneys, meanwhile, argue all of the evidence the prosecution has is circumstantial. An investigation began after a friend reported Riley missing on Feb. 22 when she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators later discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. UGA Police arrested Jose Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Jose Ibarra 26, who waived his right to a jury trial, is charged with murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, battery and tampering with evidence. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts. Jodi Huisentruit suspect list down to four people: Private investigator Ibarra's brothers to testify NewsNation obtained copies of court documents showing Ibarra's attorneys plans to call two of his brothers, Diego and Argenis, to testify in court this week. Neighbors told NewsNation that the three brothers were living in a one-bedroom apartment not far from the crime scene. On Friday, the defense showed photographs that reveal Diego Ibarra was wearing the exact same baseball hat Jose Ibarra was said to have been wearing on the day Riley was killed, as well as similar clothes. Diego and Argenis Ibarra are charged with possessing fraudulent green cards and in federal custody. They are set to be taken to the courthouse on Wednesday. Authorities say all three brothers are Venezuelan citizens who are in the United States illegally. New ‘X’ terms and conditions leads to exodus of users First Day of Jose Ibarra's Trial Prosecutor Sheila Ross said on the first day of the trial that Jose Ibarra 'went hunting for females on the University of Georgia’s campus.' 'When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,' Ross said Friday. Defense attorney Dustin Kirby called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing, but said none of it proves his client is a killer. 'People have used this case for their own personal gain — financial gain, political gain,' Kirby said.

Trump will use 'military assets' to remove illegal migrants	(NewsNation) President-elect Donald Trump confirmed Monday morning he plans to use 'military assets' to remove migrants accused of entering the U.S. illegally. In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump shared a post by Judicial Watch president John Fitton which read, 'Reports are the incoming @RealDonaldTrump administration prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program.' Trump commented 'True!' It's unclear what military assets Trump intends to use, but he's mentioned invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite migrant removal in the past. Critics argue the law is out of date and wince at its most recent use during World War II to hold Japanese-Americans in internment camps without due process. Immigration was a top issue in the 2024 presidential campaign, and Trump has promised to stabilize the southern border after more migrants crossed during the Biden administration than any other in history.

Baltimore mayor discusses winning strategy against violent crime	(NewsNation) — Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, who recently made history as the city's first mayor to win re-election in two decades, is highlighting significant progress in reducing violent crime through a comprehensive approach to public safety. One Baltimore neighborhood, Brooklyn, has marked more than 400 days without a homicide — a dramatic turnaround for an area that experienced a block party shooting in July 2023 that left two dead and nearly 30 injured, mostly teenagers and young adults. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the city’s flagship anti-violence program Safe Streets ramped up its work in the area. Scott's strategy includes a distinctive approach to violence prevention: sending personalized letters to individuals identified as at risk of becoming either victims or perpetrators of gun violence. The letters offer support for life changes while warning of consequences for continued criminal activity. Kohberger attorneys motion to suppress evidence including DNA 'We want them to be alive. We will help them change their life, but if they don't, we will extract them with law enforcement,' Scott said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' The neighborhood has seen an 86% reduction in homicides and a 76% decrease in non-fatal shootings. These improvements are part of a broader trend, with Baltimore recording a 20% reduction in homicides last year and an additional 24% drop this year, alongside a 34% decrease in non-fatal shootings. The mayor emphasizes a collaborative approach involving multiple city agencies, from violence interrupters to recreation and parks staff. The program includes job training and education support, citing recent success stories including a participant who obtained their GED and found employment. Safe Streets focuses on de-escalating conflicts by employing mediators with credibility and knowledge of the streets. The program has 10 offices based in some of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods. It was launched in 2007 and expanded in recent years under Scott’s administration, which has often pledged to treat violence as a public health crisis and address its root causes. Laken Riley trial: Jose Ibarra’s brothers subpoenaed A community survey conducted in the weeks after the Brooklyn mass shooting showed that many neighborhood residents placed more trust in Safe Streets than Baltimore police, local schools, nonprofits and other institutions, according to city officials. Only neighborhood churches ranked higher. Even still, having Safe Streets workers present during the block party wasn’t enough to prevent it from ultimately devolving into chaos and bloodshed. Scott also addressed the city's ongoing struggle with the opioid crisis, noting a recent settlement with pharmaceutical companies that will bring approximately $500 million to Baltimore for addiction response efforts. The city currently averages more than two overdose deaths per day, according to health department statistics. The mayor's efforts are featured in 'The Body Politic,' a documentary chronicling his first year in office, scheduled to air on PBS on Nov. 25 at 10 p.m. Eastern.

Laken Riley trial: Jose Ibarra's brothers subpoenaed	(NewsNation) — The criminal brothers of accused killer Jose Ibarra will testify on behalf of the defense this week in the murder trial of 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. New court documents obtained by NewsNation revealed that Diego and Argenis, who are both undocumented immigrants currently in custody for fake green cards, were subpoenaed by the defense team to appear. Agents rescue 4-year-old girl, baby from smugglers near border The Ibarra brothers were allegedly living together in an apartment not far from the University of Georgia campus at the time of Riley's murder. All three crossed over the border illegally from Venezuela. Diego was employed for a short time by the university, but was fired shortly before Riley's death for failing to produce proper documentation. In a rare move, Ibarra has waived his right to a jury trial, leaving his fate solely in the hands of a judge — a risky decision in a case that has garnered national attention. That move could prove strategically advantageous for the accused killer following a devastating start to court proceedings. Riley’s family sobbed as graphic details and images were revealed about the woman's terrifying final moments. Laken Riley's murder The investigation into Riley’s death began when a friend reported her missing on Feb. 22 after she didn’t return home from a run. Investigators soon after discovered her body in a forested area on the University of Georgia campus. Emergency responders tried to revive Riley but determined she died before officers discovered her body. The UGA Police Department arrested Ibarra in connection to Riley’s death the following day. Texas authorities on high alert for pre-Trump immigration ‘surge’ Prosecutors allege Ibarra beat Riley with an object and dragged her body to a secluded area off the jogging path to conceal her body. The prosecution is relying on hard forensic evidence — DNA, blood, fingerprints and video of Ibarra allegedly dumping bloody clothes 15 minutes after the murder — to make its case.

Manchin postelection: 'There is a need for a third party'	Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.) said the 2024 election shows there is a 'need for a third party.' Manchin joined NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt on Sunday for 'The Hill Sunday,' where he argued that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have a duopoly, and both of their business models right now are 'spewing hatred and division.' Cole says Republicans should ‘be working with’ Trump ‘to try and achieve his objectives’ 'They attack the other and make you more concerned or more frightened of the other. You better join my side and vice versa. That does not fix our problems, it does not keep our country the United States of America,' Manchin continued. 'I know there’s a need for a third party.' Manchin, a lifelong conservative Democrat, announced in May he had become an independent. He’d long toyed with the idea of a possible third-party bid for the White House but ruled it out. He is leaving Congress at the end of his term and did not say what he plans to do next. On Sunday, he said he’s interested in participating in or helping a third party. Manchin said he believes a ticket with a former Democrat and former Republican would be strong. 'I thought that would be very attractive in [these] most divisive times that we have,' he said. As Democrats point fingers about their brutal loss in the election and try to understand where they went so wrong, many are left thinking reform is needed within both parties, Manchin included. Ron Johnson says his ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks 'I don’t know what has to be one here but … the only way you’re going to change the Democrat and Republican Party is to challenge them,' he said.

Pension, perks await retiring US presidents	(NewsNation) — It’s nowhere near what the average corporate CEO earns, but the annual salary of the president of the United States may be the envy of most Americans: $400,000. That does not include lodging at the White House, travel on Air Force One, living allowances, entertainment, staff and much more. When a president leaves office, the checks and other benefits continue. Here’s a look at some of those benefits, and how they came about. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits What benefits do all former presidents get? The Former Presidents Acts of 1958 provides for a pension and several other benefits. All presidents receive money for office space, equipment, staff, travel, entertainment and supplies. If they were enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program for at least five years, former presidents get the same health benefits as other former government workers. Tom Cole: Republicans should ‘be working with’ Trump ‘to try and achieve his objectives’ Ironically, Jimmy Carter, America’s longest-living former president, was not eligible for that program since he was president for only four years and held no other federal government post. One-term president George H.W. Bush, who was vice president for eight years, as well as serving in Congress and as an ambassador, was eligible for health benefits but declined them. Former presidents are guaranteed a funeral with full honors and burial at Arlington National Cemetery. But only two presidents, John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft, are buried there. Pollster Ann Selzer steps aside in wake of huge Iowa poll miss Biden’s big pension payday When Joe Biden leaves the White House he will be eligible for the standard annual pension that any cabinet secretary receives: $246,424. But Biden also served eight years as vice president and spent 36 years as a U.S. senator from Delaware. All three pensions will total $413,000 a year, more than he made as president. The federal government places very few limits on multiple pensions, and only a few states ban or limit 'double dipping,' in which a government employee retires, collects a pension, and then returns to work in another government job. For example, Burlington County, New Jersey, passed a law banning county departments from hiring anyone who is collecting a 'taxpayer-funded retirement pension.' Cruise line offers 4-year journey to ‘skip forward’ in wake of US presidential election A president's other post-White House benefits Donald Trump has received more than $3 million in pension, office, printing, travel, and other allowances since his first term ended. From 2016 to 2024, Bill Clinton has received nearly $13 million in pension and other benefits from 2016 to 2024. George W. Bush has been paid just over $12 million in those same eight years. Barack Obama has received about $10.5 million. And Jimmy Carter, famous for his frugality, has received just over $5 million in that same time. Clinton, Bush and Obama may also receive pensions from other government positions they held. Ron Johnson says his ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks Has a president been denied or refused benefits? To date, no president has ever been denied a pension. The Former Presidents Act of 1958, which established the current pension and benefits system, denies benefits to a president who has been impeached and convicted by Congress. Richard Nixon avoided that fate by resigning. Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were impeached, but not convicted. Former presidents and their spouses may receive protection by the U.S. Secret Service for life. Eleven years after his resignation, Richard Nixon relinquished his protection – the only former president to do so. Progressive fault lines emerge after Harris’s loss Why do presidents receive pensions? A few years after leaving the White House in 1953, Harry S. Truman lobbied for financial support. Claiming dire financial straights, Truman wrote to House Speaker Sam Rayburn in 1957 saying he might have to turn to the private sector or some other source beneath the dignity of a former president. The upshot was the Former Presidents Act of 1958, which established the system of pension, allowances and office expenses in effect today. But in 2021, University of Colorado Law School professor Paul Campos debunked the Truman 'poverty' claim. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Campos claims that Truman misappropriated nearly all of the presidential expense account that Congress set up at the beginning of his second term. Truman also, according to Campos, did the thing he claimed that he wouldn’t do: exploit his status as a former president. 'By the time Congress passed the FPA in response to Truman’s various claims that he was at least teetering on the brink of potential financial distress, Truman’s net worth was, in relative economic terms, approximately $72 million in 2021 dollars,' Campos wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/president-pension-benefits/	2024-11-17T16:39:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-514952648.jpg?w=900
Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied long-range missiles f...	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine's northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine. The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction Sunday was notably restrained. 'Strikes are not made with words,' he said during his nightly video address. 'Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Zelenskyy's statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometres (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity before the winter. 'And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs, and appeasement,' Zelenskyy said. Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. News of Biden's decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit. Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a press conference that the body’s position is 'to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.' 'We want peace, we want fair peace,' Guterres said on Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development. The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few long-range strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. America is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia. ___ Long, Miller, Knickmeyer and Lee reported from Washington.

Cole says Republicans should 'be working with' Trump 'to try and ...	Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview Sunday that Republicans should 'be working with' President-elect Trump 'to try and achieve his objectives.' 'As we record this, the Republican majority in the 119th Congress looks like it'll be about the same size as it is in the current Congress — 222, maybe 221 — but … in the same space,' NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt said on 'The Hill Sunday.' Ron Johnson says ‘bias would be to vote’ for Trump’s picks 'Narrow majorities make for hard work,' Stirewalt continued. 'What do you tell your fellow Republicans about navigating these spaces?' 'Well, first of all, I tell them, you have your majority because of President Trump,' Cole said. 'Look, he’s won the popular vote … for the first time in 20 years any Republican’s been able to do that. And so, we ought to be working with him to try and achieve his objectives.' Republicans will have control of both the House and Senate next year, as well as the presidency. The election results mirror those of around four years ago in which the party that won the presidency, the Democrats, also won the House and Senate. 'I think it will be a little bit different this Congress, simply because we've got a little bit of discipline,' Cole said in his NewsNation interview. 'You know, President Trump is not shy about expressing his opinions. I think all of my members have a very healthy respect for him.' Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory The Republicans’ win in the House this year is a victory for House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has led the House GOP through tumultuous times for a little more than a year. Johnson has overseen rough patches for the GOP conference in the lower chamber, including the period following former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) ouster and fierce debates over foreign aid. Trump’s return to the White House, as well as having a friendlier neighbor in a GOP-controlled Senate, may make things easier for House Republicans, who have recently been dealing with Democrats leading the Senate and President Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/the-hill-sunday/tom-cole-republicans-trump-objectives/	2024-11-17T13:46:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23292638592566-e1697741916519.jpg?w=900

'Again, as a U.S. senator, I'm probably the minority view here; I don't particularly like being the human resource department of administration.' 'Again, the top picks, lifetime appointments, I have no problem with that, but you start getting down to … the lesser agencies here, or positions, it's really ridiculous what we do,' Johnson continued, adding that he’d 'much rather spend time on oversight and investigations.' Trump allies remain in legal peril despite his election victory President-elect Trump has selected a few controversial people for roles in his incoming administration, including right-wing firebrand and former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for attorney general. While Gaetz had been a strong supporter of the president-elect during his time in Congress, he also had some rough relationships within his party, notably having an ongoing public feud with ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Gaetz will most likely have to earn votes in the upper chamber to claim the role of attorney general, and although Republicans will have control of the Senate next year, GOP senators have expressed reservations about casting their votes for him. What has Project 2025 said since Trump’s win? The Florida Republican, who resigned from the House immediately after the announcement, has recently been the subject of a probe by the House Ethics Committee looking into whether he took part in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, alongside other allegations. He has denied allegations of wrongdoing, but Gaetz’s resignation essentially kills the probe by taking himself out of the panel’s jurisdiction.
