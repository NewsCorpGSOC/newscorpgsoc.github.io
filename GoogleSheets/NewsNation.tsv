Live: Group holds rally supporting Menendez brothers at DA's home	(NewsNation) — Family members of Erik and Lyle Menendez are holding a rally and news conference Thursday outside the home of Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. The Menendez brothers have been jailed for decades after being convicted of fatally shooting their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. During their trials, the brothers said the killings came after years of sexual abuse by their father. Both men were sentenced to life without parole. Their case has recently received renewed attention on social media, much of it from a generation too young to have heard of the incident before. Bryan Kohberger knife purchase, selfie emerge in Idaho killings case The previous L.A. County district attorney recommended resentencing. Factors behind the recommendation included additional evidence that appears to corroborate claims of sexual abuse and a better understanding of child sexual assault and how it affects victims. Since taking office, Hochman has moved to withdraw one of the pathways to resentencing. He has also said he would only support a resentencing, which would allow the brothers to be eligible for parole if they admit to what he says are numerous lies. Brothers, roommate of man convicted of killing Laken Riley to be deported Hochman has been hesitant to address the sexual abuse claims in detail and has only said it was not the defense that Lyle and Erik Menendez used at trial. One criterion he has laid out is for the brothers to admit they did not kill their parents in self-defense, something Hochman claims they lied about. In a news release, the Justice for Erik and Lyle Menendez Coalition, which is led by members of the family, said it would address the 'DA's relentless fixation on the past' and accused Hochman of silencing victims of sexual abuse.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/rally-menendez-brothers-district-attorney-home/	2025-03-20T07:57:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-1462340490-e1727990791773_d15fed.jpg?w=800

Homan, Noem head to Florida to tout Trump's immigration policies	(NewsNation) — The United States' so-called 'third border' is in the spotlight Thursday as two top Trump administration officials head to Florida to discuss immigration mitigation efforts. Revved-up border security and increased deportations have been a mainstay of President Donald Trump's second administration, with border czar Tom Homan and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at the helm of the efforts. Both are slated to speak in the Sunshine State on Thursday about the federal government's cooperation with state and local law enforcement to carry out Trump's policies. Trump’s 5 biggest moves on immigration so far Tom Homan, Ron DeSantis discuss immigration Homan, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf are slated to speak at 10 a.m. ET in Sarasota, Florida. Their conversations will likely be focused on Trump's mass deportation efforts and state-level involvement in removal efforts, which DeSantis has openly supported. In late February, DeSantis upped the stakes for crimes by immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, part of his plan to deter migrants from entering the state. DOJ again faces deadline to disclose deportation flight details The meeting comes as the Trump administration doubles down on its attempts to fly alleged gang members out of the country despite a judge's temporary block on the removals. 'We’ll let DOJ and the courts fight this out, and we’ll see where we go from there,' Homan said on 'CUOMO' on Wednesday. 'We’re going to keep targeting the worst of the worst.'

Trump will order a plan to shut down the US Education Department	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Thursday calling for the shutdown of the U.S. Education Department, according to a White House official, advancing a campaign promise to eliminate an agency that's been a longtime target of conservatives. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity before an announcement. Trump has derided the Department of Education as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology. However, finalizing its dismantling is likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979. A White House fact sheet said the order would direct Secretary Linda McMahon 'to take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure (of) the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.' Trump's Republican administration has already been gutting the agency. Its workforce is being slashed in half, and there have been deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation’s academic progress. Advocates for public schools said eliminating the department would leave children behind in an American education system that is fundamentally unequal. 'This isn’t fixing education. It’s making sure millions of children never get a fair shot. And we’re not about to let that happen without a fight,' the National Parents Union said in a statement. The White House has not spelled out formally which department functions could be handed off to other departments or eliminated altogether. At her confirmation hearing, McMahon said she would preserve core initiatives, including Title I money for low-income schools and Pell grants for low-income college students. The goal of the administration, she said, would be 'a better functioning Department of Education.' The department sends billions of dollars a year to schools and oversees $1.6 trillion in federal student loans. Currently, much of the agency’s work revolves around managing money — both its extensive student loan portfolio and a range of aid programs for colleges and school districts, from school meals to support for homeless students. The agency also plays a significant role in overseeing civil rights enforcement. Federal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets — roughly 14%. The money often supports supplemental programs for vulnerable students, such as the McKinney-Vento program for homeless students or Title I for low-income schools. Colleges and universities are more reliant on money from Washington, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition. Republicans have talked about closing the Education Department for decades, saying it wastes taxpayer money and inserts the federal government into decisions that should fall to states and schools. The idea has gained popularity recently as conservative parents’ groups demand more authority over their children’s schooling. In his platform, Trump promised to close the department 'and send it back to the states, where it belongs.' Trump has cast the department as a hotbed of 'radicals, zealots and Marxists' who overextend their reach through guidance and regulation. At the same time, Trump has leaned on the Education Department to promote elements of his agenda. He has used investigative powers of the Office for Civil Rights and the threat of withdrawing federal education funding to target schools and colleges that run afoul of his orders on transgender athletes participating in women's sports, pro-Palestinian activism and diversity programs. Even some of Trump’s allies have questioned his power to close the agency without action from Congress, and there are doubts about its political popularity. The House considered an amendment to close the agency in 2023, but 60 Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it. During Trump’s first term, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sought to dramatically reduce the agency’s budget and asked Congress to bundle all K-12 funding into block grants that give states more flexibility in how they spend federal money. It was rejected, with pushback from some Republicans. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

DOJ again faces deadline to disclose deportation flight details	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's Department of Justice once again faces a noon deadline to provide details about deportation flights that carried alleged gang members to El Salvador last weekend. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who ordered the flights to be halted, has requested information from the DOJ for three consecutive days in hopes of determining whether the administration 'deliberately flouted' his orders. The DOJ has twice maintained that it is not required to share flight details with the judge, and the deadline to provide information has shifted each day. White House condemns website publishing Tesla owner data Some of the 250 alleged Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members on those planes were removed under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law granting the government additional powers against noncitizens during wartime. Boasberg ordered a pause on the deportations and verbally said planes in the air should be turned around, but the White House claims the planes were over international waters at the time of the directives. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the standoff 'partisan' but clarified the administration will 'continue to comply with these court orders, we will continue to fight these battles in court.' The DOJ could potentially invoke the state-secrets privilege on Thursday to block the judge from receiving details about those flights. White House reacts to Judge Boasberg's orders Amid the back-and-forth, Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment. He called the judge 'crooked' for attempting to block deportation efforts. The DOJ has also asked a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., to remove Boasberg from the case. Trump's actions prompted a rare response from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. 'For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,' Roberts said. Border czar: We’ll obey court while deporting dangerous migrants Border czar Tom Homan on 'CUOMO' Wednesday said agents under his direction would indeed continue deportation flights and making arrests. But he said they’ll do so under other means — such as Title 8 under immigration law or 'another way' — as parties fight in court over the Alien Enemies Act. 'We’ll let DOJ and the courts fight this out, and we’ll see where we go from there,' Homan said. 'We’re going to keep targeting the worst of the worst.' It was a departure from his comments on 'Fox &amp; Friends' earlier this week, when he said: 'They’re not gonna stop us. We made a promise to the American people, President Trump has made a promise to the American people. I don’t care what the judges think, I don’t care what the left thinks. We’re coming.' Homan clarified that he was told 'every one' of the Venezuelan deportees has been verified as a member of the Tren de Aragua gang.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/deportation-flights-boasberg-trump-doj-deadline/	2025-03-20T03:37:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/scotus_062824jg02_w.jpg?w=900
Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 58 Palestinians, medics...	DEIR-AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 58 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, according to three hospitals. The strikes hit multiple homes in the middle of the night, killing men, women and children as they slept. Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war. It warned residents against using the main highway to enter or leave the north and said only passage to the south would be allowed on the coastal road. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January. Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. Israel blamed the renewed fighting on Hamas because the militant group rejected a new proposal that departed from their signed agreement. Some uncertainty on release of hostages following Israeli strikes The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has voiced full support for Israel. More than 400 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday alone, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. There have been no reports of Hamas firing rockets or carrying out other attacks. The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels early Thursday before it reached Israeli airspace, as air raid sirens and exploding interceptors were heard in Jerusalem. No injuries were reported. It was the second such attack since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebels earlier this week. One of the strikes on Gaza early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family’s home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza. Israel, Hamas being at odds caused deadly airstrikes: Retired major The strike killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of a month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents. 'Another tough night,' said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors in the rubble. 'The house collapsed over the people’s heads.' There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the latest strikes. The military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it is deeply embedded in residential areas. Israeli ground troops advance On Wednesday, Israeli ground troops advanced in Gaza for the first time since the ceasefire took hold in January, seizing part of a corridor separating the northern third of the territory from the south. The announcement about passage to the south indicated troops will soon retake full control over what is known as the Netzarim corridor, stretching from the border to the Mediterranean Sea. Israel, which has also cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, has vowed to intensify its operations until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 35 of whom are believed dead — and gives up control of the territory. The Trump administration, which took credit for brokering the ceasefire, says it fully supports Israel. Families of hostages in Gaza are terrified they won’t return after Israel resumes fighting Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement they reached in January after more than a year of mediation by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Hamas, which does not accept Israel's existence, says it is willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state. A ‘bloody night’ for hard-hit northern town The European Hospital in the southern city of Rafah said it received 36 bodies after the overnight strikes, mostly women and children. The Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis received seven and transferred four to European, which were included in its count. In northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital said it had received 19 bodies after strikes in the town of Beit Lahiya near the border. 'It was a bloody night for the people of Beit Lahiya,' said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s emergency service in northern Gaza, adding that rescuers were still searching the rubble from homes that were hit. 'The situation is catastrophic.' Witkoff says administration is ‘exploring’ alternatives for Gaza relocation Beit Lahiya was heavily destroyed and largely depopulated during the first phase of the war before January’s ceasefire. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners killed 17 people there, according to health officials. No end in sight to the 17-month war The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel's retaliatory offensive, among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and has caused vast destruction across the territory. Hundreds of thousands of people returned to their homes during the ceasefire, but many found only fields of rubble and the bombed-out shells of buildings.

Crucial JFK information still unreleased: Author James H. Johnsto...	NewsNation’s Ross Coulthart will host a special report, 'Declassified: The JFK Assassination,' this Saturday at 8p/7C. Find out how to watch at NewsNationNow.com. (NewsNation) — A missing memorandum documenting a conversation between President Lyndon B. Johnson and CIA Director John McCone days after President John F. Kennedy's assassination could contain crucial information that was never submitted to the National Archives, according to an author. James H. Johnston, author of 'Murder, Inc., the CIA under John F. Kennedy,' told NewsNation that the memorandum was written following a private hourlong conversation between Johnson and McCone at Johnson's residence six days after Kennedy's assassination. His comments come after the remaining classified files on the assassination of Kennedy were released Tuesday on the National Archives website. JFK files: Who is ‘Gary Underhill’ in assassination files? 'John McCone always wrote a memorandum for the record of any conversation he had with the president,' Johnston said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'And that memorandum was not given over to the National Archives and is not available.' JFK memo reportedly discussed Cuba and Castro after assassination According to Johnston, State Department historians viewed the document in 1997 and noted the conversation included discussion about Cuba and 'how they were going to get rid of Castro.' The full contents of this conversation remain unknown to the public. President John F.

Kennedy's motorcade speeding down a Dallas freeway to the hospital after he was fatally wounded on Nov. 22, 1963. (RR Auction via AP, File) Gerald Posner, investigative journalist and author of 'Case Closed, Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,' acknowledged the document might exist but questioned its relevance to understanding the assassination. 'If there was a large conspiracy to kill the president, the evidence of it is not going to be found in the release of files from the National Archives,' Posner said, suggesting any truly incriminating documents would have been retained or destroyed rather than archived. What JFK files have been released, and what have we learned? Both authors discussed Lee Harvey Oswald's visit to Mexico City six weeks before the assassination, where he visited Soviet and Cuban embassies. Posner questioned why the CIA, which had monitored Oswald since his 1959 defection to the Soviet Union, didn't alert the FBI about his concerning behavior following this trip. Johnston noted that during this Mexico City visit, Oswald reportedly met with a KGB operative known for assassination operations, though he didn't suggest this directly connected Oswald to Kennedy's assassination.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/vargasreports/crucial-jfk-unreleased-james-h-johnston/	2025-03-19T20:02:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP24326581083236.jpg?w=900
Trump, AG Bondi call Tesla protests 'domestic terrorism': Are the...	(NewsNation) — U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday condemned recent violent attacks on Tesla property, adding the Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators. 'The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism,' Bondi said in a statement. President Donald Trump, when asked during a Fox News interview if setting a Tesla on fire was an act of domestic terrorism, said, 'I think so.' How are Ivy League schools using $6B in federal funding? Activists have staged protests to voice anger over Tesla CEO Elon Musk's role in sweeping cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts related to humanitarian programs since President Donald Trump took office Jan. 20. What is domestic terrorism? The FBI classifies domestic terrorism as 'Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.' Schumer defiant as first Dem lawmaker calls for new leadership The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's definition of domestic terrorism, however, focuses more on 'human life,' as it defines domestic terrorism as 'Activities that involve acts dangerous to human life, intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence government policy, or affect government conduct, and occur primarily within the U.S.' A former CIA agent's opinion? NewsNation national security contributor and former CIA officer Tracy Walder said she believes that the latest attacks against Tesla facilities are '100%' an act of domestic terrorism. '(The protesters) are furthering a political ideology or a political goal,' said Walder. 'But here’s the problem that I want to lay out: There are no federal domestic terrorism charging statutes. So no one can be charged with domestic terrorism … we’ve left that up to the states — some states have them, some states do not.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/trump-ag-bondi-tesla-protests/	2025-03-19T16:09:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2205773666.jpg?w=900
How are Ivy League schools using $6B in federal funding?	(NewsNation) — The country’s eight prestigious Ivy League colleges and universities took in more than $6 billion in federal funding in fiscal year 2023, but how those institutions of higher education are using tax dollars has raised eyebrows over the use of public money. Ivy League schools like Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania have been targeted by President Donald Trump recently. Trump withheld $175 million in federal money from UPenn over its policy of allowing transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports. Trump also canceled $400 million in federal grants and contracts from Columbia after the White House said the university failed to protect Jewish students. Thousands sue Maryland agencies over alleged child sexual abuse However, Trump’s actions come as a NewsNation probe into Ivy League funding found that the eight Ivy League schools are sitting on more than $185 billion in endowment money, including $50 billion at Harvard and $41 billion at Yale. Yet NewsNation’s analysis of the school’s audited financial statements shows that the majority of public funding given to Ivy League schools goes to indirect recovery costs, which are also considered on-campus overhead. For instance, Harvard takes approximately 69% of the top of federal research grants for the on-campus overhead, while Yale takes about 67.5%, followed by Columbia (64.5%) and Cornell and Dartmouth (64%). 'The grants are designed to do good things, and many of them do,' Benjamin Ginsberg, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, told NewsNation. 'But universities have tried to make a little bit of money on those activities, and so they charge overhead on federal research dollars, and that money is not spent on the nominal activity for which the grant is given.' Schumer defiant as first Dem lawmaker calls for new leadership When adjusted, of the approximate $820 million Harvard took in for research, only about $248 million went for research, NewsNation found. At Columbia, which received $1.5 billion in research grants, only about $400 million was devoted to research after it took 64.5% for overhead. 'It doesn’t make sense,' Ginsberg told NewsNation, adding that rather than spending tax dollars on building improvements and repairs, tax dollars are being spent on hiring more bureaucrats. However, as Trump has held back federal funding, the National Institutes of Health has recently installed a 15% cap on federal research funding that the Ivy League schools receive, meaning that even deeper cuts will be taken in tax dollars being sent to the institutions. Also, Ivy League universities are among more than 50 higher education institutions being investigated for their continued diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Scott Walter, the president of Capital Research Center, told NewsNation that Trump is doing what is right in starting conversations about how universities like Columbia are funded and how the respective schools are using those dollars. 'Nobody should be able to feed at the federal trough without having to justify themselves without Americans understanding what they're getting from the rest of us,' Walter said. 'This is absolutely the conversation we need to be having. Some of that money will get justified, and some of it will not.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/ivy-league-schools-6b-funding/	2025-03-19T14:07:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e1d652cfd2b2.34656485.jpeg?w=900
How much do you need to make to be in the top 1%?	(NewsNation) — It takes about $800,000 to be in the top 1% of earners in the U.S., but you could be a one-percenter in your state making less. West Virginia has the lowest threshold to be a 1% earner at $420,453, according to a 2024 study by personal finance website SmartAsset. On the other hand, it takes $1.21 million to be among the top 1% in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, to be in the top 5% of American earners, you'll need to earn at least $290,185 a year, SmartAsset found. To put that in perspective, the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau found the median household income in 2023 was $80,610 a year. Meet the world's newest wealth class: 'Superbillionaire' How much do you have to make to be in the top 1%? The SmartAsset study found it takes $787,712 to be in the top 1% of earners. That report was based on 2021 IRS tax return data for individual filers and then adjusted to June 2024 dollars. A separate analysis of Social Security wage data by the Economic Policy Institute found the top 1% of earners in 2023 had an average annual wage of $794,129. That works out to more than $66,000 a month, or about $15,200 per week, to be in the top 1% of earners in the U.S. For the ultra-wealthy, the top 0.1%, average earnings were more than $2.8 million in 2023, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That number has surged 350% since 1979, while the average annual wage for the bottom 90% has grown about 44% over the same period. Does the top 1% vary from state to state? You'll need to make about $800,000 to be in the top 1% of earners nationally, but you could earn considerably less and reach that status in your state. West Virginia has the lowest threshold to be a 1% earner: $420,453 annually, according to SmartAsset. Mississippi ranks second, where residents have to make $440,744 to be in the top 1% of earners. New Mexico has the third lowest threshold at $476,196. States with the lowest income threshold to be in the top 1% of earners, according to SmartAsset: West Virginia ($420,453) Mississippi ($440,744) New Mexico ($476,196) Kentucky ($513,865) Arkansas ($531,692) On the other hand, residents in places like Washington, D.C. ($1.21 million), Connecticut ($1.15 million) and Massachusetts ($1.11 million) have to make more than the national average to be one-percenters in their region. The net worth of richest Congress members In California, it takes more than $1.03 million to be in the top 1% of earners. Over 177,000 tax returns in The Golden State hit that threshold in 2021. SmartAsset ranked states based on the minimum pre-tax income needed to be considered a top 1% earner. States with the highest income threshold to be in the top 1% of earners, according to SmartAsset: Connecticut ($1,152,254) Massachusetts ($1,113,662) California ($1,035,673) Washington ($989,649) New Jersey ($975,645) How many Americans are in the top 1% of earners? Only 1.49 million Americans, a small fraction of taxpayers, reported enough income to crack the top 1% in 2021, according to SmartAsset. California, the most populous state, had the most taxpayers (177,645) in the top 1% nationally, followed by Texas (126,128) and Florida (101,940). Wyoming, the least populous state in the country, had the fewest taxpayers (2,616) in the top 1%, followed by Vermont (3,107) and Alaska (3,231). How much do you need to make to be in the top 5%? In 2023, the top 5% of earners had an average annual wage of $352,773, according to the Economic Policy Institute. SmartAsset's analysis found the top 5% income threshold was a bit lower, at $290,185 annually. That's just over the typical salary for high-earning professions like doctors and pilots. Again, the top 5% varies widely depending on where you live. Washington, D.C., residents need to make $424,592 to be among the top 5% of earners. Massachusetts leads all states, with earners having to make $393,160 a year to be in the top 5%, according to SmartAsset. On the other hand, Mississippi and West Virginia residents are in the top 5% if they make roughly $193,000 a year. What about the wealthiest 1%? Income and net worth are both ways to measure financial security, but they are not the same. Income is the money you bring in over a certain period, like your salary, dividends from investments or interest from a savings account. Net worth, meanwhile, is a measure of wealth and is the value of all assets minus any outstanding debt. 1% of Americans own 30% of country's wealth The minimum net worth of the top 1% of U.S. households is roughly $13.7 million as of 2023, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by DQYDJ, a personal finance site. To join the top 0.1%, you'll need a net worth of nearly $62 million. Altogether, the wealthiest 1% of American households held a record $49.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. That's more than 30% of the total wealth held by all U.S. households. To put that in perspective: The wealthiest 1% can afford to buy nearly every home in America, according to a recent Redfin analysis. The superwealthy, top 0.1%, control about 14% of all the wealth held by American households, up from 9% in 1990, Fed data shows.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/how-much-to-make-top-1-percent/	2025-03-19T13:45:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-1626996551.jpg?w=900
Democrats targeting toss-up districts in town hall tour	(NewsNation) — As Democrats try to work their way out of the political wilderness and find a message that resonates with voters, some marquee names in the Democratic Party are holding town halls with Americans around the country. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — the former candidate for vice president — held three town halls in the past week in Des Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Starting Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will join Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on his 'Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here' tour in Nevada, Arizona and Colorado. The press release from the Sanders team says the tour is targeting districts narrowly won by Republicans in 2024, 'serving as a pressure campaign to force vulnerable congresspeople to vote against any cuts to Medicaid, housing, nutrition, education and other basic needs to pay for more tax breaks for the richest people in this country.' These events, and others being held by Democrats, aim to hone the party’s message after losing the White House, Senate and House in November. Fetterman claps back at Ocasio-Cortez on government funding vote They also hope to prove that they’re actively listening to voters and highlight that many Republican representatives have canceled town halls after facing voters upset at the chaos they’ve experienced since President Donald Trump began his second term. Walz said his goal is to respond to the 'primal scream of ‘God dang it, do something’' that he was hearing. At Tuesday’s town hall in Wisconsin, he made digs at Elon Musk, Trump, Republicans who were not holding town halls as well as the Democratic Party. Walz noted many times that Democrats, including himself, did not do a good job of explaining why their programs and policies were better and that people didn't think Democrats were fighting for them. 'When can an unelected South African nepo baby be able to cut our programs? Again, I will own this. Ninety million people stayed home because they didn't think there'd be any difference. ... That responsibility falls back on me, and it falls on us to define who we are,' said Walz. Trump will run and win again in 2028: Steve Bannon The governor also acknowledged that while Democrats need to spread their message everywhere, it also needs to be simpler. Though he disagreed with Trump’s methods, he conceded they were effective. The Trump campaign 'made it simple...the contrast...‘Kamala's for they/them, Trump is for you.’ Demonizing a group of people, but the simplicity was just brutal,' said Walz. Walz asked the audience what Democratic action in the age of Trump looks like to them. One suggestion was for Senate Democrats to mimic what GOP Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., did under former Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, which was to try and slow or even stop the White House’s agenda from moving forward. There was also a call for Democrats to say what they’ll do differently, including fighting for universal health care and labor unions, fighting against climate change and getting money and Musk out of politics. At the Wisconsin event, Walz also encouraged attendees to get involved in the competitive race for state Supreme Court taking place on April 4. He expressed disgust that Elon Musk had donated millions of dollars to try to defeat the candidate supported by Democrats.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democrats-toss-up-districts-town-hall-tour/	2025-03-19T12:59:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Tim-Walz_StarTribune_AP-e1733493722692.png?w=800
Tesla vandalism is 'nothing short of domestic terrorism': AG Bond...	(NewsNation) — U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday condemned recent arson attacks and vandalism on Tesla property, adding the Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators. 'The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism,' Bondi said in a statement. 'We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.' While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. Tesla attacks escalate nationwide A 26-year-old woman appeared in court Wednesday after allegedly vandalizing a newly constructed Tesla service center in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, on March 14. Erin L. White, 27, was taken into custody and charged with felony criminal damage to property and criminal trespass. Border wall work resumes to combat crossings, cartels She was released on her own recognizance, and a Cook County judge ordered her to stay away from Tesla properties. In Las Vegas, several Teslas at a dealership were targeted. Witnesses reported seeing someone dressed in black setting the electric vehicles on fire, and when police arrived, the word 'resist' was spray-painted on the building. Mass protests on the West Coast outside Tesla dealerships have turned violent, with peaceful demonstrations accompanied by acts of vandalism. One dealership had to remove spray-painted swastikas and profanity from its vehicles. In Portland, police said someone fired seven bullets into three Teslas at a dealership, while a nearby dealership was targeted by a hooded figure who threw Molotov cocktails at the EVs. Musk: ‘They basically wanna kill me because I’m stopping their fraud’ Activists have staged so-called Tesla Takedown protests to voice displeasure over Tesla CEO Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency role in cutting the federal workforce and canceling contracts related to humanitarian programs since President Donald Trump took office January 20. Elon Musk suggests his life in danger over DOGE cuts Musk attempted to validate his efforts and said his life was in danger over his involvement in the Trump administration. 'They basically want to kill me because I’m stopping their fraud,' he told Fox News’s Sean Hannity. 'And they want to hurt Tesla because we’re stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government. And, well, I guess they’re bad people. Bad people do bad things.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/tesla-vandalism-domestic-terrorism-pam-bondi/	2025-03-19T11:27:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25069708837560.jpg?w=900
What JFK files have been released, and what have we learned?	(NewsNation) — Following up on a promise from President Donald Trump, the National Archives released thousands of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Many of the documents are handwritten or blurred due to age and difficult to search, so historians and journalists are still pouring through them to uncover new details, but here is what is known so far. The White House said Tuesday that more documents would be released Wednesday. JFK files don’t highlight conspiracy theories: Ross Coulthart What files were released? Exactly what information is new and what is old is difficult to determine. Investigative journalist Gerald Posner told NewsNation the release was a document dump and a 'master class' in how not to release documents. 'They don't tell you what's new in them,' he said. The only way to clearly tell what information is new is to compare the documents to older versions previously released by the National Archives, a laborious process. The documents also were not classified or sorted in any way, so it could take days to determine what new information was actually released. Was there a 'smoking gun?' So far, there hasn't been any 'smoking gun' that would validate decadesold conspiracies about the assassination, but independent journalist Jefferson Morely told NewsNation the files don't debunk conspiracies either. NTSB releases preliminary report on near-miss at Midway Airport 'They undermine the official story that one man alone killed the president for no reason,' Morely said. NewsNation contributor Ross Coulthart also notes that a document clearly laying out a planned conspiracy is unlikely to exist, and people would be unlikely to admit in no uncertain terms to taking part in one. 'Just because it's not written down on paper doesn't mean the evidence doesn't point to more than one shooter,' Coulthart said. What are people looking for in the files? The main conspiracy theories around the Kennedy assassination have centered around the identity or number of the shooters and the motivation behind the shooting. Many theorize that Lee Harvey Oswald was not the shooter and was set up or that he was one of multiple shooters and will be searching for evidence of that in the files. People will also be looking for references to the CIA, FBI, Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Mafia, which have all been accused of being behind the assassination, either individually or as part of a larger conspiracy. Dramatic car chase in Florida ends in discovery of missing Texas teen Many are also interested in how much intelligence the U.S. or other countries, including Mexico, had on Oswald prior to the shooting. What has been learned so far? Coulthart noted the documents also provide a glimpse into the bigger picture of Cold War clandestine actions, including the U.S. being behind the deaths of leaders who were deemed a threat to America's goal of stopping communism. Another revelation was the number of CIA agents placed overseas as State Department employees, said to be about 1,500. The CIA has historically used State Department employment as a cover for agents, but a 1961 memo to Kennedy revealed the number was beginning to be seen as a threat to the ability of the agency to control its own policy. Morely also noted that the documents suggest that CIA surveillance of Oswald prior to the assassination was more extensive than previously known. Were there redactions? Announcing the release of the documents, Trump promised no redactions, but that does not appear to have been true. Trump will run and win again in 2028: Steve Bannon Posner noted that some redactions include Social Security numbers for still-living individuals. There are also redactions related to files on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. because they are related to information that was sealed by a judge for 50 years. Despite executive orders to release information, those files cannot be made public for another two years. Will there be more documents? All the files released have come from the National Archives. A question remains on if or how files from other agencies, including the CIA and FBI, would be made public. Following Trump's executive order, the FBI conducted a review and found 2,400 unreleased records relating to the JFK assassination. Those were not included in Tuesday's drop, and there has been no information on if or when they could be released. Trump defends deportation flights as judge calls for more information In addition to the Kennedy files, Trump also promised the release of files related to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. A release date for those files has not yet been announced. Will the files shift trust in government? The files are being released in the name of transparency, but Posner said he doubts they will satisfy those who think the government is hiding something. The fact that information has been kept secret for so many decades despite public questions about the official narrative may lead people to think incriminating files are still being obscured, he told NewsNation. 'The average person thinks they must have been hiding something to keep them hidden for so long,' Posner said. 'So people think maybe they're destroyed or kept elsewhere in government.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jfk-files-what-learned/	2025-03-19T11:04:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/679402f77b7588.00696267.jpeg?w=900
Schumer defiant as first Dem lawmaker calls for new leadership	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Maryland Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey suggested that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., step down from leadership during a raucous town hall Tuesday following Schumer’s vote in support of a GOP government funding measure last week. 'I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he had a great, long-standing career,' Ivey told constituents at a forum in his district. 'But I’m afraid it may be time for Senate Democrats to choose a new leader.' Ivey is the latest Democrat to hit Schumer over voting for a House GOP-drafted funding measure last week that would keep the government open through September. He is, however, the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call for new Senate leadership in the party. Trump defends deportation flights as judge calls for more information Last week, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., shaded Schumer over the vote in a statement, calling on Democrats 'to fight back for a better way.' Schumer is postponing several scheduled events this week to promote his new book after some liberal groups had planned to stage protests. Risa Heller, a representative for Schumer’s book, said the tour would be rescheduled 'due to security concerns.' Appearances in Baltimore, D.C. and other cities have already been postponed. Despite avoiding public appearances, Schumer remains a prominent fixture on television, making several cable news appearances and a sit-down with 'The View.' Schumer defended his vote and his spot atop the Senate Democratic caucus, maintaining Tuesday that he has no plans of stepping aside anytime soon. Schumer was defiant when pressed about the vote and his standing, saying that he knew he’d take flak but still thought he made the right decision. Musk: ‘They basically wanna kill me because I’m stopping their fraud’ 'We would have had half the federal government we have right now,' Schumer told 'CBS Mornings,' pointing to what he believed would be a hollowing out during a shutdown. 'I thought I did the thing a leader should do. Even when people don’t see the danger around the curve, my job was to alert people to it, and I knew I’d get some bullets.' 'I’m the best leader for the Senate,' Schumer continued. 'I am the best at winning Senate seats. I’ve done it in 2005. Just in 2020, no one thought we’d take back the Senate. Under my leadership, we took it.' The Democrats lost control of the Senate in 2024. When pressed by host Gayle King if he had plans of stepping aside, Schumer shot them down. 'No, no,' he said. 'We’re moving forward. Hakeem and I have a plan,' he added, referring to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.

Border wall work resumes to combat crossings, cartels	(NewsNation) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection has awarded a $70.2 million contract to close critical gaps in the border wall in the Rio Grande Valley sector of Texas. The gaps have been a traditional passageway for migrants entering the United States illegally and for Mexican cartels to smuggle illicit drugs into the country. Construction on the border wall resumed with President Donald Trump back in the White House after work was halted during the Biden administration. The contract was the first awarded for wall construction during Trump's second term and is part of a renewed effort by Trump to secure the nation's southern border. Crews are installing six-foot guardrails with 18-foot steel panels in Hidalgo County, Texas as part of the contract. CBP officials say that the construction will help agents prevent migrants from entering the country, but will also slow the flow of drugs and humans being smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border. El Paso leads nation in migrant encounters Officials say that migrants and the cartels were taking advantage of open gaps in the wall after construction was stopped by former President Joe Biden. Biden issued an executive order that stopped construction of the border wall, which started during Trump’s first term in office. In 2023, however, the Biden administration announced they had waived 26 federal laws in Texas to allow wall construction to continue, The Associated Press reported. Work on the wall resumed in McAllen, Texas, under Biden’s executive power after 245,000 illegal border entries took place during Fiscal Year 2023. The $70.28 million contract was recently awarded to Granite Construction to complete a seven-mile stretch of the wall in Hidalgo County as Trump has prioritized closing the southern border to illegal crossings. The funding for the contract comes from CBP's Fiscal Year 2021 budget after contracts for border wall construction were canceled by the Biden administration. Border officials announced that 28,654 encounters took place along the southern border between migrants and border officials in February, compared to 81,528 in January. In the Rio Grande Valley sector, which has been a hotspot for migrant crossings since 2013, border encounters plummeted from 5,964 in January to 1,285 in February, according to CBP data. The resumed border wall construction sends a clear message to migrants looking to enter the country illegally and to cartels, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told NewsNation. Trump defends deportation flights as judge calls for more information 'They recognize that we’re enforcing our federal laws (and) that we’re not letting people just walk across the border anymore,' Noem said in an exclusive interview with NewsNation’s Ali Bradley. 'You can see we mean business. We are building the wall, we are securing our borders and we’re not going to allow this illegal activity to continue.' Similar work on the border wall is being done in Arizona. including in Nogales, which is another known hotspot for migrant crossings and cartel smuggling operations. Crews are working to close open gaps in the wall. In that sector, border encounters dropped by 89% in a year, plummeting from 3,923 border encounters in February 2024 to just 413 last month. Noem said in a recent social media post that seven miles of the wall would be built where the structure ends. Border officials told NewsNation that wall construction has not yet resumed in the Del Rio sector of Texas, where migrant encounters have dropped so significantly under Trump that it has not been made a priority at this time.

JFK files don't highlight conspiracy theories: Ross Coulthart	NewsNation’s Ross Coulthart will host a special report, 'Declassified: The JFK Assassination,' this Saturday at 8p/7C. Find out how to watch at NewsNationNow.com. (NewsNation) — Though NewsNation's Ross Coulthart thinks the newly-released John F. Kennedy files are a 'heck of a read,' he found that there's little new information regarding conspiracies around the president's 1963 assassination. 'Frankly, the biggest shock in the files to me so far is why on earth they kept the secret all these years and allowed this notion of conspiracy to fester,' the NewsNation special correspondent and investigative journalist said. Around 63,000 pages were released Tuesday, though it's unclear which documents are new and which were simply rereleased, this time unredacted. Here are the remaining JFK assassination files The documents have yielded little new information so far. 'I still do think there was a conspiracy, by the way. I just don't think we're going to find it in the files,' Coulthart said. He told 'Morning in America' that theories — like one that purports there were multiple shooters involved — will continue to garner support, whether there is official documentation or not. 'Evidence is beginning to make it very clear that there were multiple shooters, probably three shooters,' Coulthart said. 'I think eventually that's going to have to be admitted. It's just not going to come out of this release of these files.' JFK assassination files released JFK was killed on Nov. 22, 1963, on a visit to Dallas, when his motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown and shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer. A year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, which President Lyndon B. Johnson established to investigate, concluded that Oswald acted alone and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. Read the JFK files.

Russia continues to strike Ukraine despite limited ceasefire	(NewsNation) — Sirens rang out in Ukraine overnight, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging the world to turn up the pressure on Russia — just hours after President Vladimir Putin agreed to a limited ceasefire during a call with President Donald Trump. During Tuesday's call, Putin agreed to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure but stopped short of backing a 30-day pause in fighting that the Trump administration is pressing for. Trump call with Putin didn’t go far enough: Ex-ambassador The White House described the limited ceasefire as the first step in a 'movement to peace' that it hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting. But there was no indication that Putin has backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv. Shortly after the call ended, Zelenskyy said Russian drones hit key infrastructure in Ukraine. Air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions in the city, and local officials urged people to seek shelter. Trump's call with Putin During the call with Trump, Putin reiterated his demand for an end to foreign military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. Trump, however, denied the subject came up during an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. 'We didn’t talk about aid,' Trump said. 'We didn’t talk about aid at all.' One of the broader objectives Trump has acknowledged is strengthening bilateral ties between the United States and Russia, but he also said he's prepared to be tough on the Kremlin to get a peace deal. Talks between the U.S. and Russia are expected to continue in Saudi Arabia over the weekend. Russia isn't easing military pressure on Ukraine Meanwhile, Russia is not easing its military pressure on Ukraine. Sources on the ground told NewsNation they heard anti-air defense systems firing and sirens ringing out across Kyiv throughout the night. Zelenskyy confirmed a drone attack targeting Kyiv, and officials said power plants were targeted. Russia said a fire sparked at one of its oil depots during a counterattack by Ukraine. Russia has said it wants Ukraine to pull back its troops from four regions that Moscow has annexed but never fully captured, renounce any prospect of joining the NATO military alliance and sharply cut its army. Zelenskyy told reporters Ukraine is open to any proposals that lead to sustainable and just peace but stressed the need for full transparency in discussions. He said he's seeking more details on Putin and Trump's agreement but rejected Putin's demand for halting military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine, warning that such a move would weaken Ukraine.

Trump defends deportation flights as judge calls for more informa...	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration's deportation flights to El Salvador remain at the center of a federal government showdown. District Judge James E. Boasberg has once again set a noon deadline for more information on the flights he tried to block, which transported more than 250 alleged Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members over the weekend. Here are the remaining JFK assassination files The judge wants to know, down to the minute, when the planes took off, when they hit international airspace, when they landed, when deportees were transferred out of U.S. custody and just how many of them were actually deported using the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg is looking to pinpoint if the Trump administration knowingly ignored his orders to halt the flights, which the American Civil Liberties Union argues occurred. Overnight, President Donald Trump on social media defended the flights: 'If a President doesn't have the right to throw murderers, and other criminals, out of our Country because a Radical Left Lunatic Judge wants to assume the role of President, then our Country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!' Deportation flight judge's first information request Trump's Justice Department pushed back on Boasberg's information order Tuesday, maintaining 'there is no justification to order the provision of additional information' regarding the flights 'and that doing so would be inappropriate.' The DOJ said sharing that information would reveal sensitive national security and foreign relations information. Trump fires both Democratic commissioners at FTC Some details did emerge from Tuesday's request, however. A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official revealed a third flight took off after Boasberg's written order. The official said that flight only had deportees with Title 8 final removal orders, not alleged gang members. For that reason, the agency argues the plane didn't have to turn around. ICE also said there are at least another 250 people in the Venezuelan gang who could end up in their custody — and if they do, they too could be deported. Chief justice rebukes Trump's call to impeach Judge Boasberg The back-and-forth prompted Trump to call for Boasberg's impeachment. The DOJ has also asked the D.C. Federal Appeals Court to remove Boasberg from the case. U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public statement Tuesday in response to Trump’s directive. 'For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,' Roberts said. Judge blocks implementation of Trump’s transgender military ban It would take a two-thirds vote from the Senate to remove a judge — which the Republican Party does not have. Boasberg, confirmed in 2011 with a 96-0 vote, has resolved secret grand jury disputes that arose during the special counsel investigations into Trump, overseen improvements after the Trump-Russia investigation into how the DOJ conducts national security surveillance and handled his share of sentencings for rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Trump will run and win again in 2028: Steve Bannon	(NewsNation) — Steve Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist, said in an interview on NewsNation that he and others are working on ways for President Donald Trump to seek a third term despite constitutional term limits. 'We're working on it. I think we'll have a couple of alternatives,' Bannon told NewsNation's 'CUOMO' when asked how Trump could overcome term limits. 'We'll see what the definition of term limit is.' JFK assassination files released Bannon expressed confidence in this effort, comparing it to Trump's 2024 comeback. 'I'm a firm believer that President Trump will run and win again in 2028,' Bannon said. 'We've had greater long shots than Trump 2028.' He added that they're 'not prepared to talk about it publicly, but in a couple of months, I think we will be.' Steve Bannon says he is a 'huge believer in democracy' When pressed on whether he was suggesting revolution or overthrow, Bannon rejected that characterization, describing himself as a 'huge believer in democracy' while claiming the country is experiencing a '1932-type realignment' comparable to the FDR era. Cuomo: Does MAGA care about checks and balances? 'We're in the middle of a 1932-type realignment if we can continue to have populist nationalist policies,' Bannon said. 'We have African-Americans coming to our side. We have Hispanics coming to our side.' He described the current administration's actions as a 'revolution of common sense to deconstruct the administrative state' and claimed anti-democratic forces are working through the courts to 'obstruct a sitting president' from fulfilling his executive mandate. Steve Bannon defends Elon Musk's role despite differences Bannon defended Elon Musk's role in implementing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. He acknowledged having 'huge, almost unbridgeable differences' with Musk on issues including 'transhumanism and technology and visas and immigration,' but praised Musk's support for their efforts. 'He backed our play,' Bannon said, mentioning Musk contributed financially to their voter outreach and supported the merger of 'Bobby Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again with MAGA.' Bannon described Musk's DOGE initiative as deploying 'shock troops' in a 'trauma-inducing effort into the administrative state' that, while 'not pretty,' has been 'pretty effective.' Steve Bannon calls out federal judges for blocking Trump's orders Bannon criticized federal judges who have blocked administration policies, particularly regarding immigration enforcement, calling for their impeachment. James Carville: 'I don't have a good image of the Democratic Party' 'More of these radical, neo-Marxist judges that are working in coordination ought to be impeached,' Bannon said, referring specifically to a judge who halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump invoked. He accused the judge of 'stepping into President Trump's role' as commander-in-chief and 'making command decisions that a military commander would make.' When questioned on how patriotism aligns with attacking government institutions, Bannon responded that reforming institutions was central to Trump's mandate. Trump defends deportation flights as judge calls for more information 'The American people understand that our institutions have to be either purged or they have to be reformed,' Bannon said, 'everything from the Justice Department to the FBI to the intelligence community to the Pentagon, across the board.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/steve-bannon-trump-2028/	2025-03-18T18:48:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-1-7.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Illegal crossings in the Del Rio, Texas, sector have dropped to 25 a day across more than 100 miles, but new consequences will be placed on individuals using 'carpet shoes' to evade the Border Patrol. Anyone who is trying to cross the border illegally using the shoes, which make it drastically harder to trace footprints, will face criminal charges. Most 'carpet shoes' are obtained through cartels in Mexico, often coming with a camouflaged outfit. The Border Patrol is hoping criminal charges will deter others from using the evasion tactic. Individuals using 'carpet shoes' are subject to being prosecuted in the Del Rio sector with up to two years' imprisonment. Chief justice rebukes Trump’s call to impeach judge over deportations The acting chief patrol agent of the Del Rio sector, Milton Moreno, told NewsNation that the Border Patrol wants zero crossings across the river and has sent apprehended migrants hundreds of miles away to avoid swift reentry attempts. 'Not only are we doing our job, but we're delivering consequences,' Moreno said. 'Word carries fast, and they know if they come in, they're going to get apprehended and sent back to their country.' Moreno also told NewsNation that Mexico is assisting with stopping people on its side of the border. He added migrants that are repatriated on the southern side of the border simply don't have the finances to attempt reentry and thus return home. As the Trump administration eyes zero illegal crossings, seven more miles of border wall has been approved, with construction to begin in the Rio Grande Valley sector.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartel-carpet-shoes-migrants/	2025-03-18T12:51:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/35A841F725AD0D8A32AFEF2BC2FA584E.jpg?w=900
NASA atronauts return after 9 months: What happens to the human b...	(NewsNation) — Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, as well as two other NASA astronauts, have left the International Space Station after being stuck for nine months after a Boeing test flight. The return trip will take around 17 hours, and the crew plans on landing in the splashdown zone in Florida if weather allows. Republicans unveil bill relocating NASA headquarters to Florida Wilmore and Williams have been in space since June 2024, so returning to Earth will take a toll on the astronauts' bodies. What happens to a human's muscles and bones in space? An astronaut's muscle and bone mass can diminish due to the lack of gravity in space. According to the BBC, the muscles that help maintain posture are affected the most because the muscles don't have to work as hard in space. The Canadian Medical Association Journal reported that muscle mass can fall by nearly 20% in two weeks and by 30% on three-to-six-month missions. Astronauts' skeletons can also be affected without Earth's gravity. Bones can start to demineralize and lose their strength, according to the BBC. For every month an astronaut is in space, they can lose 1% to 2% of their bone mass. This can make it more likely for astronauts to have bone fractures and it can take longer for injuries to heal.

(NASA via AP, File)FILE - This image made from a NASA live stream shows NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore during a press conference from the International Space Station on Friday, Sept. 13, 2024. (NASA via AP, File) The BBC reported that it can take up to four years for the bone mass to return to normal after an astronaut returns to Earth. To help with this, astronauts will do 2.5 hours of exercise per day and training while on the ISS. That training and exercise can include squats, deadlifts, and row and bench presses. According to the BBC, astronauts also take diet supplements to keep their bones healthy. However, one study showed that this training and exercise wasn't enough to prevent all losses in muscle function and size. Do humans lose weight in space? It is actually quite the opposite. Since human bodies float around in space, keeping a healthy weight can be challenging. According to NASA, to help combat this, the agency ensures astronauts have access to many nutritious foods. ‘Can be pretty depressing’: Formerly stuck astronaut on how he persevered Scott Kelly, a NASA astronaut who was onboard the ISS for 340 days, lost 7% of his body mass while in space, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. How is a human's eyesight affected by space travel? According to NASA, in space, blood can accumulate in the head more than normal. This can cause some fluids to pool at the back of the eye and near the optic nerve. This can cause vision changes, like decreased sharpness and structural changes. This can happen after only two weeks in space, and the risk increases as time goes on. Some of these changes will reverse, but others will be permanent, according to NASA. Galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles could also cause problems with an astronaut's eyes. On Earth, we are protected, but in space, cosmic rays and solar particles can hit an astronaut's retina and optical nerves. How does a human's skin react to being in space? An astronaut's skin can also be affected by prolonged space travel. According to Kelly, his skin was more sensitive and he developed a rash around six days after returning from space. The BBC reported that researchers have speculated this could be due to the lack of skin stimulation during space missions. NASA’s newest space telescope blasts off to map millions of galaxies Once the Starliner astronauts return home, they will board a NASA jet to the Johnson Space Center in Houston where their families will be waiting. Medical teams will also be available to help the crew, as astronauts often experience muscle weakness in their first days back to Earth after extended periods in space.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/astronauts-returning-space-toll-human-body/	2025-03-18T10:45:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66995f183a1df1.64433640.jpeg?w=900
Family of Sudiksha Konanki believes she 'drowned': Sheriff	(NewsNation) — The family of missing college student Sudiksha Konanki has asked authorities to declare the 20-year-old dead, according to U.S. officials. 'Sudiksha’s family has expressed their belief that she drowned,' Loudon County Sheriff Michael Chapman said in a statement Tuesday. 'While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible.' Konanki, a student at the University of Pittsburgh, disappeared from a beach in the Dominican Republic earlier this month, and her disappearance is being investigated by local authorities and by authorities from her hometown in Loudoun County, Virginia. What happened to Sudiksha Konanki? Konanki was last seen at the Riu República Hotel, just north of Punta Cana in the La Altagracia district, around 4 a.m. on March 6. She was one of six female University of Pittsburgh students who traveled together for spring break on March 3. Missing teen paddleboarders found safe off Florida coast Police said Konanki disappeared after she and other guests went outside amid a power outage. The group was accompanied by two American men. Konanki stayed on the beach with one of the men while the rest of the group returned to the hotel. Dominican police say they’ve been reinterviewing people who were with Konanki before she went missing. Investigators have been using drones, helicopters and detection dogs to search waters off the island’s east coast. Despite the extensive search, her body has not been found. The public prosecutor’s office said Konanki’s friends have been interviewed. Video shows Konanki at outdoor bar Video footage was released on Monday that appears to be Konanki with a man who has been under the attention of authorities at an outdoor bar before she disappeared. The videos were published by local media outlet Noticia SIN and appear to show Konanki and her friends at a resort bar near a man who resembles Joshua Riibbe. Local authorities initially said they believed Konanki drowned, but have not ruled out the possibility of foul play in her disappearance. Spring break crackdown in Tampa nets more than 20 arrests Local police previously said Riibe is not a suspect, although the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office believes he may have been the last person to see Konanki before she disappeared. Authorities in the Dominican Republic later pulled Riibe’s passport, and he is not allowed to leave the country. Riibe told authorities he pulled Konanki out of rough water in the ocean. He said he vomited seawater up after the incident and felt sick before falling asleep on a beach chair. Riibe said he believed Konanki left the beach before he passed out and woke up some time later. Four tourists drowned at the same beach nearly two months prior to Konanki’s disappearance. The night she disappeared, there were rough seas and high waves, authorities said.

Tyler Goodrich's death ruled a suicide	Editor’s Note: This article contains discussions of suicide. Reader discretion is advised. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, you can find resources in your area on the National Crisis Line website or by calling 988. (NewsNation) — Authorities in Lancaster County, Nebraska, ruled Tyler Goodrich's death a suicide following an autopsy performed on his remains. Goodrich disappeared from his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, in November 2023, leaving his house after a fight with his husband. His remains were found earlier this month near Highway 77. Investigators said there were no other injuries that would indicate any foul play. They confirmed that Goodrich's body was preliminarily identified by his tattoos and his identity was later confirmed with dental records. Body found in nature preserve identified as missing St. Pete teen Allister Nasr Goodrich had run out of his home after a physical altercation with his husband, Marshall Vogel. His disappearance kicked off a massive search of the area. Goodrich's sister, Felicia Nichelson, told NewsNation she believes there is still more information about the circumstances around his death that needs to come out. 'Tyler was such an important person to so many people. For me, he was my oldest little brother, he was someone who always had a smile on his face, he was someone who brought energy everywhere he went,' Nichelson said. 'He was loud, he was funny, he was driven, and he continues to be missed within our family.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/tyler-goodrichs-death-suicide/	2025-03-18T08:23:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/02/tyler.png?w=424
Trump has two-hour call with Putin amid Russia-Ukraine ceasefire ...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump communicated with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday for two hours as the United States pushes for a permanent ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Two of the world's most prominent leaders spoke via phone and discussed a proposed ceasefire deal orchestrated by the Trump administration. The call ended around noon after beginning at 10 a.m. ET with White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino noting discussions were 'going well' during the call. Steve Witkoff, special envoy to the Middle East, met with Putin in Moscow last week ahead of Tuesday's conversation. Trump call fits perfectly with Putin’s scenario: John Bolton Trump suggested on Sunday there could be something worth announcing after the call. 'A lot of work’s been done over the weekend. We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,' Trump told reporters. Former national security adviser John Bolton told 'NewsNation Now' on Monday that the call favors Putin and could be 'bad news for Ukraine.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-putin-meeting-ceasefire-russia-ukraine/	2025-03-18T06:59:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump-and-Putin-0221202.jpg?w=900
Deportation judge lost 'catch me if you can' game: White House of...	(NewsNation) — White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told 'Morning in America' on Tuesday that District Judge James E. Boasberg was too slow to prevent Trump’s deportation flights to El Salvador this past weekend. 'We played a little game of catch me if you can, and guess what? The judge wasn’t able to catch us on this one,' Fields said. Boasberg — whose order was potentially violated when the Trump administration carried out deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act — is demanding the Justice Department hand over all information about the flights by noon on Tuesday. The administration invoked the 18th-century wartime law to carry out deportations of more than 250 alleged Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members last weekend, despite Boasberg's temporary block on the removals. Fields told NewsNation the order came after migrants 'were over international waters' meaning that the judge 'lost.' Trump’s use of Alien Enemies Act could face lengthy legal fight In a contentious court hearing Monday, Boasberg scolded the DOJ for not turning the planes carrying the alleged gang members around despite being ordered to do so during a virtual hearing Saturday. The DOJ refused to share much information, citing national security reasons, and said no planes departed after the written order was filed. But Boasberg on Monday asserted that his verbal order should have been enough to ground the planes. 'I’m just asking how you think my equitable powers do not attach to a plane that has departed the U.S., even if it’s in international airspace,' Boasberg said. Trump calls for deportation judge's impeachment Trump has joined Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, in the call for Boasberg's impeachment. In a Truth Social post Tuesday morning, Trump said he and other 'crooked judges' should be impeached for blocking deportation attempts. 'WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY,' Trump's post reads in part. Members of Mexico’s National Guard killed in cartel ambush The Trump team has described the Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force conducting irregular warfare, but the American Civil Liberties Union — which filed a lawsuit Saturday — has raised concerns that some of those deported might not actually be gang members. 'At this point, it seems like the administration is simply walking into court and telling a federal court they can't look at the evidence, they can't stop what they're doing,' said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigrants' rights project. 'We see constant public statements from administration officials criticizing federal judges, saying they don't have authority,' Gelernt said. 'I think we're on dangerous ground here in the United States.' Trump administration resumes immigrant family detentions What is next for Trump's Alien Enemies Act deportees? According to a social media post from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, the country has agreed to hold 238 Venezuelans in its 'terrorism confinement center.' They are scheduled to stay for at least one year under an agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador worth $6 million, according to the Associated Press. The president of Venezuela's National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, has slammed Trump's actions, saying the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador were denied due process and that the country will do everything it can to have them returned home.

After 9 months in orbit, NASA astronauts finally on their way hom...	(NewsNation) — NASA’s two stuck astronauts began their journey back to Earth with SpaceX on Tuesday after a dramatic marathon mission that began with a troubled Boeing test flight more than nine months ago. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, along with two other astronauts, left the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft early Tuesday morning. The return trip will take around 17 hours, with splashdown set for 5:57 p.m. ET off the Florida coast, weather permitting. As the Dragon approaches its splashdown zone, a series of parachutes will open to slow the aircraft's descent to 15 miles per hour, aiming for a gentle splashdown into the ocean. A recovery vessel will welcome the astronauts back to Earth. What exactly is an autopen? Medical teams will be available to assist the crew, as astronauts often experience muscle weakness in their first days back to Earth after extended periods in microgravity. The astronauts will then board a NASA jet to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where their families are eagerly awaiting their return. NASA will address the public and media at 7:30 p.m. ET to provide updates on the mission. Butch Wilmore, Suni Williams stuck on ISS since June Wilmore and Williams had been expected to return just a week or so after launching Boeing’s Starliner crew capsule on June 5. However, many problems cropped up on the way to the space station, and NASA eventually sent the Starliner back empty and transferred the test pilots to SpaceX, pushing their homecoming to February. Then, SpaceX capsule issues added another month’s delay. Sunday’s arrival of a relief crew meant Wilmore and Williams could finally leave the ISS. NASA dismissed the team a little early, given the iffy weather forecast later this week. They checked out with NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s Alexander Gorbunov, who arrived in their own SpaceX capsule last fall with two empty seats reserved for the Starliner duo. Republican bill would relocate NASA headquarters to Fla. 'Just wanted to say thank you to everybody around the world on the control centers, friends and family who are out there, all our trainers, all of the folks who have got us ready to come here and fly in space,' Williams said. 'We are absolutely thankful for that opportunity, and hopefully we did you proud.' Williams said she's looking forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim. Wilmore said he's ready to get back to his church and smell freshly cut grass.

Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 326, shatter ceasefire	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing at least 326 Palestinians, including women and children, according to hospital officials. The surprise bombardment shattered a ceasefire in place since January and threatened to fully reignite the 17-month-old war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to change the ceasefire agreement. Officials said the operation was open-ended and was expected to expand. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions. The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza, including much of the northern town of Beit Hanoun and other communities further south, and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. Witkoff says administration is ‘exploring’ alternatives for Gaza relocation 'Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,' Netanyahu’s office said. The attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan could resume a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised questions about the fate of the roughly two dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive. A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu’s decision to return to war amounts to a 'death sentence' for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to try and save his far-right governing coalition and called on mediators to 'reveal facts' on who broke the truce. There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment, indicating it still hoped to restore the truce. The strikes came as Netanyahu comes under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial was canceled after the strikes. The main group representing families of the captives accused the government of backing out of the ceasefire, saying it 'chose to give up on the hostages.' 'We are shocked, angry and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,' the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. Wounded stream into Gaza hospitals A strike on a home in the southern city of Rafah killed 17 members of one family, including at least 12 women and children, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. In the southern city of Khan Younis, Associated Press reporters saw explosions and plumes of smoke. Ambulances brought wounded people to Nasser Hospital, where patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Trump’s Scotland golf resort vandalized by pro-Palestinian activists Many Palestinians said they had expected a return to war when talks over the second phase of the ceasefire did not begin as scheduled in early February. Israel instead embraced an alternative proposal and cut off all shipments of food, fuel and other aid to the territory's 2 million Palestinians to try to pressure Hamas to accept it. 'Nobody wants to fight,' Palestinian resident Nidal Alzaanin told the AP by phone from Gaza City. 'Everyone is still suffering from the previous months,' he said. Gaza's Health Ministry said at least 326 people were killed in the strikes and hundreds more wounded. Rescuers were still searching the rubble for dead and wounded as the strikes continued. It was among the deadliest days of the war. US backs Israel and blames Hamas The White House sought to blame Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group 'could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.' An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks. The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. A second Israeli official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a closed-door meeting, said Netanyahu would meet with top security officials to discuss next steps in the war. Talks on a second phase of the ceasefire had stalled The strikes came two months after a ceasefire was reached to pause the war. Over six weeks, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in a first phase of the ceasefire. But since that ceasefire ended two weeks ago, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward with a second phase aimed at releasing the 59 remaining hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead, and ending the war altogether. Is Columbia University’s Mahmoud Khalil being wrongfully detained? Hamas has demanded an end to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli troops in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages. Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas' governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible. Netanyahu's office on Tuesday said Hamas had 'repeatedly refused to release our hostages and rejected all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy, Steve Witkoff, and from the mediators.' Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to follow the ceasefire deal reached by the two sides, which calls for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. A return to war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase of the agreement and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza. It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and re-build Jewish settlements there. Gaza already was in a humanitarian crisis The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children. The ceasefire had brought some relief to Gaza and allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to resume to what remained of their homes. Netanyahu faces mounting criticism The released hostages, some of whom were emaciated, have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining captives. Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken part in mass demonstrations calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages. Mass demonstrations are planned later Tuesday and Wednesday following Netanyahu's announcement this week that he wants to fire the head of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency. Critics have lambasted the move as an attempt by Netanyahu to divert blame for his government's failures in the Oct. 7 attack and handling of the war. Aid operations in Gaza imperiled as millions of promised USAID dollars do not arrive Since the ceasefire in Gaza began in mid-January, Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas. Still, the deal has tenuously held without an outbreak of wide violence. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.

Trump tariffs will lead to 'freer' trade, economist says	(NewsNation) — The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says higher United States tariffs could lead to 'stagflation,' which is a word for slower growth and higher inflation. Higher United States tariffs on imports are to blame, the organization said, according to The Wall Street Journal. Some of the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China are already in place, while others take effect in a few weeks. Trump to release JFK files Tuesday The United States, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said, will only grow by 2.2% this year, down two-tenths of a percent from their earlier projections. However, Stephen Moore, a Trump economic adviser in his first term, says if a trade deal can get done, the economy will 'turn the corner' and see growth in the second half of the year. 'Trump's idea here, just so people understand, is that we want to have freer and fairer trade, right?' Moore, currently a senior visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think thank, said. 'That's going to force other countries to bring their tariffs down.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-freer-trade-economist/	2025-03-17T14:38:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2202630548.jpg?w=900
Trump to release JFK files Tuesday	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump announced he will release the remaining classified files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Tuesday. Trump promised the release of those files, as well as files relating to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., files relating to the assassination of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and files on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. All three cases have been the subject of conspiracy theories, and there has long been public pressure to release them. 'We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading. I don't believe we're going to redact anything. I said, just don't redact. You can't redact,' Trump said. What we know about El Salvador’s megaprison Trump, who made the announcement as he spoke to reporters at the Kennedy Center, said he had not read the files but called them 'very interesting.' The president said there are around 80,000 pages that will be released. The majority of files regarding JFK's assassination have already been declassified. The remaining files remained classified due to sensitive information, which could include the names of informants who may still be alive and intelligence-gathering information, including potential safe houses or black sites, that may still be in use. Trump has already come under fire after an initial release of the Epstein files turned out to consist largely of information that is already known to the public. Those files were released only to a small group of conservative influencers, bypassing traditional media. Republicans in Congress were among those expressing disappointment at how the Epstein files were released and pushing the administration for more transparency.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-to-release-jfk-files-on-tuesday/	2025-03-17T13:44:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Closer-JFK_050462_AP_BS-e1737667097250.jpg?w=800
What we know about El Salvador's megaprison	(NewsNation) — El Salvador's famed megaprison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, is now housing more than 250 alleged gang members in El Salvador after striking a deal with the Trump administration. According to The Associated Press, the 238 Tren de Aragua members and 23 MS-13-affiliated individuals will stay in the prison for at least one year. What is the deal with El Salvador? The accord is worth $6 million. El Salvador will receive that amount from the Trump administration, a figure widely considered relatively low for what the U.S. will gain from the arrangement. In a statement accompanying government video of the high-security exchange, Salvidorian President Nayib Bukele said it is a relatively low sum, but not for his nation. 'The United States will pay a very low fee for them but a high one for us,' Bukele said. 'This will help us finalize intelligence gathering and go after the last remnants of MS-13, including its former and new members, money, weapons, drugs, hideouts, collaborators, and sponsors. As always, we continue advancing in the fight against organized crime.' Inmates look on as they remain in a cell at the Counter-Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT) mega-prison, where hundreds of members of the MS-13 and 18 Street gangs are being held, in Tecoluca, El Salvador on January 27, 2025.

The megaprison opened in 2023 as Bukele rounded up criminal gang members as part of his campaign, and it can hold up to 40,000 inmates. It is the largest prison facility in Central America and one of the largest in the world in terms of inmate capacity. CECOT has giant cells, compared to most prisons, allowing for around 65 to 70 prisoners per cell. Human Rights entity Cristosal said in March 2024 that 110,000 people were behind bars, per AP, more than double what the Salvadorian government reported in 2021 pre-Bukele's war on crime. What facilities do they have at CECOT? Living up to its fierce reputation, there are few liberties for the prisoners at CECOT. There is a gym, dining halls, break rooms and board games inside the prison, but they are for guards only. The facility, in Tecoluca, approximately 45 miles east of San Salvador, does not allow visitors, and the prisoners are never allowed to venture outdoors. Educational programs are not available, nor are workshops to prepare them for a return to society at the end of their sentences. Cell signals are also unavailable within a radius of 1 1/2 miles to limit information emanating from CECOT, according to CBS. 10 December 2024, El Salvador, Toluca: Members of gangs take part in an activity that allows them to be outside for 30 minutes a day at the maximum security penitentiary 'Center for the Compulsory Housing of Terrorism' (Cecot).

No. Multiple reports say that prisoners who reside at CECOT cannot leave, with some serving centurieslong sentences. 'It is impossible to escape. These psychopaths will spend their whole lives behind these bars,' an anonymous CECOT warden told Connectas. Lights remain on 24 hours a day, and all inmates have their heads shaved and must sit in line, resting their heads on the back of the person in front of them when entering CECOT. They are all dressed in white and receive a diet usually of beans and pasta, with meat not an option. Some human rights groups have criticized CECOT, but several polls have Bukele receiving an approval rating above 90%.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/what-we-know-el-salvador-megaprison/	2025-03-17T12:16:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a29518613836.93594496.jpeg?w=900
Could soda and candy bans potentially cut SNAP?	(NewsNation) — A ban on using food stamps for candy and soda has been touted by supporters as a way to push users to make healthier choices and bring the program in line with its intended purpose, but opponents fear it's part of a plan to eventually eliminate the program. Momentum has never been higher to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), in part due to lobbying groups taking headwind from the 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) movement, spearheaded by President Donald Trump’s new Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Karen Siebert, a public policy adviser for Harvesters, a Kansas food bank network, said. For the last decade, groups opposing the food stamps program have been coming into states like Kansas to chip away at it, but this year their fight to push soda and candy bans feels especially like a 'David and Goliath' situation, she said. USDA proposes ban on buying junk food with SNAP benefits 'Restricting food choices within SNAP is not going to have the health outcomes that people are looking for. It's just not going to get you there, that’s a very, very complex problem,' Siebert said. Kansas, along with 15 states including Idaho, Tennessee, Arizona, and Utah have put forth bills sponsored by state legislators and other parties asking the federal government to allow SNAP restrictions on candy and sugary drinks, citing the need for better nutrition. 'It is a ruse [by lobbying groups]…because any sort of harm to SNAP, anything that makes the program more difficult or stigmatizes it is a cut because it's cutting off more people,' Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, said. Bills in at least 10 states, including in Kansas, have been backed by the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA), a conservative Florida-based think tank, according to FRAC. FGA says it aims to promote work over welfare, reserving food stamps and other government programs for the truly needy. Which foods contain Red 3, the dye now banned by the FDA? 'We're very excited that legislators are concerned about the health of the residents and so when we are asked, we will get involved in those states,' Paige Terryberry, Senior Research Fellow with the FGA, told NewsNation, praising the MAHA movement for creating 'momentum' for the issue. Banning soda and candy under Make America Healthy Again's momentum The movement to ban candy and sugary drinks like soda has gained a significant boost since Trump announced Kennedy as his HHS pick. Kennedy has called for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for 'soda or processed foods,' which has been echoed by his MAHA political action committee. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies Jan. 29, 2025, during his confirmation hearing in the Senate in Washington. The committee did not return a request for comment by NewsNation. While SNAP is run by the Department of Agriculture, not HHS, Agriculture Chief Tom Vilsack has proposed a 'Make America Healthy Again' commission to consider the ban. GOP Sens. Katie Britt (AL) and Mike Lee (Utah) have also introduced the federal Healthy SNAP Act, which excludes certain snacks and drinks from being purchased with SNAP benefits. Health groups prepare for the unthinkable: Working with RFK Jr. 'We see the food stamps program as not fulfilling its purpose of providing this more nutritious diet to enrollees so we're really excited about the Make America Healthy Again movement and the solutions that it's bringing to some of these problems,' Terryberry told NewsNation. The enthusiasm appears to deviate from Trump’s first term when his administration denied a request from the state of Maine in 2018 that would have placed similar restrictions on its food stamp program. The x-factor now appears to be MAHA, anti hunger advocates said. 'I do believe they are taking advantage of a broader discussion in the culture and a lot of frustration that a lot of people have about the food system and health issues…and they're using that to their advantage to achieve their actual goals, which are to reduce these federal programs that help people in need,' she said. Will soda and candy bans get at the root cause? While the bans may seem intended to promote healthier choices, anti-hunger groups argue it doesn’t get to the root cause, and will further strain the SNAP system. 'These proposals kind of miss the bigger picture, and that is that the biggest barrier that staff participants actually face to achieving a healthy diet is the cost and availability of healthy foods,' Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group, said. The most common barrier overall, reported by 61% of SNAP participants, was the affordability of foods that are part of a healthy diet and harder to find in low-income areas, according to a 2021 USDA survey. 'If you really care about the nutrition piece of making people healthy, can we talk about how there are not enough grocery stores within walking distance for individuals? Can we talk about the high price of vegetables and eggs?' Plata-Nino said. 'If you really care about this issue, look at the systemic root causes.' RFK Jr. says Texas measles outbreak a ‘call to action’ Food restrictions also come with a high price tag of converting codes and categorizing food that will steer some food vendors away from SNAP, she adds. Under Arizona’s bill, SNAP participants could be prevented from buying granola bars and some cereals, while allowing them to buy potato chips, while the Kansas legislation defines candy as something that doesn’t contain flour, allowing Twizzlers and Twix but not a Clif energy bar. 'Members of Congress are trying to destroy the program without taking into account that anything cut, anything that they do is the states that have to implement it, and many states are already at capacity,' Plata-Nino said.

(AP Photo/Allison Dinner, file) But the FGA says implementing food restrictions is a 'negligent factor' as grocers already regularly update their system for SNAP and ban items like alcohol and tobacco. 'There's dozens of new products that come onto shelves at grocery stores and convenience stores every day and those are never going to be the problem. Those have to go through the same kind of sorting system whether they're EBT eligible or not,' Terryberry said. Proposed SNAP budget cuts Along with proposed bans, SNAP is facing its biggest budget reduction in 30 years, Bergh said. The budget resolution that the House plans to take up directs the House Agriculture Committee to cut programs by at least $230 billion through 2034, with these cuts expected to come largely or entirely from SNAP which serves more than 40 million Americans. 'It's interesting that some of the same people who are advocating to restrict what SNAP participants can buy - when their biggest barrier is the affordability of healthy food - are also advocating to reduce the size of the benefit that people are getting,' she said. What is causing your spring allergies and what can you do to prevent them? But the FGA says while SNAP is an important 'safety net' it's also very expensive and needs more accountability that should be geared towards reducing government dependency. 'We've watched the growth and we're very concerned about getting those resources to those with a true need,' Terryberry said. 'As a part of this effort, we're very focused on making sure that it's actually fulfilling its goal of providing nutrition, that's one thing that we have seen the program depart from that purpose.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/soda-candy-bans-potentially-cut-snap/	2025-03-17T12:13:11-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1205050194-e1727116913367.jpg?w=800
Live: White House says acted 'within the confines of the law' in ...	(NewsNation) — The White House is holding a press briefing at noon Monday amid questions over whether the Trump administration violated a federal judge's court order by deporting more than 200 people from the United States. On Saturday night, District Judge James E. Boasberg ordered the administration not to deport anyone in its custody over the Alien Enemies Act. President Donald Trump previously issued a proclamation that the 1798 law is in effect. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday that hundreds of members of the Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua were deported under the act. Does Canada really have tariffs above 200% on US dairy products? Plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed to halt deportations asked Boasberg to force officials to explain whether they violated his court order. A court hearing is scheduled for Monday afternoon over the matter. Asked by NewsNation what the administration says to Americans who are concerned due process is being violated, Leavitt said the president 'is using every lever of his executive authority and his constitutional authority within the bounds of the immigration laws of our country to ensure that our streets are safer for law-abiding American citizens.' Pressed about the court order, Leavitt maintained that the Trump administration 'acted within the confines of the law, again, within the president’s constitutional authority and under the authority granted to him under the Alien Enemies Act.' 'We are quite confident in that, and we are wholly confident that we are going to win this case in court,' Leavitt said. At Monday's press briefing, reporters are also expected to ask Leavitt about Trump's upcoming conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump told reporters that he will be speaking with Putin on Tuesday, and that a 'lot of work's been done over the weekend' to end the war in Ukraine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-press-secretary-brief-reporters/	2025-03-17T09:42:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25064123597545.jpg?w=900
Family of AI whistleblower Suchir Balaji speaks out: Exclusive	After speaking out about OpenAI to The New York Times, Suchir Balaji was found dead. NewsNation’s Brian Entin sits down with his family for the exclusive on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports,' Monday 7p/6C on NewsNation. Find NewsNation on your screen: NewsNationNow.com (NewsNation) — A tech prodigy who spoke out about the dangers of artificial intelligence was found dead last year, and now his family is hoping the Trump administration will help them get answers. Suchir Balaji began working at OpenAI in San Francisco after college. Four years later, in an interview with the New York Times, he alleged OpenAI had illegally used copyright articles to train its bots and brought 'society more harm than benefit.' Poornima Rao, Balaji's mother, said she feared her son was in danger after the interview. New video footage appears to show missing student at resort bar 'I sensed the danger,' Rao said. 'Moment I saw that, I knew something was there. Mother instinct.' 'As a mother, I could sense it,' she continued. 'But later it just vanished. I talked to Suchir each time he came home, and every time he said don’t worry. But in his journal, he's written, 'I'm a credible threat because of New York Times.'' One month later, Balaji was found dead in his apartment. Police said Balaji took his own life, but his family believes the circumstances don't add up.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/ai/family-ai-whistleblower-suchir-balaji/	2025-03-17T09:19:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67671956a5d6e3.44862985.jpeg?w=900
Schumer postpones book tour amid backlash over funding vote	Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) has postponed his book tour scheduled this week in Baltimore, New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia amid an intense backlash from fellow Democrats over his controversial vote to advance a House Republican-drafted funding package that cuts deeply into non-defense programs. A spokesperson for Schumer’s book tour said that it would be rescheduled due to 'security concerns.' Schumer was scheduled to barnstorm East Coast cities this week to promote his new book, 'Antisemitism in America: A Warning.' He was slated to speak at Central Library on Cathedral Street in Baltimore Monday evening, at the Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center in New York City on Tuesday, at a Politics and Prose event at the Sixth &amp; I synagogue in D.C. on Wednesday and at the Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia on Thursday. Those plans are now on hold indefinitely amid a torrent of criticism the Democratic leader has drawn after announcing last week he would vote to advance a GOP-drafted funding bill to avert a government shutdown that received only one Democratic vote in the House. 'Due to security concerns, Senator Schumer’s book events are being rescheduled,' said a spokesperson for the book tour. Some progressive activists had circulated the schedule of Schumer’s events and had suggested their allies attend to vent their displeasure over the leader’s vote. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said many Democrats felt betrayed by Schumer’s vote. 'There is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,' she told reporters Thursday. 'And this is not just about progressive Democrats. This is across the board, the entire party.' Ocasio-Cortez argued that Schumer had undercut House Democrats in districts that President Trump won in 2024 who took very tough votes against the bill. 'I think it is a huge slap in the face,' she said. Schumer defended his vote on the Senate floor last week, arguing if Democrats had blocked the House-passed bill it would have triggered a government shutdown that would have further empowered Trump and Elon Musk, who is leading the administration's effort to slash the federal workforce and shutter federal agencies. The Democratic leader said while the House bill was 'very bad,' he argued the consequences of a government shutdown would be 'much, much worse.' 'For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option,' he acknowledged, noting it was 'deeply partisan.' But he warned that a shutdown would give Trump and Musk 'carte blanche to destroy vital government services at a significantly faster rate than they can now.' He warned it would give the administration 'full authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel ‘non-essential,’ furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/schumer-postpones-book-tour-amid-backlash-over-funding-vote/	2025-03-17T08:18:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/schumerchuck_031425gn04_w.jpg?w=900
Why the USS Gravely warship was deployed to the southern border	(NewsNation) — The U.S. military is expanding its role in border security with the presence of the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer, on the southern border. The USS Gravely was deployed Saturday under U.S. Northern Command to counter illegal immigration, weapons trafficking and transnational crime. Where is the USS Gravely headed? The warship departed from Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, heading to U.S. territorial waters covering the continental United States, Alaska, Canada and Mexico. Gen. Gregory Guillot, who oversees U.S. Northern Command, said the deployment supports President Donald Trump’s executive order to secure the southern border. The Department of Defense described the move as a significant shift, giving the U.S. Navy a direct role in stopping threats before they reach American shores. Accused Tren de Aragua gang members deported to El Salvador get harsh reception Since taking office, Trump has designated Mexican cartels as terrorist threats, allowing law enforcement to pursue them with the same legal framework as groups like ISIS. The Department of Justice has streamlined terrorism charges, increased penalties and fast-tracked warrants. Continuation of Trump's border security At the southern border, the administration has added 9,000 active-duty troops, deployed Stryker combat teams and reinforced aerial support with Black Hawk helicopters to assist Border Patrol. Mexico has also stepped up enforcement, adding 10,000 troops to its side of the border. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also ramped up efforts. The agency has reportedly arrested more than 32,800 people in just 50 days — more than all of last year’s at-large arrests. Nearly 75% had criminal records or pending charges, officials said, including more than 1,100 gang members and 39 suspected terrorists — triple last year’s numbers. Immigration attorney Rolando Vazquez told NewsNation that levels of self-deportation have been higher than expected. 'I'm very surprised with the amount of self-deportations. I knew there would be self-deportations, but not at the level I'm seeing,' Vazquez said. Rubio announces deportations day after judge blocks using Alien Enemies Act 'Many of these immigrants are going to other countries to look for ... new beginnings in countries that don't have aggressive immigration laws,' Vazquez said. Congress key to next steps Guantanamo Bay has already received its first detainees, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, marking a major shift in how the U.S. handles criminal migrants. Border officials say the results are clear: Illegal crossings have dropped by 94%, and the administration’s policies have effectively halted migrant releases into the U.S. The focus now shifts to Congress, where new legislation aims to classify fentanyl trafficking as a national security threat.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/uss-gravely-warship-deployed-border/	2025-03-17T07:58:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/GettyImages-1401545075.jpg?w=900
New video appears to show Sudiksha Konanki at outdoor bar	(NewsNation) — New video footage appears to shows missing college student Sudiksha Konanki with a man who has been under the attention of authorities at an outdoor bar before she disappeared. Konanki, a student at the University of Pittsburgh, disappeared from a beach in the Dominican Republic earlier this month, and her disappearance is being investigated by local authorities and by authorities from her hometown in Loudoun County, Virginia. The videos were published by local media outlet Noticia SIN and appear to show Konanki and her friends at a resort bar near a man who resembles Joshua Riibbe. Missing college student timeline: Where is Sudiksha Konanki? In one of the videos, Konanki and her friends are at the bar before a girl identified as Konanki puts her hand over her mouth and excuses herself, appearing to vomit on a patch of grass a few feet away. She then walks back to the bar and jumps up and down before hugging her friend. The man who appears to be Riibe is separately seen bending over and struggling outside a bar while another man comforts him. The two do not interact in the footage. Another video appears to show Konanki and several other girls in the lobby of the Riu República Hotel a few hours before she disappeared. Local authorities initially said they believed Konanki drowned but have not ruled out the possibility of foul play in her disappearance. Local police previously said Riibe is not a suspect, although the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office believes he may have been the last person to see Konanki before she disappeared. Authorities in the Dominican Republic later pulled Riibe's passport, and he is not allowed to leave the country. Tyler Goodrich was ‘so important’ to many people, sister says Riibe told authorities he pulled Konanki out of rough water in the ocean. He said he vomited seawater up after the incident and felt sick before falling asleep on a beach chair. Riibe said he believed Konanki left the beach before he passed out and woke up some time later. Four tourists drowned at the same beach nearly two months prior to Konanki's disappearance. The night she disappeared, there were rough seas and high waves, authorities said. Konanki's family has urged authorities to consider all possibilities, including foul play, in the case.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/new-video-sudiksha-konanki-missing-bar/	2025-03-17T07:38:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Sudiksha-Konanki-wings.jpg?w=900
What is the Tren de Aragua gang, linked to several crimes in US?	(NewsNation) — Federal and local officials are urging people to be on alert for the growing presence of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in the United States as President Donald Trump orders the deportation of hundreds of migrants. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said this is an issue people should take seriously. Accused Tren de Aragua gang members deported to El Salvador get harsh reception 'Whether it's west Texas, east Texas, south Texas, it doesn't matter,' he said. 'These criminal gangs, these criminal elements are here.' Border Patrol receives warning on Tren de Aragua gang NewsNation reported in July on an internal safety bulletin sent across Border Patrol warning that Tren de Aragua, Venezuela's largest criminal organization, is 'known to exploit immigrant populations and carry out acts of violent crime.' Putin and Trump will speak on Tuesday about the war in Ukraine The Miami Herald reported that in the past 10 years, the gang, which traces its origin to a prison in the central state of Aragua, has grown from an estimated 400 members to more than 3,000. Between 2018 and 2023, according to think tank Insight Crime, Tren de Aragua built a transnational criminal network, setting up cells in Colombia, Peru and Chile. The group reportedly has a sporadic presence in Ecuador, Bolivia and Brazil as well. Tren de Aragua members have been linked to several crimes in the U.S. NBC reported that U.S. law enforcement and immigration officials, as of June, had launched more than 100 investigations of crimes connected to suspected members. Sec. Noem reports reduced border crossings, aggressive deportation efforts These include sex trafficking in Louisiana and the shooting of two New York City police officers, per Department of Homeland Security officials who spoke to NBC. An alleged Tren de Aragua member was arrested in connection to a violent jewelry store heist in Denver, where they were caught on video pulling out guns and pistol-whipping two women. Tren de Aragua gang designated as transnational criminal organization This summer, the Treasury Department sanctioned the gang, designating it as a transnational criminal organization. 'From its origins as a prison gang in Aragua, Venezuela, Tren de Aragua has quickly expanded throughout the Western Hemisphere in recent years,' the department said. 'With a particular focus on human smuggling and other illicit acts that target desperate migrants, the organization has developed additional revenue sources through a range of criminal activities, such as illegal mining, kidnapping, human trafficking, extortion, and the trafficking of illicit drugs such as cocaine and MDMA.' Trump says autopen voids Biden’s pardons for Jan. 6 committee The Department of Homeland Security said in July it was expanding access to additional foreign records systems through new international agreements. It also implemented enhanced screening measures at the border to identify known or suspected gang members. About $12 million in rewards was being offered by the U.S. State Department for any information leading to the arrests of Tren de Aragua's main leaders. Trump tries to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 In March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II. This would give him the power to deport those associated with a Venezuelan gang. However, hours later, a federal judge halted deportations. The act would allow noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go in front of an immigration judge or a federal court judge. Trump's proclamation identified the Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force. However, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg blocked anyone from being deported under the president's proclamation for two weeks. A hearing has been scheduled to consider all arguments. Other countries worried about Tren de Aragua gang members U.S. officials aren't the only ones on the lookout for Tren de Aragua: the Mexican state of Chihuahua has received reports that several Venezuelan gang members have used the El Paso-Juarez corridor, NewsNation partner Border Report wrote. Chicago neighborhood calms after ICE raids fail to materialize 'We have detected — thanks to a collaboration with the United States — that a large number of people who belong to Tren de Aragua have passed through Chihuahua,' Gilberto Loya, the state's public safety director, said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/what-is-tren-de-aragua-gang/	2025-03-17T07:30:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/669064dac48ab1.70574144.jpeg?w=900
Trump says autopen voids Biden's pardons for Jan. 6 committee	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said former President Joe Biden's preemptive Jan. 6 Select Committee pardons, among others, are 'hereby declared void, vacant' because Biden may have used an autopen, a device that replicates a signature. 'In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden,' Trump said on social media. Democratic Party’s favorability hits record low: Poll Trump's accusations echo an argument made by conservative thinktank Heritage Foundation, which recently compared Biden's signatures throughout his presidency as evidence of autopen usage. What is an autopen? Trump has claimed Biden relied heavily on an autopen — a mechanical device replicating his signature, similar to a stamp — for crucial documents like executive orders and pardons. The device is something celebrities often use for autographs to fans. Trump argues Biden's alleged cognitive decline raises concerns about whether he was fully aware of what he was signing. Trump, in the social media post, suggested members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee were 'probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent' of Biden. Did Biden use an autopen? Investigators from the Heritage Foundation's oversight project shared photos showing identical signatures on multiple executive orders signed by Biden, suggesting the use of an autopen. The group also points to the timing of orders — specifically, pardons from 2022 dated in D.C., though Biden was publicly vacationing in the U.S. Virgin Islands at the time. Republicans worry Trump’s tariffs could harm economy The pardons seemingly signed while Biden was on vacation include people convicted of charges including underage drinking, selling alcohol without tax stamps, distribution of marijuana and second-degree murder. Officials have neither confirmed nor denied the use of an autopen at this time. If Biden did use an autopen, it's unknown who operated it and whether Biden personally authorized each signature made by it. Do pardons have to be written and signed? No, a pardon doesn't need to be put in writing for it to be valid. A 2024 federal appeals court decision asserted: 'The plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limit' on pardons. President George W. Bush's Department of Justice penned a 29-page opinion deeming the tech constitutional, though the elder Bush reportedly never used it. Treasury secretary: ‘There are no guarantees’ when it comes to recession The autopen has been around — and in use by the country's chief executive — for decades. The 1965 book 'The Robot That Helped to Make a President' points to former President John F. Kennedy's use of the technology. According to previous Politico reporting, former President Barack Obama used the device to sign an extension of the Patriot Act in May 2011 as he was attending the G-8 Summit in France. Could autopen accusations void Biden pardons? Biden's pardons can't be voided over autopen use, at least not by Trump's will alone. 'It’s not my decision — that’ll be up to a court — but I would say that they’re null and void, because I’m sure Biden didn’t have any idea that it was taking place, and somebody was using an autopen to sign off and to give pardons,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Bloomberg reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-pardons-autopen-trump-jan-6/	2025-03-17T04:45:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6777d5eff15379.28543841.jpeg?w=900
Sudiksha Konanki case: Passport confiscated in search for college...	(NewsNation) — Authorities in the Dominican Republic have confiscated the passport of the last person known to have seen University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki before she disappeared, according to NBC News. Konanki, 20, was last seen on March 6 near the RIU Hotel &amp; Resort in Punta Cana, where she had traveled for spring break with five friends. She was reportedly on the beach with a 22-year-old American man before vanishing. The man, a college senior from a Minnesota school, has not been named as a suspect, but his lawyers confirmed that he has been required to stay at the hotel and is under constant police escort. 'So no, he is not free to leave,' the law firm said in an email to NBC News. Drone team helps find missing Wisconsin woman lost in woods NewsNation is not naming the individual because officials in the Dominican Republic stated that no one has been identified as a suspect, and they do not use the term 'person of interest.' In an interview with investigators, he said he and Konanki went into the ocean together, where they were caught by a wave and pulled out to sea. He claimed he managed to bring her back toward shore but later lost sight of her. 'The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn’t hear her answer,' he told authorities, according to a transcript obtained by NBC News. He said he assumed she had left the beach but was shocked to learn later that she was missing. A transcript of his police interview states that surveillance footage captured him and Konanki walking to the beach with her friends. Around 5:50 a.m., the group returned to the hotel, leaving the pair alone. He told investigators they waded into waist-deep water, kissed and were then hit by a strong wave. He claimed he swallowed seawater while trying to keep her afloat but was able to bring her closer to shore. Family speaks on missing St. Pete teen as search expands Afterward, he said he vomited from ingesting salt water and lost track of her. 'I passed out on the beach and woke up hours later,' he told authorities, per NBC News. Konanki’s friends reported her missing around 4 p.m. later that day. Authorities subsequently found items believed to belong to her, including a white sarong and a pair of beige flip-flops, left near a set of beach chairs. U.S. authorities are treating the case as a missing persons investigation.

Accused gang members deported to El Salvador get harsh reception	Ali Bradley covers developments on the southern border with a focus on human and drug smuggling, immigration enforcement efforts, and the failure to control the influx of migrants. Check out Bradley on the Border on YouTube now! (NewsNation) — The U.S. deported more than 250 alleged gang members to El Salvador this weekend, and video posted to social media shows the harsh reception they received in the Central American country. Salvadoran officials said the detainees included 238 Venezuelans who are members of Tren de Aragua gang, as well as 23 members of MS-13. They were immediately transferred to a Terrorism Confinement Center, where they are scheduled to stay for at least one year, under an agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador worth $6 million, according to the Associated Press. 'The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us,' Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in comments on X that accompanied government video of the high-security exchange. What is the Tren de Aragua gang, linked to several crimes in US? In the footage, shackled prisoners are seen stumbling forward as heavily armed officers push them along. Detainees’ wrists, ankles and waists are tightly bound, forcing them to shuffle in short, restricted steps. On the tarmac, riot police stand shoulder to shoulder, gripping their batons as helicopters hover overhead, scanning for any disturbances. The men are loaded one by one onto special units and military buses, their heads forced down as officers keep them under strict control. Sirens blare as a convoy of armored vehicles, escorted by special forces, transports the migrants to the mega-prison known as CECOT, the same facility where El Salvador's government has locked up tens of thousands of gang members in recent years. Inside the prison walls, heads are shaved in assembly-line fashion, while guards bark orders. Cameras also capture the moment they are dressed in white prison uniforms, before they are marched, hands behind their backs, into tightly packed holding cells. The transfer of the migrant detainees comes as the Trump administration is trying to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport members of Tren de Aragua, which the State Department has designated as a terrorist organization. The strategy faced immediate legal challenges, and a federal judge in Washington called for planes to be turned around while the issue was settled in court. The White House said the migrant detainees were in international airspace at the time of the ruling. President Bukele offered an online taunt upon receiving the migrants, saying, 'Oopsie … Too late.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/us-deports-gang-members-prison-el-salvador/	2025-03-16T18:19:33-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/els.jpg?w=900
Business owner's message on Trump tariffs: 'Don't forget' us	(NewsNation) — Sarah Pitkin, owner of hardware stores in Virginia, joined 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' to discuss the impact tariffs could have on her businesses and why she cannot always buy American-made products. Despite some American businesses welcoming President Trump's tariffs on imported goods, Pitkin is less of a fan. She has had to raise prices on products from China; such as steel, nuts and bolts, among others. 'We order our goods usually about four to six months ahead of time before we knew about tariffs. We do have a large stock of grills that we're going to have to figure out if we can sell for the price,' Pitkin said. 'One of our major manufacturers is going to raise prices by about 20% within the next few months. So that means that we will have to raise prices as well,' she added. Are there benefits to Trump’s tariffs? Based just outside of Washington D.C., Pitkin says her customers are on both sides of the political aisle and as much as she would love to buy all of her products from within America, she's unsure of the feasibility. 'When you see and read some of your plate boxes that say 'Made in America,' it'll say from globally sourced items. 'So we're a global economy, I don't know how we're going to pick up and [produce] more Made in America because of what is available and how we're so interconnected with everybody.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/business-owners-trump-tariffs-economy/	2025-03-16T13:46:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/True-Value.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — A Missouri rancher, Wes White, and his family joined 'NewsNation Live Sunday' live from Alton, Missouri, after surviving tornadoes and storms in the South that have killed at least 35 people. The White family ranch is in tact, and none of the family suffered any injuries but their neighbor's property wasn't so lucky. They previously lived in Alaska and endured earthquakes before moving to the Midwest. Tornadoes, wildfires and blinding dust sweep across US as massive storm leaves at least 35 dead 'I've experienced Arctic hurricanes, I used to work on the Arctic, but this was like nothing we've ever felt before when it went over us. It's kind of unexplainable,' Wes White told 'NewsNation Live Sunday.' 'I didn't know it was a tornado, but I know something we never experienced before,' he added. Despite high anxiety and emotions, no animals or infrastructure was damaged on the White property. At least 8 dead after 71-vehicle pileup during dust storm in Kansas The White family's ranch is Tick Creek Ranch and runs both cattle and horses. They can be found on social media showing off the realities of farm life. 'We build everything ourselves here and we would be rebuilding everything again if that [storm] path would have been just 200 feet this way, we would look just like our neighbors,' White added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/missouri-family-survives-deadly-storm/	2025-03-16T13:43:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/White-family.jpg?w=838
Rubio announces deportations day after judge blocks using Alien E...	Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Sunday that hundreds of members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang have been deported under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, even as a federal judge ordered the removals be temporarily stopped. 'Under the President’s direction, his administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to initiate the removal of hundreds of dangerous members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a vicious and violent Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), which has been threatening our nation, conducting irregular warfare, and terrorizing Americans,' Rubio said in a statement Sunday. Sec. Noem reports reduced border crossings, aggressive deportation efforts 'Hundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country. This crucial step would have never happened under any other U.S. president. President Trump is following through on the promises he made to the American people,' he added. Rubio’s announcement comes a day after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration halt deportations for individuals deemed eligible for removal under Trump’s order for 14 days, as a result of the lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). But Boasberg, in a virtual hearing on Saturday, signaled that two planes with immigrants were in the air already, at the time of the order — one headed for El Salvador and the other for Honduras, The Associated Press reported. Boasberg verbally ordered that the planes be turned around, according to the AP, but they apparently were not and the directive was not included in the written order. 'Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,' Boasberg told Justice Department officials on Saturday. Some ICE detention centers at capacity while others shutting down The immigrants were deported under an agreement Rubio negotiated with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who agreed to imprison the deported alleged gang members in exchange for the U.S. returning two top leaders of MS-13 and 21 of its most wanted alleged criminals 'to face justice in their homeland,' according to Rubio. 'President Bukele has shown he is not only the strongest security leader in our region, he’s also a great friend of the United States,' Rubio said in a statement, thanking Bukele for 'playing a pivotal role in this transfer.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/marco-rubio-deportations-alien-enemies-act/	2025-03-16T13:29:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25050289031640-e1741641222610_e49152.jpg?w=900
Trump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a jud...	The Trump administration has transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations under an 18th century wartime declaration targeting Venezuelan gang members, officials said Sunday. Flights were in the air at the time of the ruling. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg issued an order Saturday blocking the deportations but lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air — one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Boasberg verbally ordered the planes be turned around, but they apparently were not and he did not include the directive in his written order. 'Oopsie…Too late,' Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, a Trump ally who agreed to house about 300 immigrants for a year at a cost of $6 million in his country’s prisons, wrote on the social media site X above an article about Boasberg’s ruling. That post was recirculated by White House communications director Steven Cheung. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated an earlier deal with Bukele to house immigrants, posted on the site: 'We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.' Steve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, said that Boasberg's verbal directive to turn around the planes was not technically part of his final order but that the Trump administration clearly violated the 'spirit' of it. 'This just incentivizes future courts to be hyper specific in their orders and not give the government any wiggle room,' Vladeck said. The immigrants were deported after Trump’s declaration of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been used only three times in U.S. history. The law, invoked during World Wars I and II and the War of 1812, requires a president to declare the United States is at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners who otherwise would have protections under immigration or criminal laws. It was last used to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II. The ACLU, which filed the lawsuit that led to Boasberg's temporary restraining order on deportations, said it was asking the government whether the removals to El Salvador were in defiance of the court. 'This morning, we asked the government to assure the Court that its order was not violated and are waiting to hear, as well as trying to do our own investigation,' ACLU’s lead lawyer, Lee Gelernt, said in a statement Sunday. A Justice Department spokesperson on Sunday referred back to an earlier statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi blasting Boasberg’s ruling and didn’t immediately answer questions about whether the administration ignored the court’s order. Venezuela’s government in a statement Sunday rejected the use of Trump’s declaration of the law, characterizing it as evocative of 'the darkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.' Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation’s economy came undone last decade. Trump seized on the gang during his campaign to paint misleading pictures of communities that he contended were 'taken over' by what were actually a handful of lawbreakers. The Trump administration has not identified the immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the U.S,. It did also send two top members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang to El Salvador who had been arrested in the United States. Video released by El Salvador’s government Sunday showed men exiting airplanes into an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had with their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down to have them bend down at the waist. The video also showed the men being transported to prison in a large convoy of buses guarded by police and military vehicles and at least one helicopter. The men were shown kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison’s all-white uniform – knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs – and placed in cells. The immigrants were taken to the notorious CECOT facility, the centerpiece of Bukele's push to pacify his once violence-wracked country through tough police measures and limits on basic rights The Trump administration said the president actually signed the proclamation contending Tren de Aragua was invading the United States Friday night but didn't announce it until Saturday afternoon. Immigration lawyers said that, late Friday, they noticed Venezuelans who otherwise couldn't be deported under immigration law being moved to Texas for deportation flights. They began to file lawsuits to halt the transfers. 'Basically any Venezuelan citizen in the US may be removed on pretext of belonging to Tren de Aragua, with no chance at defense,' Adam Isacson of the Washington Office for Latin America, a human rights group, warned on X. The litigation that led to the hold on deportations was filed on behalf of five Venezuelans held in Texas who lawyers said were concerned they'd be falsely accused of being members of the gang. Once the act is invoked, they warned, Trump could simply declare anyone a Tren de Aragua member and remove them from the country. Boasberg barred those Venezuelans' deportations Saturday morning when the suit was filed, but only broadened it to all people in federal custody who could be targeted by the act after his afternoon hearing. He noted that the law has never before been used outside of a congressionally-declared war and that plaintiffs may successfully argue Trump exceeded his legal authority in invoking it. The bar on deportations stands for up to 14 days and the immigrants will remain in federal custody during that time. Boasberg has scheduled a hearing Friday to hear additional arguments in the case. He said he had to act because the immigrants whose deportations may actually violate the constitution deserved a chance to have their pleas heard in court. 'Once they’re out of the country,' Boasberg said, 'there’s little I could do.' _____ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/ap-trump-administration-deports-hundreds-of-migrants-despite-judges-order-stopping-removal/	2025-03-16T11:08:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25064133427365.jpg?w=900
Tornadoes, wildfires and dust sweep across US as massive storm le...	PIEDMONT, Mo. (AP) — Violent tornadoes and high winds decimated homes, wiped out schools and toppled semitractor-trailers as a monster storm that also produced dust storms and icy conditions killed at least 33 people across the central and southern U.S. Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbors found five bodies scattered in the debris Friday night outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said. 'It was a very rough deal last night,' Henderson said Saturday not far from the splintered home from which he said they rescued his aunt through a window of the only room left standing. 'It’s really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.' The dynamic storm, earning an unusual 'high risk' designation from weather forecasters, was blamed for deadly dust storms in the nation’s midsection, icy winter weather in northern parts of the country and severe thunderstorms on Sunday, including on the West Coast. Authorities were still sifting through massive tornado damage. Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County in Missouri described the 'unrecognizable home' where one man was killed as 'just a debris field.' 'The floor was upside down,' he said. 'We were walking on walls.' Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced six people died in three counties and three more people were missing late Saturday as storms moved further east into Alabama, where damaged homes and impassable roads were reported. Officials confirmed three deaths in Arkansas, where Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency. In Alabama, Dallas County Sheriff Michael L. Granthum said there was one storm-related fatality in that county. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also declared an emergency in anticipation of the storm's shift eastward. Early Sunday morning, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency used its social media accounts to repost a National Weather Service tornado watch for parts of southeast Georgia. In response to the watch, which warns of isolated tornadoes and hail and gusts of 50 to 70 mph (80 to 112 kph), Kemp posted a note saying his family was 'praying for all those impacted by this storm system and those still in its path.' 'We will continue to work closely with state and local officials to respond to damage and assess any needs following this weather event,' Kemp wrote. Dust storms spurred by the system's early high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday. Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. Extreme weather encompasses a zone of 100 million people The extreme weather conditions were forecast to impact an area that is home to more than 100 million people, with winds threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and fanning the wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) had burned, sharing that he lost a home of his own on a ranch northeast of Oklahoma City. To the north, the National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Still, experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes have been widespread Significant tornadoes continued late Saturday, with the region at highest risk stretching from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, as a massive twister struck an area about half a mile (0.8 kilometer) away near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded video of snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. 'The amount of damage was catastrophic,' Dillon said. 'It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over. Everything was destroyed.' Paradise Ranch said via Facebook that all staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the RV park itself. 'Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,' she said. 'Schools and buildings are just completely gone.' Some images from the extreme weather went viral online. Tad Peters and his father, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, on Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists fleeing the interstate to park. 'Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it’s here. It’s here,' Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. 'Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ...' His father then rolled up the window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to return home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they then encountered wildfire. ___ Walker reported from New York and Reynolds reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

DOGE representatives visit US Institute of Peace, are turned away	U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) officials said several members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) arrived unannounced with FBI agents on Saturday but were denied access to the building after being approached by their counsel. 'They were met at the door by the Institute’s outside counsel who informed them of USIP’s private and independent status as a non-executive branch agency. Following that discussion, the DOGE representatives departed,' Gonzo Gallegos, USIP’s director of communications, said in a statement to The Hill. DOGE has ordered mass firings at a wide range of federal agencies and departments while working to cancel government contracts in an effort to reduce spending levels. USIP is a national non-partisan organization created by Congress and dedicated to protecting U.S. interests by helping to prevent violent conflicts and broker peace deals abroad according to their website. It uses federal funding to perform its mission and works closely with the Department of Defense. A Senate-confirmed Board of Directors made up of the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and President of the National Defense University governs the USIP in an effort to align with each presidential administration and their national security efforts. 'As an independent, non-profit organization established by Congress, USIP remains committed to the cooperation and comity with the Trump Administration it has exhibited in its work with seven administrations since its founding under President Ronald Reagan,' Gallegos said after the DOGE visit. 'This includes ensuring the responsible use of taxpayer funds, aggressively pursuing its ongoing efforts to modernize and make all aspects of its operations more efficient,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-representatives-visit-us-institute-of-peace-are-turned-away/	2025-03-16T05:23:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/doge_022125gn03_w.jpg?w=900
Hundreds protest Tesla showrooms over Musk's DOGE work	Hundreds of protestors gathered outside of Tesla showrooms on Saturday to showcase their disdain for CEO Elon Musk and his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in an effort to slash federal spending. The 'Tesla Takedown' movement has launched a series of demonstrations that have taken place in Washington, D.C., Boston and other locations aiming to encourage investors to divest in Tesla stock and charging electric vehicle owners to ditch the brand. Approximately 80 protests took place on Saturday alone, according to CNN. 'Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines. Hurting Tesla is stopping Musk,' a statement on their website reads. 'Stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy. The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us—not politicians, not the media.' Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said he was looking for a 'new ride' after getting rid of his Tesla, which he argued was 'built and designed by an a‑‑hole.' 'Every time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country. Talking about slashing Social Security, cutting health care benefits for poor people, for seniors. It’s one bad thing after the next,' Kelly said in a video posted to X. Musk has supported efforts to close the U.S. Agency for International Development and the regulatory Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in his role as senior adviser to President Trump. The tech giant is frequently spotted on the South Lawn with the leader and highlighted unique Tesla features next to Trump with three cars parked at the White House on Tuesday, which caused some to question the event’s ethical standing. 'I mean, nobody else has a car company started up in the last 30 years that’s been successful, I don’t think so,' Trump told reporters. 'But because he’s finding all sorts of terrible things that have taken place against our country, we want to penalize him in an economic sense. And I just think that’s very unfair. So I just wanted to make a statement. I’m going to buy one now.'

NASA's stuck astronauts welcome their newly arrived replacements ...	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Just over a day after blasting off, a SpaceX crew capsule arrived at the International Space Station on Sunday, delivering the replacements for NASA’s two stuck astronauts. The four newcomers — representing the U.S., Japan and Russia — will spend the next few days learning the station’s ins and outs from Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Then the two will strap into their own SpaceX capsule later this week, one that has been up there since last year, to close out an unexpected extended mission that began last June. Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week when they launched on Boeing’s first astronaut flight. They hit the nine-month mark earlier this month. The Boeing Starliner capsule encountered so many problems that NASA insisted it come back empty, leaving its test pilots behind to wait for a SpaceX lift. Their ride arrived in late September with a downsized crew of two and two empty seats reserved for the leg back. But more delays resulted when their replacements’ brand new capsule needed extensive battery repairs. An older capsule took its place, pushing up their return by a couple weeks to mid-March. Weather permitting, the SpaceX capsule carrying Wilmore, Williams and two other astronauts will undock from the space station no earlier than Wednesday and splash down off Florida's coast. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Motorist caught with 150 pounds of marijuana: Police	MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A female driver was arrested along I-40 on Sunday after drug agents discovered 150 pounds of marijuana in her vehicle during a traffic stop. The West Tennessee Drug Task Force says agents with the 30th District out of Shelby County stopped the rental van and developed reasonable suspicion to believe criminal activity was occurring. Marijuana seized along I-40 on March 9. Courtesy: West TN Drug Task Force Director Johnie Carter stated that the driver denied consent to search the van, and the agent deployed his canine partner, Athena, who alerted him to the vehicle. Carter said a probable cause search revealed approximately 150 lbs. of marijuana hidden throughout the van. The woman taken into custody has not been identified. The case is being prosecuted by the Office of the District Attorney General, 28th Judicial District, Frederick Agee. The 30th interdiction unit operates by agreement on I-40 in Shelby and Haywood Counties.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/motorist-caught-with-150-pounds-of-marijuana-police/	2025-03-15T20:39:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/drug-bust.jpg?w=720

Ali Bradley covers developments on the southern border with a focus on human and drug smuggling, immigration enforcement efforts, and the failure to control the influx of migrants. Check out Bradley on the Border on YouTube now! (NewsNation) — Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, in an exclusive interview, told NewsNation that illegal border crossings have decreased by 95% compared to the previous administration, with recent daily encounters dropping to some of the lowest numbers in Border Patrol history. The secretary visited Nogales, Ariz., on Saturday to assess the border situation firsthand as illegal crossings hit their lowest levels since 1967. Noem’s message was clear: People should not come to the U.S. illegally. 'Just recently, we saw less than 200 encounters in a day. That's remarkable,' Noem said. 'Now our agents can get back to doing their jobs and enforcing the law instead of processing.' Trump orders military action against Houthi terrorists in Yemen Noem attributed the decrease to stricter enforcement policies under President Donald Trump's administration, including resumed border wall construction. She said that cartels are becoming 'more desperate' in response to increased border security. 'They recognize that we're enforcing our federal laws, that we're not letting people just walk across the border anymore,' Noem said. 'We are building a wall, we are securing our borders, and we're not going to let this illegal activity continue.' According to Noem, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested more than 32,000 individuals since Trump took office in January. Noem said all ICE arrests made in 2024 under the Biden administration, came up to 33,000. Noem said the administration is specifically targeting Tren de Aragua (TDA), which she described as 'an extremely dangerous gang from Venezuela' with thousands of members in the United States. Cartels shift smuggling tactics as border crossings drop She indicated that Guantanamo Bay is being used as a detention facility for individuals deemed especially dangerous. The administration has launched a self-deportation app called CBP Home, which Noem said is gaining 'momentum,' with hundreds using it so far. She warned that individuals with final removal orders who don't self-deport could face penalties of up to $700 per day. Regarding unaccompanied minors, Noem said the administration has reinstated DNA testing at the border to verify family relationships and prevent child trafficking. She acknowledged that some young cartel and gang members as young as 12 or 13 years old have entered the country as unaccompanied minors. 'They may be cartel members, but TDA members and MS-13 members that we're meeting are 12, 13 years old, but they're conducting criminal activities here, even though they're children,' Noem said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sec-noem-reports-reduced-border-crossings-aggressive-deportation-efforts/	2025-03-15T16:15:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-1-5.jpg?w=900
Trump orders military action against Houthi terrorists in Yemen	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has ordered the United States military to 'launch decisive and powerful' action against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. Trump made the announcement during a lengthy Truth Social post where he criticized former President Joe Biden's response to the group, and warned Iran they will face consequences should they continue to support the Houthis. 'Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,' Trump said in the post. 'No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.' 'Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies.

Trump orders military action against Houthi terrorists in Yemen	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has ordered the United States military to 'launch decisive and powerful' action against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. Trump made the announcement during a lengthy Truth Social post where he criticized former President Joe Biden's response to the group, and warned Iran they will face consequences should they continue to support the Houthis. 'Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,' Trump said in the post. 'No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.' 'Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.'

Trump signs a bill funding the government for 6 months, avoiding ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown and capping off a struggle in Congress that deeply divided Democrats. Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday. The bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion. The Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party — most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand. Senate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs. In the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired. 'A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,' Schumer said. 'Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.' Passage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats — something they've rarely been able to achieve in the past.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-trump-signs-a-bill-funding-the-government-for-6-months-avoiding-a-shutdown/	2025-03-15T11:06:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67d5c1ec440485.03525102.jpeg?w=900
‘Can be pretty depressing’: Formerly stuck astronaut on how he pe...	(NewsNation) — An astronaut who was formerly stuck in space for a month revealed how he managed to stay positive amid uncertainty. 'I looked at it like ‘I’ve got the rest of my life on earth, I’m going to make the most of my time in space,’' Terry Virts said on NewsNation’s 'Morning in America with Hena Doba.' Virts said without that mantra, things could have become 'pretty depressing.' The replacements for NASA’s two stuck astronauts launched to the International Space Station on Friday night, paving the way for the pair’s return after nine long months. Monster storm across the US sparks threat of tornadoes and fire, killing at least 17 Virts commended crews on the ground for keeping supplies flowing to the astronauts. 'Those types of little logistics, things that you wouldn't think about. NASA did great,' said Virts. 'They got the things that they needed. One of the biggest things: you have to have exercise shoes and that's super important because you have to exercise. Because if you don't, your bones and your muscles start to deteriorate.' Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams need SpaceX to get this relief team to the space station before they can check out. Arrival is set for late Saturday night. The duo will be escorted back by astronauts who flew up on a rescue mission on SpaceX last September alongside two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/astronaut-terry-virts-stuck-in-space/	2025-03-15T11:02:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-4-3.jpg?w=900
Pelosi shades Schumer on funding bill: ‘Listen to the women’	Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Friday issued a blistering statement on how senators should handle a government funding vote that, without naming him, dinged Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). 'Democratic senators should listen to the women,' Pelosi said. 'Appropriations leaders [Rep.] Rosa DeLauro [D-Conn.] and [Sen.] Patty Murray [D-Wash.] have eloquently presented the case that we must have a better choice: a four-week funding extension to keep government open and negotiate a bipartisan agreement.' 'America has experienced a Trump shutdown before – but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse. Democrats must not buy into this false choice. We must fight back for a better way. Listen to the women, For The People,' Pelosi said. The statement comes a day after Schumer announced that he would vote to advance the House GOP-drafted stopgap bill to fund the government until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, averting a government shutdown that would start early Saturday morning. Senate Republicans need at least eight Democrats to vote with them to advance the measure. Schumer argued that while the continuing resolution (CR) is 'very bad,' 'the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,' saying he believes it would allow President Trump 'to take even much more power via a government shutdown.' That position comes despite a wave of Senate Democrats opposing the funding bill, even those in competitive districts. Just one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden (Maine), voted for the funding patch in the House earlier this week after Democratic leaders there urged their caucus to vote against it. Pelosi praised House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) for that position earlier in her statement: 'I salute Leader Hakeem Jeffries for his courageous rejection of this false choice, and I am proud of my colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus for their overwhelming vote against this bill.' 'Donald Trump and Elon Musk have offered the Congress a false choice between a government shutdown or a blank check that makes a devastating assault on the well-being of working families across America,' Pelosi also said. 'Let’s be clear: neither is a good option for the American people. But this false choice that some are buying instead of fighting is unacceptable.' House Democrats, who are gathering for their annual issues retreat as their Senate counterparts grapple with the funding measure, are furious with Schumer for not holding the line and using a shutdown to negotiate a better funding deal.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pelosi-shades-schumer-on-funding-bill-listen-to-the-women/	2025-03-15T09:00:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/pelosinancy_022525gn01_w_29916c.jpg?w=900
Oklahoma man says Social Security benefits terminated without war...	OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — An Oklahoma City retiree says his Social Security benefits were suspended without warning — and with no explanation given when he reached out. He worries it may have to do with the place he was born, and ongoing Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cutbacks. The man, James McCaffrey, who was born to an active-duty U.S. soldier at an overseas Army base, says because of recent comments from DOGE leader Elon Musk, he’s worried his benefits were cut because of his foreign birthplace.Earlier this month, Musk, the billionaire head of DOGE, pushed for major cuts to Social Security, calling it a 'Ponzi scheme,' claiming the system is rife with people fraudulently receiving benefits. Particularly, Musk claimed during an interview with Fox Business, with no evidence, that many illegal immigrants are receiving benefits, calling for them to be removed from Social Security's rolls. The Hill reported economists say the levels of fraud Musk has talked about 'just don’t exist.' Earlier this month, NBC News reported former Social Security administrator Martin O’Malley warned that DOGE’s cuts to Social Security could disrupt benefits for millions of Americans for the first time since Social Security's founding. Now, McCaffrey worries he may have been one of the first of them. An unexpected bill and unanswered questions McCaffrey said he started to think something was often when he received an unexpected Medicare bill.'It said that I needed to pay $740 before the 25th of this month or I was going to lose my Medicare,' McCaffrey said.That seemed odd, since his Medicare payment is normally deducted from his Social Security check.'So I called Medicare,' he said. 'They returned my call after a wait and told me that they were unable to process it through my Social Security payment, that there was some problem with it. We talked for a bit. He kind of let it out that he thinks it’s a possibility that my Social Security was suspended.' And that — definitely didn’t make sense to McCaffrey.'I thanked him for his time and called Social Security,' he said.After more than two and a half hours on hold with Social Security, he finally got a callback.'They confirmed that my account was suspended,' McCaffrey said.He says Social Security never sent him any sort of notice this was happening, so he can’t be certain the exact day his benefits were canceled. But he knows it must have been sometime between the day he received his February Social Security check early in the month, and Feb. 27, the date written on the bill he received from Medicare. He asked the Social Security agent if there was anything she could do to fix it.'She said she was going to input some stuff and that she hoped that would take care of it,' he said.And by the next morning, sure enough, the issue had been fixed. 'I just got a simple email on my phone,' McCaffrey said. 'It said that my normal payment was going to resume in April.' The email didn’t mention anything about the March payment he never received. He took it upon himself to check his bank account, where he saw his March check had since been deposited. 'Well, that’s fine and dandy,' McAffrey said. 'I enjoyed that, but they gave me no explanation.' For him to get an explanation, he had to become his own detective of sorts. He thought back to an experience he had two years ago when he first went to a Social Security office to apply for benefits.'The first person I talked to at the Social Security Administration told me that I was not an American citizen,' McCaffrey said.McCaffrey was born on a U.S. Army base in Germany, where his father was stationed for active duty. He has an American birth certificate — officially stamped and sealed by the federal government.'I was on American soil,' he said. 'I’m American. She told me I was going to need to hire a lawyer, get a naturalization before I could even apply for Social Security.'But when he returned another day with his birth certificate and passport, a different employee told him there was no issue.'Got a different person, presented my things to him, and he says, ‘I don’t need these. You’re fine. I don’t know what. She’s just misinformed.’ And I’ve never had a problem with anything until [Tuesday],' McCaffrey said.Then he remembered something he had recently seen on TV. Elon Musk, the billionaire in charge of DOGE, spoke about Social Security during an interview on Fox Business Network. In the interview, Musk suggested, without citing evidence, that non-citizens in large numbers are receiving Social Security benefits, and called for them to be purged from the system. '[Federal entitlements] is also a mechanism by which Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants, by essentially paying them,' Musk said during the March 10 interview on Fox Business. 'If we turn off this gigantic money magnet for illegal immigrants, then they will leave.'That made McAffrey wonder about his own situation.'I think they went into Social Security and suspended all foreign addresses, whether you reside at home, born on them,' he said.KFOR reached out to the Social Security Administration for an explanation, but officials declined to comment, citing confidentiality rules, but the news station put them in touch with McCaffrey. He says a representative with the Social Security Administration called him on Wednesday, but still offered no explanation for why his benefits were terminated.'It makes me wonder how many other people are going to get — or have gotten — that same Medicare letter,' McCaffrey said.He worries about people who may not have the time and resources he had to get to the bottom of what happened and get his benefits back.'I’ve been a diligent Boy Scout type, I prepared,' he said. 'But, no, I shouldn’t have to.' McAffrey, 66, says there was one thing he most looked forward about retirement. 'More time with the grandkids,' McAffrey told Nexstar's KFOR. He said he made sure to save up enough retirement money to—quite frankly—spoil his three grandkids.'I went out and bought [my granddaughter] a new jacket,' McCaffrey said. 'She’s thrilled. And then her sister says, 'well, you know, she got a new jacket. Where’s mine?' I said, 'I’ll get you one.'' He also looked forward to being able to travel more with his wife, who is nearing retirement herself. But he thought all those dreams would have to come to a halt, after he opened his mail on Tuesday. 'I’d hate to have to turn around and say, ‘Well, I have to worry about my next check,’' he said.He also worries about people who may not share the same savings or the same financial cushion that he had to fall back on. 'And you interrupt that for seven days, two weeks or even longer, and they’re in bad trouble,' he said. 'They could be out of the house. They could be out of food. I don’t know.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/oklahoma-man-says-social-security-benefits-terminated-without-warning-or-explanation/	2025-03-15T05:45:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Oklahoma-City-man-says-social-security-benefits-terminated-without-warning-or-explanation_ed6242.png?w=859
Schumer brushes off leadership questions: ‘My caucus and I are in...	(The Hill) — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) brushed off questions surrounding his leadership and defended his decision to vote to advance the six-month GOP-crafted continuing resolution (CR) that will fund the government through the end of September, saying during an interview that he and his caucus are on the same page. Schumer was asked on CNN by Jake Tapper if the long-time lawmaker was 'worried' about his leadership position after getting fierce pushback from House Democrats and some senators in his conference about his decision to vote to move forward a funding bill that he said previously was 'bad.' 'I think I had the overwhelming support in my caucus, and so many of the members thanked me and said, 'You did what you thought was courageous, and we respect it.' I think my caucus and I are in sync, and everyone knew what I was doing and respected it,' Schumer said during his Friday appearance on CNN. Schumer told Senate Democrats during a lunch meeting Thursday and later in the day affirmed that he would vote to advance the GOP-led CR in order to avoid a shutdown. On Wednesday, he said the House bill did not have enough votes to pass. 'I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country, to minimize the harms to the American people. Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down,' Schumer said Thursday on the Senate floor. The New York senator emphasized, again, on Friday that the House funding resolution is a 'bad bill,' but also argued that it would be 'far worse to give [President] Donald Trump the keys to the city and the country,' if the CR fails. 'We all know that [Elon] Musk and DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] and Trump want to decimate the federal government and letting them shut down the government, allowing them to shut down the government, they would have done it within two, three weeks,' Schumer said on Friday before the final vote on the resolution. Schumer, along with nine other Democrats, voted with Republicans to help advance the CR to the final vote. The bill advanced with a 62-38 vote on Friday. Shortly after, the Senate passed the House-led bill to avert a government shutdown with a 54-46 vote. Only two Democrats, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with the party, voted for the measure. On the Republican side, only Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) voted against the CR. Only one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden (Maine), who represents a battleground district, voted for the CR in the lower chamber. Tapper asked Schumer what message he wants to give to those toss-up district House Democrats as well as senators in purple states that opted against backing the funding bill. 'I respect what the House members did. I'm glad all of them voted against it, but as I said, it is much different in the Senate, where if you would have voted against the bill, and the bill would have gone down, the whole government would have shut down from one end to the other, creating dramatic and huge hardship for tens of millions of Americans,' Schumer said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/schumer-brushes-off-leadership-questions-my-caucus-and-i-are-in-sync/	2025-03-15T05:33:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/schumerchuck_031125gn05_w-e1741996336395.jpg?w=800
Monster storm across the US sparks threat of tornadoes in US Sout...	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The threat of tornadoes moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday, a day after a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that damaged buildings, whipped up deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Multiple tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, just some of the extreme weather that was forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south. The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings early Saturday morning for areas in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana and Texas. Three people were killed Friday in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo County in the Texas Panhandle, according to Sgt. Cindy Barkley of the state’s department of public safety. One pileup involved an estimated 38 cars. 'It’s the worst I’ve ever seen,' Barkley said, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. 'We couldn’t tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled.' Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. 'This is terrible out here,' said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot (14.6-meter) trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. 'There’s a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I’m not pushing it over 55 mph. I’m scared it will blow over if I do.' Forecasters said the severe storm threat would continue into the weekend with a high chance of tornadoes and damaging winds Saturday in Mississippi and Alabama. Heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some parts of the East Coast on Sunday. Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. 'What’s unique about this one is its large size and intensity,' said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. 'And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.' Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The weather service said at least five tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, including one in the Saint Louis area. Several buildings were damaged. The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. 'Potentially violent' tornadoes were expected Saturday in parts of the central Gulf Coast and Deep South into the Tennessee Valley, according to the National Weather Service. The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa would be at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle. Wildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditions Wildfires in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&amp;M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 300,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according the website poweroutage.us. Blizzard warnings in Northern Plains The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. ___ Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia, and Golden from Seattle.

DHS revokes visa of one Columbia student, arrests another pro-Pal...	The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Friday it has revoked the visa of one Columbia University student and arrested another person involved in the pro-Palestinian protests, escalating its crackdown on those engaged in demonstrations over the conflict in Gaza. The stripping of the visa comes just days after the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a former grad student at the university, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Khalil has a green card, which can only be revoked by an immigration judge. But Ranjani Srinivasan, a citizen of India and doctoral student in urban planning at Columbia University, had her F-1 student visa revoked on March 5, according to DHS. The federal agency said Srinivasan 'was involved in activities supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization,' sharing a video of her passing through airport security. Columbia said it would not comment on individual students. Another protester, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested by ICE for allegedly overstaying her F-1 student visa. Kordia's visa was terminated back in January of 2022 for lack of attendance, and she was arrested in April 2024 over her involvement in the pro-Palestinian protests on campus. 'Columbia has no record of this individual being registered as a current or former student at the University,' a university spokesperson said. An official with the university said there is no record that Kordia was arrested on campus or involved in campus activities. The university believes she was arrested outside the school on public streets. DHS did not give specifics about the alleged activities of either student. In announcing Srinivasan’s departure, DHS promoted its new app, the CBP Home App, adding that the Srinivasan used the app’s new 'self-deport' feature by uploading her travel plans and indicating her intent to leave the country. 'It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. The Trump administration has been under fire by free speech experts for releasing few details about the foreign students it has targeted and potentially conflating their First Amendment right to protest with illegal actions such as giving a terrorist group monetary resources. F-1 student visa holders only have 15 days to leave the country after the visas are revoked. Student visas can be revoked for multiple reasons, including criminal concerns, prolonged absence from school, giving incorrect information or changing schools without permission. The announcement shows an expansion of activity since ICE arrested Khalil, a lead negotiator during the Columbia pro-Palestinian encampment last spring. Immigration and civil rights advocates have blasted the move, calling it an abuse of federal immigration authorities to target free speech. Khalil’s attorneys have sued to get his case moved to New York after ICE took him more than 1,000 miles away from his home to be held in Louisiana. His lawyers noted Khalil has yet to be charged with a crime, and it is still unclear what activities the federal government targeted him over. The Foundation for Individuals Rights and Expression has sent a letter to the Trump administration demanding to know the reason for the arrest. Federal officials, including President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, said Khalil’s detention was only the beginning of targeting foreign students who participated in the encampments. 'We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again,' Trump said. 'If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America’s Colleges and Universities to comply.' The DHS announcement comes a day after its agents searched two Columbia dorm rooms, with the university saying the agents obtained two judicial warrants but gave no information about why the search was conducted or who was the target. —Updated at 3:06 p.m. EDT	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/dhs-revokes-visa-of-one-columbia-student-arrests-another/	2025-03-14T11:49:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25072629698923-e1741887462154.jpg?w=900
DOGE cuts could hinder weather forecasting	(NewsNation) — The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has begun plans to lay off 10% of the current workforce, cuts experts are warning could reduce the ability to accurately warn Americans of severe weather. That comes as the country heads into the warmer months and faces increasing risks from severe storms. In 2024, there were a historic 1,796 tornadoes, 11 hurricanes and 27 weather disasters where losses exceeded $1 billion. NOAA cuts hit key areas It's not the first round of layoffs for the agency, and by the end of the cuts, NOAA will have eliminated 1 out of every 4 jobs. AOC: Schumer’s intent to vote for budget bill a ‘slap in the face’ 'This is not government efficiency,' said former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad. 'It is the first step toward eradication. There is no way to make these kinds of cuts without removing or strongly compromising mission capabilities.' In addition to layoffs, two NOAA facilities that are essential to weather forecasting were on a list of lease cancelations made by the Department of Government Efficiency. After reporting on the leases emerged, a White House source told Axios the leases had not been formally canceled but were under evaluation. Already, the Trump administration has had to backtrack on some layoffs at the agency. NOAA recently rehired hurricane hunters caught up in layoffs. Those meteorologists fly directly into hurricanes to collect data that helps predict and track deadly storms. What does NOAA do? The agency is responsible for the National Weather Service, which provides daily weather forecasts. NOAA also provides monitoring and warnings about hurricanes, tornados, floods and tsunamis; provides navigation information to ships and weather data to the FAA; and also plays a role in warnings about space weather that could damage the electrical grid. Education Department investigating dozens of universities after DEI warning letter NOAA also performs functions that couldn't easily be replicated by private industry, like radar and satellite data that require expensive building, launching and maintaining satellites and analyzing all the data that returns from them. The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore warned that NOAA cuts could lead to less accurate forecasting. NWS data is currently available for free and is not just used by individuals seeking forecasts but by private forecasting companies as well. Could cuts put Americans at risk for severe weather? Many Americans rely on the National Weather Service's free forecasts, which are accessible to the public and also used by news media to warn of storms. The NWS is often the first to issue alerts for dangerous weather like tornadoes, giving people more time to take cover. Without the NWS, forecasting would fall to private companies. However, those companies, including ones like AccuWeather that offer free forecasts, typically rely on NWS data to generate their own forecasts. If the data provided were reduced, companies would have to figure out how to gather it (potentially at high cost) or attempt to forecast with reduced information. Nearly half of Americans say economy worsening: Poll There's also the question of liability and whether media networks or private companies would want to take on the legal risk of issuing things like severe weather alerts where an inaccurate forecast could result in deaths. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which lays out a conservative blueprint for the future of the country, suggests the NWS should retain its data-gathering capabilities but commercialize its forecasting operations.

AOC: Schumer's move a 'slap in the face'	(NewsNation) — U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Thursday criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for voicing his intent to vote for a Republican-sponsored budget bill to avoid a government shutdown, calling it a 'deep sense of betrayal' to 'this very dark time,' and a 'slap in the face.' 'I cannot underscore enough how incorrect that is if they vote for the CR (continuing resolution),' the congresswoman told NewsNation. '... I think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there's a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as as currently planned Trump to deliver speech at DOJ on ‘restoring law and order’ Schumer’s support for a CR has angered a broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, and Schumer himself even called the legislation 'terrible.' It’s the same bill that House Democrats almost unanimously opposed on Tuesday, in part because House Republicans would not negotiate with them. Ocasio-Cortez said that Democrats have time to 'correct course.' 'People think this is a left issue or right issue. It's not. It's genuinely not,' she told NewsNation. 'This is about our values and what we stand for, and it's about the right thing and the wrong thing, and we have time to correct course.' The continuing resolution would mostly keep current funding levels through September but would add $6 billion for defense spending and cut $13 billion from nondefense programs. Democrats oppose these cuts, which they say would impact health care, veterans, housing, food programs and more. Ocasio-Cortez asks DOJ: Am I under investigation? While the Senate is set to vote on the GOP legislation Friday before the midnight funding deadline, it’s not yet clear whether eight Senate Democrats will join their Republican colleagues and vote for it to pass. But Schumer’s announcement makes it more likely, muddies any sort of unified front and highlights a leadership vacuum in the party. House Democratic leadership made clear their ire at Schumer’s announcement. Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and caucus chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., released a joint statement late Thursday night saying they remain strongly opposed to 'the far-right Republican funding bill,' one they say 'will unleash havoc on everyday Americans, giving Donald Trump and Elon Musk even more power to continue dismantling the federal government.'

Global alert issued for missing college student Sudiksha Konanki	(NewsNation) — Interpol has issued an international alert for Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student who went missing during a spring break trip to the Dominican Republic. A yellow notice is typically issued for 'unexplained disappearances,' according to Interpol. The notices are used to give 'high, international visibility' to cases, and since abducted or missing people are flagged to border officials, it makes travel difficult. Konanki, a citizen of India and a permanent U.S. resident, was last seen at the Riu República Hotel, just north of Punta Cana in the La Altagracia district, around 4 a.m. on March 6. She was one of six female University of Pittsburgh students who traveled together for spring break on March 3. Missing college student timeline: Where is Sudiksha Konanki? Police say she disappeared at a beach near the hotel before dawn, after she and other guests had headed outside amid a power outage. The group was accompanied by two American men. Konanki stayed on the beach with one of the men while the rest of the group returned to the hotel. The Dominican Civil Defense and a search-and-rescue unit have been working to locate Konanki. Drones, helicopters and detection dogs are also being used in the search. Dominican police say they've been reinterviewing people who were with Konanki before she went missing. Investigators have been using drones, helicopters and detection dogs to search waters off the island's east coast. The public prosecutor’s office said Konanki’s friends have been interviewed. Wisconsin police release details on missing teen's recovery Police also spoke with a man in his 20s who was allegedly at the beach around the same time as Konanki and may have been the last person to see her. NewsNation will not name the man unless he is named officially as a person of interest or a suspect in this case. Authorities have not said there is any sign of foul play, and the leading theory among law enforcement is that she drowned. Konanki's family is pushing investigators to consider the possibility she may have been abducted.

SpaceX mission to replace stuck NASA astronauts set to launch Fri...	(NewsNation) — NASA and SpaceX's mission to relieve Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been in orbit for nine months, is set to lift off Friday. A Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to launch the Crew-10 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 7:03 p.m. ET, with a backup opportunity available Saturday evening. With a Friday launch, the crew is expected to dock at the International Space Station on Saturday at 11:30 p.m. Watch: American Airlines plane evacuated after fire Once on board the ISS, there will be a handover period, which has been shortened due to concerns about commodities on the ISS after an upcoming supply mission experienced an issue. The Crew-9 will then return, along with Wilmore and Williams.

Trump to deliver speech at DOJ on 'restoring law and order'	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump on Friday will give a speech at the Department of Justice on 'restoring law and order' and 'ending the weaponization of justice,' according to the White House. Trump is also expected to discuss his plans for 'removing violent criminals from our communities.' The decision to speak at the Justice Department is unusual for a sitting president, though not unprecedented. Presidents typically keep the department at arm's length to avoid politicizing it — but Trump contends it has been politicized already. Trump's remarks are expected around 3 p.m. ET. Democrats struggling with unified strategy to oppose Trump, Musk As far as federal institutions go, few have drawn Trump's ire quite like the DOJ. Trump signed an executive order the day of his inauguration aimed at rooting out what he called 'weaponization of the federal government' from top to bottom. Trump's 2024 campaign rhetoric focused on the same topics he is expected to address Friday. His presidential run coincided with his own legal troubles. Nearly half of Americans say economy worsening: Poll Department of Justice overhaul One of the biggest factors in the DOJ's changing landscape is who is in charge, and their initiatives. Trump's new departmental leadership includes Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and FBI head Kash Patel. Blanche was once Trump's personal lawyer for his criminal cases. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump’s first impeachment defense team, and she was among a group of Republicans who showed up to support Trump at his New York hush money criminal trial that ended last May with a conviction on 34 felony counts. In addition to his conviction for falsifying business records, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023.

'In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the President’s agenda. This action is consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government,' a DOJ official said in a statement. Trump has instructed the DOJ to terminate all U.S. attorneys appointed by former President Joe Biden, contending a 'clean house' is needed to move forward.

Democrats struggling with unified strategy to oppose Trump, Musk	(NewsNation) — It looks like Democrats will have to wait a while longer for party unity. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced on Thursday night that he would vote for a Republican-sponsored budget bill to avoid a government shutdown, even while calling the legislation 'terrible.' It’s the same bill that House Democrats almost unanimously opposed on Tuesday, in part because House Republicans would not negotiate with them. The bill, called a continuing resolution, would mostly keep current funding levels through September but would add $6 billion for defense spending and cut $13 billion from nondefense programs. Democrats oppose these cuts, which they say would impact health care, veterans, housing, food programs and more. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called Schumer’s decision 'a huge slap in the face,' and one that she said leaves her and many Democratic House colleagues feeling betrayed and outraged. Nearly half of Americans say economy worsening: Poll Ocasio-Cortez made these comments to reporters, including NewsNation, while attending the Issues Conference, a three-day retreat in Leesburg, Virginia, for House Democrats. Through a series of news conferences at the event, it was clear that House Democrats are trying to hone their message to voters: that they are unified in pushing back against President Donald Trump’s administration while proactively working to make Americans' lives better. While the Senate is set to vote on the GOP legislation Friday before the midnight funding deadline, it’s not yet clear whether eight Senate Democrats will join their Republican colleagues and vote for it to pass. But Schumer’s announcement makes it more likely, muddies any sort of unified front and highlights a leadership vacuum in the party. House Democratic leadership made clear their ire at Schumer’s announcement. Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and caucus chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., released a joint statement late Thursday night saying they remain strongly opposed to 'the far-right Republican funding bill,' one they say 'will unleash havoc on everyday Americans, giving Donald Trump and Elon Musk even more power to continue dismantling the federal government.' Ironically, Schumer used similar logic to come to his decision. In a speech on the floor of the Senate, he said, 'A shutdown would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk carte blanche to destroy vital government services at a significantly faster rate than they can right now under shutdown.' Trump pushes annexation of Greenland during meeting with NATO secretary He said the Trump administration would have full authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel nonessential and worried that Republicans in Congress would cherry-pick the agencies and services to reopen, leaving others they don’t like to languish. But Ocasio-Cortez and many others argue that a shutdown is not inevitable and that a 30-day continuing resolution could pass, allowing the parties to negotiate. While Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune told NewsNation he’s open to giving Democrats a vote on a 30-day funding bill, the chance of it getting the necessary support from GOP senators is slim. On this continuing resolution, Republicans have outplayed Democrats, forcing them into a difficult decision: Vote for a bill you believe will hurt Americans, or vote for a government shutdown you believe will hurt Americans. All hope is not lost for Democrats, though. At the Issues Conference, representatives expressed optimism that they were learning lessons from recent election losses and that they could flip the script on Republicans. Leading up to November’s elections, Trump and Republicans would ask, 'Is your life better today than it was four years ago?' During a news conference for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., asked, '50 plus days into this administration, do you feel better today than you did 50 days ago?' He believes it’s been chaotic and pointed out the fear some of his constituents have over Trump’s actions, including tariffs. During the election cycle, the GOP called out Democrats, saying they were too focused on culture-war issues and not on the economy. Dems are now beating that drum in return. DOGE’s next round of layoffs may harm veterans 'I appear to live rent-free in the minds of some of my Republican colleagues. I wish that they would spend even a fraction of the time that they spend thinking about me, thinking about how to lower the costs for American families,' said Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first openly transgender member of Congress. Many members sounded a similar alarm on threats to the economy, housing, education and social safety net programs. Jeffries shared that Democrats would hold a day of action in support of Medicaid, with hundreds of events expected around the country on Tuesday, March 18. And Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, announced that he and Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, launched a new podcast called 'The Fly-In' to talk about politics and maybe even the Dallas Cowboys. He acknowledged podcasts are an important way to communicate with voters who get their news that way and are a messaging tool Democrats did not take enough advantage of last cycle. Rep. Sam Liccardo, D-Calif., said that Democratic strategist James Carville spoke at the conference and advised Democrats to focus their message versus diluting it by responding to everything Trump does. That message is starting to come into focus. Democrats all share a belief that Trump is not focused on cost-of-living issues and instead, in partnership with Elon Musk, is looking to make cuts to programs like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security to enact tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. Democrats just haven’t figured out a unified strategy to fight back. For the sake of their supporters, they need to hurry up.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democrats-unified-strategy-trump-musk/	2025-03-14T02:55:42-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/schumerchuck_klobucharamy_012825gn01_w_148d5e.jpg?w=900
US and Israel look to Africa for resettling Palestinians uprooted...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for resettling Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump's proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials say. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a 'beautiful area.' Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts. Under Trump’s plan, Gaza’s more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the U.S. would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project. The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a ' bold vision.' Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime. Still, the White House says Trump 'stands by his vision.' Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place. Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions. Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives — financial, diplomatic and security — to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords — a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries. The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts. The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls 'voluntary' emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a 'very large emigration department' within its Defense Ministry. Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached. Sudan The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020. As part of the deal, the U.S. removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group. The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden's administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide. The U.S. and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support. Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians. One of them said the contacts began even before Trump's inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. 'This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,' said one official. 'No one opened this matter again.' Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders’ summit last week in Cairo that his country 'categorically rejects' any plan that aims to transfer 'the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.' Somaliland Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory. Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority. An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the U.S. was 'having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the U.S. in exchange for recognition.' The possibility of U.S. recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory’s solidarity with the Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory's strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally. Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia’s ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world. An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians. Somalia Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump’s plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move. Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule. 'The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda in why Somalia,' Chepkorir said. A Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it. ___ Lee reported from Washington, and Magdy reported from Cairo.

Putin will talk peace while continuing to fight: Wesley Clark	(NewsNation) — Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion Thursday he supports a ceasefire with Ukraine comes with many caveats that could scuttle a peace deal, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley Clark says. Ukrainian leaders have already agreed to a 30-day halt in fighting, and now, U.S. representatives are seeking Russia’s acceptance so that talks for lasting peace can begin in earnest. Putin said he supports the ceasefire in concept but said any permanent solution must address the 'root causes' of the conflict. 'What’s the root cause? The root cause is Ukraine wants to be aligned with the West. It wants protection from Russian interference,' Clark told 'NewsNation Now.' What are Ukraine’s critical minerals and why does Trump want them? Putin would like to roll back NATO and absorb additional close neighbors such as the Baltic states and Bulgaria, the retired U.S. Army general said. He predicted Putin may take part in negotiations while trying to maintain the upper hand militarily. 'It’s talk, talk, fight, fight,' Clark said. Putin has limits: Ex-ambassador Putin is a former KGB official who knows how to manipulate people, says John Herbst, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush. Herbst told 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that Putin will try to manipulate President Trump if Ukraine peace talks move forward. 'Of course he can’t be trusted,' Herbst said of Putin. 'And he’s demonstrated that over the past 20 years, breaking multiple treaties, breaking multiple commitments.' And yet Putin realizes he cannot be seen as double-crossing Trump, the former ambassador said. 'I would not dismiss the idea that Putin has a certain wariness with Trump,' Herbst said. 'He believes he’s able to persuade him, but he also understands, I think, that if he crosses Trump and Trump understands that, that can be very bad for Putin and for Russia.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/putin-ceasefire-reaction/	2025-03-13T16:37:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/putin.jpg?w=900
Schumer says he will vote to advance GOP spending bill, lowering ...	Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) announced on the Senate floor Thursday that he plans to vote to advance a House-passed six-month government funding bill, despite the strong opposition of many Democrats who say the bill would create a 'slush fund' for President Trump and Elon Musk. 'I will vote to keep the government open, and not shut it down,' Schumer said on the Senate floor. Schumer is only the second Senate Democrat to state definitively his intention to vote to advance the GOP-written bill — joining Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.). But it’s highly likely he will give political cover to other Democrats to vote to advance the 99-page package. He said there are a number of undecided votes in his caucus and that colleagues are reviewing the House bill carefully. 'As of [Wednesday] there were not enough votes to pass it, I thought I would let people know that. But there are a bunch of undecided votes and as members study it and look at it, each will make his or her own decision,' he later told reporters at a pen-and-pad briefing. Still, his announcement didn't immediately stem the tide of Democratic 'no' votes. Sen. Jon Ossoff (Ga.), who is considered the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbent, announced late Thursday evening that he would oppose the House bill. He said the bill 'guts NIH research into diseases like Alzheimer’s and maternal mortality, funding for the prevention of violence against women, and Army Corps of Engineers construction of water infrastructure.' Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who won election to the Senate last year in a state that Trump carried, also announced late Thursday evening that she would vote against the House bill. 'I will be voting no on the continuing resolution tomorrow. First, because this bill is bad for Michigan. It makes significant cuts to Michigan's key infrastructure projects,' she said. 'But on top of that, my Republican colleagues offered no assurances that the money wouldn't be redirected at the whip of Elon Musk,' she said. It also followed similar pronouncements earlier in the day. Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ruben Gallego (R-Ariz.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) all also said they are against it, panning Republicans for their one-sided crafting of the bill and airing concerns that the bill allows Trump and Musk to continue running roughshod over the government. 'I cannot vote for the Republican plan to give unchecked power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk,' Kelly said in a statement. 'I told Arizonans I’d stand up when it was right for our state and our country, and this is one of those moments.' Schumer and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) still need to work out a time agreement for voting on the House funding package. Democrats want amendments to the bill, including a substitute proposal to fund the government for 30 days. Congress must pass a funding measure by the end of Friday to avoid a shutdown. Schumer said he agrees with Democratic colleagues who say the bill is a bad piece of legislation, but he warned that failure to pass it could trigger a far worse outcome: a government shutdown. 'While the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse. For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean CR, it is deeply partisan. It doesn’t address far too many of this country’s needs, but I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,' he said on the floor. Schumer argued that a shutdown would lead to the shuttering of regional Veterans Affairs offices, leaving veterans without crucial services, and could empower Trump to lay off more staff at the Social Security Administration, hurting seniors and people with disabilities. The Democratic leader’s announcement on the Senate floor marks a dramatic turnaround from the day before, when he declared that the House GOP bill did not have enough votes to advance in the upper chamber and demanded a vote on a clean 30-day government funding stopgap sponsored by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). But Schumer on Thursday evening said the efforts to muster Republican votes for Murray’s proposal fell flat. 'Patty Murray worked extremely hard as did our Appropriations Committee members to get Republicans to go along with a 30-day bill so they could do what they really like to do, which is write a whole big appropriations bill, and they wouldn’t go along,' he told reporters 'That’s regrettable, very, very regrettable,' he said. Schumer told Senate Democratic colleagues at a lunch meeting earlier Thursday that he would support a procedural motion known as cloture to advance the House-passed bill. Senate Republicans control 53 seats and need eight Democratic votes to advance the House GOP-drafted continuing resolution to a final vote. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says he will vote against the measure because it doesn’t do enough to cut the deficit. The legislation, which would increase defense spending by $6 billion and cut non-defense programs by $13 billion, needs 60 votes to advance to a final vote. Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the House-passed funding bill 'a dumpster fire.' Schumer’s decision to support the House bill was met with immediate criticism from Democratic progressives, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in an interview Thursday afternoon it would be a 'tremendous mistake' for Schumer to vote to advance the House Republican funding resolution. Asked about criticism of his decision, Schumer said, 'The bottom line is you have to make these decisions based on what is best for not only your party, but your country,' he said. 'I firmly believe … that I’ve made the right decision,' he said. 'I believe that my members understand that I came to that conclusion and respect it. … People realize it’s a tough choice but realize I made the decision based on what I thought were the merits and I think they respect it.'

What alcohol would cost more under 200% Trump tariff?	(NewsNation) — Under a 200% proposed tariff on imported alcoholic beverages, many summer favorite cocktails could become significantly more expensive. The 200% tariff could more than double the cost of European wine and other alcohol for U.S. distributors, which would almost assuredly trickle down to U.S. bars and restaurants and eventually to American consumers, Michael Bilello, the executive vice president of strategic communications for Wine and Spirit Wholesalers of America, told NewsNation. 'If the intention of tariffs is to impose some discomfort on other countries, what we respectfully ask the administration to consider is that these will likely become burdens on U.S. businesses and U.S. consumers,' Bilello said. Prosecco, champagne and other European wines One of the hardest hit beverages would be wine imported from Europe, particularly the selections that cannot be made in the U.S. Prosecco, a sparkling white wine that comes from nine Italian provinces, overtook champagne as the top-selling wine in the U.S. Champagne, which can only be produced in the Champagne region of France, is routinely used for U.S. celebrations, which helps to drive U.S. sales. The Associated Press reported that with the 200% tariff, a previously untariffed $15 bottle of Prosecco would jump to $45 should the 200% tariff be imposed. Additionally, Bordeaux, a popular red wine produced in southwest France, also falls into the single-origin category that could dramatically hit U.S. businesses should the tariff be imposed. Bilello says that 35% of American wine and spirit sales are generated by products imported from Europe. Close-up of hands toasting champagne flutes during dinner party at home Does Canada really have tariffs above 200% on US dairy products? 'We want toasts not tariffs,' Chris Swonger, Distilled Spirits Council president and CEO, said in a statement issued by the organization. Cognac, Aperol and other spirits Cognac, a variety of brandy named after a commune in Cognac, France, and Aperol, the Italian base for a popular summertime cocktail, are among the products that would be included in the tariff against European countries. Although spirits sales may not be as affected as the wine industry, Trump's actions against other countries have already impacted American drinkers. Could Guinness cost more this St. Patrick's Day? Beer sales, which grow significantly around St. Patrick's Day, could also be hit. Although Guinness is brewed domestically in Baltimore, other brews, including those from companies in Germany, could be hit. While Trump previously imposed tariffs during his first presidency, the steep nature of the tariff he suggested against E.U.-represented countries would not only be disruptive but economically devastating to U.S. companies. Tequila already affected by Mexico tariffs Trump previously announced a 25% tariff on products coming from Mexico, which would directly impact tequila, which can only be legally produced in specific regions of Mexico. Tequila remains the base for the margarita, the No. 1-ordered alcohol beverage in America, Bilello said. Alcoholic Lime Margarita with Tequila and Sea Salt (Getty Images Can the US make some of these spirits and wines? Although some U.S. states produce alcoholic beverages like California, Washington and Oregon wines or Champagne-produced products that would be otherwise directly affected by the tariffs, Bilello said there is not enough production happening to fill the gap that would be created. Some U.S. manufacturers have begun making agave-produced spirits to replicate the plant (tor piña) that serves as the base of tequila. However, agave plants need 7 to 9 years to mature, Bilello said, again making the U.S. reliant on foreign producers. 'Importers and wholesalers will be incapable of absorbing a 200% tariff on these products,' Bilello told NewsNation. 'There’s little doubt, there’s zero debate on this. This is going to be more expensive for consumers and American businesses,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/alcohol-cost-more-200-percent-trump-tariff/	2025-03-13T11:51:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25071702458124-e1741815371181.jpg?w=800
Trump administration tariffs create uncertainty for brewery owner	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration's threats of a global trade war have left small businesses facing uncertainty. On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne and spirits. The proposed tariff is a response to the European Union's planned 50% tariff on American whiskey. It is expected to go into effect April 1. Does Canada really have tariffs above 200% on US dairy products? There is currently a 25% tariff on most goods coming from Mexico and Canada that officially went into effect on March 4 after a 30-day pause. Kevin Cary, owner of Begyle Brewing in Chicago, said his brewery imports about 200,000 pounds of barley from Canada each year and that the tariffs would hurt the brewery's margins. On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, another expense for Cary's business as they need enough to produce about 1 million cans each year. He says the back-and-forth is leaving him confused. 'It's hard when you're managing any business to not really know what you're going to do in a month or three months or a year,' Cary said. 'It impacts hiring and contracts.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trump-tariffs-uncertainty-brewery-owner/	2025-03-13T11:18:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/GettyImages-1165269799-1.jpg?w=900
Jewish protesters flood Trump Tower's lobby to demand the Columbi...	NEW YORK (AP) — Demonstrators from a Jewish group filled the lobby of Trump Tower on Thursday to denounce the immigration arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist who helped lead protests against Israel at Columbia University. The Jewish Voice for Peace protesters, who carried banners and wore red shirts reading 'Jews say stop arming Israel,' chanted 'Bring Mahmoud home now!' After warning the protesters to leave the Fifth Avenue building, officers arrested 98 of them on various charges including trespassing, obstruction and resisting arrest, a police official said at a news briefing. Khalil, a 30-year-old permanent U.S. resident who is married to an American citizen and who hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, was arrested outside his New York City apartment on Saturday and faces deportation. He's being held at an immigration detention center in Louisiana. President Donald Trump has said Khalil’s arrest was the first 'of many to come' and vowed on social media to deport students who he said engage in 'pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.' The White House didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the Trump Tower demonstration. Among those who took part in Thursday's protest was actor Debra Winger, who has discussed her Jewish faith and upbringing over the years. Winger accused the Trump administration of having 'no interest in Jewish safety' and 'co-opting antisemitism.' 'I’m just standing up for my rights, and I’m standing up for Mahmoud Khalil, who has been abducted illegally and taken to an undisclosed location,' she told The Associated Press. 'Does that sound like America to you?' Protester Sophie Edelhart, who studies Yiddish at a school in Canada, said she took part in the demonstration because she didn't want to 'cede ground' to Trump and 'fascism.' She said the building, with its golden escalator that Trump rode before announcing his 2016 presidential run, was a symbolic target. Trump Tower serves as headquarters for the Trump Organization and is where the president stays when he is in New York. The skyscraper often attracts demonstrations, both against and in support of its namesake, though protests inside are less common. The building’s main entrance opens to a multi-story atrium that is open to the public and connects visitors to stores and eateries such as the Trump Grill. Kaz Daughtry, the deputy mayor for public safety and a former longtime New York Police Department official, said no one was injured in Thursday's protest. But he said the city would assess the situation and review its procedures 'so this cannot happen again.' Khalil’s supporters say Khalil's arrest is an attack on free speech and have staged protests elsewhere in the city and around the country. Hundreds demonstrated Wednesday outside a Manhattan courthouse during a brief hearing on his case. Columbia was a focal point of the pro-Palestinian protest movement that swept across U.S. college campuses last year and led to more than 2,000 arrests. On Thursday, Khalil and seven students identified by pseudonyms filed a lawsuit seeking to block a Congressional committee from obtaining Columbia and Barnard College disciplinary records for students involved in campus protests. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan against the schools, the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce and its chairman, Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., seeks a permanent injunction barring Congress from forcing the schools to provide the records and the universities from complying with it. The committee sent a letter last month demanding that Columbia and Barnard provide the records or risk billions of dollars in federal funding. The plaintiffs contend that the committee is abusing its power in an attempt 'to chill and suppress speech and association based on the viewpoint expressed' and that its investigation 'threatens to significantly infringe on First Amendment rights.' Message seeking comment were left for spokespeople for Walberg, the committee and Barnard College. Columbia declined to comment on the pending litigation. Khalil, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, finished his requirements for a Columbia master’s degree in December. Born in Syria, he is a grandson of Palestinians who were forced to leave their homeland, his lawyers said in a legal filing. ___ Associated Press reporters Michael Hill in Albany, and Michelle L.

Federal judge rules Trump must reinstate many fired federal emplo...	A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Trump administration must reinstate probationary government employees fired unlawfully at several agencies, lambasting the Justice Department at a hearing for a 'sham' gambit that enabled a key official to avoid testifying in the case. U.S. District Judge William Alsup’s ruling broadens his previous order to now require the government to reinstate probationary employees fired on Feb. 13 and 14 at the Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury departments. The case is one of multiple pending lawsuits challenging the mass terminations of probationary workers, who are usually in their first or second year in a role. The firings are just one dimension of a broader effort by the new Trump administration to reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked dozens of lawsuits. Alsup issued his ruling from the bench after criticizing the government for withdrawing a sworn declaration it submitted from acting Office of Personnel Management (OPM) head Charles Ezell so he wouldn’t have to testify and face cross-examination at Thursday’s hearing, as the judge had ordered. 'Come on, that's a sham. Go ahead. It upsets me, I want you to know that. I've been practicing or serving in this court for over 50 years, and I know how do we get at the truth,' said Alsup, an appointee of former President Clinton. 'And you're not helping me get at the truth. You're giving me press releases, sham documents,' the judge added. Ezell has played a central role in the lawsuit filed by a coalition of government employee unions, as it revolves around claims that Ezell and the OPM directed the firings of probationary employees, not individual federal agencies, in violation of the law and the separation of powers. The judge had ordered Ezell to testify in his San Francisco courtroom Thursday to discuss his declaration. After the judge on Monday refused to relieve Ezell from testifying, the government withdrew the document so he wouldn’t have to show. 'Whenever you submit declarations, those people should be submitted to cross-examination, just like the plaintiffs’ side should be. And we can then we get at the truth of whether that's what your story is actually true,' Alsup said Thursday. 'I tend to doubt it. I tend to doubt that you're telling me the truth,' he told the government. Later in the hearing, the judge apologized to Justice Department attorney Kelsey Helland for getting mad and clarified he hasn’t done anything 'dishonorable' and is 'doing the best he can with the case he’s got.' 'I respectfully disagree that we have submitted false evidence or have withdrawn evidence in an attempt to frustrate Your Honor’s efforts to find the truth,' Helland told the judge at one point. Though Thursday’s ruling marks the most expansive block a federal judge has issued on the administration’s efforts to fire probationary employees, it is just one of several lawsuits currently pending on the issue. Democratic state attorneys general and individual employees have also sued. 'The words that I give you today should not be taken as some kind of wild and crazy judge in San Francisco has said that the administration cannot engage in a reduction in force. I'm not saying that at all,' Alsup noted as he issued his ruling. 'Of course, if he does, it has to comply with the statutory requirements: the Reduction In Force act, the Civil Service Act, the Constitution, maybe other statutes,' the judge continued. 'But it can be done.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-judge-rules-trump-must-reinstate-many-fired-federal-employees/	2025-03-13T10:19:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25071569071203-e1741876447451.jpg?w=900
Putin says he agrees in principle with US proposal for 30-day cea...	Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace. 'So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,' Putin told a news conference in Moscow. 'But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.' He noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce. Another issue, he said, is whether Ukraine could use the 30-day ceasefire to rearm. Boris Johnson: I knew Trump had a plan for Ukraine 'We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,' Putin said. Putin made the remarks just hours after the arrival of Trump’s envoy in Moscow for talks on the 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has accepted. The diplomatic effort coincided with a Russian claim that its troops have driven the Ukrainian army out of a key town in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Moscow has been trying for seven months to dislodge Ukrainian troops from their foothold. Putin said it appeared that the U.S. persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and that Ukraine is interested because of the battlefield situation, particularly in Kursk. Referring to the Ukrainian troops in Kursk, he said: 'Will all those who are there come out without a fight?' Putin thanked U.S. President Donald Trump 'for paying so much attention to the settlement in Ukraine.' He also thanked the leaders of China, India, Brazil and South Africa for their 'noble mission to end the fighting,' a statement that signaled those countries' potential involvement in a ceasefire deal. Ukraine agrees to US proposal for 30-day ceasefire Russia has said it will not accept peacekeepers from any NATO members to monitor a prospective truce. Putin’s foreign affairs adviser said Putin planned to meet with Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, later Thursday. The Russian Defense Ministry’s claim that it recaptured the town of Sudzha, a Ukrainian operational hub in Kursk, came hours after Putin visited his commanders in Kursk. The claim could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment. The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops unfolded as Trump seeks a diplomatic end to the war, which began more than three years ago with Russia’s full-scale invasion. President Duda calls on US to place nuclear weapons in Poland The U.S. on Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid for Kyiv after senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials reported making progress on how to stop the fighting during talks in Saudi Arabia. Trump said Wednesday that 'it’s up to Russia now' as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The U.S. president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it does not engage with peace efforts. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Thursday that Trump is 'willing to apply maximum pressure on both sides,' including sanctions that reach the highest scale on Russia. Zelenskyy chides Russia for slow response Ukraine has expressed its own concerns that Russia would use a truce to regroup and rearm. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy chided Russia on the Telegram messaging app Thursday for what he said was its slow response to the ceasefire proposal, accusing Moscow of trying to delay any peace deal. He said that Ukraine is 'determined to move quickly toward peace' and hoped U.S. pressure would compel Russia to stop fighting. The U.S. still has about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for future arms shipments to Ukraine, but the Trump administration has shown no interest so far in using that authority to send additional weapons as it awaits the outcome of peace overtures. US arms flow to Ukraine again as the Kremlin mulls a ceasefire proposal By signaling its openness to a ceasefire at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma — whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington. The Ukrainian army’s foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from the renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin. Putin visits Russian military commanders Speaking to commanders Wednesday, Putin said that he expected the military 'to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.' Wearing military fatigues, Putin added that 'it’s necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,' in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine’s neighboring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal. Ukraine launched the raid in a bid to counter the unceasingly grim news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and to gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion did not significantly change the dynamic of the war. Cuomo &amp; Carlson: The Conversation continues The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, assessed late Wednesday that Russian forces were in control of Sudzha, a town close to the border that previously was home to about 5,000 people. Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russian aircraft had carried out an unprecedented number of strikes on Kursk and that as a result Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said his country was 'maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.' Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine’s Northern Operational Command, which includes the Kursk region, was dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on Wednesday. He told the outlet that he was not given a reason for his dismissal, saying 'I’m guessing, but I don’t want to talk about it yet.' ___ Associated Press Writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ This story has been corrected to show that Suzha is a key Ukrainian military hub, not Kursk’s biggest town.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-russia-says-it-has-retaken-sudzha-the-biggest-town-in-the-kursk-region-controlled-by-ukraine/	2025-03-13T09:37:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67d30acfcde552.13443705.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — An Oklahoma grand jury has indicted former televangelist and megachurch founder Robert Morris on child sexual abuse charges dating back to the 1980s. Morris, who previously served as a spiritual adviser to President Donald Trump, has been charged with five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child, the attorney general's office said. The 63-year-old resigned from his role as senior pastor of Gateway Church in 2024 after Cindy Clemishire accused him of sexually abusing her starting in 1982. Clemishire said Morris was staying in Hominy, Oklahoma, with her family at the time of the abuse. Execution by nitrogen gas ‘ugly way to die’: Medical ethicist 'There can be no tolerance for those who sexually prey on children,' said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. 'This case is all the more despicable because the alleged perpetrator was a pastor who exploited his position. The victim in this case has waited far too many years for justice to be done.' Gateway Church, based in the Dallas suburb of Southlake, was founded by Morris in 2000.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey. The European tariff, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, was expected to go into effect on April 1.

SpaceX targets Friday launch for flight to replace stuck astronau...	(NewsNation) — SpaceX and NASA are aiming for a launch no earlier than Friday for the Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station, which will relieve Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been in space for nine months. The mission is now targeting a liftoff no earlier than Friday at 7:03 p.m. ET, with a backup opportunity available on Saturday at 6:41 p.m. ET, SpaceX said. Originally set to blast off from Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday night, the launch was canceled because of a 'hydraulic ground issue with a ground support clamp arm for the Falcon 9 rocket,' NASA said. Former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao told 'Morning in America' it's rare for SpaceX and the Falcon 9 Dragon rocket to experience delays. How to photograph the total lunar eclipse 'This is unusual for SpaceX and Falcon 9 Dragon because they usually go on time,' he said. 'They don’t often have to scrub a launch for a technical problem, but things do happen.' The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would have carried two American astronauts, one Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut on the Dragon Endurance spacecraft. NASA astronaut Anne McClain is leading the mission, accompanied by NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, JAXA astronaut Takuya Onishi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov. The mission was originally scheduled for a Crew Dragon spacecraft, but due to delays, NASA instead opted for the Dragon Endurance. Astronauts have been on ISS for 9 months Once on board, there will be a handover period, which has been shortened due to concerns about commodities on the ISS after an upcoming supply mission experienced an issue. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson told NewsNation handovers are 'routine.' 'A crew of four is going up. It has to dock. It has to meet up with the space station dock. The crew gets out, they hug each other, and then the other crew gets in,' he said. Anonymous donor pays to spay, neuter 120 pit bulls Crew-9 will then return along with Wilmore and Williams. Their original departure from the ISS was set for Monday, NASA said, though it's unclear if the launch delay will affect that timeline. Wilmore and Williams blasted off on Boeing's Starliner last summer for a mission initially meant to last two weeks. However, after multiple issues, including helium leaks in the service module and docking issues, NASA deemed it unsafe for them to return.

The meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte comes just days after Trump called on European allies to contribute more to the alliance's defense fund. Trump last week publicly called for other countries to give up to 5% of their GDP. Trump has made it clear he wants NATO countries to pay much more than the 2% commitment decided upon more than a decade ago. In 2024, an estimated 23 of 32 countries were projected to meet that goal. Trump makes third term remark during event with Irish prime minister Rutte, who served as prime minister of the Netherlands during Trump's first term, has also supported increasing NATO members' funding expectations. 'Our mindset has to be that we are willing to protect every inch of NATO territory ... If we would stick to the 2%, we cannot defend ourselves in four or five years. We have to spend more,' Rutte said during a Feb. 12 news conference. Last week, Trump suggested the U.S. should not have to defend NATO allies he believes have not contributed enough to defense spending. Elon Musk, one of Trump's top advisers, said in a social media post that the U.S. should withdraw from NATO altogether and refuse to fund Europe's defense. The United States typically spends around 3% of its GDP on defense, meaning a major increase in Pentagon funding would be needed for the nation to meet Trump's own standards. Canadians, stung by Trump’s tariffs and rhetoric, balk at US travel Russia mulls potential ceasefire with Ukraine Thursday's conversation comes on the heels of a tentative ceasefire deal in the Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine on Monday agreed to accept a deal for a temporary ceasefire with Russia in exchange for the U.S. resuming intelligence sharing and security assistance. Russia has reportedly given the U.S. a list of demands necessary to end its war against Ukraine, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. No specifics have been made public, but the White House has said everyone — Russia and Ukraine included — will have to make some kind of concession to reach a deal. Will Putin accept US-Ukraine ceasefire deal? 'People are going to Russia right now, as we speak, and hopefully we can get a cease fire from Russia. And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Those headed to Moscow include Steve Witkoff, special envoy to the Middle East, NewsNation has learned. It will be his second trip to Russia this year; the first secured the release of Marc Fogel. Ukraine has repeatedly sought NATO membership, though Russia has vehemently opposed the move. 'The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence, and its right to choose its own security arrangements. Ukraine’s future is in NATO,' the organization's Ukraine relations website reads.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-nato-chief-mark-rutte/	2025-03-13T03:51:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67508b3f89e574.79439632.jpeg?w=900
Trump designee should reassure people about the economy: O'Reilly	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump should tap someone to come forward and reassure Americans who have jitters about the economy, political commentator Bill O’Reilly says. The president’s decisions to impose tariffs on trade partners has roiled financial markets in recent days, although U.S. stock indexes somewhat stabilized Wednesday amid an encouraging inflation report. Trump doubles down on Mexico, Canada and China tariffs | The Hill 'People are starting to panic — the stock market and all that,' O’Reilly said on 'CUOMO' Wednesday. 'If I were President Trump, I’d have a calming presence to come out and explain exactly why the president is doing what he’s doing. Because most people don’t understand tariffs.' Trump is not the one for that task, he added. 'Donald Trump is not in the calm-down business. He’s never been in the calm-down business,' O’Reilly said, laughing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-scaring-people-economy/	2025-03-12T18:43:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a3eda4a95ac2.24093548.jpeg?w=900
Canadians, stung by Trump's tariffs and rhetoric, balk at US trav...	Right on the U.S.-Canadian border, Corey Fram's tourism marketing job has gotten a lot harder of late. Fram is director of the 1000 Islands International Tourism Council, which promotes a nature destination with castles, cruises, hikes and fishing enjoyed by Canadians and Americans. But he says U.S. President Donald Trump's continuous disparagement of Canada is taking a toll. 'We have had to switch gears a bit,' Fram said from his office near the 1,800 tiny scenic islands that dot the St. Lawrence River framed by New York State and Ontario province. School lunches, food banks lose more than $1B in USDA funding Seeing Canadian and American flags often flying side by side, travelers didn't care what side of the border they were on. Now, with Trump's recent rhetoric, Fram has had to adjust his message. 'We've been very careful not to broadcast and demonstrate U.S. assets to Canadian audiences and Canadian assets to U.S. audiences because when we have, we found that has drawn out a lot of negative sentiment,' Fram said. Canadians have been stung by Trump's actions and words since he returned to the White House, both around tariffs and suggestions that Canada should be annexed by the United States. The American anthem has been booed at hockey games and some stores are removing U.S. products from their shelves, even before Trump's latest salvo on Tuesday, when he increased tariffs on imported Canadian steel and aluminum to 50%. Does Canada really have tariffs above 200% on US dairy products? Travelers are responding with their wallets. New bookings to the United States from Canada have declined about 20% since February 1 compared with the year-ago period, according to Forward Keys, a flight ticketing data firm. United Airlines UAL.O CEO Scott Kirby said on Tuesday the company has adjusted its capacity due to a big drop in incoming traffic from Canada. 'We've lost a lot of interest in going to the States in general,' said Allyson C., 34, from Vancouver, who canceled her family's summer vacation to Washington, D.C., citing the on-again, off-again tariffs and the U.S. exchange rate. This worries the U.S. travel industry. Inbound travel to the United States is still just 90% of pre-pandemic levels, Geoff Freeman, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said in an interview. No other country's residents go to the United States more than Canada, which notched 20.4 million visits in 2024. Canadian travelers also spend three times more on vacations than domestic U.S. travelers, said Freeman. Saturday night hotel bookings in Bellingham, Washington, a coastal city near the Canadian border which offers skiing and ferries to Alaska, declined 10.8% from February 2 through March 1. Bookings in Niagara Falls, New York, fell 8.1% over the same period, according to analytics firm CoStar. Weather and the exchange rate also affected cross-border travel in 2024, said Jan Freitag, director of U.S. hospitality at CoStar. 'The thing that is different this year is the rhetoric from the administration that has a lot of Canadians thinking twice about coming across the border.' Canadians face stiffer rules for extended US stays Fram said his tourism council is also not getting as warm a reception to invitations to bring Canadian travel writers and influencers to Thousand Islands attractions on the New York side. 'Anytime that we put a restriction and make it difficult or make people not want to cross the border, that has a lasting impact,' said Fram. 'It is going to be a significant challenge to get back to where we were before this.' The Trump administration said it will require all foreigners above the age of 14 in the U.S. to register and submit fingerprints beginning April 11 if they stay beyond 30 days. Canadians are not exempt, even though they typically can visit the U.S. for up to six months without a visa. Canadians aren't the only travelers backing off from the U.S. Bookings from Denmark and Germany decreased 27% and 15% year-over-year, respectively, according to Forward Keys. Demand from Europe as a whole only slightly decreased at 1%. Irish PM asked why he 'let' Rosie O'Donnell move to his country But Canada's proximity makes it more important. A 10% drop in Canadian travelers could cost the United States $2.1 billion in lost spending, the U.S. Travel Association estimated. 'I would love to go back to the U.S., but right now, as things are, I as a Canadian don't really feel safe or welcomed,' said artist manager Zina Oukil, 32, from Calgary. She is vacationing in Cancun, Mexico with her husband after canceling a road trip to Los Angeles. 'I feel very sad about it, but also a little bit frustrated and quite frankly angry,' Oukil said.

Does Canada really have tariffs above 200% on US dairy products?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said last week that Canada has tariffs in place at above 200% on dairy products imported from the U.S. 'Canada is cheating the United States Farmers on USMCA,' Trump wrote in a Friday post on Truth Social. 'In 2024, Canada retained Tariffs on various U.S. Goods, particularly in protected sectors like Dairy that are operated under a supply management system. Some examples of Canadian Tariffs on U.S. Dairy outside of the limited quota include: Milk: Up to 243% …. Butter: Up to 298% …. Cheese: Up to 245%.' It’s a little more complicated. Those Canadian tariffs on U.S. dairy imports apply only after the U.S. hits a level of tariff-free sales. Canadians face stiffer rules for extended US stays It was a deal Trump negotiated in 2018 during his first term in office. CNN reports that in many categories, including milk, the U.S. is not even at half of the zero-tariff maximum. 'It is accurate that Canada imposes a tariff of approximately 250% on U.S. exports of certain dairy products into Canada, and even more with Canada’s 25% retaliatory tariffs in place,' a March 7 statement from the International Dairy Foods Association read in part. 'However, that tariff would only apply if we were able to reach and exceed the quota on U.S. dairy exports agreed to under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Frustratingly, the U.S. has never gotten close to exceeding our USMCA quotas because Canada has erected various protectionist measures that fly in the face of their trade obligations made under USMCA.' Trump has given a variety of explanations for targeting Canada in recent weeks. He has said that his separate 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada, some of which are suspended for a month, are about fentanyl smuggling and objections to Canada putting high taxes on dairy imports that penalize U.S. farmers.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/canada-200-percent-dairy-tariff-fact-check/	2025-03-12T14:55:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP20297685690915.jpg?w=900
Luigi Mangione files amended motion police unlawfully detained hi...	(NewsNation) — A lawyer for Luigi Mangione amended a motion to suppress evidence in his Pennsylvania criminal case, alleging police detained Mangione and seized items from him unlawfully, violating several constitutional rights. Mangione is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December in Midtown Manhattan. In the amended motion filed in Blair County, attorney Thomas Dickey says the Altoona Police Department detained Mangione at a local McDonald's without sufficient evidence he was a legitimate suspect. The original motion was filed two weeks ago. In his recent filing, Dickey alleges that 'no official identification of the Defendant, as being the suspect from New York, was ever made by any personnel from the State of New York, the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office, or the FBI.' The arrest happened when Mangione was eating breakfast, and a customer pointed him out to a McDonald’s employee, who then called 911. Luigi Mangione’s motive in alleged killing was ‘corporate greed’: TMZ Mangione was reportedly found with a gun and silencer, believed to be 3D-printed, and multiple fake ID cards, including one New York police said he used days before the shooting to check into a hostel in the city. During the interaction, his defense team argued the police had surrounded Mangione, not giving him any way to leave, which amounted to an 'investigative detention.' This type of holding has Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment as well as state law protections, the motion stated. The police lacked 'reasonable suspicion and probable cause to stop, arrest and detain Mangione,' filings noted. Did police violate Luigi Mangione’s rights at arrest? Anything that was seized of Mangione is, therefore, unlawful, they contend. 'Any evidence, seized, obstinate or in possession of law enforcement and/ or the Commonwealth, purportedly in support of any of the instant charges, was obtained illegally and unlawfully,' the motion stated. Mangione faces multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism under federal and state charges in New York and Pennsylvania after allegedly gunning down Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in Midtown Manhattan on Dec. 4. The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/luigi-mangione-motion-unlawfully-detained/	2025-03-12T14:18:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Luigi-Mangione-1.jpg?w=900
Scientists find natural molecule that works like Ozempic	(NewsNation) — Researchers at Stanford Medicine have discovered a naturally occurring molecule they believe is similar to the active ingredient in the same diabetes drugs that have shown weight loss potential. BRINP2-related peptide, or BRP, can suppress appetite and promote weight loss in mice and pigs without causing common side effects like nausea, according to the study, which was published in Nature. The discovery may provide a solution for those who suffer from some of the more severe side effects of Wegovy and Ozempic, which include inflammation of the pancreas, changes in vision, increased risk of thyroid cancer and others. Michelle Obama’s new look? Plastic surgeons on her new podcast headshot 'The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues,' said assistant professor of pathology Katrin Svensson. 'That’s why Ozempic has widespread effects, including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels. In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism.' Ozempic and Wegovy sales have soared in recent years, but shortages and challenges with insurance coverage have made it difficult for many patients to get the drugs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 100 million adults in the U.S. are obese — defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher — and more than 22 million adults are severely obese, with a BMI of 40 or higher.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/natural-molecule-ozempic/	2025-03-12T13:47:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/06/6478a5ba667621.01797178.jpeg?w=900
Canadians face stiffer rules for extended US stays	(NewsNation) — Canadians who enter the United States and stay longer than 30 days will soon be required to register with the U.S. government and face criminal charges or fines if they don’t. The new policy is tied to President Donald Trump’s 'Protecting The American People Against Invasion' executive order, which Trump signed during his first day back in the White House. The order was designed to curb what the order referred to as an 'unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States.' Canadian visitors entering the U.S. currently have visa-exempt admission and don’t typically file with the Department of Homeland Security when they enter the country by car at the northern border. Washington sues county for illegally helping ICE However, beginning April 11, Canadians who have not previously registered as foreign nationals and have been fingerprinted as part of existing requirements will need to complete a new U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services form to avoid punishment by U.S. immigration officials. Those violating the policy face fines of up to $5,000, six months in jail or both, according to the Federal Register, which was updated with the new guidance Wednesday. USCIS first published details of the new requirements on its website in late February. The new registration requirement could affect more than 1 million Canadians who travel to warmer parts of the U.S. during the winter to escape colder temperatures. In a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Michael MacKenzie, the executive director of the Canadian Snowbird Association, said the organization is seeking clarity on Trump’s executive order and registration requirements for all 'aliens' entering the United States. MacKenzie wrote that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials stated that the new requirement does not apply to Canadian citizens who have already registered as foreign nationals. The letter states that guidance on the USCIS website indicates that those who are not considered registered include Canadian visitors who entered the U.S. at land ports and were not given evidence of their registration from Customs and Border Protection officers working at the border. MacKenzie says the lack of clarity creates confusion as to how Canadians are viewed by the U.S. government. 'It is our position that this executive order relates to unlawfully present individuals currently in the United States and should not apply to Canadian tourists visiting the U.S. for vacation purposes,' MacKenzie wrote in the letter. How many Canadians travel to the United States? According to Statistics Canada, 4.1 million Canadian residents arrived from trips abroad in December 2024. Of those, 2.1 million arrived from the United States by car, and 68.3% of those trips were taken within the same day. The busiest points of entry back into the country were located in southwestern Ontario. However, in the letter to Noem, MacKenzie said that more than 1 million 'snowbirds' travel to the United States each year. 56 percent disapprove of Trump handling of economy: Survey Other snowbird organizations report that 50% of those who leave Canada own property in the United States and often land in southern U.S. states. The volume of those typically spending longer periods in the United States has immigration attorneys concerned that the new registration requirements may create confusion among Canadians who remain in the U.S. after traveling here to escape the winter north of the U.S. border. 'My concern is for the snowbirds who are in the U.S. and are in their 70s and 80s,' Rosanna Berardi, a Buffalo, New York, immigration attorney, told NewsNation. 'Will they be aware of the new requirements, and do they have a computer to register?' What do existing immigration laws state? The new requirements are an addition to those found in The Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires all 'aliens' who travel to the U.S. who are 14 years of age or older to register with the federal government if they are staying in the United States for 30 days or longer. The INA already requires noncitizens who stay in the U.S. longer than 30 days to be fingerprinted, which was part of the Alien Registration Act of 1960. How does Mahmoud Khalil’s case affect those with green cards? While these requirements have been in place, Canadians visiting the country will be required to complete a new registration form on the USCIS website that registers them and allows them to remain in the country for an extended time if they have not previously registered as foreign nationals. Registered foreign nationals over the age of 18 are required to carry their registration with them at all times, the agency said. The added requirements come as Trump has clashed with the U.S.’ northern neighbor, suggesting that Canada become the 51st U.S. state and has imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel coming from Canada. Canadian officials have responded by stating they will impose retaliatory tariffs of 25% on products imported from the U.S. Berandi argues the added registration is connected to the Trump administration’s 'obsession' with its northern neighbor after maintaining Canada has contributed to the flow of illicit drugs entering the U.S. Global Affairs Canada said in a statement to NewsNation that it is aware of the new DHS and USCIS requirements affecting Canadian citizens. It said that it routinely posts travel advice on its website, ensuring travelers are aware of the policies each country has in place. 'Each country decides who enters its borders,' a spokesperson told NewsNation. 'The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveler.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/canadians-stiffer-rules-extended-us-stays/	2025-03-12T13:24:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67ae4fa1bb29d7.22699453.jpeg?w=900
Bryan Kohberger trial: Frantic 911 call released	(NewsNation) — Authorities have released audio of the 911 call made after four University of Idaho students were fatally stabbed as they slept in their off-campus home. In the recording from the morning of Nov. 13, 2022, a surviving roommate who was not aware of the killings called emergency dispatchers to report unsettling news. 'Something’s happened in our house, and we don’t know what,' a distraught young woman says at the beginning of the call. Bryan Kohberger trial: Timeline in Idaho college killings, arrest A female neighbor then takes the phone to say that one of the occupants of the house is 'not waking up.' 'Oh, and they saw some man in their house last night,' the neighbor says. 'I need to know what’s going on right now, if someone is passed out,' the 911 operator says. 'Can you find that out?' The caller agrees to check, with others accompanying her. More grim comments from the house are heard, such as, 'She’s passed out. What’s wrong?' The caller sobs and pants and confirms, 'She’s not waking up.' Another person, a male, takes the phone and tells the 911 operator the 20-year-old roommate, Xana Kernodle, is not breathing. The dispatcher says an ambulance and police are on the way. By then, an officer has arrived, the caller says. Besides Kernodle, authorities would discover the bodies of Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Kaylee Goncalves, all of whom were killed overnight at the Moscow, Idaho residence. Bryan Kohberger, a graduate student at Washington State University in nearby Pullman, Wash., was charged with first-degree murder and is expected to go to trial in August. Authorities zeroed in on Kohberger after collecting DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene. He also drove a white Hyundai Elantra, the type of vehicle that was observed in the area at the time of the killings.

Trump says tariffs will be 'positive'; Vance pushes Russia for ce...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump challenged U.S. allies Wednesday by increasing tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% as he vowed to take back wealth 'stolen' by other countries, drawing quick retaliation from Europe and Canada. The Republican president's use of tariffs to extract concessions from other nations points toward a possibly destructive trade war and a stark change in America’s approach to global leadership. It also has destabilized the stock market and stoked anxiety about an economic downturn. 'The United States of America is going to take back a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries and, frankly, by incompetent U.S. leadership,' Trump told reporters Wednesday. 'We’re going to take back our wealth, and we’re going to take back a lot of the companies that left.' Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil’s case heads to court Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%. His moves, based on a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce. He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging 'reciprocal' rates starting April 2. The EU announced its own countermeasures Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was 'applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,' or about $28 billion. Those measures, which cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods, are due to take effect April 1. Inflation slows in February ahead of tariff impact Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance says the administration believes it is in a 'very good place' as it pushes the Kremlin to sign off on a U.S.-backed proposal to pause the fighting with Ukraine for 30 days. He says U.S. officials will have conversations with their Russian counterparts by phone and in person in the coming days. Trump says he has received some good feedback on the proposal. He has offered no details. 'I’ve gotten some positive messages, but a positive message means nothing. This is a very serious situation,' Trump said. 'This is a situation that could lead to World War III.' 'We’ve gotten half of it as a ceasefire,' Trump added. 'And if we can get Russia to stop, then we have a full ceasefire. And I think it’ll never go back to war.' The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-us-wealth-stolen/	2025-03-12T11:32:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-3-2.jpg?w=900
US toughens visitor registration rules for Canadians	(The Hill) -- The United States is cracking down on long-term visits from Canadians by now requiring visitors in the U.S. longer than 30 days to register with the government. Those who are over the age of 14 will also need to apply for fingerprinting with authorities, according to the mandate uploaded Wednesday to the Federal Register. It firms up an existing law from which Canadians had typically been exempt. Washington sues county for illegally helping ICE The move comes as Canada, Mexico and the U.S. remain entangled in a trade war spurred by President Donald Trump’s new levies on imports from both foreign countries. Each nation has sought to impose retaliatory measures while agreeing to work with Trump to address his concerns on the influx of fentanyl, an addictive and deadly opioid, which he has promised to wipe out. The rule will go into effect on April 11 and is set to impact 900,000 Canadians, some of whom vacation in the U.S. during winter months to escape the cold. Previous practice required only individuals who flew across the border to register with the government. Those who do not comply could face misdemeanor prosecution resulting in a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than 30 days. Officials also reserve the right to impose both punishments concurrently. How does Mahmoud Khalil’s case affect those with green cards? The new requirement only allows for one exemption, which applies to American Indians born in Canada who entered the United States under section 289 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and members of the Texas Band of Kickapoo Indians who entered the United States under the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act, are not required to register. The regulations advance the Trump administration’s measures to crack down on illegal immigration through the Protecting American People Against Invasion executive order, which seeks to 'eliminate all documentary barriers, dilatory tactics, or other restrictions that prevent the prompt repatriation of aliens to any foreign state.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/canadian-visitor-registration/	2025-03-12T11:21:31-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/6560045da28cc2.08871930-e1741795390257.jpeg?w=800
Washington sues county for illegally helping ICE	(NewsNation) — The state of Washington filed suit against one of its counties, saying it broke state law by assisting federal immigration agents. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown alleged that Adams County, about 80 miles southwest of Spokane, has been illegally holding people in custody based on their immigration status since 2022. The suit also alleges the county sheriff's office has illegally shared nonpublic personal information of people in the country, including birth dates, home addresses, driver’s license numbers and fingerprints with federal immigration officials. 'All of this conduct expressly violates state law,' the state wrote in the lawsuit. CBP shutting down migrant processing tent facilities in Texas, Arizona The suit cites the Keep Washington Working Act, which restricts the extent to which state, county and local police can assist federal immigration officers. While the county was in talks with the attorney general's office towards following this law, those talks fell through in January after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Brown alleges. 'The county and its Sheriff’s Office suddenly hardened their stance, broke off settlement talks and aligned themselves with an organization founded by a top Trump aide who is among the most virulent anti-immigrant voices in the administration,' he added. Brown referred to Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of policy, who also founded America First Legal, which has been involved in a slew of right-wing initiatives across the country. One month after Trump took office, the county sent a letter to the Attorney General’s Office asserting that it has 'obligations under federal law that directly conflict' with the Keep Washington Working Act, reported Courthouse News. New CBP Home app assists migrants with self-deportation 'The state’s restrictions attempt to tie the hands of law enforcement, making it harder to cooperate with federal agencies that help keep dangerous individuals off our streets,' Adams County Sheriff Dale Wagner, a Republican, said in a statement that also thanked America First Legal. The suit also says the state law protects the economy. Around 50% of the state’s agricultural labor force is foreign-born, and the agricultural sector brought in over $12.7 billion in sales in 2022, according to the state. 'Even without the economic benefits to Adams County’s important agrarian economy, its residents—approximately 64% of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino—deserve the protections afforded by KWW so that they too may live and work with dignity in Adams County,' the state contends.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/washington-sues-county-illegally-helping-ice/	2025-03-12T11:00:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67900c482bcb55.76968600.jpeg?w=900
California dad sees ambulance bill more than double with insuranc...	(NewsNation) — A California father is raising the alarm after he said his ambulance bill more than doubled after providing his insurance information. Robert Witt, whose TikTok video detailing the price jump went viral, told 'Morning in America' that there has to be 'a more simple way' to handle insurance in the United States. 'The first bill we got without the insurance was $600, and then the second one was almost $1300,' Witt said in the TikTok, which has garnered millions of views. 'Okay, yeah, so that the first thing you received, that's a discount that you received if you're uninsured,' an unknown representative said in response. 'So, you're not eligible for the discount since you are insured.' Girl Scouts sued over alleged heavy metals, pesticides in cookies The representative pointed to AB 716 as the source of the so-called 'discount.' It's a law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom aiming to prevent 'surprise' ambulance bills by capping the cost of a ride at an insured person's in-network cost. Uninsured patients are instead capped at the Medi-Cal or Medicare rate. In the TikTok, the representative explains that the full bill for the ambulance ride was $2,342.14 — and that his insurance only paid $1,078.85, leaving him with a nearly $1,300 bill. By providing his insurance information, Witt became ineligible for the uninsured cost cap provided by AB 716. The father told NewsNation he was 'absolutely shocked' to find out the bill — which came about because his young daughter had an allergic reaction — only grew once insurance got involved. He said he's found many people with similar stories since making his post. 'I make comedy skits online, and I don't have the answers to these questions,' Witt said. 'But what I do have, like you mentioned, is millions of people who have said, 'I can't stand my insurance.' We need to do something in this country.'

Witt went on to make two subsequent TikToks to call out what he described as 'insider trading' among politicians. 'It feels like they might, when they go to legislate, try to pad their own bank accounts a little bit,' Witt said. 'And that really just doesn't sit well with anybody.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/california-father-ambulance-insurance/	2025-03-12T07:05:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-8.jpg?w=900
Person of interest named in Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance	(NewsNation) — Virginia authorities on Wednesday confirmed Joshua Riibe is a person of interest in the disappearance of University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki. Konanki, 20, vanished while on a spring break trip with friends in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic early Thursday morning. Chad J. Quinn, manager of media relations and communications for Loudoun County, Virginia, confirmed Riibe as a person of interest but said officials have 'no statements at this time.' Loudoun County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Tom Julia told NewsNation that Riibe and others have been 'persons of interest for four days.' Authorities have not indicated any signs of foul play in her disappearance, though her family is pushing investigators to consider the possibility she might have been abducted. Sudiksha Konanki disappearance timeline from Dominican Republic Sudiksha Konanki missing after trip to Dominican Republic Missing Pitt student Sudiksha KonankiMissing student Sudiksha Konanki (The AWARE Foundation) A resident of Ashburn, Virginia, Konanki was last seen Thursday at 4:50 a.m. while walking on the beach at the Riu Republica Hotel, just north of Punta Cana in the La Altagracia district of the Dominican Republic. According to the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, Konanki was last seen wearing a brown bikini, big round earrings, a metal designer anklet on her right leg, yellow and steel bracelets on her right wrist, and a multicolored beaded bracelet on her left wrist. Dominican Republic resort guest: Nobody warned us about waves Konanki is a citizen of India and a permanent U.S. resident. She was one of six female University of Pittsburgh students traveling together for spring break. According to the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, the Indian embassy in the Dominican Republic has led the search efforts, along with state, federal and on-the-ground law enforcement. Anyone with information regarding Konanki's whereabouts is urged to contact the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office at 703-777-1021. Police interview witnesses Police spoke to both Konanki's friends and a man in his 20s who was allegedly at the beach around the same time as her, CNN and other outlets reported. The man, who was spotted on surveillance leaving the beach area alone at 9:55 a.m., is allegedly the last person to see Konanki. He reportedly told police multiple versions of the morning's events. He initially said Konanki may have been swept away by a wave but then gave another account, saying she may have left when he got out of the water. In another, he claimed both he and Konanki went into the ocean, but he felt sick, left the water and fell asleep in a lounge chair. Another account involved her walking along the beach with the water up to her knees in the direction of where she had left her clothes, the outlet reported. Police have not linked the interviewee to Riibe.

Inflation slows in February ahead of tariff impact	(NewsNation) — Inflation slowed in President Donald Trump's first full month in office, new Labor Department data shows. The consumer price index increased 2.8% in February from a year ago, but ticked up 0.2% from January. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.1% from a year earlier, down from 3.3% in January. The core figure is the lowest since April 2021. The monthly inflation rose by much less than expected. The 0.2% jump in February from the previous month is down from a 0.5% jump in January. And core prices increased just 0.2%, below the 0.4% rise in January. Economists watch core prices because they are typically a better guide to the future path of inflation. Canada suspends 25% electricity tariffs on US Grocery prices were unchanged last month from January, bringing some relief to consumers grappling with a 25% jump in grocery prices from four years ago. The cost of eggs, however, jumped 10.4% in February from the previous month and are nearly 60% more expensive than a year ago. The increases were less than the 2.9% rise economists expected, according to a survey by data provider FactSet, though they remain higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Two policies under the Trump administration are expected to have a significant impact on the U.S. economy going forward: Trump's tariffs placed on a wide range of foreign imports and cuts to federal government spending under the Department of Government Efficiency. EU retaliates against Trump’s tariffs On Wednesday, the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the U.S. is 'applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,' or about $28 billion. 'We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,' she said. 'Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up, in Europe and in the United States.' Trade war threatens to rekindle inflation that economists believe ticked lower last month The commission manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 member countries. Von der Leyen said the EU 'will always remain open to negotiation.' Britain, which is not part of the EU, has said it will not impose retaliatory measures of its own on the U.S. Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First, on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls 'rebalancing measures,' which the EU had in place from 2018 to 2020 but were suspended under the Biden administration. Then, on April 13, additional tariffs will target 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports. Trump sticks to his guns on economy With Trump imposing or threatening tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, China, Europe and India, most economists forecast price increases will likely remain elevated this year. Trump on Tuesday reiterated his commitment to his economic approach, regardless of short-term fluctuations. Education Department eliminating nearly half its workforce 'We're going to have drops, and markets are going to go up, and they're going to go down,' he told reporters. 'But you know what? We have to rebuild our country. Our country has been stripped of its jobs, of its factories.' If price increases remain stubbornly high, that could create political problems for Trump, who promised as a candidate to 'knock the hell out of inflation.' White House brushes off recession worries Trump's tariffs have set off a wave of economic uncertainty, driving stocks lower and fueling fears of a potential recession. Trump did not rule out the possibility of a recession in a recent Fox News interview with Maria Bartiromo. When asked if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump told Bartiromo, 'I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.' Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick has continued to dismiss concerns about a recession. When asked if the administration's policies would be worth it if they led to a recession, even a short-term one, Lutnick replied, 'These policies are the most important thing America has ever had.' When pressed, he confirmed, 'It is worth it.' Trump's economic agenda roils markets Markets are set to open after another day of red across the board on Wall Street — the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 were all down Tuesday. Trump’s approval dips amid concerns over economy: Poll The S&amp;P 500 is down more than 7% over the past month, wiping out all of its gains since Trump was reelected in November. Share prices for popular stocks like Tesla (-36%), Nvidia (-25%) and Meta (-16%) sank even faster from a month ago. Uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs and the potential hit to both consumers and businesses appear to be the main reason investors are spooked. Major retailers like Target and Best Buy have already warned shoppers Trump's tariffs will likely lead to higher prices. Trump’s flip-flop in recent days has made it harder for Wall Street investors to price in the potential impact of tariffs. Though it has fallen over the past month, the S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 10% from a year ago.

Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil's case heads to court	(NewsNation) — A judge will hear arguments Wednesday about the arrest of a Columbia University graduate student who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on campus. Mahmoud Khalil, who was born in Syria and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp there, holds legal permanent resident status in the United States. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Khalil on Saturday and transferred him to a detention center in Louisiana. The court on Wednesday will hear arguments alleging Khalil was wrongfully detained for his role in last year's protests at Columbia University. A judge will examine his habeas corpus petition at 11:30 a.m. ET. How does Mahmoud Khalil’s case affect those with green cards? The hearing is the first challenge to President Donald Trump's January executive order prohibiting antisemitism on college campuses and using that as justification for deportation. According to Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, ICE officers said his student visa was revoked under Trump's executive order. When Khalil showed them he was not in the country on a student visa but rather as a legal permanent resident, the officers said that was also revoked, Greer said. 'I think we ought to get them all out of the country,' Trump said about Khalil’s arrest Tuesday. 'They’re troublemakers, they’re agitators. They don’t love our country. We ought to get them the hell out. I think that guy — I heard his statements too. They were plenty bad, and I think we had to get him the hell out of the country.' Police clear pro-Palestinian protesters from Barnard College library Khalil's lawyer argues that ICE's actions violate his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights. A federal judge in Manhattan blocked Khalil’s deportation earlier this week. Khalil is a green card holder, which allows him due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. Can ICE take away Mahmoud Khalil's green card? Khalil was one of the most visible activists at Columbia University's pro-Palestinian rallies in 2024. The Department of Homeland Security has accused him of 'leading activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.' The agency is sanctioned to initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range of alleged criminal activity. But according to immigration experts, the detention of a legal permanent resident who has not been charged with a crime marked an extraordinary move with an uncertain legal foundation. 'I would gather that anyone that has a political view or has protested and also has a green card would be nervous,' Rosanna Berardi, managing partner at Berardi Immigration Law, told NewsNation. Trump floats labeling violence against Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism 'If this is any indication of the administration’s position on green card holders that their own agency vetted at a super-high level and gave a green card ... and this is the behavior of the administration, I would be gravely concerned,' Berardi said. NewsNation has reached out to Khalil's lawyer, the Justice Department, DHS and Columbia University for comment but has not yet heard back. Mahmoud Khalil case first 'of many to come' Trump himself said Khalil's arrest was the first of many during his second term. The administration is not only targeting students who participated in protests but also the universities themselves. The Department of Education sent letters to 60 universities warning they were under investigation for alleged antisemitic discrimination and harassment for allowing pro-Palestinian protests to occur on school grounds. Education Department says 60 universities under investigation for antisemitism Following the letters, the University of California, Los Angeles — the site of a large pro-Khalil protest Tuesday — announced it is starting a new initiative to combat antisemitism on campus. The Trump administration has already canceled $400 million worth of grants to Columbia University as of Friday. The school's response to pro-Palestinian protests on its New York City campus was explicitly cited as the reason behind the funding changes. Harvard University announced a faculty and staff hiring freeze Monday due to 'substantial financial uncertainties driven by rapidly shifting federal policies.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/mahmoud-khalil-ice-palestine-protester-court/	2025-03-12T03:52:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25068571884044.jpg?w=900
Boris Johnson: I knew Trump had a plan for Ukraine	(NewsNation) — Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he has 'always been confident' that United States President Donald Trump could get the Ukrainians to sign up to 'some sensible things.' On Tuesday, Ukraine agreed to accept a deal for a temporary ceasefire in its war with Russia in exchange for the U.S. resuming intelligence sharing and security assistance. 'I've been one of the tiny minority of European commentators, politicians, Turners, to think that actually there was method in the madness of Donald Trump, and that he did have a plan,' Johnson said on 'On Balance' Tuesday. Is the US headed for a recession? 4 warning signs to keep an eye on 'I'm a believer in the president, Donald Trump's ability to get things done,' Johnson said. 'When I was Foreign Secretary, I saw how he dealt with Ukraine.' While Johnson said he 'may be proved wrong,' he added that 'Trump is the kind of President who has the guts to stand up to Putin.'

Will Putin accept US-Ukraine ceasefire deal?	(NewsNation) — As Ukraine agrees to a 30-day ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States, experts remain skeptical Russian President Vladimir Putin will reciprocate without adding demands that could derail peace efforts. 'Putin does not want a ceasefire. He wants to take more Ukrainian territory,' John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told NewsNation Tuesday following the announcement of the agreement reached in Saudi Arabia. President Donald Trump's administration announced it would immediately resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after the ceasefire agreement, reversing a controversial freeze implemented in late February. Boris Johnson: I knew Trump had a plan for Ukraine Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, 'The ball is now in Russia's court,' but military experts caution against optimism. 'He could agree to a ceasefire but then continue to fight,' said retired Gen. Wesley Clark, former NATO supreme allied commander. 'There could always be accusations of provocations by Ukraine. There's no one to monitor the ceasefire.' 'Lot of games' until Putin agrees to ceasefire deal: Ex-NATO commander Clark outlined several potential scenarios where Putin might undermine the agreement, including demanding substantial Ukrainian territorial concessions or using the pause to rebuild Russian forces. 'He could say 'yes' and then put some really tough demands on the table, like Ukraine expected to give up the rest of these oblasts provinces,' Clark said. The ceasefire announcement comes after Ukraine launched its largest drone attack of the conflict, with approximately 90 drones targeting Moscow, reportedly killing three people. Ukraine agrees to US proposal for 30-day ceasefire Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to Russia in the coming days to present the ceasefire proposal to Putin. Trump said he hoped that an agreement could be solidified 'over the next few days.' 'I’ve been saying that Russia’s been easier to deal with so far than Ukraine, which is not supposed to be the way it is,' Trump said later Tuesday. 'But it is, and we hope to get Russia. But we have a full ceasefire from Ukraine. That’s good.' Herbst suggested Putin may try to 'probe some Ukrainian weak spots during the ceasefire period' to test American resolve in enforcing the agreement's terms. 'The United States can push back on this,' Clark said, noting that sanctions relief could be a powerful bargaining chip. 'The question is, will we do so?'

Department of Education eliminates almost 50% of workforce	(NewsNation) — The Department of Education announced Tuesday almost half of its staff will be laid off starting March 21. 'Today’s reduction in force reflects the Department of Education’s commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,' Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. The statement added that the department will continue to deliver on programs, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for students who are disabled and competitive grantmaking. This makes it so the department's workforce will total 2,183 workers, down from 4,133 when President Donald Trump first took office. Included in this number are almost 600 employees who took buyouts. Is the US headed for a recession? 4 warning signs to keep an eye on According to a note obtained by NewsNation, all Washington, D.C., offices in the National Capital Region will be closed for 'security reasons' starting 6 p.m. ET Tuesday and also Wednesday. 'Employees will not be permitted in any ED facility on Wednesday, March 12 for any reason,' the note said. 'All offices will reopen on Thursday, March 13, at which time in-person presence will resume.' Several federal agencies have seen layoffs and firings through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump created at the beginning of the year. This includes the Social Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among other agencies.

How does Mahmoud Khalil's case affect those with green cards?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has vowed the arrest of a Columbia University graduate student who organized pro-Palestinian rallies at the school will 'be the first of many to come' as immigration advocates push back against the possible deportation of an immigrant who holds legal permanent resident status. Mahmoud Khalil was sent to a detention center in Louisiana, where he faces deportation after being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 'I think we ought to get them all out of the country,' Trump said about Khalil’s arrest Tuesday. 'They’re troublemakers, they’re agitators. They don’t love our country, we ought to get them the hell out. I think that guy—I heard his statements too. They were plenty bad, and I think we had to get him the hell out of the country.' $20M in liquid meth found in mineral water bottles Khalil was arrested despite holding a green card, which provides him Fifth Amendment due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. Khalil is scheduled to appear at a hearing Wednesday after a federal judge in Manhattan blocked Khalil’s deportation earlier this week. Rosanna Berardi, the managing partner at Berardi Immigration Law, said Khalil’s case is concerning on several levels and sets a dangerous precedent that should be concerning to other migrants in his position. 'I would gather that anyone that has a political view or has protested and also has a green card would be nervous,' Berardi told NewsNation. 'If this is any indication of the administration’s position on green card holders that their own agency vetted at a super-high level and gave a green card to, and this is the behavior of the administration, I would be gravely concerned.' Why is Mahmoud Khalil facing deportation? Khalil was arrested on Saturday for 'leading activities aligned to Hamas,' a designated terrorist organization, the Department of Homeland Security announced. The agency said Khalil was arrested 'in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.' Two people with knowledge of Khalil’s arrest told The New York Times that Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The act states that any alien whom the secretary of state has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable. Trump referred to Khalil as a 'radical, foreign pro-Hamas student' in a post on Truth Social in which he wrote that ICE 'proudly arrested' Khalil. 'We know that there are more students at Columbia and other universities across the country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump administration will not tolerate it,' Trump wrote. House GOP tees up final vote on bill to avert shutdown He added: 'We will find, apprehend and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country – never to return again.' Trump wrote that the presence of those who support terrorism 'is contrary to our national and foreign policy interest and not welcome here.' U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., told NewsNation that colleges and universities need to 'step up to the plate' to prevent rallies like the ones Khalil organized at Columbia from happening. Walberg said that by leading campus protests, Khalil put Jews on campus at risk and kept students from their studies. 'This type of anti-Semitism, anti-Americanism cannot go on in our college campuses,' Walberg said. 'That's not what we are.' Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, a Cornell Law School professor, told The Associated Press that permanent legal residents have many constitutional protections. However, she said that green card holders can be deported for committing certain crimes or failing to report a change in address or committing marriage fraud. Did Mahmoud Khalil break the law? The Center For Constitutional Rights, which is part of Khalil’s legal representation, called Khalil’s arrest, detention and attempted deportation not only 'patently unlawful' but said it is 'a further dangerous step into modern-day McCarthyism repression.' Khalil’s attorney, Amy Greer, told ABC News that ICE arrested Khalil, claiming his student visa had been revoked. But when alerted that Khalil had his green card, agents said that it had been revoked as well. 'Agents arrested a U.S. permanent resident as he was walking home at night with his pregnant spouse because his speech and activism are not to the government’s liking,' Ramzi Kassem, the co-director of Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility, said in a statement issued by the organization. 'If our society remains attached to the rule of law, and if speech in the United States remains free, then no one should accept what happened to Mahmoud.' Florida sees first major operation under Laken Riley Act Berardi, the Buffalo-based immigration attorney, agreed. 'We do not want to be a country in which the government kicks people out because we don’t like what they say,' she said. What happens to Mahmoud Khalil next? Berardi, who has practiced law for nearly 30 years, expects a judge to place Khalil’s case in the immigration court system. He will likely be given a notice to appear, the charging document used in immigration court, which will allege the grounds on which the government is pushing for Khalil’s deportation. The immigration court process drags on for years in some cases, which could keep Khalil in federal custody until he appears before a judge on the charges. In the meantime, Khalil’s wife, who was with him when he was arrested, is eight months pregnant. In a statement issued through the Center For Constitutional Rights, Khalil’s wife, who prefers not to be named in media reports, described her husband’s arrest as being 'kidnapped from home' as the couple awaits their child. But like many migrants who are arrested by federal immigration agents, Khalil faces a very uncertain future as his case enters a system that already faces a yearslong backlog of cases. 'I’m just concerned this is going to be kicked down the road for a long time,' Berardi told NewsNation. 'I don’t see this wrapping up anytime soon, unfortunately.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/mahmoud-khalil-case-green-card-holders/	2025-03-11T14:56:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25068571884044.jpg?w=900

Ukraine agrees to US proposal for 30-day ceasefire	(NewsNation) — Ukraine agreed to accept a deal for a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the U.S. resuming intelligence sharing and security assistance. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. will take the deal to Russia. 'I think today, Ukraine has taken a concrete step in that regard. We hope the Russians will reciprocate,' he said. 'Our hope is that the Russians will say yes. that they will also agree. So the shooting will stop. The killing will stop. The dying will stop, and the talks can begin about how to end this war permanently in a way that's acceptable and enduring for both sides.' Trump to double steel, aluminum tariffs on Canada to 50% Officials from both the U.S. and Ukraine met in Saudi Arabia to broker the deal, with Ukraine expressing gratitude to the U.S. for previous assistance. That comes after a heated exchange between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an Oval Office photo opp, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance attacking Zelenskyy for what they said was a lack of gratitude. Trump expressed hope for the deal. 'Hopefully Putin will agree to it also and we can get this show on the road,' he told reporters. Ukraine has expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal that would enact an immediate 30-day ceasefire with Russia, which can be extended by mutual agreement, and must be reciprocated by the Russians. The U.S. will lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine immediately in exchange. ‘Measles Party’? Health officials say no Russia was not present at the negotiations and the U.S. is expected to communicate that reciprocity is key to the ceasefire. Both delegations also agreed to name negotiating teams and continue negotiations toward a longer-term peace deal, with the U.S. communicating proposals to Russia. European leaders will also be involved in the discussions. Ukraine and the U.S. will also work on an agreement to develop Ukraine's mineral resources.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ukraine-ceasefire-deal/	2025-03-11T11:14:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495043.jpg?w=900
National Park Service faces 30% payroll reduction	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration is looking at a 30% cut in payroll at the National Park Service. A former employee told NewsNation affiliate The Hill that managers were asked to put together plans to cut 30% of payroll. The reduction would not necessarily lead to a 30% cut in staffing, since some employees make more than others. Workforce reductions in the Park Service have been on the table as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency move to make sweeping cuts on government spending. At least 10% of federal jobs have been cut since January. Former Park Service employees say a payroll reduction would immediately impact park janitors and rangers — and would put conservation efforts at risk in the long term. Federal cuts likely to hurt economies around nation’s capital The Park Service normally employs about 20,000 full-time and seasonal workers, but those numbers have recently been reduced. The Trump administration has fired 1,000 probationary employees, and about 700 employees have accepted federal buyouts. The impacts of the staffing cuts already made are reportedly already being felt at national parks, with longer lines at entrances, canceled park ranger tours and reduced hours. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has pledged to hire around 5,000 to 7,000 seasonal employees before the spring and summer seasons. 'It's just absolutely infuriating and heartbreaking,' California resident Jennifer Roberts told NewsNation about the potential cuts. 'The rangers don't do this for the money. They do this because they care about protecting the environment and about the visitors.' The National Park Service saw a record number of visitors in 2024, with more than 331.8 million visits reported at parks across the country.

Girl Scouts sued over alleged heavy metals, pesticides in cookies	NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Girl Scouts have been sued by consumers over the alleged presence of 'heavy metals' and pesticides in its popular Thin Mints and other cookies. A proposed class action was filed on Monday night in the Brooklyn, New York federal court against the 113-year-old nonprofit and the cookies' licensed producers, ABC Bakers and Ferrero USA's Little Brownie Bakers. It cited a December 2024 study commissioned by GMO Science and Moms Across America, which tested samples of 25 cookies from three U.S. states. The study said Girl Scout cookies contained at least four of five heavy metals - aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury - that can harm people's health or the environment, often at levels exceeding regulators' recommended limits. Are Girl Scout Cookies toxic? It also said all samples contained glyphosate, a pesticide used in some weed killers, with Thin Mints containing the highest levels. 'While the entire sales practice system for Girl Scout Cookies is built on a foundation of ethics and teaching young girls sustainable business practices, defendants failed to uphold this standard themselves,' the lawsuit said.

Girl Scouts addresses the allegations Girl Scouts, short for Girl Scouts of the United States of America, addressed the study in a February 6 blog post. It said heavy metals occur naturally in soil, with trace amounts not a safety issue, while glyphosate is found 'nearly everywhere' in the food chain. Girl Scouts also said its bakers are committed to complying with all food safety standards.

The lawsuit is led by Amy Mayo, a resident of Bayside, New York. Wendy’s to offer Frosty customization with sauces, mix-ins Mayo said she bought numerous Girl Scout products such as Adventurefuls, Peanut Butter Patties and Caramel deLites, believing they were 'quality and safe cookies.' She said she would not have bought the cookies or 'would have paid substantially less' had Girl Scouts disclosed the presence of 'dangerous toxins.'

NTSB makes 'urgent safety recommendations' after DC plane crash	(NewsNation) — The National Transportation Safety Board is still in a 'fact-finding phase' regarding the deadly midair collision between a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines aircraft near Washington, D.C. Sixty-seven people were killed on Jan. 29 when the aircraft collided over the Potomac River. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy addressed the media, noting that it is a process to gather the requisite details. A preliminary report was issued on Tuesday but did not include 'probable cause' of the accident. Is it time to update hiring requirements for air traffic controllers? 'I often say that the easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened. The part that takes longer is the how and why,' Homendy said. The NTSB is, however, making 'urgent safety recommendations,' per Homendy, regarding helicopter routes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 'Urgent recommendations require immediate action to prevent similar accidents or incidents when we issue them,' Homendy said. 'We believe a critical safety issue must be addressed without delay.' The recommendation itself reads: 'Prohibit operations on helicopter Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge when runways 15 and 33 are being used for departures and arrivals, respectively, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.' NTSB investigators said there have been 15,214 'near-miss events' at DCA from Oct. 2021 to Dec. 2024. Without a change in helicopter routes, Homendy and NTSB 'remain concerned about the significant potential for future mid-air collision at DCA,' she said. Southwest Airlines breaks with another tradition, and checked bags will cost you now Investigators previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash and that the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers.

Are there benefits to Trump's tariffs?	(NewsNation) — While some U.S. businesses and consumers are worried about their bottom lines amid President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada, Mexico and China, other companies and workers are welcoming the implementation of new tariffs. Anheuser-Busch, which owns Budweiser and Michelob among other beverages, is reportedly thrilled about extra taxes on Mexican and Canadian beers. Most of Anheuser-Busch's beers are made in America, so if the prices of imported brews increase, the company could theoretically sell more of its brands. Cuomo &amp; Carlson: The Conversation continues Chief financial officer Fernando Tennenbaum told Yahoo Finance last month that 'any exposure to tariff is very limited.' Tennenbaum said 99% of what the corporation sells inside the United States is made domestically. New steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect tomorrow, and some executives are pointing to subsidies and lower labor costs in countries like Canada as to why the tariffs should exist. They believe these tariffs will level the playing field. America's largest primary aluminum producer, Century Aluminum, applauded Trump's initial reinstatement of a 25% tariff on primary aluminum imports in a news release last month. 'President Trump’s decisive action will protect national security and help level the playing field for America’s aluminum workers,' Century Aluminum CEO Jesse Gary said. US-Canada products are 99% tariff-free: Canadian ambassador to US 'On behalf of our employees, I thank President Trump for putting America first and strengthening the Section 232 tariffs, which will help drive the resurgence of domestic aluminum production.' Despite concerns about an increase in the price of cars, some are in favor of the initiative. United Auto Workers Union president Shawn Fain told ABC News that tariffs will benefit his colleagues greatly. 'Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years,' Fain said, referencing the North American Free Trade Agreement, which began in 1992. 'Tariffs aren’t the end solution, but they are a huge factor in creating, fixing the problem,' he added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/trump-tariffs-benefits-american-companies/	2025-03-11T08:10:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/65e7d490b6dd85.62397413.jpeg?w=900
Trump to double steel, aluminum tariffs on Canada to 50%	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump plans to double the nation's steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, increasing each to 50%, he announced Tuesday. In a social media post, Trump said the levy's leap is in retaliation to Ontario Premier Doug Ford imposing a 25% electricity tariff on exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota, which took effect on Monday. 'This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,' Trump said in the post. Whiskey makers face worsening hangover from trade dispute The president also said he would declare a 'national emergency on electricity' within the 'threatened area,' presumably the three affected states. 'This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,' Trump said. He did not immediately make his plans clear. Alongside the tariff announcement came further threats of an escalating trade war, with the president specifically targeting Canada's tariffs on American dairy — which are above 200% but only kick in once the U.S. has completed its limit of tariff-free dairy sales. Trump himself negotiated the tariff-free dairy sale limit back in 2018. In the same social media post, Trump said Canada 'must immediately drop' what he described as an 'anti-American farmer tariff,' threatening tariffs on cars if those on dairy and other similar tariffs are not dissolved. Is the US headed for a recession? 4 warning signs to keep an eye on 'If other egregious, long time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada, I will substantially increase, on April 2nd, the Tariffs on Cars coming into the U.S. which will, essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,' the post reads in part. 'Those cars can easily be made in the USA!' According to new Edmunds data, 48.6% of all new vehicles sold through February were built in the U.S. Another 17.4% were built in Mexico, 7.4% in Canada and 26.5% elsewhere. Trump also once again reiterated his desire for Canada to be the nation's 'cherished' 51st state — a development he claims would make 'all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-steel-aluminum-tariffs-canada/	2025-03-11T08:01:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2202667226.jpg?w=900
Search for Sudiksha Konanki, missing Pitt student, continues in D...	(NewsNation) — The search continues for missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, 20, who was last seen early Thursday morning in the Dominican Republic. Despite the search expanding, local officials believe she drowned after being overtaken by a large wave. Her family believes something more sinister has happened. Sudiksha Konanki disappears in Dominican Republic Konanki, a resident of Ashburn, Virginia, was last seen March 6 at 4:50 a.m. while walking on the beach at the Riu Republica Hotel, just north of Punta Cana in the La Altagracia district of the Dominican Republic. Konanki was last seen with a man heading toward the beach; he has since been interviewed by authorities. The man said they were both hit by a large wave, local officials reported, and he returned to shore after being unable to find her in the water. Dominican police are questioning the man and other members of Konanki's group, as well as hotel employees, in an effort to corroborate the timeline and narrow the search area. Konanki was part of a group of six female University of Pittsburgh students traveling together for spring break. On Monday, police deployed canine units in the search, adding to drones, boats and land crews. Why haven’t the JFK and Jeffrey Epstein files been released? Konanki's father has filed a record of complaint, urging authorities to widen the investigation. He is reportedly concerned his daughter may be the victim of kidnapping or foul play. Search for Sudiksha Konanki The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Virginia is pushing Interpol to issue a global missing persons alert. Interpol says the alert, known as a 'yellow notice,' can boost the chances of finding a missing person, especially if they were taken abroad. The sheriff's office said it is hopeful for Konanki's safe return and has asked the public to let investigators do their jobs before drawing any conclusions. The FBI and U.S. Embassy are working with Dominican authorities in this investigation. In an update late Monday, Dominican police said they were working on an analysis of surveillance cameras to track down and connect Konanki's moves since arriving in the country more than a week ago.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/sudiksha-konanki-missing-search-continues/	2025-03-11T07:27:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Sudiksha-Konanki-wings.jpg?w=900
House subcommittee to hold hearing on school choice	(NewsNation) — Supporters of school choice are slated to address the House's Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education at a Tuesday morning hearing. Proponents of school choice programs say parents should get to choose where their children are educated and how tax dollars allocated for education are spent, while detractors worry redirecting funds could gut public education. School choice initiatives, which vary greatly from state to state, are gaining ground across the country as the Trump administration makes school vouchers and parental choice a major focus of its education agenda. Education Dept. says 60 universities under investigation for antisemitism Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon told NewsNation last week that students 'shouldn't be trapped in a failing school,' referring to public institutions. Instead, she wants the funding for public schools to go toward relocating students to charter or public schools. 'They should have the ability to do that,' McMahon said. 'Parents know the success of their children is going to depend on where they're able to get their education.' The hearing, titled 'Education Without Limits: Exploring the Benefits of School Choice,' is scheduled for 10:15 a.m. ET. What is school choice? School choice is an umbrella term for educational initiatives allowing parents to enroll their children in schools other than their assigned public school — including charter schools, private institutions and homeschooling — often using public funding. An executive order signed Jan. 29 gave McMahon, who had not yet been confirmed, 60 days to 'issue guidance regarding how States can use Federal formula funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives.' President Donald Trump's order specified that education freedom should be given 'priority in discretionary grant programs,' which the Department of Education defines as 'financial assistance in the form of money by the Federal government to an eligible grantee.' Essentially, the Trump administration wants to help students switch schools through taxpayer-funded vouchers, scholarships and grants. How that would happen — and what it would cost — has not yet been outlined. Is the US headed for a recession? 4 warning signs to keep an eye on Some Republicans on Capitol Hill believe adopting these methods would help America's students regain ground on declining national test scores, but opponents say the federal funding switch-up would negatively impact public schools that need the most help. 'In rural America, there's one school in the community. You undercut it, and education just dramatically declines,' said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. 'Without good schools, without the funding to support these schools, children will be hurt, our country will be worse off, and the American dream falls by the wayside,' he said. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, roughly nine out of 10 K-12 students in the U.S. attended public schools as of 2021. Department of Education's future Tuesday's hearing comes as Trump's White House looks to dissolve the Department of Education altogether. The agency's closure was a cornerstone of his campaign and serves as the so-called 'final mission' for McMahon's subordinates. Last week, Trump was scheduled to sign an executive order asking McMahon to essentially put herself out of a job, though it was delayed. A White House official told NewsNation the administration would continue to review the department in the meantime. Senate confirms Lori Chavez-DeRemer as Trump’s labor secretary 'He’s been crystal clear that he wants to see the Department of Education closed, and he’d like to see it done sooner rather than later,' McMahon said. 'But he understands that we need to work with Congress. There are certain things that are in statute.' It would take an act of Congress to shutter the agency. 'I think my job is to convince Congress that the steps that we are taking are in the best interest of the kids,' McMahon said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/house-subcommittee-hearing-school-choice/	2025-03-11T04:55:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/72db96a8-20e5-497d-a885-4caa6fd27320_e675f1.jpg?w=800
US-Ukraine talks begin hours after Kyiv's huge drone attack on Mo...	(NewsNation) — Officials from Ukraine and the United States have gathered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss diplomatic cooperation and a potential 'limited ceasefire' in the Russia-Ukraine war, according to officials. It's the first time the allied diplomats are sitting down face-to-face after an explosive Oval Office meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Feb. 28 left a rare minerals deal unsigned and international tensions on the rise. Trump over the weekend was hopeful about the 'big meetings' in Saudi Arabia, telling reporters on Air Force One: 'A lot of people died this week, as you know, in Ukraine, not only Ukrainians, but Russians. So I think everybody wants to see it get done. We're going to make a lot of progress, I believe, this week.' Frontlines with Robert Sherman: Aboard Air Force One for NewsNation Ukrainian officials told the Associated Press on Monday that they will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea — which would bring safer shipping — as well as long-range missile strikes that have hit civilians in Ukraine and the release of prisoners. The Kremlin has not publicly offered any concessions. Russia has said it is ready to cease hostilities on the condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian. The two senior Ukrainian officials said Kyiv is also ready to sign an agreement with the U.S. on access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals — a deal that Trump is keen to secure. Ukraine carries out massive drone attack on Russia The meeting also comes on the heels of what appears to be the largest-ever Ukrainian drone attack on Russia. Russian officials said overnight its air defenses shot down 337 Ukrainian drones over 10 Russian regions, killing at least two people and injuring another 18. Ukrainian officials have not yet commented on the attack. Ukraine on its way to negotiated surrender because of Trump: Bolton Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and other top officials will represent the U.S. at the meetings in Saudi Arabia. Rubio has previously emphasized there is no military solution to the war, while Waltz has joined a growing chorus of Republicans who suggested Ukraine might be better off finding a new leader altogether.

Pope gets good news from doctors: He's no longer in immediate dan...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis woke up Tuesday to good news from his doctors: They upgraded his prognosis and say he is no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of the double pneumonia that has kept him hospitalized for nearly a month in the longest and gravest threat to his 12-year papacy. The 88-year-old pope isn’t out of the woods yet, however. Doctors are still cautious and have decided to keep him hospitalized for several more days to receive treatment, not to mention a period of rehabilitation he will likely need. But the doctors said he remains stable and has consolidated improvements in recent days, according to blood tests and his good response to treatment. Francis, who has chronic lung disease, is still using supplemental oxygen during the day and a ventilation mask at night to help him breathe. Syrian refugee family that Pope Francis brought to Rome prays for him as they build new life In an early update Tuesday, the Vatican said Francis woke up around 8 a.m. after a quiet night. The Argentine Jesuit has regularly been sleeping in while at Gemelli hospital, given his usual wakeup time at the Vatican is around 4:30 a.m. Late Monday, doctors lifted their 'guarded' prognosis for the pope, meaning they determined he was no longer in imminent danger as a result of the original respiratory infection he arrived with on Feb. 14. But their caution remained, given Francis’ fragility and risks of other complications. 'In view of the complexity of the clinical picture and the important infectious picture presented on admission, it will be necessary to continue medical drug therapy in a hospital setting for additional days,' the Vatican statement said. In a sign of his improved health, Francis followed the Vatican’s weeklong spiritual retreat via videoconference on Monday in both the morning and afternoon sessions, something he was likely to continue to do through the week. The retreat, an annual gathering that kicks off the Catholic Church’s solemn Lenten season leading to Easter, continues through Friday. The Vatican has said Francis would participate 'in spiritual communion' with the rest of the hierarchy, from afar. In his own words: Pope Francis’ views on resigning changed over time Francis could see and hear the Rev. Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops, cardinals and nuns gathered for the retreat in the Vatican auditorium could not see or hear him. Pasolini is delivering a series of meditations this week on 'The hope of eternal life,' a theme that was chosen well before Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection. Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was just a bad case of bronchitis when he was hospitalized last month. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis and raised questions about the future. He was still keeping his eye on things, however. The Vatican said he had been informed about the floods in his native Argentina, sent a telegram of condolences and expressed his closeness to the affected population.

Is the US headed for a recession? 4 warning signs to keep an eye ...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's tariffs have set off a wave of economic uncertainty, driving stocks lower and fueling fears of a potential recession. Trump didn't rule out the possibility of a recession in a recent Fox News interview with Maria Bartiromo. When asked if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump told Bartiromo: 'I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.' Trump on if he’s expecting 2025 recession: ‘I hate to predict’ Trump added: 'It takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us.' Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that there's going to be a 'detox period' for the U.S. economy as it moves away from public spending to private spending. While the president and administration officials urge patience, investors are feeling uneasy, and some banks have raised their recession odds in recent days. How likely is a recession? Recession risks have ticked up recently, but that doesn't mean a downturn is imminent. Last week, Goldman Sachs hiked its odds of a recession in the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, The Wall Street Journal reported. The bank reportedly noted its forecast could increase further if the Trump administration remains 'committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data.' Economists at J.P. Morgan Chase are more pessimistic and peg the chances of a recession this year at 40%, 'owing to extreme US policies,' according to Bloomberg. A recent forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta also set off alarm bells, estimating that first-quarter GDP may decline by an annualized adjusted rate of 2.4%, which would be the first quarterly contraction in the U.S. since 2022. A separate projection from the New York Federal Reserve is more optimistic, forecasting robust 2.7% growth in the first quarter. Which is all to say: Predicting a recession is difficult, and experts disagree about how likely it is to happen. Back in March 2023, Goldman Sachs saw a 35% chance of a U.S. recession in the year ahead, but that didn't end up happening. As a general rule of thumb, two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth is often considered a recession, but that's not the official definition. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines 'recession' as a 'significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.' While the U.S. may not be in a recession today, there are four economic indicators that suggest the U.S. economy may be slowing. 1 - Job market softening but resilient U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in February, a sign the job market is slowing but still holding up for now. Employment rose in health care and finance as well as transportation and warehousing, according to the latest Labor Department data. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.1%, up from 4.0% in January but still historically low. 'It's hard to look at the jobs data and believe that GDP is contracting in Q1,' Harvard Economist Jason Furman wrote on X. 'But then again, crazier things have happened.' Job cuts last month higher than any February since 2009 Lydia Boussour, senior economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, called February's job growth 'healthy' but said 'downside risks are brewing.' 'Steep tariff increases and the surge in uncertainty and volatility could cause job growth to moderate even further,' Boussour wrote in a commentary. Other data has offered more reason for concern. A recent report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas found U.S.-based employers cut more jobs last month than in any February since 2009. Part of that was driven by government job cuts resulting from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts. 'With the impact of the Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE] actions, as well as canceled Government contracts, fear of trade wars, and bankruptcies, job cuts soared in February,' Andrew Challenger, senior vice president and workplace expert for Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, said in the report. The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits has also risen, climbing to 242,000 for the week ending Feb. 22, the highest level since early December. However, 'that number is still historically low,' according to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management. 2 - Stocks have pulled back The S&amp;P 500 is down more than 7% over the past month, wiping out all of its gains since Trump was reelected in November. Share prices for popular stocks like Tesla (-36%), Nvidia (-25%) and Meta (-16%) have sunk even faster from a month ago. Uncertainty around Trump's tariffs — and the potential hit to both consumers and businesses — appear to be the main reason investors are spooked. 'This is the first time we’ve had an administration pretty much say with a straight face … the objectives are going to cause pain,' Shelby McFaddin, investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, told The Wall Street Journal. The stock market is down: Are Trump’s tariffs to blame? Major retailers like Target and Best Buy have already warned shoppers that the president's tariffs will likely lead to higher prices. Trump's tariff flip-flop in recent days has only added to the chaos and made it harder for Wall Street investors to price-in the potential impact. 'There are always multiple forces at work in the market, but right now, almost all of them are taking a back seat to tariffs,' according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. Though it has fallen over the past month, the S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 10% from a year ago. 3 - Americans are spending less Consumer spending is the backbone of the U.S. economy, and recent data suggests Americans may be starting to pull back. Americans cut their spending by 0.2% in January from the month prior — the first decline since March 2023 and the biggest decrease in nearly four years. The drop was partially attributed to unseasonably cold weather, so it could be an anomaly rather than a trend. Still, the retreat was unexpected and occurred even as incomes rose. If Trump's tariffs worsen inflation, as many economists expect them to, Americans may cut back further. That would be a major problem for the economy given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. US consumer confidence drops by most since August 2021 'We have to wait and see how new tariffs ultimately affect the data to see if consumer spending could be altered,' Haworth said in his analysis. Two separate measures of consumer resilience have flashed warning signs recently. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell sharply in February, recording the biggest monthly decline since August 2021. The index that measures consumers' short-term outlook slipped below the threshold 'that usually signals a recession ahead,' the Conference Board noted. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment also dropped last month, in large part 'due to fears that tariff-induced price increases are imminent,' survey director Joanne Hsu said. 4 - Credit card debt, late car payments on the rise Americans collectively owe more than $1.21 trillion on their credit cards, a record high that suggests much of the recent consumer spending strength has been fueled by borrowing. Now, more Americans are falling behind on their loans. Credit card delinquencies ticked up at the end of 2024, but late payments on auto loans rose even faster, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Late car payments hit highest level in decades In the fourth quarter of 2024, the share of auto loans among all borrowers that transitioned into serious delinquency — 90 days or more past due — rose to 3%, the highest level since 2010. 'Higher car prices combined with higher interest rates have driven monthly payments upward and have put pressure on consumers across the income and credit score spectrum,' researchers at the New York Fed wrote. Separate data from Fitch Ratings shows subprime auto borrowers are feeling the most pain. Some 6.56% of subprime auto borrowers were at least 60 days past due on their loans in January, the most since the agency began collecting the data in 1994. Another sign Americans may be feeling financially strained? More people are raiding their retirement savings to cover emergency expenses.

Judge blocks deportation of Columbia University protester	(NewsNation) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the removal of a Columbia University graduate student who led pro-Palestinian protests, ordering that he cannot be deported while the court considers the petition. U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman of the Southern District of New York issued the order Monday for Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who helped lead campus protests urging Columbia to cut financial ties with Israel. The Department of Homeland Security said Khalil was detained Saturday under President Donald Trump's executive order banning antisemitism, though he has not been charged with any crimes. Menendez brothers ‘do not meet the standards for rehabilitation’: DA The judge scheduled a conference for Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. after his lawyers filed a lawsuit challenging his detention. A Palestinian green card holder, Khalil earned his master's degree in December, and his wife, a U.S. citizen, is eight months pregnant. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the arrest, saying the U.S. will revoke visas and green cards of Hamas supporters, though no evidence has been provided linking Khalil to Hamas. Trump called Khalil a 'radical foreign pro-Hamas student' on Truth Social, stating that supporters of terrorism are not welcome in the U.S. College student vanishes on spring break trip to Dominican Republic After his arrest in New York, Khalil was flown to an immigration jail in Louisiana. Khalil’s detention drew outrage from civil rights groups and free speech advocates, who accused the administration of using its immigration enforcement powers to squelch criticism of Israel. Typically, expelling a person who has permanent residency in the U.S. requires a high bar, such as that person being convicted of certain types of crimes. He’s the first person known to be detained for deportation under Trump’s promised crackdown on student protests.

Does Putin deserve more sympathy in war with Ukraine?	Last year, two of the most prolific names in media met. This Monday, Tucker Carlson and Chris Cuomo continue the conversation. Tune in to 'CUOMO' on Monday 8p/7C to watch. (NewsNation) — As the war between Russia and Ukraine enters its fourth year, Tucker Carlson acknowledges he is more sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin than he is to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Carlson said he thinks this for one reason. Cuomo &amp; Carlson: The Conversation continues 'I’m not sympathetic to Putin in the sense that I want to move to Russia,' Carlson told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'I don’t see Russia as a close friend of mine at all – or as a free country or anything like that. I’m just saying I just think it’s fair to judge leaders on how they do for their country. They have one job: Do a good job for your country. Make it better.' Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump engaged in a heated argument in the Oval Office last month in which Trump told the Ukrainian president he was not in a good position in the ongoing war. Immigration needs to be ‘shut down’ until unity restored: Carlson Carlson maintains that the United States has funded 'the worst war since World War II' for three years and that the country’s stance on the war has made it weaker on the world stage. Cuomo said, however, that since Trump took office in January, the line has shifted, and Ukraine is 'now the bad guy' while Putin has garnered more sympathy from U.S. lawmakers. Yet when it comes to Zelenskyy, whom Carlson refers to as a 'complicated person,' the Ukrainian leader has become a 'pawn among bigger powers,' he said. Why haven’t the JFK and Jeffrey Epstein files been released? 'I feel bad for Zelenskyy, but we were required to pretend that (Zelenskyy) was Jesus and that Vladimir Putin was Satan,' Carlson told Cuomo, adding that he was fired from Fox News for his stance. 'My only point is, that’s not true, actually. It’s way more complicated than that. Both of them have good and bad qualities. And moreover, it’s not our fight. What are we doing there?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/does-putin-deserve-more-sympathy-in-war-with-ukraine/	2025-03-10T15:06:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/05/ddab6d780e884e0fabf6001b8287a0df.jpg?w=900
Immigration needs to be 'shut down' until unity restored: Carlson	Last year, two of the most prolific names in media met. This Monday, Tucker Carlson and Chris Cuomo continue the conversation. Tune in to 'CUOMO' on Monday at 8p/7C to watch. (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has made reining in illegal immigration a key component of his administration, but Tucker Carlson said in a conversation with NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo that the country needs to shut down 'all immigration' for a cooling-off period until unity among Americans can become restored. Carlson told Cuomo that allowing migrants to enter the country illegally is the biggest problem currently facing the nation and insists there is only one solution. Cuomo &amp; Carlson: The Conversation continues 'It’s too chaotic, it’s too crazy right now,' Carlson said. 'No more people, period. None. Cap it right now.' As Trump continues to push for the largest domestic deportation in American history, Carlson said that illegal immigration has created chaos and disunity among the American people. He said that the central question facing the country is how to bring people back together. 'How do 50 states not become 50 countries?' Carlson asked. Why haven’t the JFK and Jeffrey Epstein files been released? In suggesting a 'cooling off' period from allowing people to enter the country, Carlson says what is needed is a period of time when people consider what it means to be an American and what brings us together. '(But) immigration makes it impossible because it’s too much churn,' he told Cuomo. 'Things change too fast.' While Cuomo said that immigration is how the United States became populated, Carlson said that people were not entering the country at the rate they have been in recent years. Does Putin deserve more sympathy in war with Ukraine? The Trump administration has blamed former President Joe Biden’s open-border policy for allowing millions of migrants to enter the country, which led to a crisis that Trump is trying to solve through mass deportations. 'Whoever opened the spigot and flooded our country with 15 or 25 million illegals in the past four years should be in prison for the rest of his life,' Carlson told Cuomo. 'That’s the worst thing that’s ever been done to this country, and I don’t know if we can recover from it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/immigration-needs-to-be-shut-down-until-unity-restored-carlson/	2025-03-10T15:05:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a54e51ebf688.35259054.jpeg?w=900
Why haven't the JFK and Jeffrey Epstein files been released?	Last year, two of the most prolific names in media met. This Monday, Tucker Carlson and Chris Cuomo continue the conversation. Tune in to 'CUOMO' on Monday at 8p/7C to watch. (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order that declassifies records connected to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, but many fear what releasing what is found in those files may do. In a conversation with Tucker Carlson, NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo says he believes there is information in the files that implicates the Central Intelligence Agency in Kennedy’s assassination. But Carlson believes something larger is at play. Cuomo &amp; Carlson: The Conversation continues 'The CIA has already been discredited,' Carlson said. Why the JFK assassination files haven't been released Carlson said he does not know why the files have not been released before now. 'The story doesn’t make sense,' he said. Trump signed the executive order regarding the JFK files in late January, and as of this week, none of the information found in the files has been released. Carlson said that pressure is being applied to the Trump administration not to release the files. Who that may be pressuring Trump remains unknown, he added. 'We can say with certainty that there is a force that is acting on these people — a very serious force to the point that they are embarrassing themselves because they promised they would release this and they haven’t,' Carlson said. Does Putin deserve more sympathy in war with Ukraine? When will the Jeffrey Epstein files be made public? The same applies to files related to Jeffrey Epstein, Carlson and Cuomo said. The U.S. Department of Justice recently released hundreds of Epstein files to a group of conservative influencers, but U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi says there are more. Bondi is now being pressured to release Epstein’s flight log for his private jet and helicopter, according to The Hill. Immigration needs to be ‘shut down’ until unity restored: Carlson 'Where are the files? Where are they?' Cuomo asked. In both cases, Cuomo and Carlson agreed that more transparency is needed. 'I’m really concerned that the failure to disclose big things, like the details about the murder of a president in a democratic country or republic, will convince people that our system itself is fake,' Carlson said. 'And it’s kind of hard to argue that’s it’s real if you can’t even know who killed the president?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hold-why-havent-the-jfk-and-jeffrey-epstein-files-been-released/	2025-03-10T15:04:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/JPEG-trump.jpg?w=900
Credit card debt calculator: Find out how much you owe	(NewsNation) — Americans have more credit card debt than ever, but knowing where you stand can help you climb out of a hole. Credit card balances in the U.S. hit a record high $1.21 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A separate report from TransUnion found the average credit card debt per consumer is now $6,580, and more than 173 million people carry a balance. Here are 4 tips to get out of credit card debt At the same time, credit card interest rates are near a record high, which means falling behind on payments has never been more expensive. Understanding your credit card situation can help you turn things around. The size of your outstanding balance, interest rate and monthly payments will help determine which repayment strategy is best for you. You can use the NewsNation credit card payoff calculator to get control of your debt.

From Your Money on NewsNation How can I get out of credit card debt? There are two popular strategies for paying off credit card debt: The avalanche method: Pay off debt with the highest interest rate first. Make a list of your debts organized by interest rate from highest to lowest Pay off your debt with the highest interest rate first, then move on to the debt with the next highest rate, and so on. Pros: Reduces the amount of interest you pay over the long run Cons: May take longer to completely pay off, since it prioritizes interest rate over size of balances Is credit card debt settlement a good idea? The snowball method: Pay off your smallest debts first. Rank your debts from smallest to largest based on their current balance Pay off your smallest debt first, then move on to the next smallest balance and so on. Pros: Can be motivating and build confidence to watch debts disappear Cons: You pay more interest over the long run by not prioritizing debt with the highest interest rate There is no one-size-fits-all approach for everyone, and the right debt repayment strategy depends on your unique situation and financial habits. How credit card debt relief can impact your taxes Other steps you can take if you've fallen behind on your credit card payments: Ask your card issuer for a lower interest rate: Lenders may reduce your interest rate if they know you're struggling. Simply call and explain your situation. Look into a balance transfer credit card: Balance transfers allow you to move debt from a high-interest credit card to a card with a lower interest rate, usually for a fee. Consider nonprofit credit counseling: Credit counselors can help you come up with a plan to repay your debt, oftentimes for free. To check whether a credit counseling agency is legit, make sure they are certified by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC).	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/credit-card-debt-calculator/	2025-03-10T12:23:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1159840872_019cbf.jpg?w=900
Social Security Administration bans reading 'general news' at wor...	(The Hill) — The Social Security Administration (SSA) has banned reading 'general news' websites at work, according to The Hill. 'Social Security employees should be focused on mission-critical work and serving the American people,' a Social Security spokesperson said in a statement emailed to The Hill on Thursday. Trump signs executive order on student loan forgiveness program 'Therefore, we implemented additional restrictions to the categories of websites prohibited from government-furnished equipment, including online shopping, general news, and sports. Employees may request an exception if they have a business need for job-specific duties,' the spokesperson continued. NBC News and The Washington Post both reported previously that there was an SSA email discussing employee website bans including for 'general news,' which was confirmed by the agency's statement. Social Security warns of 'significant workforce reductions' The SSA recently said it was letting employees know about incoming 'significant workforce reductions' while it got ready for 'agency-wide organizational restructuring' as reports were coming forth on thousands of workers being potentially let go. A week ago, the agency said offices that carried out functions not 'mandated by statute may be prioritized for reduction-in-force actions that could include abolishment of organizations and positions, directed reassignments, and reductions in staffing.' Inside hidden cartel smuggling tunnels in the Rio Grande Valley 'The agency may reassign employees from non-mission critical positions to mission-critical direct service positions (e.g., field offices, teleservice centers, processing centers),' the SSA said. 'Reassignments may be involuntary and may require retraining for new workloads.' DOGE, Trump federal job cuts The Trump administration has sought to dramatically reshape the federal government through actions like job cuts. On Wednesday, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Doug Collins confirmed that his department was preparing to cut about 72,000 jobs. Targeted Tesla attacks continue amid outrage at Elon Musk 'Our goal is to reduce VA employment levels to 2019 in strength numbers, roughly 398,000 employees, from our current level of approximately 470,000 employees,' Collins said in a video statement. 'Now that’s a 15 percent decrease. We’re going to accomplish this without making cuts to health care or benefits to veterans and VA beneficiaries.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/social-security-bans-reading-general-news/	2025-03-10T11:15:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP24347611754679-e1739880320757.jpg?w=900
Cuomo & Carlson: The Conversation continues	Last year, two of the most prolific names in media met. This Monday, Tucker Carlson and Chris Cuomo continue the conversation. Tune in to 'CUOMO' on Monday at 8p/7C to watch. (NewsNation) — Following up on their meeting last year, Chris Cuomo and Tucker Carlson sit down for part two of their conversation on NewsNation. Click here to watch Part 1 of 'Cuomo &amp; Carlson: The Conversation' Despite Carlson and Cuomo being critical of each other in the past, both were let go from partisan cable networks the past few years — Carlson from Fox and Cuomo by CNN. They also have the same lawyer, Cuomo said, who encouraged them to 'bridge the gap and talk to each other for personal reasons.' Why haven’t the JFK and Jeffrey Epstein files been released? Monday night, the two talked about all things Russia-Ukraine war, declassified JFK and Epstein files and DEI. Russia-Ukraine War The war entered its fourth year on Feb. 24 and continues despite efforts by the Trump administration to urge Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to withdraw. The two world leaders got into a heated argument at the Oval Office on Feb. 28, when President Donald Trump raised his voice at Zelenskyy, calling him 'disrespectful' and also saying, 'You're gambling with World War III.' Carlson said the U.S. has funded 'the worst war Europe has seen since World War II for three years.' 'We are not negotiating from a position of strength,' Carlson said. 'Sorry, I'm not taking Russia's side. I'm on America's side. This is terrible for us. We've exposed how weak we are.' Does Putin deserve more sympathy in war with Ukraine? Cuomo pushed Carlson, saying the former Fox News host is more sympathetic toward Russian President Vladimir Putin than Zelenskyy, to which Carlson agreed. 'I think it's fair to judge leaders on how they do for their country. They have one job. Do a good job for your country, make it better,' Carlson said. 'Russia, actually, for a country at war, is thriving.' Cuomo challenged Carlson on making Ukraine out to be the bad guy. 'I got fired over this. … Ok, I feel bad for Zelenskyy, but we were required to pretend that he was Jesus and that Vladimir Putin was Satan. And my only point is that's not true. It's way more complicated than that,' Carlson said. DEI Another timely topic is diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, which Trump has sought to dismantle within the federal government. Some private companies like Target have cut back their own DEI programs and divisions. 'The meritocracy to be judged by what you do, not what you look like,' Carlson said. 'Every institution in American life, almost about any exception at all, has abandoned that standard and now has something called DEI or diversity hiring.' Carlson said aptitude and basis of intelligence, not race or sex, should be prioritized. Immigration needs to be ‘shut down’ until unity restored: Carlson 'Now, in federal contracting, if you're a woman-owned business, why do I have an interest in a woman-owned business?' he said. JFK/Epstein files declassified Carlson had a question for Cuomo: Why have the JFK files been kept secret for so long? The Trump administration has moved to declassify the files. 'It's a boogeyman. Why don't they put it out? Because institutions protect themselves,' Cuomo responded. 'Tucker, as we both know, really, and there is clearly information in those files that are going to make the CIA look bad.' Carlson doesn’t buy it. 'There's no one at the CIA who was involved. There's no one in America who's involved in the Kennedy assassination,' Carlson said. What about the FBI? 'I've always thought that. And then in January, you know, there was a scramble over who's gonna get what jobs in the new administration,' Carlon said. 'You have a sitting member of the United States Senate whose main goal is to keep those files secret.' Recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered an investigation into the FBI’s handling of the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. 'Where is your boy Kash Patel? He went in there to supposedly bust all this up,' Cuomo said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/cuomo-carlson-part-ii-the-conversation/	2025-03-10T10:17:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/image-8.png?w=663
Social Security to again recoup 100% of overpayments	(NewsNation) — The Social Security Administration is reinstating its plan to reclaim 100% of overpayments made to beneficiaries — a ten-fold jump from the current rate, the agency announced Friday. By asking for 100% of overpayments to be repaid by recipients, the agency could save about $7 billion over the next decade, the Office of the Chief Actuary estimated. The new rate will take effect March 27. 'We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people,' said Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, in a statement. 'It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds,' Dudek said. How many people over 100 receive Social Security benefits? Improper Social Security payments The SSA discarded its 100% per paycheck policy — in favor of 10%, set by Biden — last year after years of improper payments left some beneficiaries grappling with massive repayment bills, drawing media and political ire. One instance cited in a 2024 report from the Office of the Inspector General found that the SSA overpaid a disability beneficiary by about $62,000. The SSA learned of the mistake in June 2021, after the beneficiary had already received an extra $9,000 over four months, but the administration did not take action to collect the overpayment until May 2023. By then, the beneficiary had received an additional $53,000, according to the Office of the Inspector General. Social Security to increase monthly benefits for millions With a 100% withholding rate reinstated, recipients like those would likely see their payments mostly or entirely withheld for repayment purposes. Shannon Benton, executive director of Senior Citizens League, told CBS News: 'The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits.' DOGE downsizes Social Security The SSA hasn't been spared from the Department of Government Efficiency's budget cuts and downsizing plans. The latest round of cuts saw the immediate or planned closure of 47 Social Security offices across the country. The southeastern U.S. was hit the hardest, with almost half of all closures taking place in Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Mississippi and Arkansas. DOGE leader Elon Musk also falsely claimed that millions of dead beneficiaries were receiving monthly checks in 'the biggest fraud in history.' It's true that records with incomplete death information have plagued the agency, but a 2023 agency inspector general report found 'almost none' of the 18.9 million people listed as 100 or older were receiving benefits. 'What Musk has tweeted is not primarily an example of fraud but more like the messy databases kept by Social Security,' said Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits In a February news release, the agency said all its employees had been told to prepare for 'significant workforce reductions.' Employees could be fired or redirected, while some positions could be eliminated completely. 'Reassignments may be involuntary and may require retraining for new workloads,' the release said.

LA district attorney to provide update on Menendez brothers case	(NewsNation) — The Los Angeles district attorney is set to give an update Monday on the case status of the Menendez brothers, who have been in prison for nearly three decades after the 1989 killing of their parents. Erik and Lyle Menendez had been pushing for a new trial, citing new evidence of their father’s sexual abuse, but District Attorney Nathan Hochman cast doubt over the evidence and opposed their petition, calling the brothers’ sexual abuse claims 'untrustworthy.' 'Sexual abuse in this situation may have been a motivation for Erik and Lyle to do what they did, but it does not constitute self-defense,' Hochman said last month. But Hochman said he had yet to make a decision on their resentencing bid, which could lead to the brothers' freedom. Menendez brothers case timeline: Murder to resentencing The brothers’ case was re-opened in October of last year, when then-District Attorney George Gascón announced that his office would reexamine the case in light of the new evidence, which included a letter alleging sexual abuse purportedly written by Erik Menendez just months before he and his brother, Lyle, fatally shot their parents in Beverly Hills. Following an initial mistrial, the Menendez brothers were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 without possibility of parole. The brothers were 21 and 18 at the time. This combination of two booking photos provided by the California Department of Corrections shows Erik Menendez, left, and Lyle Menendez. (California Dept. of Corrections via AP) The Menendez brothers, now in their 50s, have spent nearly 30 years in prison. According to family member Tamara Goodell, they have 'created careers for themselves' while incarcerated, starting numerous peer support groups and initiatives. They have also submitted a clemency plea to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who previously said he would not make a decision until Hochman reviewed the case. The case has gained new traction after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.'

Cartel human smuggling push continues along southern border	(NewsNation) — Despite a dramatic decrease in migrant encounters in the Rio Grande Valley, officials at the southern border said cartel human smuggling operations show no signs of slowing down. Migrant apprehensions in the area have dropped to just around 100 per day under the Trump administration — a stark contrast to the reported 2,000 daily crossings just a year ago. NewsNation joined Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley to see firsthand the stark contrast between quieter border activity and continued cartel smuggling operations. The area remains a known smuggling hotspot. And as NewsNation followed agents, children’s clothing and personal belongings were visibly scattered along the trail — a reminder that family units and single adults from Central America continue to be moved through the sector. ICE arrests Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia University protests: Lawyer Agents said it’s common to see clothing left behind as migrants rush to avoid capture. Hundreds of discarded wristbands also littered the ground. Border Patrol agents told NewsNation these wristbands are not just random trash but are a form of control, with cartels using them to track and manage migrants throughout their journey. Each color and label represents a different smuggling network. Some say 'Mexicanos,' others say 'Entregas' — which translates to 'deliveries.' 'Let me lowball here and say that the illegal alien wearing this wristband paid $1,000 to cross the Rio Grande, and I'm going pretty low here,' Christina Smallwood, an agent with the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol, told NewsNation. Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki missing in the Dominican Republic 'This just shows you how much money the cartel made off human smuggling,' she said. Agents also told NewsNation that migrants wearing the wristbands often pay extra money to cartels so that if they are deported, they can cross again without paying a second time. Despite a more quiet border, challenges remain — staying one step ahead of cartels and dismantling their human smuggling networks is a constant battle for Border Patrol agents, they said. After an apprehension, Border Patrol agents must conduct background checks. If the migrants have no criminal record, they can be removed or deported within hours. In many cases, Border Patrol uses buses to transport migrants to an entry point, where they are handed over to Mexican authorities. Migrants crossing illegally are being removed and deported much faster than in the past — in some cases, within just an hour of apprehension, without the probability of seeing or waiting for a judge.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartel-human-smuggling-southern-border/	2025-03-10T08:15:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/AP21271604046859.jpg?w=900
More than 80% of USAID programs cut, Rubio says	(NewsNation) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Monday that the United States has cut 83% of programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development and said the thousands of canceled contracts did not serve the 'core national interests' of the U.S. Rubio made the announcement in a social media post and said the Trump administration has wrapped up a six-week review. 'The 5200 contracts that are now cancelled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,' he wrote. HHS makes $25,000 buyout offer to most of its employees Rubio thanked the Department of Government Efficiency and 'our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform' in foreign aid. He said he would transfer the 18% of programs that survived the purge to the State Department. The announcement was one of few public comments from Rubio on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by political appointees of President Donald Trump at the State Department and Elon Musk's DOGE team. SCOTUS lifts freeze on some foreign aid The Trump administration has worked for weeks to dismantle USAID, which oversees foreign aid and development programs. Thousands of employees have either been put on leave or fired, while the federal government has also frozen payments to contractors. Trump's tax cuts from 2017 could expire by year's end After a federal court ruling last week, the government must start making payments to contractors on Monday for work already done, which is estimated to cost around $2 billion. It's unclear if the cuts will impact the Food for Peace program, which buys billions in food from American farmers to send overseas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/usaid-programs-canceled-rubio/	2025-03-10T07:22:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a431b60cd3c2.35830804.jpeg?w=900
Elon Musk says X outages caused by cyberattack	(NewsNation) — X owner Elon Musk has said the multiple outages experienced by X users Monday were the result of a cyberattack. Musk hypothesized on his platform that 'Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country' was responsible. He added X was investigating further. 'There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against X. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing,' Musk wrote. Many X users experienced as many as three outages throughout Monday. Some users reported an outage of the platform, formerly known as Twitter, around 6:30 a.m. ET, the number of reports skyrocketing to thousands within 20 minutes, according to downdetector.com. Targeted Tesla attacks continue amid outrage at Elon Musk That outage subsided shortly after, but as of 10 a.m. ET, the site was having trouble loading again. During that service interruption, X web users encountered a message reading, 'Something went wrong. Try reloading.' A button to retry also appeared, prompting a spinning blue circle that reverted to the same message after a few seconds. Users reported similar problems with the app version of X.

ICE arrests Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia protest...	(NewsNation) — Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has been arrested at New York's Columbia University as part of President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on what he calls illegal campus protests. Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, told the Associated Press that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers entered Khalil's university-owned apartment, just blocks from Columbia's Manhattan campus, and arrested him on Saturday night. The agents claimed they were acting on a State Department order to revoke Khalil's green card, Greer said. Who is Mahmoud Khalil? Khalil, who was actively involved in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last spring, was one of few protesters to publicly share his name. Khalil is a legal, permanent U.S. resident who grew up in Syria, according to his attorney, and is married to a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant. Israel cuts off electricity supply to Gaza, affecting drinking water Greer told the Associated Press that Khalil's wife does not know his whereabouts and that authorities have declined to explain his detention to her. Khalil has since been transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, according to the Associated Press. One ICE officer told Greer by phone that they were executing a State Department order to revoke Khalil’s student visa. Informed that Khalil, who graduated in December, was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer. Columbia University contracts canceled over antisemitism allegations The Department of Homeland Security said in a social media post that it had arrested Khalil because he has 'led activities aligned to Hamas,' without elaborating. A Homeland Security spokesperson said Khalil's arrest aligns with the Trump administration's threats to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests. The administration has claimed that by allegedly supporting Hamas against Israel’s war in Gaza, students have forfeited their right to remain in the U.S. Fighter jets again intercept aircraft near Trump's Mar-a-Lago Trump emphasized this stance on Tuesday, vowing that 'agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came.' The administration has placed particular scrutiny on Columbia, announcing Friday that it would be cutting $400 million in grants and contracts because of what the government described as the school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. Civil rights union slams Mahmoud Khalil's arrest The New York Civil Liberties Union condemned Khalil's arrest, calling it 'a frightening escalation' and 'retaliation by the Trump administration.' A spokesperson for Columbia University said the school is unable to share information about students due to legal restrictions but emphasized the university's commitment to protecting students' legal rights. The spokesperson also noted that law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property but declined to say if the school had received a warrant for Khalil’s arrest, per the Associated Press.

Fighter jets again intercept aircraft near Trump's Mar-a-Lago in ...	(NewsNation) — U.S. fighter jets were scrambled twice over the weekend to intercept civilian aircraft in the skies over Palm Beach, Fla., where President Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said the most recent incident occurred around 1 p.m. Florida time on Sunday when NORAD aircraft escorted a civilian aircraft out of the area after setting off flares to get the pilot’s attention. The airspace over Trump’s property has a permanent flight restriction that expands to a radius of 30 nautical miles when the president is in residence. Robotic dogs are patrolling Mar-a-Lago to help protect Trump, Secret Service confirms NORAD said its aircraft have responded to more than 20 'tracks of interest' since Trump took office on Jan. 20. The agency reported three interceptions just last week. The military command reminded pilots to stay current on the 'Notice to Airmen,' or NOTAMs, issued by the federal government, which include Temporary Flight Restrictions, or TFRs. 'The excessive number of recent TFR violations indicates many civilian aviators are not reading' the notices, Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, said in a news release. Sunday’s incident took place as Trump finished a round of golf at his West Palm Beach golf course. Jets also conducted an intercept on Saturday morning shortly after Trump arrived at the course from his private Mar-a-Lago club and residence. Trump’s schedule was not affected over the weekend, officials said.

Ex-central banker to replace Trudeau as Canada's prime minister a...	TORONTO (AP) — Former central banker Mark Carney will become Canada’s next prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war and annexation threat, and a federal election looms. Carney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote. 'There is someone who is trying to weaken our economy,' Carney said. 'Donald Trump, as we know, has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell and how we make a living. He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won't.' Carney said Canada will keep retaliatory tariffs in place until 'the Americans show us respect.' Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. Trump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party’s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls. 'We have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,' Carney said earlier. After decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada’s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States. Carney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience. The other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau. Carney is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either Carney will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-canadas-liberals-will-elect-new-leader-to-replace-trudeau-as-country-deals-with-trumps-trade-war/	2025-03-09T16:04:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67ce1f15a77e08.32938719.jpeg?w=900
Israel cuts off electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalinat...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel's 'starvation policy.' Israel last week suspended supplies of goods to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war. Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. The militant group — which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages — said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position. Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to 'advance' the negotiations. Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel's energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza. The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has 'practically' cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel's 'starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.' The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it's expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool. Israel’s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks. Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies. 'Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,' the U.N. human rights office said Friday. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used 'starvation as a method of warfare' when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations' inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn't resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. US envoy describes talks with Hamas The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas. On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a 'fair and just solution' that includes an independent Palestinian state. Boehler also told CNN that 'I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they’re not part of the political party going forward. I think that’s a reality. It’s real close.' When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, 'You never know.' He added: 'I think something could come together within weeks,' and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive. Hamas on Sunday didn't mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. Hamas’ attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants. With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 'Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,' said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis. 'I swear to God, one could not satisfy their hunger.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow developments at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-says-it-is-cutting-off-its-electricity-supply-to-gaza/	2025-03-09T12:55:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67cdf27e78f0b7.07725885.jpeg?w=900

HHS makes $25,000 buyout offer to most of its employees	WASHINGTON (AP) — Most of the 80,000 federal workers responsible for researching diseases, inspecting food and administering Medicare and Medicaid under the auspices of the Health and Human Services Department were emailed an offer to leave their job for as much as a $25,000 payment as part of President Donald Trump's government cuts. Workers cannot start opting in until Monday and have until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit a response for the so-called voluntary separation offer. The email was sent to staff across the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and the National Institutes of Health as well as the Food and Drug Administration, both in Maryland. The mass email went out to a 'broad population of HHS employees,' landing in their inboxes days before agency heads are due to offer plans for shrinking their workforces. HHS is one of the government's costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. The agency oversees health insurance for roughly half the country through Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for disabled and poor Americans. There was no immediate comment Sunday from HHS. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's health secretary, has hinted at plans at deep cuts to the staff. Last year, he promised to immediately clear out all 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's biomedical research arm. He has not gone that far, but in an interview last month shortly after being sworn in last month, Kennedy said he wanted to remove some workers from the public health agencies. 'I have a list in my head,' Kennedy said of potential firings at the agency. He said some workers 'made really bad decisions' on nutrition guidelines. The Trump administration, with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, has been trying to push out federal workers in an effort to cut costs. In January, most federal employees received a deferred resignation offer that came with eight months of pay. Thousands of probationary employees, too, have been fired across federal agencies, including at HHS. The latest move to reduce the number of federal health workers comes as the the CDC is assisting with a deadly measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico and as lawmakers are debating deep cuts to Medicaid in the federal budget. HHS workers are directed in the email to reach out to their local human resources office to submit for the voluntary separation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-top-us-health-agency-makes-25000-buyout-offer-to-most-of-its-employees/	2025-03-09T10:02:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67cdcab3beb779.05994214.jpeg?w=900
CDC announces investigation into link between autism, vaccines	(NewsNation) — Officials confirmed this weekend that the Centers for Disease Control will conduct a large-scale study to examine if there's a causal link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder. Despite hundreds of worldwide clinical trials and studies revealing no link, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to prove causation. The CDC conducted two previous investigations, confirming past scientific studies. Measles outbreak rises to 208 cases The news comes amid one of the largest measles outbreaks the United States has seen in years. The outbreak is centered in West Texas largely among unvaccinated individuals. As of March 7, 208 cases have been reported, and 10 of those are in New Mexico, according to the CDC. At least two people have died, both of whom were unvaccinated. One of them was a school-aged child. A Health and Human Services spokesperson said the CDC is delivering on the transparency Americans expect. During his joint address to Congress last week, Trump touched on the topic of autism and the increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. 'Not long ago, and you can't even believe these numbers, 1 in 10,000 children had autism (in the past),' he said in the address. 'And now it's 1 in 36 something. One in 36.' 'We're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby (RFK Jr.) and all of the people that are working with you,' Trump continued. Scientists have said the increase in autism cases is a result of increased awareness of the disorder and ongoing changes in the way that doctors diagnose it. RFK Jr.'s vaccine skepticism Vaccine skepticism was one of the cornerstones of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign, and he continues to hold those beliefs. During his Congressional confirmation hearing for the HHS position, RFK Jr. was grilled on his approach to vaccines. 'Vaccines do not cause autism. Do you agree with that?' Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., asked. 'As I said, I'm not going to go into HHS with any preordained --' RFK Jr. said before Sanders cut him off. 'Bobby, studies all over the world say it does not. What do you think?' Sanders said in an impassioned tone, later calling RFK Jr.’s responses 'troubling.' He claimed he is not 'anti-vaccines.' Rather, he said he is 'pro-safety.' RFK Jr. did recommend that parents consult with their doctors about vaccinating their children for measles, saying, 'Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,' Kennedy said in an op-ed for Fox Digital. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, who was diagnosed with polio as a child, has attributed the eradication of the disease to vaccinations. Meanwhile, Trump's nominee for CDC director, Dr. Dave Weldon, who is a physician, is scheduled for Senate committee hearings this week. Some senators have already expressed their concerns over his views on vaccines as well. 5th anniversary of COVID-19 This also comes as the fifth anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic approaches this week. More than 800,000 people died in the U.S. alone. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at John Hopkins Center for Health Security, called the COVID-19 vaccine 'one of the greatest scientific achievements in modern history.' By December 2020, nine months after the shutdown, a vaccine was created. 'The anti-vaccine movement was poised to jump even if this would have taken two years, they would have attacked it,' Adalja said. 'Every vaccine that we've developed, even if it's been something that's taken years to develop, like, for example, the HPV vaccines like Gardasil, they've attacked those.' On the measles outbreak, Adalja said to NewsNation’s 'Morning in America with Hena Doba,' that it is to be expected when vaccination rates fall. 'Measles is kind of the canary in the coal mine. It’s the first infectious disease that kind of roars back when vaccination rates fall because it's so contagious,' he said. On the CDC investigation: 'This wastes a lot of resources. This is going to cost millions and millions of dollars, and it also puts doubt in people's minds that this link has not been completely disputed.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/cdc-announces-investigation-autism-vaccine-link/	2025-03-09T09:41:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/MMRvaccineGettyImages-1141724957-e1739567630564.jpg?w=800
Bacterial infection common in women may actually be an STI: Study	(NewsNation) — A third of women experience a common bacterial infection that previously was not considered to be sexually transmitted. Now, researchers believe it may be. In a new study published Wednesday, researchers found that treating male partners may prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis results from an imbalance in the vagina's bacteria, causing symptoms of discolored discharge, a 'fishy' odor, vaginal itching and a burning feeling when peeing, though not all women who have BV will show symptoms. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the infection is the most common vaginal problem for women ages 15 to 44. Researchers sniff out obesity link between labradors, humans In the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers in Australia observed 164 monogamous heterosexual couples to study whether treating male partners would reduce the recurrence of BV in the female partner. In the control group, the women who had bacterial vaginosis received antibiotics, while the men did not receive any treatment. In a second study group, both partners received treatment. In the control group in which men did not take antibiotics, 63% of women redeveloped bacterial vaginosis within 12 weeks after taking oral medication. In comparison, just 35% of women whose partners also received treatment experienced reoccurrence. Menopausal hormone therapy linked to Alzheimer's: Study 'Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI,' said Professor Catriona Bradshaw at Monash University. The study calls for a new approach to the way the infection is classified and treated, finding that male-partner treatment may prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. 'We’ve suspected for a long time that it’s a sexually transmitted infection (STI), because it has a similar incubation period (after sex) to most STIs and is associated with the same risk factors as STIs like chlamydia, such as change in sexual partner and not using condoms,' said Dr. Lenka Vodstrcil, one of the study's authors. Practitioners still do not treat BV as an STI, but if it were to officially be classified as one, it would surpass chlamydia as the most common.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/bacterial-infection-common-women-sti/	2025-03-09T07:52:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2166856899.jpg?w=900
Brush fires on Long Island not fully contained as winds gain grou...	(NewsNation) — Dangerous brush fires erupted on Long Island just east of New York City over the weekend, causing smoke to billow for miles and resulting in a state of emergency. Now, strong winds are a concern. Around 90 emergency service departments pitched in to battle the flames, according to Suffolk County Fire Rescue and Emergency Services commissioner Rudy Sunderman. What is feared to be a multi-day event has left some parts of the town of Westhampton Beach scorched and looking almost like a haunted forest. First responders were still on the ground working to contain the fires as of Sunday morning. Seniors, families return to their homes a mess 5 months after Helene Gov. Kathy Hochul is sending 100,000 N-95 masks to the area for residents and deploying the National Guard. Three of the four brush fires from Saturday have been fully contained, while one continues to burn at about 50% containment as of Sunday. So far, no residents have been injured, and only a few structures have been damaged in the rural area. Westhampton has not been evacuated, but residents are prepared to do so if winds pick up heading into the new week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/brush-fires-long-island-new-york/	2025-03-09T06:58:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-09-085201.png?w=871
Secret Service officer-involved shooting reported	(NewsNation) — An officer-involved shooting between the U.S. Secret Service and a 'person of interest' was reported shortly after midnight Sunday morning in Washington, D.C., according to the federal agency. Following an 'armed confrontation,' agents shot an adult male near 17th Street and G Street NW, according to Anthony Guglielmi, Secret Service spokesperson, who posted the updates to X. Earlier Saturday night, local police notified the Secret Service of a person who was traveling to the area from Indiana and was believed to be suicidal, according to an official statement. DJ Daniel’s ‘soul left his body’ after Trump gave Secret Service honor When officers approached the man, he 'brandished a firearm and an armed confrontation ensued, during which shots were fired by our personnel,' the statement on X said.

Vance ramps up his clout in Trump world	Vice President Vance’s clout is on the rise, taking on the role of pot stirrer at the White House and on the world stage. His attack dog role was on full display during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when Vance confronted the foreign leader, calling him disrespectful and demanding appreciation for the billions in aid the U.S. has provided the country during its war with Russia. Vance’s more aggressive stance – including his ruffling of feathers in Europe and a visit to the southern border – follows weeks of tech billionaire Elon Musk in the spotlight, who at times has even surpassed President Trump for attention. 'Vance had his best week since being nominated,' a source familiar with the thinking of the White House said. 'Solidified himself as a go-to player with Trump and MAGA world.' As vice president, Vance took a seat behind Trump in the House chamber during the joint address to Congress, joining in with GOP lawmakers to jeer Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) and advocate for Green’s removal from the chamber for interrupting Trump’s speech in protest. He then traveled to the U.S.-southern border with Cabinet officials to highlight immigration, visit with patrol agents and held a press conference to talk tariffs and the border wall alongside Gov. Greg Abbott. But Vance really stole the spotlight last Friday, when a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went off the rails as Vance answered a question by a reporter in which he suggested Zelensky engage in diplomacy with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That prompted Zelensky to read off a list of aggressions taken by Putin against his country over the last decade after he asked Vance: 'what kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about?' 'I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,' Vance said as Zelensky attempted to interrupt. 'Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.' Some Republicans who spoke to The Hill about that meeting said Vance unnecessarily enflamed the talks. But MAGA world, who has increasingly been skeptical of funding for Ukraine and align with Trump’s 'America first' agenda also found Vance’s behavior refreshing. 'By going all in on defending Trump’s agenda and taking the fight directly to opponents, he’s solidifying his role as the administration’s top enforcer. This isn’t just about loyalty—it’s about power. Every punch he throws for Trump boosts his own standing with the base, reinforcing his credentials as a true MAGA warrior,' said Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor. He added, 'let’s be clear: this isn’t just about today. Vance is staking his claim to the movement’s future, positioning himself as the heir apparent for when Trump steps off the stage.' That Oval Office spat catapulted Vance into the spotlight in ways he had not been since Trump took office in January. It has instead been Musk who has taken over the limelight of the administration, in often controversial ways over how his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has partaken in radical reforms of the federal government, including dismantling entire agencies on a whim. 'There's this sense that you got folks, Vance and Musk are examples of this, who have free license to step into the breach right, which you don't ever see,' a source close to Trump world said. 'Trump has a certain amount of tolerance for freelancing…I think Trump likes people who perform.' But Trump’s tone has seen a slight shift this week, at least when it comes to Musk. During his second Cabinet meeting, Trump insisted that his Cabinet secretaries, not Musk, take the lead in finding cuts to their respective agencies, but added the caveat that if they didn’t do what was necessary, Musk would. Tensions are also reportedly flaring between Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has reportedly been furious with Musk for weeks since his team closed down the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), according to reporting by The New York Times. Meanwhile, Trump has left Vance in a tough spot when it comes to his political future. The president wouldn’t fully back Vance to be the next leader of the Republican Party during a Fox News interview leaving many to wonder just what Trump’s strategy was there. Some observers say that’s also led Vance to increase his posture. 'He’s got a pretty long leash in a different way than Musk to be the interpreter of the MAGA doctrine,' the source close to Trump world said. 'I think Vance certainly will be more aggressive in his posture because of that. Because he does want to be the heir apparent.' Vance caught the attention of GOP senators and the White House when he successfully lobbied for Trump’s more controversial Cabinet nominees – albeit behind closed doors. Vance was credited with talking them into reaching a point where they could vote yes on now-confirmed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Vance was also tapped by Trump to oversee a potential sale of the popular app TikTok ahead of the upcoming April 5 deadline. 'Vice President Vance has taken on projects, like TikTok and helping with Senate nominations, at the explicit direction of President Trump,' a source familiar with his work told The Hill. 'President Trump clearly trusts the Vice President to take on challenging tasks.' Some senators, meanwhile, are skeptical of Vance being Trump’s heir apparent and presidential hopefuls in the upper chamber will at some point start to create their own positioning for the future, the source close to Trump World described. 'I don't think it was lost on people that when Trump was asked if Vance was his successor, he didn’t immediately embrace them,' the source said. Meanwhile, Vance is cementing his role from multiple angles to show he can be the future of the party in 2028. He even defended Trump for declining to endorse him, arguing that its too early. 'Vance isn’t there to soften Trump, he’s there to drive the entire movement forward. To Trump, Vance is the product of what he started—young, aggressive, and fully committed to its future,' said Jordan Wood, a former Trump administration communications aide.

Trump-district Democrats face risky vote on GOP spending bill	House Democrats in districts carried by President Trump are confronting a potentially risky vote next week when GOP leaders are expected to put their partisan government funding bill on the floor. If the vulnerable Democrats support the bill, they’ll defy the position of their own leadership and undermine the party’s argument that the legislation is a threat to basic public services across the country. If they oppose it, they’re sure to face Republican attacks accusing them of endorsing a government shutdown — especially if the bill fails and a shutdown does occur. To be sure, the Republicans would be in the tougher political predicament if the government is forced to shutter, since they control all levers of power in Washington and their spending bill is a go-it-alone effort that excluded Democrats from the drafting. Democrats have long portrayed Republicans as incompetent stewards of government, and a shutdown on the GOP’s watch would provide them more ammunition to make that case. Still, those details might carry less sway with voters in the 13 Trump-won districts currently represented by Democrats, who face heavier pressure to cross the aisle in the promotion of bipartisanship. It’s those regions where GOP campaign operatives are eying every opportunity to highlight controversial votes in the effort to pick off vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the 2026 midterms. Next week’s vote on government spending might be one such vote. A number of those lawmakers are already defying the GOP threats with vows to oppose the continuing resolution (CR) when it comes up for a vote. Those voices are siding with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Democratic leaders. 'We need to pass full-year spending bills negotiated through a bipartisan process, but the party in power in the House, Senate, and White House has chosen not to do so — all while President Trump and unelected Billionaire Elon Musk are shutting down legally appropriated funds,' Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said Friday in an email. 'We cannot continue to kick the can down the road. We need to come to the table together and work together in a bipartisan fashion to get our work done for the American people,' she continued. 'I would support a bill that protects the middle class, seniors, veterans, small businesses, emergency responders, farmers, growers, and producers, and our Northwest Ohio communities. I cannot in good conscience vote for legislation that puts Northwest Ohio and our people on the chopping block to pay for tax cuts for Billionaires.' Another frontline Democrat opposing the GOP strategy is Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.). Asked this week if he would support a long-term CR, the Long Island Democrat — who represents another district carried by Trump last year — didn’t hesitate at all. 'No,' he said. Still, the offices of a vast majority of the 13 Democrats in Trump-won districts did not respond Friday to requests for comment about how they’ll vote on the CR. And one of those lawmakers, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), appeared to leave the door open to supporting it. While Cuellar blasted the CR strategy and endorsed 'a bipartisan spending agreement,' he also made clear that he’s averse to shuttering the government. 'I do not support government shutdowns,' he said in an email. 'As an appropriator, it has always been my top priority to ensure American taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and effectively. I am also focused on ensuring our vital services are protected. 'It is time to get a bipartisan agreement.' The Democratic opposition could prove crucial to the fate of the legislation, since House Republicans hold just a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber, and even a few GOP defections would sink the bill if Democrats are united in opposition. The legislation, known as a continuing resolution (CR), would extend federal funding at 2024 levels through the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends on Oct. 1. The proposal is currently being crafted by House GOP leadership, and is expected for release sometime this weekend. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said he wants to vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. But the CR strategy marks a departure from the initial plan of negotiating a bipartisan deal on higher levels of spending for 2025, as outlined by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), which was approved by both parties in 2023. After Johnson abandoned those talks, Democratic leaders came out in opposition to the CR, warning that Republicans will be on their own to pass the bill. In a letter sent Friday to Democratic lawmakers, the top party leaders — Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — said the Republicans’ bill is a 'partisan' effort 'that threatens to cut funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year.' 'That is not acceptable,' the Democrats wrote. Democrats have also sought assurances that the White House would spend the money as Congress appropriates in the wake of President Trump and Elon Musk’s efforts to slash the federal bureaucracy, which has been a nonstarter for Republicans. The Democratic leaders are hoping their opposition to the CR will force Republicans back to the negotiating table, where Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, had been in bipartisan talks for months in search of an agreement on the 2025 numbers. Upping the stakes, a number of conservative Republicans have declined to commit to supporting the CR when it hits the floor next week. 'I’m open [to a CR], but like I said, I want to see what’s in it,' Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) told reporters this week. 'You can call it anything you want, I just want to see what’s in it.' Republicans, fighting to downplay their own internal divisions, are already trying to exploit the Democratic opposition. Just minutes after the Democratic leaders released their letter on Friday, the GOP’s campaign arm issued a statement attempting to shift the blame for any shutdown on the Democrats. 'House Democrats admitted they wanted a government shutdown, and now they're following through,' Mike Marinella, spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), said Friday in a statement. 'They're deliberately making our country less safe and less prosperous just to score political points.' How far that message resonates with the Democrats in Trump-won districts remains to be seen.

Buckets of chicken nixed as last meal for inmate Brad Sigmon: Att...	(NewsNation) — The South Carolina inmate who died by the rare execution method of firing squad this week requested a last meal of KFC to share with his death row neighbors, but prison officials nixed the idea, his attorney says. Instead, convicted murderer Brad Sigmon was served his own meal of Southern comfort food, according to the South Carolina Department of Corrections. It consisted of four pieces of fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy, biscuits, cheesecake and sweet tea, officials said. If Sigmon had his way, he would have shared three buckets of the original recipe KFC with his fellow death row inmates, attorney Gerald 'Bo' Hunt said in a prepared statement. Is a firing squad execution more humane than lethal injection? 'That request was denied,' he said. His final meal was served Wednesday evening, two days before Sigmon's execution. In the interim, he ate cafeteria fare, a corrections department spokesperson said. She said she could not confirm the information about the request for buckets of chicken. On Friday evening, Sigmon was restrained in a chair with a hood over his head and a target on his heart. A trio of volunteer marksmen fired simultaneously at 6 p.m. Columbia, S.C., time, and the inmate was pronounced dead three minutes later, witnesses and officials said. The 67-year-old inmate was convicted of fatally beating David and Gladys Larke, the parents of his ex-girlfriend, in 2001. Sigmon kidnapped his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint with the intent of committing a murder-suicide, but she managed to escape. According to a last statement read at his execution, Sigmon called for an end to capital punishment, saying it’s not supported by the New Testament.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/buckets-of-chicken-last-meal-firing-squad/	2025-03-08T16:33:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/chick.jpg?w=900
Trump shifts tone on Musk as tensions rise with Cabinet	President Trump is signaling a softer approach to the mass firings of federal government workers led by Elon Musk as cracks emerge between the tech billionaire and Cabinet secretaries running the agencies he’s gutting. Musk’s swift and wide-ranging cost-cutting efforts have been met with pushback from some in Washington, who have complained behind-the-scenes about the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) upending of norms. Trump’s shift in tone emerged this week when he stressed that his Cabinet secretaries take the lead on staffing choices, insisting that cuts be made with a 'scalpel' instead of a 'hatchet.' That came after a contentious meeting Thursday attended by Trump, Cabinet secretaries and Musk at the White House, which was followed by an explosive report in the New York Times about clashes between Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump blew off a question about friction between Musk and Rubio when a reporter asked him to weigh in from the Oval Office after the Times report published. But his response earlier this week stressing that his Cabinet secretaries take the lead in making what he deems appropriate cuts to federal agencies signals some potential pushback from his secretaries as to how Musk has been handling things. Still, the president left the door open for Musk to take the reins back, telling his Cabinet that if they didn’t make the right cuts, then the Tesla CEO would. 'At some level, Musk has been a little bit callous in the presentation. And then when you talk about veterans across the country, disabled vets, people like that, losing their jobs, at some point that stuff starts to take hold,' a source close to Trump world said. 'You got to execute with a little more precision and more with a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer. Now Trump may not care, right? Because they think they can win the larger victory just by doing it. It comes down to the personality base… and the personal stories,' the source said. A former Trump official suggested the president’s shift in tone was an acknowledgment of the political and legal scrutiny toward DOGE that has ramped up in recent weeks. The official noted that Thursday’s Cabinet meeting took place behind closed doors, where it could be more candid than the on-camera gathering last week that was dominated by Musk. In a clear sign of tension, Musk called out Rubio in the second meeting for not firing enough people from his department The New York Times reported. Rubio has reportedly been furious with Musk for weeks since his team closed down the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and during the spat, Musk suggested Rubio was only good for television before Trump stepped in to commend his secretary of state’s work and suggest everyone work together. When Trump was asked about the reported clash, he said, 'no clash, I was there.' 'Elon gets along great with Marco and they’re both doing a fantastic job,' he said, later adding, 'Marco has done unbelievably as Secretary of State. And Elon is a unique guy and has done a fantastic job.' Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins also reportedly said in that meeting that cuts have to be more strategic, with Trump agreeing with him. Collins, in an op-ed in The Hill, stressed the importance of supporting veterans and said his agency 'is conducting a department-wide review of its organization, operations and structure' in response to the DOGE workforce initiative from Trump. Musk wore a suit during the meeting, a subtle but noticeable change from the 'Tech Support' T-shirt and black MAGA hat he wore during a previous Cabinet meeting. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a 'great and productive meeting,' but did not directly address the reported disagreements. 'Everyone is working as one team to help President Trump deliver on his promise to make our government more efficient,' Leavitt said in a statement. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Friday expressed his support for Musk directly, as well as Trump’s 'approach' to working with him. 'The President's approach of a scalpel versus a hatchet and better coordination between Secretaries and DOGE is the right approach to revolutionizing the way our government is run. @USDOT will continue to work closely with @elonmusk,' Duffy said on X. Aside from the heat emanating from the Cabinet, the administration’s work to cut waste from the government has faced its biggest roadblocks through the courts. A coalition of unions representing federal employees sued last month over efforts to conduct mass layoffs across the government. A federal judge this week ordered the administration to release payments to contractors and nonprofits connected to USAID, which has been hardest hit by Musk’s efforts to slash spending. On Capitol Hill, Republican senators told Musk this week that his aggressive moves to shrink the federal government will need a vote by Congress, with lawmakers seemingly irked at being bypassed. Republican senators have taken particular issue with thousands of firings planned at the Department of Veterans Affairs and layoffs of federal employees that have affected veterans in particular. 'There’s a real separation between, USAID is funding a transgender puppet show in Kuwait versus we’re giving life saving medicine in Sub Saharan Africa or we’re helping children who are getting literally pouches of peanut butter not starve to death. I think even the most cynical Americans think that, okay, we have some role in that,' the source close to Trump world said. Trump’s comments also bring his public rhetoric more in line with the White House’s assertion in court filings that Musk is not the administrator of DOGE and does not have the authority to make policy decisions on his own. And, they build on an executive order Trump signed last week, directing agency leaders to work with DOGE staff and look at contracts, employee travel and other areas, as well as build a centralized system to record every payment. Despite the shifts in guidance around handling Musk, Democrats, unions and activists are expected to keep up their pushback on the billionaire’s work for Trump, including the host of Democratic attorneys generals who are plaintiffs in several lawsuits against the administration. Senate Democrats this week asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether Musk is leveraging his government position to pressure advertisers into spending more on his social media platform, X. Critics say though that putting Cabinet secretaries in charge over Musk doesn’t mean the legal issues will stop. 'Unfortunately, closing the barn door after the horse has bolted does no good,' said Norm Eisen, executive chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund, which has represented plaintiffs in a complaint that Musk’s actions are in violation of the Constitution because he is not Senate-confirmed. 'In fact, this attempted backtrack is an admission that the vast chaos that Musk and DOGE have wrought without proper approval and documentation is illegal— and so must be completely unwound.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-shifts-tone-on-musk-as-tensions-rise-with-cabinet/	2025-03-08T15:28:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/trumpdonald_muskelon_030425gn01_w.jpg?w=900
House GOP seeks spending cuts, defense increases in plan to avert...	House Republicans on Saturday unveiled a six-month stopgap government funding plan, that seeks cuts to nondefense programs while boosting funding for defense. The bill's rollout kicks off a crucial stretch for GOP leadership to lock down support ahead of Friday's shutdown deadline with a Trump-backed strategy that has drawn the ire of Democrats. The plan seeks to keep the government funded through September. While it is considered a continuing resolution (CR), Republicans say its funding levels in the 99-page bill are below those previously set as part of a bipartisan funding deal last year, as leadership has faced growing pressure from its right flank to drive a harder line on curbing government spending. Will Medicaid face cuts? How Americans could be affected Republicans say the plan would allow for moderate increases to defense funding to the tune of about $6 billion above fiscal year 2024 levels, though below levels previously agreed to for fiscal year 2025 under a bipartisan spending-limits deal struck in 2023. The bill also seeks to allow the Defense Department flexibility to start new programs and move funds around, as defense hawks have raised concerns about the military being hamstrung by a six-month funding patch without major changes. The bill will also fund already-authorized pay increases for junior enlisted military personnel. Republicans say the stopgap measure would increase funding for veterans healthcare and housing, and funds the WIC program. But overall funding for non-defense programs would decrease by about $13 billion below fiscal year 2024 levels. Republicans say the bill would also reflects a request to rescind IRS funding. House GOP leadership staff said ahead of the release that the bill was crafted in close coordination with the White House. GOP hardliners, who have long opposed CRs, have signaled they are open to supporting the Trump-backed strategy. Leland Vittert’s War Notes: Singing Into Irrelevancy 'The House and Senate have put together, under the circumstances, a very good funding Bill (‘CR’)! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week.' Trump posted on Truth Social after the bill’s release. 'We have to remain UNITED — NO DISSENT — Fight for another day when the timing is right. VERY IMPORTANT. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' he said. Democrats have come out in sharp opposition to the strategy, however. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, voiced strong criticism of the funding plan on Saturday, dubbing the measure as a 'power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people.' 'Reading the CR bill text now,' she wrote on the social platform X. 'Republicans are zeroing out the Toxic Exposures Fund (to care for veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances) on October 1. They cut $23 billion from their own bill they passed last year. You can’t make this stuff up.' Trump tariffs already costing border money, jobs Government programs have been running on stopgaps since last October, the start of fiscal year 2025. But Democratic negotiators raised a list of concerns over the potential consequences that a CR through the end of the fiscal year could pose to defense programs and military effectiveness, health care costs, pay reforms for wildland firefighters, veterans services and food assistance programs. At the same time, their Republican counterparts have sought to pin blame on Democrats over the stopgap, citing their push for assurances that the administration will spend the money as directed – which GOP leaders have panned as a nonstarter. In the last Congress, Democratic support was key for GOP leadership to pass funding measures in the House, due to the Republicans' slim majority. And given that the House GOP’s control has only narrowed in the current Congress, Republican leadership is taking a risk in pressing on with a strategy panned by Democrats as a go-it-alone approach that undercuts a bipartisan spending-limits deal struck in 2023. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said this week that Republicans are on their own to find the votes to pass the funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters earlier this week that he thinks Republicans will be able to 'pass it along party lines,' but he added that he believes 'every Democrat' should vote for the legislation. Al Green censure highlights increased appetite for retribution in House But GOP leadership will need near unanimity in their conference to pass the bill if all Democrats vote 'no.' And a small number of hardline conservatives signaled on Thursday that they still weren’t sold on the strategy, which some Republicans have griped would lock in Biden’s funding priorities. 'I'm ruminating on it,' Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Thursday when asked how he would vote if a stopgap running through September was brought to the floor. 'I talked to the president about it,' Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) also said Thursday, after noting he hasn’t yet said he 'was on board' with the plan. 'I just got some questions. Is it truly going to be clean? Is appropriations going to add a bunch of amendments for the Pentagon?' Some hardline conservatives had warned ahead of the release that their support for the stopgap plan could be in jeopardy depending on the price tag, while pressing for offsets for any potential add-ons, including in areas like defense. At the same time, defense hawks have sounded the alarm over how defense programs would fare under the plan in recent weeks. 'The costs of deterring war pale in comparison to the costs of fighting one. If Congress is unwilling to make deterrent investments today, then discussions about urgency of looming threats — particularly the ‘pacing threat’ of China — carries little weight,' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) wrote in an op-ed published by The Washington Post days back. House Republicans are expected to take swift action on the legislation, eyeing a floor vote on the measure as soon as Tuesday.

Walmart pays back towed customer, fires towing company	PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) — Those who observed it told us. People got out of their cars at the Frederick Boulevard Walmart, went inside to shop, and by the time they came out, their cars were gone. A car would then show up, and car owners were put in that car and taken to Always Swift Towing to get their own cars — usually leaving behind $375 in cash. Back in December, Alison Copeland, a disabled driver who had a disabled placard to hang on the rearview mirror of her car, said her car was wrongly towed by Always Swift Towing, which had a contract to tow cars from the Walmart. 'As a shopper of Walmart, I no longer want to go to Walmart because I don’t know if my car is going to be gone,' Copeland said. At the time, Copeland showed NewsNation affiliate 10 On Your Side a photo of her car, the company telling her that it was keeping another car from parking in the next spot. Missing teen ‘lured’ to man’s home was killed, dismembered: St. Pete police 'This is my vehicle, and this is the right side back tire and it's crossed the line,' Copeland said, 'and they indicated that it was preventing another car from parking in the next spot.' 10 On Your Side asked her if that was true? 'No, I think they were wrong,' she said. 10 On Your Side also confronted Always Swift Towing, and though supervisors did not want to be seen, they came to WAVY to show us their pictures, which showed the tires were over the line into the next parking space. 'Why did we tow her? Because she was double-parked,' someone from the company said. 'It’s over the line.' But we pointed out to the supervisor that she was parked just over the line, and her point was that someone on the other side was over the line, which made her have to park over the line on the other side. The supervisor said what Copeland said was not true. But we asked the supervisor — she’s disabled, why not throw her a break instead of towing the car? Said an Always Swift Towing supervisor: 'We are doing what Walmart wanted us to do.' Now, Walmart doesn’t want them to come on property. Following WAVY's reporting, Copeland sent an email up the line. 'So, I decided to just send an e-mail to Walmart's CEO, their head of marketing, whomever that I could find from the CEO all the way down.' Brad Sigmon’s final conversation with his spiritual adviser 'I couldn't sleep because of this,' Copeland said. 'I wanted my money back, but I couldn't sleep, and it gave me nightmares because it just wasn't fair. And not just me. There were others that may not have had the money to get their car.' 10 On Your Side went back to Walmart to see store manager Jamie Cobb, who referred us to corporate. But in this email to Copeland, Cobb wrote: 'I recently received your request for reimbursement. ... Please come at your convenience to receive your money.' Said Copeland: 'So, I came back, back Saturday and they did give my money back in cash, $375.' Cobb also wrote how she worked to terminate the Always Swift Towing contract. 'I worked very hard to get this contract cancelled,' Cobb wrote. 'As of 12/24/24 they are no longer allowed on property.' Proof of that? Gone are the 'towing enforced signs' and 'vehicles will be impounded to Always Swift Towing.' Copeland teed off on the towing. 'I'm thinking about a civil lawsuit because I get upset about it,' Copeland said. 'I'm upset and it is much deeper than the $375, because it appears to be a target towards the handicapped.' Copeland added this on speaking out: 'Just don't give up. If you feel you've been done wrong [and] something's not right, speak up, stand up [and] don't give up, because that's why we're here. Don't give up.' She also said this about 10 On Your Side. 'I mean what you did was huge,' she said, '... and I'm really grateful. With all the people who email you, you chose me. I just felt like somebody has to stand up for what's right. And I know that, you and 10 On Your Side is all about telling what’s right.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/walmart-pays-back-towed-customer-fires-towing-company/	2025-03-08T12:36:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-2025-03-07T191902.079.jpg?w=900
House Republicans unveil bill to avoid shutdown and they're darin...	WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans unveiled a spending bill Saturday that would keep federal agencies funded through Sept. 30, pushing ahead with a go-it-alone strategy that seems certain to spark a major confrontation with Democrats over the contours of government spending. The 99-page bill would provide a slight boost to defense programs while trimming nondefense programs below 2024 budget year levels. That approach is likely to be a nonstarter for most Democrats who have long insisted that defense and nondefense spending move in the same direction. Congress must act by midnight Friday to avoid a partial government shutdown. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is teeing up the bill for a vote on Tuesday despite the lack of buy-in from Democrats, essentially daring them to vote against it and risk a shutdown. He also is betting that Republicans can muscle the legislation through the House largely by themselves. Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That's because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own. Crucially, the strategy has the backing of President Donald Trump, who has shown an ability so far in his term to hold Republicans in line. Trump praised the bill, writing on X that Republicans have to 'remain UNITED — NO DISSENT — Fight for another day when the timing is right.' 'Great things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country's ‘financial house’ in order,' he said. House Republicans' leadership staff outlined the contours of the measure, saying it would allow for about $892.5 billion in defense spending and about $708 billion in nondefense spending. The defense spending is slightly above the prior year's level, but the nondefense spending, the aides said, was about $13 billion below last year. The measure also will not include funding requested by individual lawmakers for thousands of community projects around the country, often referred to as earmarks. The bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs are on auto pilot and are not regularly reviewed by Congress. The top Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Washington Sen. Patty Murray, both issued statements blasting the legislation. 'I strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution,' DeLauro said. Murray said the legislation would 'give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending — and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike.' Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the focus must be on preventing a shutdown because closures have negative consequences all across government. 'They require certain essential government employees, such as Border Patrol agents, members of our military and Coast Guard, TSA screeners, and air traffic controllers, to report to work with no certainty on when they will receive their next paycheck,' Collin said. 'We cannot allow that to occur.' Trump's request for unity appears to be having an effect. Some conservatives who almost never vote for continuing resolutions expressed much openness to one last week. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., says he has never voted for a continuing resolution, what lawmakers often call a CR, but he is on board with Johnson's effort. He says he has confidence in Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, to make a difference on the nation's debt. 'I don't like CRs,' Norman said. 'But what's the alternative? Negotiate with Democrats? No.' 'I freeze spending for six month to go identify more cuts? Somebody tell me how that's not a win in Washington,' added Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, another lawmaker who has often frequently voted against spending bills but supports the six-month continuing resolution. Republicans are also hoping that resolving this year's spending will allow them to devote their full attention to extending the individual tax cuts passed during Trump's first term and raising the nation's debt limit to avoid a catastrophic federal default. Democratic leaders are warning that the decision to move ahead without consulting them increases the prospects for a shutdown. One of their biggest concerns is the flexibility the legislation would give the Trump administration on spending. The Democratic leadership in both chambers has stressed that Republicans have the majority and are responsible for funding the government. But leaders also have been wary of saying how Democrats would vote on a continuing resolution. 'We have to wait to see what their plan is,' said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. 'We've always believed the only solution is a bipartisan solution, no matter what.' House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said earlier this week that the Democratic caucus would meet and discuss the legislation at the 'appropriate moment.' But he struck a more forceful tone Friday. Jeffries said Democrats are ready to negotiate a 'meaningful, bipartisan spending agreement that puts working people first.' But he said the 'partisan continuing resolution' threatens to cut funding for key programs, such as veterans benefits and nutritional assistance for low-income families. 'That is not acceptable,' Jeffries said. Trump has been meeting with House Republicans in an effort to win their votes on the legislation. Republicans have a 218-214 majority in the House, so if all lawmakers vote, they can afford only one defection if Democrats unite in opposition. The math gets even harder in the Senate, where at least seven Democrats would have to vote for the legislation to overcome a filibuster. And that's assuming all 53 Republicans vote for it.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-republicans-try-to-go-it-alone-on-government-funding-as-shutdown-deadline-nears/	2025-03-08T11:07:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67cc9681c02198.81790467.jpeg?w=900
Trump's Scotland golf resort vandalized by pro-Palestinian activi...	(NewsNation) — A group of pro-Palestinian activists vandalized President Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland on Saturday morning. Palestine Action claimed responsibility for the crimes, which included defacing a building, digging up greens and painting 'GAZA IS NOT 4 SALE' on a fairway. Other graffiti that read 'Free Gaza' was spotted on part of a building at Trump Turnberry. On X, the activist group issued a threat to the president. Inside hidden cartel smuggling tunnels in the Rio Grande Valley 'Whilst Trump attempts to treat Gaza as his property, he should know his own property is within reach,' the post said. According to multiple reports, Police Scotland is investigating the incident. It follows Trump's proposal to turn the war-torn Gaza Strip into a 'riviera of the Middle East.' 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,' Trump said last month, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. Two weeks ago, Trump shared an AI-generated video to Truth Social, purporting to show what the Gaza Strip looks like now and under his purview.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/trump-scotland-golf-resort-vandalized-pro-palestinian-activists/	2025-03-08T08:01:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-1252558896.jpg?w=900
How to pay off debt using the avalanche method	(NewsNation) — Don't let debt drown you. There are various methods for reducing credit card debt, and the first step is to find the one that works best for you. One route to consider is the avalanche method. What is the avalanche method? With this strategy, you prioritize paying off debt with the highest interest rate. Start by listing your debts from highest interest rate to lowest and then put as much money as possible toward the debt with the highest rate. Once that’s taken care of, move on to the debt with the next highest rate, and so on. How to quickly pay off debt in 2025 If one has an especially high interest rate, you may want to consider paying this one off first. 'If you have three different credit cards, one has a 30% APR (annual percentage rate), one is 20 and one is 15, you’d want to focus on paying off the 30% APR balance first because it’s the most expensive,' John Kiernan, managing editor of WalletHub, a financial services company, told NewsNation in December. You should continue making at least the minimum monthly payments on your other credit cards. Other strategies for paying off debt Another popular strategy for paying off debt is the snowball method. This approach is all about paying off the smallest balance first and building momentum. This involves prioritizing debts in order of smallest balance to largest balance. Credit card debt: Answers to frequently asked questions 'The benefit of this method is that you’ll pay off your smallest balances more quickly, which can be motivating and act as a springboard toward paying off more of your debts,' according to Experian, one of the three major credit-reporting agencies.

Brad Sigmon's final conversation with his spiritual adviser	(NewsNation) — Brad Sigmon, a South Carolina inmate executed by the firing squad, was allowed to meet with his spiritual adviser one last time Friday morning. Rev. Hilary Taylor, executive director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, spoke with Sigmon for two hours before his execution. 'When I was with Brad this morning from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., Brad and I and another spiritual adviser talked about supporting family and friends,' Taylor said on NewsNation’s 'Banfield.' 'Whereas for the people that he loved, the people that he had formed community with before his incarceration and also during his incarceration.' Sigmon chose to die by firing squad – the first inmate in the U.S. in 15 years to be executed by this method – because he was afraid of lethal injection. Lethal injections can sometimes go wrong. In the 1985 execution of Texas inmate Stephen Peter Morin, it took execution technicians nearly 45 minutes to find a suitable vein, for example. South Carolina executes inmate by firing squad 'Lethal injec­tion had the high­est rate of botched exe­cu­tions,' according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a national nonprofit that analyzes data on capital punishment. Execution methods in the U.S. include hanging, electrocution, lethal gas, lethal injection and firing squad. 'The thing that Brad was forced to do was to make an impossible decision between being injected with poison by people who are not medical doctors, being cooked alive by electric chair or having his chest blown out of, or having his heart blown out of his chest by the firing squad,' Taylor said. Sigmon, 67, was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents in 2001. At the time of the murder, Sigmon was attempting to kidnap his ex-girlfriend and confessed that he was likely going to kill her and then himself. He forced her into his car when she arrived at her parents’ home, but she jumped out of it as Sigmon drove away and escaped. Gov. Henry McMaster declined to grant clemency. He was pronounced dead at 6:08 p.m. Friday. 'I want my closing statement to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to end the death penalty,' Sigmon said in his final statement read to witnesses, according to the South Carolina Department of Corrections. Gerald 'Bo' King, chief of the Capital Habeas Unit for the Fourth Circuit, issued the following statement on behalf of Sigmon's legal team: 'Knowing that he was going to die, Brad Sigmon used his final statement to call on his fellow people of faith to end the death penalty and spare the lives of the 28 men still locked up on South Carolina’s death row.' Violent and sudden. What a firing squad execution looked like through my eyes Six inmate executions are planned over the next three weeks in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Florida using a variety of methods. Sigmon was the first South Carolina inmate to die by firing squad. 'He expressed remorse every day of his incarceration at the violence that he caused and sought to be a different person since his incarceration,' Taylor said. 'Tried to be as supportive and loving as kind as possible to everyone in his midst, whether that was his neighbors on death row, whether that was corrections officers, whether that was pen pals and family members that he was supporting from afar, emotionally and spiritually.'

Francis rests in hospital as Holy Year marches on without him, th...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis continued his recovery from double pneumonia on Saturday as the Vatican’s Holy Year proceeded without him on a weekend dedicated to the Catholic Church’s volunteers. 'The night passed quietly, the pope is resting,' said the Vatican’s early morning update. The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, enters his fourth week at Rome’s Gemelli hospital with his condition stabilized following a few bouts of acute respiratory crises. In his absence, the Vatican was going ahead with its Jubilee celebrations, the once-every-quarter-century Holy Year that is drawing pilgrims from around the world to Rome. This weekend, the Holy Year is celebrating volunteers, and many are extending their pilgrimage to pray for Francis outside the Gemelli hospital. On Sunday, one of the cardinals most closely associated with Francis' papacy, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, presides over the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated. On Friday, Francis spent 20 minutes in the Gemelli hospital chapel, praying and doing some work in between rest and respiratory and physical therapy, the Vatican said. A medical update was expected later Saturday. Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night. Doctors not involved in his care said after three weeks of acute care in the hospital for double pneumonia, they would have hoped to have seen improvement. While he has stabilized, they warned that he was increasingly at risk of secondary infections the longer he remains hospitalized. Additionally, Francis had episodes of acute respiratory failure earlier this week and underwent bronchoscopies to suction mucus from his lungs. 'He’s had respiratory failure and they were not able to liberate him from the hospital in the first three weeks. And therefore I think you’d say this does look concerning, perhaps more concerning than it did right at the beginning,' said Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospitals in England. Dr. Jeffrey Millstein, a clinical assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said it wasn’t shocking that Francis hadn’t improved in three weeks, and that it was encouraging he was able to breathe part of the day with just a nasal tube of high-flow oxygen. But he said that the pope's condition certainly was 'a precarious, touch and go kind of situation' and that recovery, while still possible, would be a long process. Going forward, 'I just would be looking for no new setbacks,' he said. 'I think as long as he is dealing with the current issues and he’s just making incremental progress, that would be great.' Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

South Carolina executes inmate by firing squad	(NewsNation) — South Carolina on Friday executed convicted murderer Brad Sigmon by firing squad after the death row inmate called for the end of capital punishment through a written statement that was read to witnesses. It was the first time in 15 years that a firing squad had been used in the United States, and the first time for South Carolina. Sigmon, 67, was convicted of fatally beating his ex-girlfriend's parents in 2001. The execution was carried out Friday evening about 6:05 p.m. local time after Gov. Henry McMaster declined to grant clemency to Sigmon. Witnesses at the execution in Columbia say three voluntary marksmen fired in unison at Sigmon, who was wearing a hood and strapped to a chair with a red target over his heart. He reportedly was wearing a black jumpsuit and black Crocs. This undated image provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows Brad Sigmon. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File) The inmate was pronounced dead at 6:08 p.m., said Chrysti Shain, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Corrections. She said the inmate's last statement, read to witnesses, called for the end of capital punishment. Social Security Administration offices DOGE, Elon Musk is closing 'I want my closing statement to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to end the death penalty,' Sigmon said, according to the statement. Sigmon had selected firing squad over the electric chair or lethal injection. His attorney, Gerald 'Bo' King, told NewsNation earlier that Sigmon was afraid of the electric chair and avoided lethal injection because the last three procedures in South Carolina were botched. 'So, Mr. Sigmund was in the position of having to choose between the firing squad, which has never been used in South Carolina, hasn't been used in the United States in 15 years, or the prospect of dying for over 20 minutes while strapped to a gurney, while (his) lungs fill up with fluid and blood,' King said. 'And having seen this happen with three men that he knew very well — men considered brothers — that was not a choice that he could bring himself to make.' The last time Sigmon talked to King was Thursday afternoon. He's made peace with what will happen to him, NewsNation was told. Some family members of the victims, David Larke and Gladys Gwendolyn Larke, were in attendance to watch the execution. They included the victims' grandson, Ricky Sims. 'He's going to pay for what he’s done,' Sims said to the Greenville News. 'He took away two people who would have done anything for their family. They were the rock of our family ... They didn't deserve it.' At the time of the murder, Sigmon was attempting to kidnap his ex-girlfriend and confessed that he was likely going to kill her and then himself. He forced her into his car when she arrived at her parents’ home, but she jumped out of it as Sigmon drove and escaped. How long should you keep tax return records? Friday's execution marks the sixth one that's planned over the next three weeks in America. The other states that will be carrying out these executions include Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Florida using a variety of methods including lethal injection and, in the case of Louisiana, death by suffocation from a gas chamber.

Sheriff to give update on investigation into Hackman's death	(NewsNation) — Investigators will be providing an update into the death of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, more than a week after both were found dead in their home near Santa Fe, New Mexico. There are still more questions than answers in the case, including how the couple died, how long their bodies were there and if they died at the same time. What happened to Gene Hackman? Hackman and Arakawa were found on Feb. 26, 2025, and the story has drawn widespread attention. Officials initially said there were no signs of foul play but deemed the deaths sufficiently suspicious to warrant investigation. Diddy accused of ‘forced labor’ in latest indictment Hackman, 95, and Arakawa were discovered by two maintenance workers who saw the remains through the window and called the police. Hackman was found near the kitchen and Arakawa was found in a bathroom with pills scattered nearby. One of the three dogs they owned was also found dead inside a crate. The other two dogs were found alive. The remains were decomposing and partially mummified, and that, along with evidence from Hackman's pacemaker, suggested they could have been dead for as long as several weeks. Authorities have estimated that Hackman was likely dead for nine days before the body was found, with the last event on his pacemaker recorded on Feb. 17. The couple tested negative for carbon monoxide, and a gas company found no evidence of gas leaks, ruling out carbon monoxide poisoning as a cause of death. There also did not appear to be any external injuries on the bodies, but authorities found decomposition and Arakawa's hands and feet appeared mummified, something that usually starts more than two weeks after a person dies.

Officials also initially suspected a fall as Hackman was found with his walking cane and sunglasses next to his body but later said there were no indications of injuries that would have resulted from a fall. Items taken from the home as evidence included cell phones and medication, including a thyroid medication, a medication used for high blood pressure or chest pain and Tylenol. Questions about investigation The office leading the investigation has been under intense scrutiny, especially after some discrepancies in initial statements, including an initial misidentification of the breed of the dog that had died. Another discrepancy came when the person who called 911 to report the bodies said the home was locked, and he couldn't get inside. A deputy later the caller found the front door open and investigators later said the two surviving dogs had been able to get in and out of the house through an open door.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/sheriff-update-gene-hackman/	2025-03-07T12:15:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67c03deecb2542.00148934.jpeg?w=900

The remarks, part of the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum at the University of Chicago, come after the Labor Department released the first jobs report of Trump's second term. The report shows that the U.S. added 151,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent.

Inside hidden cartel smuggling tunnels in the Rio Grande Valley	(NewsNation) — Border Patrol agents in Texas' Rio Grande Valley sector are ramping up efforts to dismantle smuggling operations. Human smugglers are becoming more sophisticated, agents said, using tunnels as part of a broader network of illegal entry points along the border. NewsNation spent time with the Border Patrol Marine Unit, whose agents serve as the first line of defense against illegal immigration and drug trafficking into the United States. The area is a common route for smugglers, who use rafts to get migrants across the river and onto U.S. soil. But they're not only using rafts — agents say smugglers have also taken their operations underground. During a recent operation along the banks of the Rio Grande, the team approached a makeshift tunnel, where smugglers had installed a pipe before agents were able to seal it off with cement. Border Patrol welcomes military assistance Agents told NewsNation the tunnel was only halfway completed and never fully operational but that it was just one of many, as smugglers along the border continually adapt their methods. A drainage system that was once used by smugglers, according to Border Patrol, was blocked off by a cage placed by agents, but officials said cartel operatives are still attempting to repurpose it. There was evidence that fresh cuts had been made — clear signs of smugglers testing weak points, agents said. Alongside this system, smugglers are also reportedly digging makeshift tunnels and constantly looking for new ways to bypass security. 'Once they start digging holes like that, you gotta be extra careful and not just look at the actual drain, but look around. And that's how we found that other one,' Cesar Hernandez of the Border Patrol Marine Unit told NewsNation. Agents later uncovered another tunnel after finding wooden planks reinforcing the walls and a wooden door, both covered with fresh brush. Border Patrol agents said they remain vigilant while searching for tunnels along the Rio Grande because smugglers work fast. One day, the area can look untouched, they said; the next, a tunnel can be found hidden under fresh brush or debris. Do ICE arrest numbers align with Trump’s mass deportation plans? The Marine Unit is one of the most dangerous jobs in Border Patrol, agents said. They told NewsNation that while the job may seem quiet on the surface, the reality is far from it. Their work never stops, they said, and they remain on high alert — because smugglers and cartel scouts are always watching. Smugglers aren't just going underground. They're still using the river too, officials said. Even with tunnels emerging, the Rio Grande remains a critical crossing point. On the Mexican side of the river, migrant camps that were once full now appear abandoned, reflecting a shift in enforcement. Border Patrol is apprehending fewer migrants, and cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico is ostensibly having an impact.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/hidden-cartel-smuggling-tunnels-border/	2025-03-07T08:12:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Cartel-tunnel.jpg?w=900

Linda McMahon: Federal student aid could shift to another departm...	(NewsNation) — Newly confirmed Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon believes student loans, Pell Grants and other federal aid 'might best be served in another department,' though it's unclear which that would be. 'We're looking at them all across the board, and how can they be best handled if the Department of Education, you know, does not exist,' McMahon told 'NewsNation Live' on Friday. Linda McMahon gives Education staffers their ‘final mission’ McMahon reiterated that her 'mission' of dissolving the department she's tasked with leading has not changed — but even if the department shutters, she said federal funding isn't expected to end. 'This is not a turn off the lights and walk out of the department,' McMahon said. 'It's with close consultation with Congress and looking how the needs of students can best be serviced.' Linda McMahon: Executive order doesn't change Education Department 'mission' Trump on Thursday was expected to sign an executive order asking McMahon to dissolve the agency she’s tasked with leading, though the White House later reversed course. An official told NewsNation the administration will continue to review the department in the meantime. 'The President campaigned on this. He's been crystal clear that he wants to see the Department of Education closed, and he'd like to see it done sooner rather than later,' McMahon said. 'But he understands that we need to work with Congress. There are certain things that are in statute.' List of Social Security Administration offices DOGE is closing McMahon said she feels her job is to secure the administration the 60 necessary Senate votes — and Congressional approval — to dissolve the department. 'I think my job is to convince Congress that the steps that we are taking are in the best interest of the kids,' McMahon said. The department has been on the chopping block since Trump's presidential campaign, when he advocated for giving education power to the states.

McMahon told NewsNation on Friday that 'over 300 people' accepted the payout during the four-day window. The buyouts are part of what McMahon called an 'audit' from the Department of Government Efficiency. The Elon Musk-led task force has been examining federal agencies for waste and enacting sweeping layoffs. 'They've they've certainly shown us that some of the programs that we were looking at could, we could do without and save money,' McMahon said. She also confirmed that the agency leads hold the ultimate power to determine whether to move forward on DOGE's recommendations, not Musk.

US employers added 151,000 jobs last month; unemployment up to 4....	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added solid 151,000 jobs last month, but the outlook is cloudy as President Donald threatens a trade war, purges the federal workforce and promises to deport millions of immigrants. The Labor Department reported Friday that hiring was up from a revised 125,000 in January. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.1%. The job market has been remarkably resilient over the past year despite high interest rates. List of Social Security Administration offices DOGE is closing 'Despite rising concerns about the health of the economy, momentum remains positive,’’ Lydia Boussour, senior economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, wrote in a commentary. Billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of federal workers was not expected to have much impact on the February jobs numbers. The Labor Department conducted its survey of employers too early in the month for the Department of Government Efficiency layoffs to show up. The American job market has remained remarkably resilient, but it has cooled from the red-hot hiring of 2021-2023. Employers added a decent average of 166,000 jobs a month last year, down from 216,000 in 2023, 380,000 in 2022 and a record 603,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from COVID-19 lockdowns. Hiring continued despite high interest rates that had been expected to tip the United States into recession. The economy’s unexpectedly strong recovery from the pandemic recession of 2020 set loose an inflationary surge that peaked in June 2022 when prices came in 9.1% higher than they’d been a year earlier. In response, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades. The economy remained sturdy despite the higher borrowing costs, thanks to strong consumer spending, big productivity gains at businesses and an influx of immigrants who eased labor shortages. Inflation came down – dropping to 2.4% in September -- allowing the Fed to reverse course and cut rates three times in 2024. The rate-cutting was expected to continue this year, but progress on inflation has stalled since summer, and the Fed has held off. Future of Gaza aid operations in limbo amid Trump funding freezes Economists expect that workers' average hourly earnings rose 0.3% last month, down from a 0.5% increase in January, a drop likely to be welcomed by the Fed — but not enough to get the central bank to cut rates at its next meeting March 18-19. In fact, Wall Street traders aren’t expecting another cut until May, and they're not especially confident about that one, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Economists say the economic outlook is growing more uncertain as Trump imposes — or threatens to impose — a series of taxes on imported goods. 'Steep tariff increases could cause adjustments in business decisions with knock-on effects on hiring and wages as business leaders navigate higher input costs and retaliatory measures,' Boussour said. 'This could lead to a more severe job slowdown, weaker income and restrained consumer spending amidst much higher inflation.’’ © Copyright 2024 Associated Press.

Diddy accused of 'forced labor' in latest indictment	(NewsNation) — U.S. prosecutors amended an existing federal indictment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs on Thursday, accusing the rapper of 'forced labor.' The move comes as Combs faces a May 5 trial on federal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty. Lawyers allege Combs forced his employees to work long hours and would threaten those who did not aid his alleged trafficking ring. Luigi Mangione, Diddy in partial lockdown at prison after ‘race riot’: Report Though no new official charges were added, the indictment details these new allegations, including forcing employees 'to work long hours with little sleep.' 'He looks forward to his day in court when it will become clear that he has never forced anyone to engage in sexual acts against their will,' Marc Agnifilo, Combs' lawyer, said in a statement to Reuters. Combs faces a slew of sexual assault allegations, some of which allegedly date back decades. Combs is being held in the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center, where Luigi Mangione, the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is also held.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/diddy-accused-forced-labor-indictment/	2025-03-07T04:21:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673d1fe35bf946.05677514.jpeg?w=900
Trump says he’s 'looking at' revoking protected status for Ukrain...	President Trump said Thursday he’s looking at whether to revoke temporary protections for thousands of Ukrainians in the United States who fled that country’s war with Russia, but that no final decision has been made. 'We're not looking to hurt anybody, and we're certainly not looking to hurt them,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. 'And I'm looking at that, and there were some people that think that's appropriate, and some people don’t, and I'll be making a decision pretty soon.' Trump added that Ukrainians had 'gone through a lot.' Do ICE arrest numbers align with Trump’s mass deportation plans? Reuters reported earlier Thursday that the Trump administration planned to revoke protections for roughly 240,000 Ukrainians who had fled to the United States following Russia’s 2022 invasion. The move would lay the groundwork for those individuals to be deported. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back on the report at the time, saying no decision had been made. The Biden administration first announced it would allow Ukrainians into the country though Uniting for Ukraine, paroling migrants into the country for two years so long as they were able to secure a U.S.-based sponsor. The Biden administration also announced in January before leaving office that it was extending temporary protected status (TPS) for Ukrainians until October 2026, 'due to armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Ukraine that prevent individuals from safely returning.' The revocation of TPS for Ukrainians would be in line with the Trump administration’s broader approach to cracking down on legal pathways to enter the United States amid a widespread crackdown on immigration. The Trump administration has similarly targeted parole programs that allowed citizens of Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela into the country. White House reverses course on Education Department executive order And Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in January suspended TPS protections to roughly 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. before taking a similar move for some 520,000 Haitians. Trump has issued a flurry of executive actions suspending the refugee program and targeting other legal pathways that allow migrants to enter or remain in the country. Those actions have sparked numerous suits, including challenges to the pause in refugee admissions as well as the recission of TPS for Venezuelans.

Louisiana execution recharges debate on death by nitrogen gas	(NewsNation) — A death row inmate slated to become the first person to be put to death by nitrogen gas in Louisiana is seeking to halt the execution, citing constitutional concerns over the controversial killing method. Jessie Hoffman is set to be executed March 18, but his attorneys are asking a judge for a preliminary injunction to prevent it due to the secrecy of how the execution will be carried out. The inmate will present his arguments during a hearing on Friday in which he is expected to testify. Hoffman was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1996 rape and killing of 28-year-old Mary 'Molly' Elliot. Hoffman’s lawyers say that he was informed Feb. 20 that he will be killed using nitrogen gas, but state officials have not yet provided a detailed execution protocol, which the lawyers say is necessary to meet his constitutional rights. Will Luigi Mangione face the death penalty? 'The State wants to roll out this new gas protocol but keep it hidden from the public and even from the man they seek to kill,' Samantha Kennedy, executive director of the Promise of Justice Initiative, who is representing Hoffman, told NewsNation. 'Jessie Hoffman has a right to know how he's going to be killed, and we have a right as his attorneys to be able to determine if it's going to be a constitutional.' Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill has defended the state’s decision to utilize nitrogen hypoxia, a method used to suffocate a person by denying them oxygen and allowing them to only inhale nitrogen gas. 'On March 18, 2025, the State of Louisiana will execute Hoffman by nitrogen hypoxia for Molly’s murder. We have and will continue to vigorously defend the State’s obligation to carry out this sentence and bring justice to the family and friends of Molly Elliot,' Murrill said in a statement. Murrill told NewsNation local affiliate WVLA that she hasn’t personally spoken to the victim's family. History of nitrogen gas executions in the US The country’s first execution using nitrogen gas was carried out last year in Alabama, which has now been used to execute four people in the state. If Hoffman’s execution doesn’t get halted, Louisiana will become the second state to utilize the method on death row inmates. All of the men executed in Alabama using nitrogen shook or gasped to varying degrees on the gurney as they were being put to death, according to media witnesses, including The Associated Press. Rev. Jeff Hood, the spiritual advisor for Kenneth Smith, who was the first person to be killed using nitrogen, witnessed his execution and called it 'a slow, painful means of torture.' Smith's execution was 'the most violent thing that I have ever witnessed or engaged with,' Hood told Catholic news outlet OSV. 'It was absolutely … incredibly disturbing to see a human being suffocated to death.' Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has maintained the method as 'painless and humane.' After convicted murderer Alan Miller settled a lawsuit against Alabama over the use of nitrogen gas in 2024, Marshall stated, 'The resolution of this case confirms that Alabama’s nitrogen hypoxia system is reliable and humane.' Lethal injection, electrocution and now firing squads. A look at US execution methods Alabama's nitrogen executions prove even more how untested this method is, Kennedy said. 'It's impossible to know if somehow Louisiana Department of Corrections has fixed all the problems that happened in Alabama, where every single time they killed people with gas, it was absolutely a torturous, gruesome, horrific experience,' she said. 'Jessie Hoffman and the public have a right to know what is the process that Louisiana is engaging in, and ... if they're upholding everyone's constitutional rights.' Which states allow for the use of nitrogen gas in executions? Currently, four states allow nitrogen gas executions: Louisiana, Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi. An Arkansas bill that would allow nitrogen on death row inmates passed the state House on Tuesday and will now advance for a full vote. Louisiana had paused executions for 15 years due to an inability to secure lethal injection drugs, but with a nitrogen gas execution protocol finalized last month, the state has been eager to proceed. 'For too long, Louisiana has failed to uphold the promises made to victims of our State’s most violent crimes, but that failure of leadership by previous administrations is over,' Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement. Firing squad could become Idaho’s main execution method under a bill awaiting governor’s approval Louisiana scheduled two executions on consecutive days in March, but inmate Christopher Sepulvado, who was scheduled to be executed one day before Hoffman, died on Feb. 23 of an illness. Hoffman had initially challenged Louisiana’s lethal injection protocol in 2012 on the grounds that the method was cruel and unusual punishment. U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick dismissed the lawsuit in 2022 because the state had no executions planned but reopened the case last month, saying that the scheduled executions were 'extraordinary circumstances' that warranted more scrutiny. A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay in Dick’s ruling while it considers an opposition from Murrill.

Do ICE arrest numbers align with Trump's mass deportation plans?	(NewsNation) — Federal immigration officials boast migrant arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have jumped more than 600% under President Donald Trump, but agency data indicates that enforcement of the administration’s overall immigration mission may not be as impressive as published numbers suggest. Trump border czar Tom Homan insists the administration’s mass deportation effort is targeting 'the worst of the worst.' But of the nearly 21,000 migrants that were in ICE custody in February, just more than half had previous convictions, and many others were charged with immigration-related offenses that often do not result in removal from the United States. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem remained focused on the more than 20,000 migrant arrests ICE has made under Trump, which she said jumped 627% from the number of 'at-large' arrests made by the agency in all of 2024 under former President Joe Biden’s watch. Trump changes course and delays some tariffs on Mexico and Canada Noem claims that Trump’s border agenda is 'saving lives every day because of the actions we are taking to secure the border and deport illegal alien criminals.' But a Migration Policy Institute analyst noted that Noem’s calculations of the 627% jump included only about 30% of the 113,000 arrests that ICE made in 2024, which the MPI expert said significantly shrinks the gap between ICE arrests under Trump and Biden. A former ICE official claims such formulas highlight how the Trump administration is selectively using data to create a narrative about the federal agency’s daily work. Jason Houser, the ICE chief of staff between 2021 and 2023, told NewsNation that the 'politicization and the mass media consumption of typical ICE work' is part of the biggest shift in ICE’s new mission. Houser said ICE agents previously did their jobs quietly rather than having raids promoted on social media with Homan, Noem and celebrities like Phil McGraw in toe. Now, 'It’s all about the volume,' Houser said, adding, 'Arrests don’t equate to detained.' What migrants is ICE targeting for arrest? The nearly 20,820 migrants held by ICE in February represent about half of the 43,759 detainees in federal custody. Of those being detained by ICE and Customs and Border Protection, 52.1% do not have a criminal record, according to data released by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. ICE data shows that about 23,000 arrests have been made by the agency's immigration officers since Trump’s second term began. However, many of those being taken into custody are released because federal detention centers are at near capacity, Houser said. As ICE data shows, many of those in custody either have criminal charges pending (32%) or face 'other immigration' offenses. However, for every bed being filled by someone who may not be facing deportation, Houser said, 'a criminal is not in (a bed).' US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, along with other federal law enforcement agencies, attend a pre-enforcement meeting in Chicago, Illinois, US, on Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025. President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the largest deportation effort in US history, vowing to ultimately deport all of the foreigners living in the country without permission. Photographer: Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg via Getty Images In recent weeks, NewsNation reached out to ICE with multiple requests for comment, seeking clarification of its data and which ICE detainees are scheduled for deportation. Buoy barriers on Rio Grande have doubled in size A spokesman responded Thursday, saying that since Jan. 20, ICE has 'significantly increased' its immigration enforcement activities with additional federal agencies. To keep Americans informed of federal efforts accurately, the spokesman said, 'ICE is compiling and validating the data.' He added that moving forward, the agency will publish data monthly rather than quarterly, as has been ICE’s practice. What migrants are being held in ICE custody? As federal officials seek more detention space for migrant detainees, including at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Homan told The New York Times he could not predict the number of migrants who would be deported this year. Homan has said in other interviews that Congress needs to provide more funding to the mass deportation effort and bolster federal immigration enforcement agency budgets. 'The more money you have, the more successful we’re going to be,' Homan said. Vance urges people to leave US voluntarily before deportation As Homan waits for congressional funding, however, the administration has limited the information it releases, including to NewsNation. The agency stopped publishing daily arrest numbers under Homan’s concerns that it alerted criminal migrants where ICE may be striking next. In this handout photo provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the New York City Fugitive Operations Team, joined by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, conducted targeted enforcement operations resulting in the arrest of an illegal Dominican national on January 28 in New York City. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Getty Images) Yet other former immigration agents suggest that too much media attention is being given to arrest numbers rather than the bigger mission of removing criminal migrants. The immigration system is broken into criminal and civil administrative categories, the latter of which is often largely ignored, former Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila said. In many cases, migrants who enter the country illegally and do not present themselves to border officials are charged with a misdemeanor offense. However, once they are deported and reenter the country, they face up to two years in prison as a second illegal entry pushes the offense to a felony, Avila said. But the former HSI agent warns that just because migrants haven’t been charged with crimes like rape or murder doesn’t meant they do not pose a threat. 'They’re committing the crime, but they haven’t committed a crime that the public can see,' Avila told NewsNation, including offenses such as using false documentation and identification cards to allow migrants to avoid law enforcement. He said that although migrants, including those who overstay their visas or ignore orders to leave the country, fall into the 'noncriminal' category, that does not mean they will face a different fate than those who get more of the national spotlight. Avila said that’s where Trump’s stern approach to border security is changing the narrative of ICE’s directives. 'That’s the difference,' Avila said. '(ICE is) not going to look the other way the way the Biden administration did and gave them a pass for being here illegally.' That's the approach being taken by Noem, who was recently part of an ICE raid in Northern Virginia. In a social media post that included video of Noem dressed in tactical gear surrounded by agents, she wrote, 'If you come to this country and break our laws, we'll hunt you down.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ice-arrests-trump-deportation-plans/	2025-03-06T14:22:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1152488290-e1737689110961.jpg?w=900
Is a firing squad execution more humane than lethal injection?	(NewsNation) — For the first time in 15 years, the United States will put someone to death using a firing squad when South Carolina executes death row inmate Brad Sigmon on Friday. Sigmon chose a firing squad over lethal injection and electrocution, which are also authorized by the state, citing concerns that little is known about the drugs or process used in injections. While the method may seem barbarous, it felt the most humane to the inmate, his lawyer said. 'The fact that he ‘chose’ this, that tells you how fearful he is about this lethal injection process that’s so shrouded in secrecy,' his lawyer, Gerald 'Bo' King, told The Washington Post. Sigmon feared that the electric chair would be being 'cooked to death' and that lethal injection could cause pulmonary edema, a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs and can feel like suffocation or drowning, King told The Washington Post. FILE - This undated image provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows Brad Sigmon. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File) What is Brad Sigmon sentenced to die for? Sigmon, 67, is being executed for the 2001 killings of his ex-girlfriend’s parents at their home in Greenville County. 'I miss my momma and daddy,' Sigmon’s ex-girlfriend, Rebecca Armstrong, said of her slain parents to USA Today. 'I didn’t get to see them grow old.' The South Carolina Supreme Court rejected an 11th hour and likely last appeal to halt the execution Thursday. Condemned South Carolina killer chooses to be executed by firing squad Why did Sigmon not choose lethal injection? His main appeal to halt the execution was to gain more information about the drug South Carolina uses in lethal injections so he could have a better understanding of what to expect, King said. South Carolina has a shield law that keeps the suppliers of its lethal injection drugs, the members of the execution team and the procedure used to kill an inmate secret. FILE - This undated photo provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows the state's death chamber in Columbia, S.C., including the electric chair, right, and a firing squad chair, left. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File) Autopsies from two inmates executed by lethal injection in South Carolina showed massive amounts of the drug pentobarbital and a considerable amount of fluid in their lungs. A defense expert testified the inmates might have struggled to breathe. Lethal injection, electrocution and now firing squads. A look at US execution methods Lawyers for the state have said fluid is often found in the lungs of prisoners killed by lethal injections, and other courts have not ruled it was cruel and unusual punishment. Other than South Carolina, five states authorize the use of firing squads, including Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah. Only Utah has utilized death by firing squad on three inmates in 1977, 1996 and 2010 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. How the firing squad execution will happen Friday’s execution will be carried out by three volunteer firing squad members using live ammunition from behind a wall about 15 feet from the inmate, according to officials. Bullet-resistant glass has been installed between the witness room and death chamber. 'The inmate will be strapped into the chair, and a hood will be placed over his head. A small aim point will be placed over his heart by a member of the execution team,' officials said. Not much is known about the people who will fire the rifles. Prison officials said they have 'completed all required training.' The information released by the state to the public gives no indication what might happen if an inmate survives the initial shots. At the 2022 trial, witnesses indicated the squad could fire again. Is the firing squad a humane or heinous method of execution? Some say the firing squad is more humane than lethal injections, which have been botched in the past. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a 2017 dissent that 'in addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.' Her comments came in the case of an Alabama inmate who asked to be executed by firing squad. A Supreme Court majority refused to hear his appeal. In her dissent, Sotomayor said lethal drugs can mask intense pain by paralyzing inmates while they are still sentient. 'What cruel irony that the method that appears most humane may turn out to be our most cruel experiment yet,' she wrote. Bryan Kohberger faces firing squad execution, Idaho victim’s dad supports Dr. James Williams, an emergency room physician, has testified on the effectiveness of the firing squad. 'There is a lot of evidence that the near-instant loss of blood pressure means no blood gets to the brainstem, and there is a rapid loss of consciousness,' he told The Marshall Project. However, Williams stresses that, just as with any other execution method, protocols must be precise to avoid mistakes. Talking about the Utah firing squad deaths, Williams said that 'when the written protocol was fully followed, none were botched, which speaks strongly to the reliability of this method.' He added that 'Utah had four loaded rifles and South Carolina will use just three, along with a blank, which should be adequate. But there’s the possibility a shooter is not adequately trained, or faulty ammunition.'

Trump’s Middle East envoy confirms direct talks with Hamas	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — White House special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff confirmed Thursday the Trump administration has been in direct talks with Hamas.

It’s the first known direct engagement between the U.S. and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. White House reverses course on Education Department executive order The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Witkoff said the U.S. would not allow Hamas to 'be a part of' any potential government formed in Gaza. Witkoff did not say what would happen next — only that 'there’s going to be some action.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/trumps-middle-east-envoy-hamas-talks/	2025-03-06T11:21:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-2-2.jpg?w=900
Corporations partly to blame for high egg prices: Report	(NewsNation) — Egg shortages and high prices have largely been blamed on an outbreak of bird flu, but a new watchdog report says companies are creating the crisis by price gouging their customers. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture, the price of eggs has nearly doubled in the last six weeks, with the average cost of a dozen at around $8. Bird flu, which has spread poultry and also affected dairy herds, has 'slightly reduced' egg production, but 'corporate greed has also played a major role,' a report from Food and Water Watch published Wednesday said. White House reverses course on Education Department executive order According to the report, about 10 companies control the vast majority of the eggs produced in America, and they dictate egg prices whether there's a bird flu outbreak or not. One of these companies, the Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods, increased their profits by 7.5 times over the first year of the bird flu outbreak — despite not having outbreaks in their own flocks that fiscal year, Food and Water Watch found. During that fiscal year, from June 2022 through May 2023, Cal-Maine actually sold 7% more eggs compared to FY2021. The report says Cal-Maine Foods 'commanded prices from its buyers that were much higher than needed to cover rising costs, at a time when national egg prices were skyrocketing.' 'Basically, they just raised their prices and locked up with national prices. They had no reason to,' Amanda Starbuck, research director for Food and Water Watch, said. In FY2021, Cal-Maine took in $0.15 per dozen eggs produced and sold, according to the report. It then made $1.14 per dozen eggs in FY2023, and sold over 1 billion eggs. 'That's $1 billion dollars in windfall profits that they made from the consumers having to pay more for eggs,' Starbuck said. Cal-Maine did not respond to the Associated Press' request for comment. House votes to censure Al Green for disrupting Trump speech American Egg Board President Emily Metz said prices have nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. 'I think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the reality,' American Egg Board President Emily Metz said. 'Our farmers are in the fight of their lives, period, full stop. And they’re doing everything they can to keep these birds safe.. .This is a supply challenge due to bird flu. Nothing else.' Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pushed back against criticism that the higher cost of eggs was solely the result of avian flu when she unveiled a nearly $1 billion plan to fight the current price spike. Instead, she attributed the current situation to 'the high cost of inputs, the unbelievable amount of regulation, the shutting down of our export markets.' Rollins' plan includes $500 million for biosecurity measures to 'lock the barns down' and initiatives to repopulate flocks after what she described as the depopulation of nearly 160 million birds under the Biden administration.

Newsom: Trans athletes competing in women's sports 'deeply unfair...	(NewsNation) — California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a defender of rights for the LGBTQ community, said his party was wrong in its support of transgender athletes participating in women's sports. 'I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,' Newsom said in an episode of his new podcast 'This is Gavin Newsom.' He was speaking with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who asked Newsom if he would say 'no' to men participating in women's sports. Kirk asked if Newsom would speak out against a young man who is going to win the girls' state championship in the long jump. 'I can see you are wrestling with it,' Kirk said to Newsom. NCAA transgender policy doesn’t go far enough, some athletes say 'I am not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you,' Newsom said. 'I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,' Newsom said. 'And I saw that — the last couple years, boy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize that issue at another level.' Kirk challenged Newsom over his use of the word 'weaponize.' Newsom then used the word 'highlight.' Newsom said he completely agrees 'on the issue of fairness. That is easy to call out. The fairness of it.' 'We are getting crushed on it, crushed,' Newsom said. Newsom pointed out in the podcast that he has been a front-runner for LGBTQ rights for years and has been a major supporter of marriage for same-sex couples.

Trump delays tariffs on most goods from Mexico for a month	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he has postponed 25% tariffs on most goods from Mexico for a month after a conversation with that country's president. Trump's announcement comes after his Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said tariffs on both Canada and Mexico would 'likely' be delayed. This is the second one-month postponement Trump has announced since first unveiling the import taxes in early February. The reprieve would apply to goods that are compliant with the trade agreement Trump negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term. 'We are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl,' Trump said on Truth Social. Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs threats have roiled financial markets, lowered consumer confidence, and enveloped many businesses in an uncertain atmosphere that could delay hiring and investment. Lutnick emphasized that reciprocal tariffs, in which the United States applies import taxes on countries that tariff U.S. exports, will still be implemented April 2. U.S. markets bounced of their lows for the day shortly after Lutnick spoke. Also Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated that he expects his country will be in a trade war with the United States for the foreseeable future. Trudeau said the broader month-long pause 'aligns with some of the conversations that we have been having with administration officials.' The Canadian leader said the move by the Trump administration was a 'promising sign,' but it also 'means that the tariffs remain in place and therefore our response will remain in place.' _____ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-commerce-secretary-lutnick-says-most-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-likely-to-be-delayed-a-month/	2025-03-06T08:56:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c9d05bba68f3.17268999.jpeg?w=900
