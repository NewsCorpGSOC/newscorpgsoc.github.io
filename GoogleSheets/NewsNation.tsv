Live updates: Trump to hold victory rally at Capital One Arena, T...	President-elect Trump is making the rounds in Washington on Sunday ahead of a victory rally at Capital One Area just before Inauguration Day. Trump arrived in the nation's capital over the weekend where he is preparing to take a second term in the White House as the Republican trifecta takes form. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance took part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier earlier Sunday. He will hold a rally this evening where the slate of guest speakers include Megyn Kelly and Elon Musk. Also Sunday, TikTok said it was 'in the process' of restoring service in the United States hours after the popular video-sharing platform went dark. And in the Middle East, the ceasefire deal struck between Israel and Hamas took effect on Sunday, with the release of hostages that have been held in the Gaza Strip for more than one year. The deal includes three phases including an initial six-week pause in fighting. Several lawmakers also took to the Sunday political news shows including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) who told NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' that Trump is entering the White House as a 'different Donald Trump' from the man who took office eight years ago. Plus, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that he 'won’t commit' to sending California disaster aid without conditions, even as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) insists his state needs it for wildfire relief. He also vowed that there will be 'hell to pay' if Hamas violates the ceasefire deal struck recently with Israel.

Capitol Rotunda prepped as inaugural ceremony moves indoors	(NewsNation) — With just under 24 hours before Monday’s inauguration, the Capitol Rotunda was full of activity Sunday afternoon. The majestic room is being turned into the site of the inauguration, which was moved inside because of concerns about the frigid cold. Instead of hundreds of thousands of people being able to watch the ceremony outside, now a room housing about 2,000 max will be the site for Donald Trump’s swearing-in as the 47th president. These notable inaugurations weren’t held at the US Capitol. Here’s why Congressional officials were figuring out where exactly Trump should stand on stage as he takes the oath. Inauguration committee staff were mapping out where entertainers would enter the room, and who would escort family members to the stage. The decision Friday to move the ceremony inside forced organizers and security agencies to re-do hundreds of decisions meticulously laid out for months to new ones decided within days, such as: Who will get the coveted seats and who won’t? Various agencies are now figuring out where security entrances will now be. What road closures now need to be in effect? A new road closure map was released late Saturday. For the Secret Service, which is in charge of the security for the inauguration, the switch of venues means the swearing-in ceremony is an easier event to safeguard because it means fewer people in attendance and takes away the uncertainty of an outside site. Capitol staff, who are in charge of setting up the ceremony, were seen unloading new batches of chairs as they see how many seats could be jammed into the area. Ted Cruz: ‘This is a different Donald Trump that is being sworn in than in 2017’ Meanwhile, the decision to move the ceremony is causing repercussions across Washington. Congressional offices are being inundated with constituents who had received inaugural tickets but now won’t be able to attend and want to know if there is anything they can do. As part of the move inside, jumbotrons set up across the National Mall allowing thousands without tickets to view the swearing-in and feel like they are part of the event were taken down by the Presidential Inaugural Committee because of the weather, a spokesman for the National Park Service said. As for the Rotunda preparations, workers will be probably working through much of the night putting on the final touches because just like every other inaugural- at noon the new president will be sworn in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/capitol-rotunda-inaugural-ceremony/	2025-01-19T13:40:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/cap_rouunda.jpg?w=900
Live updates: Protestors descend on Washington as US prepares for...	Inauguration festivities will begin in full force Saturday as President-elect Trump and his allies — and protesters — arrive in Washington ahead of Monday's inauguration of the 47th president of the U.S. Trump is expected to arrive at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, and he will later host a reception and fireworks display at his Virginia golf course. There will also be a Cabinet reception and dinner for Vice President-elect Vance at the National Gallery of Art on Saturday evening. The D.C. People’s March, organized by several activist groups, kicked off Saturday morning. It will culminate in a rally outside the Lincoln Memorial at 3 p.m., and about 50,000 people are expected to attend. On Sunday, Trump will host a rally at Capital One Arena in downtown Washington, where allies such as tech billionaire Elon Musk are expected to deliver remarks. The Village People, Kid Rock and Billy Ray Cyrus are also set to perform. Although Saturday is expected to be balmy, Monday’s inauguration ceremony was moved inside the Capitol as freezing temperatures and a snow storm are expected to envelop Washington later in the weekend.

Mother of son killed in Gaza 'relieved' after first hostages rele...	(NewsNation) — The ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of the first three hostages is bittersweet for one mother who lost her 23-year-old American son, Hersh Goldberg, to the war. The ceasefire deal in Gaza is in effect as of Sunday morning, after almost falling apart in the final hours with Hamas holding out on releasing the list of hostage names. Ultimately, Hamas announced the names of three living female hostages who were successfully freed to Israeli officials Sunday afternoon local time. The deal was too late for Rachel Goldberg-Polin and her family, but she remains hopeful for the other grieving families. 'I woke up this morning, and I felt tremendous relief,' Goldberg-Polin said on NewsNation’s 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday. 'I am a mother who is going to be processing the loss of her only son for the rest of my life, but I am so relieved for these families.' Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next She described her son, who was executed by Hamas five months ago, as a 'happy-go-lucky, positive, wide-eyed lover of listening, small ego, curious, beautiful young man.' She compared him to a flower 'that's about to open up,' as she hopes his memory will 'serve as a blessing and as motivation to do and be better.' This undated photo provided by Rachel Goldberg shows her son Hersh Goldberg-Polin. The 23-year-old from Jerusalem was last seen when Hamas militants loaded him into the back of a pickup truck with other hostages abducted from a music festival in the western Negev Desert on Oct. 7. (Courtesy of Rachel Goldberg via AP) First hostages released Three women -- Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari -- were handed over to the Red Cross on the first day of the ceasefire. They are now in Israel and will soon be medically evaluated. The three-phase ceasefire began with this prisoner exchange, with Israel releasing 1,700 Palestinian prisoners in return in the first phase. Thirty-three hostages held captive by Hamas are expected to be released in the first six weeks as well. No Americans were released on the first day of the ceasefire, Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told NewsNation, but they are expected to be freed within the first six weeks. Phase two will include the return of the remaining living Israel hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza. The third phase is expected to address the handing over of the remaining bodies of dead hostages and the start of Gaza’s reconstruction, according to President Joe Biden. Families of hostages grateful but cautious about ceasefire deal The youngest hostage was kidnapped when he was nine months old, celebrating his second birthday the day before the ceasefire’s start. And 64 people will remain in captivity. 'We cannot be celebrating until every single one is home, and until this deal is complete,' Goldberg-Polin said. The war began 471 days ago on Oct. 7, 2023. In that time, people of different backgrounds faced a life-changing event. 'Now the remaining hostages comprise 23 different nationalities. They are Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. And I started to wear the number because so many people would ask me during interviews, just on the street randomly, how many days has it been and I decided very early on that this is going to be my identity until every single one of these hostages comes home.' More than 46,000 Palestinians have died in the war, according to officials. In a post to X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the hostage release. 'Romi, Doron and Emily - an entire nation embraces you, with congratulations on your homecoming. This moment was achieved thanks to the sacrifice and fighting of our heroic fighters - the heroes of Israel. I promise: We will bring everyone home!' Netanyahu wrote, translated from Hebrew. Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefire deal Is the ceasefire deal enough?

Scott Applewhite) It’s been five months since Goldberg-Polin lost her son. Is the deal enough? 'Well, if this deal gets every single person home, it is enough,' she said. 'If this deal even saves one life according to Jewish tradition and actually to Islamic tradition, one life is one universe. So, if we can save one universe, three universes, 33 universes, that's wonderful, but we have an obligation, a moral, ethical obligation to save 98 universes.' Goldberg-Polin said she wants to see Trump stand by his promises. Ceasefire in Gaza begins, Hamas releases hostage names to Israel 'This deal could have happened back in the summer, and Hersh and three of the people who he was executed with would have been released. But I don't think anymore that it's healthy nor helpful to dwell on that,' Goldberg-Polin said. 'That was not the destiny for our six families of the beautiful six who were tortured, starved and murdered in that lightless, airless tunnel that wasn't meant to be.' She is looking ahead and not behind. 'I truly believe there is light ahead, and we all need to be looking toward the light.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/mother-of-son-killed-in-gaza-relieved-after-first-hostages-released/	2025-01-19T09:18:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/652d813a1663e5.11579913.jpeg?w=900
These notable inaugurations weren't held at the US Capitol. Here'...	(NEXSTAR) – For decades, Americans have gathered at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. to watch the inauguration of the incoming president, but there are some noteworthy exceptions. While the first and second inaugurations of President George Washington were held outside of Washington D.C., they were still held in the nation's capital, which was in New York City in 1789, and, for Washington's second inauguration in 1793, in Philadelphia. The inauguration ceremony would move to Washington D.C. for Thomas Jefferson's 1801 oath of office, according to the National Library of Congress, but circumstances in subsequent years would force the inauguration to happen on a plane, at a farm and at a personal residence. Chester A. Arthur (1881) After just 200 days in office — a presidency historians called 'impactful,' if short — an 'embittered attorney' passed over for a consular post shot President James A. Garfield at a Washington, D.C. railroad station. Garfield would not survive his injuries, making his vice president, Chester A. Arthur, head of state. On Sept. 20, 1881, then-Vice President Arthur took the oath of office at his home in New York City, with New York Supreme Court Judge John R. Brady administering the proceedings, according to official accounts. The next day, he took his oath again, this time before a group of invited guests inside the vice president's room at the U.S. Capitol, according to UC Santa Barbara's 'The American Presidency Project.' Theodore Roosevelt (1901) The assassination of President William McKinley led to an inauguration ceremony hastily arranged at a home in Buffalo, New York, according to the National Park Service. McKinley was shot twice at point blank range while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, on Sept. 6, 1901, according to White House historians. He would die eight days later. His vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, had been vacationing in New York's Adirondack Mountains when he received news that McKinley was gravely wounded. Roosevelt rushed to Buffalo, but by the time he arrived McKinley had died. Using a borrowed coat, pants, waistcoat, tie and leather shoes, Roosevelt decided to take the oath of office immediately so the country wouldn't experience a gap in leadership, according to the Park Service. 'I was so shocked by the terrible news brought to me last night and by the calamity which it entailed upon the country, as well as by personal sorrow which I feel, that I have had no time to think of plans for the future conduct of the office, which has been so suddenly and sadly thrust upon me,' Roosevelt said, according to a newspaper account from The Richmond Dispatch. The impromptu inauguration ceremony was held in the library of the house of Roosevelt's friend, Ansley Wilcox. The home is now open to the public as the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site. Calvin Coolidge (1923) The death of a sitting president brought about another unorthodox inauguration – this time in 1923 when Calvin Coolidge was sworn in using a family bible at the Vermont farmhouse in Plymouth Notch where he grew up. Coolidge was ushered into office after President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in 1923 while in San Francisco, according to White House historians. After learning at 2:30 a.m. on August 3, 1923, that he was president, Coolidge's father, a notary public, had his son place his hand on the family Bible and swear the oath of office. The birthplace and childhood home of President Coolidge have since been preserved as a Vermont State Historic Site. Lyndon Johnson (1963) Roughly two hours after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade in Dallas, Lyndon Johnson made history by becoming the only president to be inaugurated on an airplane. Johnson took the oath of office in the forward cabin of Air Force One in Dallas, according to a Library of Congress blog post. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath, the first time a woman had done so in U.S. history. Photos show Johnson flanked by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and his wife, Claudia 'Lady Bird' Johnson as he pledged to 'preserve, protect and defend The Constitution of the United States.' Five days later, he would address Congress and invoke Kennedy's vision for the country, calling for the passage of civil rights and tax legislation. Fast forwarding to Monday, President-elect Trump's inauguration ceremony is already making history. While the ceremony will happen at the Capitol, Trump announced that it will be held inside the Capitol Rotunda to shield people from the brutal cold forecast for that day. An indoor inauguration ceremony hasn't happened since President Reagan's in 1985, according to The Washington Post.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/these-notable-inaugurations-werent-held-at-the-us-capitol-heres-why/	2025-01-19T08:05:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-515466874-e1737143828756.jpg?w=799
First round of hostages released after ceasefire	(NewsNation) — More than 30 Israeli hostages have been released, signaling the start of Israel and Hamas' three-phase ceasefire deal. On Sunday, 33 Israeli hostages deemed 'humanitarian cases' — including all women, children and men over 50 years old — were released. Two American citizens, Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, are on the list of hostages to be released in the first phase. Not all Americans are expected to be released Sunday, a U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. French citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi are also among the 33 hostages, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. Palestinians are expected to be able to return to their homes during the first phase. Names of hostages to be released The Times of Israel and Jerusalem Post reported the names of the 33 people set to be released in the deal. They are: Liri Albag Itzhik Elgarat Karina Ariev Ohad Ben-Ami Ariel Bibas Yarden Bibas Kfir Bibas Shiri Silberman Bibas Agam Berger Romi Gonen Danielle Gilboa Emily Damari Sagui Dekel-Chen Yair Horn Omer Wenkert Alexander Troufanov Arbel Yehud Ohad Yahalomi Eliya Cohen Or Levy Naama Levy Oded Lifshitz Gadi Moshe Moses Avera Mengistu Shlomo Mansur Keith Siegel Tsahi Idan Ofer Calderon Tal Shoham Doron Steinbrecher Omer Shem-Tov Hisham Al Sayed Eli Sharabi The process for releasing the remaining American hostages, including those who have died, is ongoing. The temporary ceasefire is set to become permanent during the second phase. The third phase will involve the return of dead hostages and reconstruction in Gaza. Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a ceasefire deal to return Hamas-held hostages has been reached. Netanyahu said in a statement that the decision was made after 'examining all the political, security and humanitarian aspects, and with the understanding that the proposed transaction supports the achievement of the war’s goals.' Both President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have claimed credit for the deal. Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefire deal The pause in fighting comes after more than a year of conflict and a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Israel says 405 soldiers have been killed in the conflict, while Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed. It is not clear how many of those are combatants and how many are civilians.

TikTok app restored in US amid Trump assurances	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump plans to help the popular social media app TikTok stay in operation under his presidency. And now, it looks like it is powering back up despite a shutdown in the United States late Saturday night before the ban upheld by the Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. 'In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,' TikTok said in a statement on Sunday afternoon. 'We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.' Trump had said earlier Saturday that he would 'most likely' give TikTok a 90-day extension but left no one in any doubt via Truth Social on Sunday morning. The president-elect kept it short initially, writing on his social media platform: 'SAVE TIKTOK!' TikTok ban enforced: What happens now? Shortly after, Trump said he would not let the app 'stay' dark, saying he would issue an executive order on Monday to 'extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.' He proposed that the U.S. have 50% ownership in a 'joint venture.''By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions,' he wrote.TikTok began to restore service to U.S. users Sunday afternoon and credited Trump again for pushing to keep the app operational. 'In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,' TikTok said in a statement posted to the social platform X. 'We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,' it continued. Upon opening the app shortly late last night, users were greeted with a message: 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.' 'We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!' the notice continued. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-AK, and Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-NE, posted a joint statement to X on Sunday morning stating that there is 'no legal basis' for an extension of any kind. Republicans set to give Trump big immigration win — while dividing Democrats 'We commend Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft for following the law and halting operations with ByteDance and TikTok, and we encourage other companies to do the same. The law, after all, risks ruinous bankruptcy for any company who violates it,' the statement read. 'Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. 'Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posed to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok.' Elon Musk, who has become close with Trump, posted to his own social media app X: 'I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but 𝕏 is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change.' In 2020, Trump tried to ban TikTok with an executive order, but two courts later shut his efforts down.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-save-tiktok-truth-social-shutdown/	2025-01-19T05:23:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2193195255.jpg?w=900
6 dramatic moments that shaped Biden’s presidency	President Biden’s single term in office will be marked by several moments that saw the White House take the spotlight. It began with the pandemic and a raucous State of the Union. Then there was the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and his handling of wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Ultimately, his age and questions about his stamina led to him dropping out of the 2024 race that ended his decades-long political career. Here are the top dramatic moments of Biden’s presidency. The raucous 2023 State of the Union During his 2023 State of the Union address, Biden sparred with Republican lawmakers over potential cuts to Social Security with a lively back-and-forth in the House chamber. He argued that 'some Republicans want Social Security and Medicare to sunset' and Republicans yelled back, 'no,' which prompted the president to ad-lib about people contacting his office if they don’t believe him. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) stood up and pointed her finger at Biden, and yelled 'liar.' Biden replied, 'I don’t think it’s a majority of you, I don’t even think it’s a significant' before more jeers from Republicans. 'So folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right?' Biden said. 'Alright,' he added, with a thumbs-up, while Democrats and some Republicans stood up to cheer. Biden spent much of his speech urging unity to kick off the second half of his presidency following the 2022 midterm elections, but a back-and-forth inside the chamber with Republicans was the key takeaway from the address. At the time, it offered Biden and the White House an example of the president’s stamina, which Democrats used as an example when arguing Biden was fit enough to run for reelection. Ukraine speech In March 2022, Biden gave a fiery speech in Poland about his support for Ukraine a month after Russia’s invasion, during which he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin can’t remain in power. 'Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. We will have a different future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principles, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom, and possibilities,' Biden said during a speech in front of the Polish presidential palace. 'For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.' The crowd he spoke to was made up of Polish citizens, Ukrainian refugees and government officials from both countries. But, his stern remarks led to a clean-up operation from the White House and officials at the time attempted to argue that Biden’s comments meant Putin should not have power outside of Russia. A year later, the president made a surprise trip to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which involved a covert journey to the war-torn country on a 10-hour train ride from Poland to Kyiv. He is the only commander-in-chief to visit a war zone not controlled by U.S. forces. Afghanistan withdrawal The August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan was a major bruise on Biden’s legacy early into his presidency and is seen as the start of a long and windy downfall for his presidency. When hectic images out of the Kabul airport surfaced, Americans at home could see how chaotic the troop removal was. Then, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members who were helping to evacuate people from the country. Biden was told to 'burn in hell' by a family member of one of the 13 fallen service members in Kabul when the remains of troops arrived at Dover Air Force Base. Biden was personally involved in solving problems at the Kabul airport during the withdrawal, directing people on the ground to find ways to get Afghans at risk out of the country, according to a recent book.The nature of the withdrawal and the several deaths led to investigations from House Republicans, who dropped a long-awaited report in September. It painted Biden as determined to leave the country but fumbling preparation, criticizing him for a rushed effort regardless of counsel from allies and advisers that led to unnecessary deaths. Hur report A March 2024 release of a transcript of special counsel Robert Hur’s two-day interview with Biden for his investigation into the president’s handling of classified materials gave Republicans and critics new ammunition to go after his age — and gave the public a window into the president’s fitness for office. Biden had not engaged in many press interviews, in print or television, so the Hur report released amid the president’s campaign for reelection fueled concerns over Biden’s age. Hur described the president as a 'well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory' in the report, which recommended no charges against Biden for his handling of classified documents. One of the most notable exchanges to come out of Hur’s final report was when the special counsel wrote that Biden struggled to remember key dates and details, including when his son Beau died. The White House and Biden himself went on the attack. Disastrous debate Biden and Trump had their first and only 2024 presidential debate on June 27, moderated by CNN. It began immediately with Biden fumbling his answers and giving confused looks. Biden’s disastrous performance, one that lasted 90 minutes, set off a series of events that led to him ultimately dropping his reelection bid. Biden’s voice was hoarse, he struggled to finish sentences and he tripped over his words while discussing key topics like border security and the economy. He appeared to lose his train of thought while mixing up the terms Medicare and COVID and Trump took aim at him for slurring his comments. His team at the time said that Biden had a cold to explain his slow start and raspy voice. Democratic operatives were the first to call for him to drop out, followed by the first Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), on July 2. Pressure then built from party leaders like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and former President Obama, who were in part behind urging lawmakers to publicly call for the president to drop out and warning Biden that he could lose to Trump. At the time of the debate, Biden was trailing Trump in the polls, especially in the pivotal battleground states. Drops reelection bid Once the flood gates were open with Democratic lawmakers calling for him to drop out, Biden was unable to stop the bleeding. In early July, he and his team spoke with Democratic congressional leadership and Democratic governors and he sat for an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in an effort to show he can participate in unscripted events. He campaigned in Wisconsin, where he fought back against critics, and he gave a defiant interview on 'Morning Joe' to dare other Democrats to challenge him at the convention in August. At this time, the White House also faced a series of questions over visitor logs that showed a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson’s disease visited the campus several times in recent months. There was then a brief pause in calls from lawmakers for Biden to step down in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania The president sat for another interview, with NBC’s Lester Holt, to defend the fallout from the debate. Days later, he tested positive for COVID-19 when he was campaigning in Las Vegas. While isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., with a growing list of sitting Democrats urging him to drop out, Biden and a small circle of his closest advisers ultimately made the decision to do so. He announced he would no longer seek another four years in office on July 21 in a letter shared on X and then later endorsed Vice President Harris to be the party’s nominee Harris had just over 100 days to run against Trump and lost decisively in November.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/6-dramatic-moments-that-shaped-bidens-presidency/	2025-01-19T05:21:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Biden-regulations_010825_AP_Gerald-Herbert.jpg?w=900
Marco Rubio met with UAP whistleblower prior to Trump nomination	(NewsNation) — Whistleblower Jacob Barber tells NewsNation he not only knows of secret unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs, more commonly known as UFOs) retrieval programs in the government but has worked for one. For the past 30 years, Barber said he’s worked in both an official and unofficial capacity for the United States government and its partners in the intelligence community. 'We're in this rare opportunity in human history where it's very clear that we know that there are things flying in the sky that are unexplained and un-understood,' Barber told NewsNation investigative reporter Ross Coulthart exclusively. UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive During his time as a contracted helicopter pilot, he retrieved all kinds of downed craft, some of which he believes are of nonhuman origin. 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber said. 'It was not human.' Barber claims he is 'uniquely providing information on' UAPs and wants the public to know what he knows. Witnesses at the congressional UAP hearings have been saying the same thing. 'The Pentagon, the intelligence community is treating us like children. It's time for us to know the truth about this. I think that we can handle it,' journalist Michael Shellenberger said during his testimony. Barber has been to Capitol Hill too. NewsNation confirmed that this past fall, he met with staffers for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is now President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state. 'I feel I was able to fill in gaps that have been there for a long time that no other whistleblower has been able to do,' Barber said. Rubio is expected to see a smooth confirmation from the Senate. Is Trump considering an overhaul of NASA? NewsNation checked Barber's records and confirmed he was an airman in the U.S. Air Force who worked as an aerospace mechanic in the late 1990s.

UAP recovery video shows ‘egg-shaped’ object: Exclusive	(NewsNation) — NewsNation has obtained exclusive footage capturing an egg-shaped craft, recorded during a UAP retrieval operation. The egg resembles the UAP encountered by U.S. Navy fighters off the east coast of the U.S. in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects. NewsNation was told that the video was sent to the organization responsible for monitoring UAPs, and until now it has never been shown to the public, making a U.S. Air Force veteran's mission even more critical. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs Whistleblower Jake Barber believes he was involved in the recovery of alien technology while working for a long-rumored secret UFO retrieval program. When asked to describe the object, Barber told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber said. 'It was not human.' He added: 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.' Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims Other whistleblowers, including Lue Elizondo and David Grusch, have alleged a secret government UFO program exists but Barber says he knows it’s true because he’s part of it. NewsNation has also obtained exclusive, never-before-seen video of one of these alleged UFO crash retrievals. That video and the full interviews will air in Saturday's special report 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' at 8p/7c. Click here to find NewsNation's channel on your television. In June 2023, NewsNation was the first television network to present an interview with Grusch. The account has led to multiple Congressional hearings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/uap-recovery-video-shows-egg-shaped-object-exclusive/	2025-01-18T18:01:17-08:00	
Whistleblower reveals UAP retrieval program; object caught on vid...	(NewsNation) — In October 2024, an unknown man stepped out of the shadows, arriving in our nation’s capital to deliver an important message about what the public calls 'UFOs' and what the government calls 'UAPs,' or unidentified aerial phenomena. His name is Jacob Barber, and he says for the past 30 years, he’s worked in both an official and unofficial capacity for the United States government and its partners in the intelligence community. What he knows, and what he’s here to tell Congress, could change the world. 'We're in this rare opportunity in human history where it's very clear that we know that there are things flying in the sky that are unexplained and un-understood, and that's another one of the things that I'm uniquely providing information on,' Barber said. Others have alleged there’s a secret government UAP retrieval program that’s been going on for decades. People like David Grusch and Lue Elizondo. They say they’ve been told about it, they believe it exists, but they weren’t a part of it themselves. Barber, however, is different. He says he was part of that covert program that worked with alien spacecraft for years. NewsNation checked Barber's records and confirmed that he was an airman in the U.S. Air Force who worked as an aerospace mechanic in the late 1990s. He was also recruited into Air Force Special Operations, known as 'combat control.' He would eventually go on to work in a nonofficial capacity for the Defense Department and the intelligence community. Barber was a highly talented airplane mechanic who was deployed on a number of presidential support missions. But Barber was no ordinary mechanic. Being recruited into the Air Force’s Elite Combat Control unit meant he had a résumé that reads like something out of an action thriller: helicopter pilot, freefall parachutist, expert marksman and the recipient of a NATO top-secret security clearance — a legacy of his service in Bosnia, for which he won an award for heroism. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs In addition to reviewing his official documentation, NewsNation spoke with three former special operations soldiers who corroborated Barber’s credentials. One of his most fervent supporters is Col. John Blitch, a Renaissance warrior who also holds a doctorate in psychology, was a Delta Force sniper and is one of the few men to hold doomsday in his hands while commanding a nuclear weapons battalion. Blitch says he believes Barber’s claim wholeheartedly and that the U.S. has 'absolutely' recovered UAPs. For Barber, he says 'everything changed' for him around Sept. 11, 2001. 'I left the Air Force and was sent out to California at that time to begin establishing my cover basis as an independent contractor so that I can serve. What was coming down the line next for me was the path which led to the UAP subject,' said Barber. He says he was contracted as a helicopter pilot and was part of a team assigned to retrieve crashed aircraft at an undisclosed testing facility in the desert. 'A lot of the work we did was on what I call ‘the range,’ where the U.S. government and its private partners used to test all kinds of things — weapon systems and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft — and so you see a lot of exciting things,' said Barber. That’s where Barber said he began to see strange things. 'It's always interesting out there,' he said. 'Things come in and out of sight. Things disappear for a moment and reappear. Things seem to move very quickly. Things change color. They change shape.' Barber said his team recovered 'things that were exotic in nature.' 'We know they were classified craft,' he said. 'And we recovered them and took them back to where they go.' Barber’s first encounter with nonhuman intelligence 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was not human,' he said. Barber said he got his first glimpse of 'not human' pretty quickly. 'I was a helicopter pilot, and I operate with a 150-to-200-foot-long line. So, I got within 150 feet of this object,' he said. That’s when he saw it. 'I saw an egg, a white egg,' he said. 'There was no engine. There was no thermal signature. I was operating at night when I finally came in to pick it up. So, I'm working under night vision goggles at the time, and it was quite clear. I flipped them up, flipped them down and looked at it a couple of different ways.' UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive Barber said the 'metallic, pearly white' object was about the size of an SUV. 'I can tell you that the reaction by my team … we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary,' he said. While Barber said he was never told the craft wasn’t human, he’s certain. 'I'll tell you that because of the reaction of my leadership structure and because of my experience working in that capacity, everyone involved was convinced that what we were seeing and dealing with was, in fact, exotic in its origin,' said Barber. 'I will also tell you that during this process, over the last couple of years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP Task Force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence), and it was not a unique experience.' Barber said he still doesn’t know what exactly the object was or where it may be housed now. 'It would be taken to a secure facility. But my role stops once I deliver it,' he said. That wasn’t Barber’s only brush with the unexplained. 'There was another object. One was the egg, the other is what I called an ‘eightgon.’ The eightgon was essentially a flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections when looking down,' said Barber. 'And I can tell you what it looked like from looking down because that's primarily how I saw it. Because I'm a helicopter pilot. We did recoveries with the eightgons. There was more than one that made its way to the ground on this particular operation.' Barber said what happened next would be one of the most 'profound' experiences he’s had in his life. 'As I get closer to this site, I start feeling odd, I start feeling extremely emotional, and the closer I get, the more the emotion starts to overwhelm me,' he said. 'I feel this intense hybrid of sadness and happiness and beauty and song, and it was very disruptive to me because I had a very practical responsibility at the time to operate a helicopter in the mountains at night. And I began wondering, ‘What was wrong with me?’' Barber said it didn’t feel like an emotional breakdown but rather something entirely different. Drone sightings over Long Island airport spark concerns 'I felt like something connected with me,' he said. 'I felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.' Barber said he had never experienced a feeling like that before. 'It was a very feminine energy. I'll tell you that it felt like the spirit of God, but not in any masculine sense. And it wasn't like a soul; it was like a frequency that I was connected with. And whatever that force was since that night, it has stayed with me. And as crazy as this sounds, it's what's guiding me now, and it's what's providing protection for me.' Psionics Barber said his mission that night came from no accidental crash. He claims the UAP was summoned by a special team with special abilities: the 'Psionics.' Psionics, according to Barber, are people with a 'predisposition for extratemporal abilities and sensitivities,' more commonly referred to as people with alleged psychic powers. 'In the program, there was certainly a desire to explore the idea that perhaps UAP could be summoned, could be communicated with, could be controlled and could be persuaded to land, all by deploying people with psionic abilities to interface and communicate with the UAP,' said Barber. It’s something Barber said he has witnessed firsthand — and it looks a lot like meditation. He firmly believes psionics are capable of making a mental and spiritual connection to technology. It’s something another decorated Special Forces operator and colleague of Barber says he has witnessed too. 'I've had the pleasure of meeting multiple psionic assets,' said Don Paul Bales. 'I've seen them function. I know that they're capable of doing what they're doing.' It’s an established fact that the Pentagon has had an interest in psychic abilities — what it calls 'remote viewing' — for military purposes. The famed Project Stargate spent years studying the subject and despite the CIA’s official position that such studies yielded nothing. Despite the wonder of it all, Barber claims that he and his team have suffered serious injuries. Are UAPs bad for your health? Barber tells NewsNation that these encounters could come with a staggering cost to his health. 'We transported what we called ‘mystery boxes’ all the time,' he said. 'I have no idea … it could have been empty. It probably wasn't empty, but we don't know what was inside the boxes.' Barber and his team, however, were authorized to use 'lethal force' to protect their shipments should someone attempt to seize them. Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims 'After this particular mission, I and everyone on my team got extremely sick, like physically ill, in the hospital,' he said. 'Within weeks after this, I lost every hair on my body, which they call alopecia. I also lost the skin on my arms, so the skin's actually falling off your body. I ended up developing a severe heart murmur that I'd never had before.' Last year, NewsNation’s Ross Coulthart introduced Barber to Stanford University immunology professor Dr. Garry Nolan. He’s been studying anomalous injuries among U.S. military personnel for years at the behest of the CIA. He agreed to review decades of Barber’s medical records. 'The acute injuries were obviously severe,' said Nolan. 'I mean, the report reads like a bit of a horror show, to be quite honest. To me, the first thing that came to mind was (Barber) was exposed to some kind of radiation.' To this day, Barber is nervous that he may have some form of cancer. Assuming Barber and his team were exposed to radiation emanating from the mysterious box they transported, could it have come from one of the many radioactive materials used regularly by the military? Barber doesn’t believe so. 'Can I put on my speculative hat for a minute? Okay, so if the Air Force, let's say, knew that what we were working with that night had any type of radiological signature, there's a whole set of processes that we're trained in on how to deal with that from a hazmat perspective and a containment perspective,' said Barber. 'And the fact that none of that was apparent that night tells me they didn't know what was in the box, and it got turned on or turned off. It leads me to believe, in hindsight all these years, that it may have been something of nonhuman origin or exotic. Let's just say exotic. It may have been something exotic that activated or still had some fallout.' Barber remains under Nolan’s care and is receiving proper evaluation and treatment. Stolen hard drives? It wasn’t just the U.S. government interested in using Barber’s expertise in UAPs and psionics; his skills were also needed by private companies involved in the program. His assignments soon took a turn from recovering UAPs to something more sinister. 'We were deployed on a particular task to recover what we call HVTs, or 'high-value targets.' Those high-value targets were Panasonic Toughbooks — the sensitive material that is on these Toughbooks has to do with sensor data, video that was illegally captured during some of these operations, some of which may be incriminating or classified now,' said Barber. What UAP witnesses recommend for congressional action Those laptops allegedly contained illegally obtained sensor data from the UAP recovery missions — sensor data that was illegally recorded during UAP recovery missions in violation of top-secret protocols. Barber said the company contracting him was determined to cover up the laptops’ existence. 'We recovered our first two Toughbooks. We got back to our base location and then went through them and took photographs. Then we discovered that the hard drives were missing,' he said. Barber said the next piece of intelligence that came through led them to a lake where they found the hard drives in a sealed steel container 25 feet underwater. 'Yeah, so someone's going through a lot of effort in order to hide these things,' he said. What began as a straightforward recovery mission proved to be anything but simple, and Barber says things soon took a nefarious turn. ‘Things got strange for me’ 'The very next time we went out, things got strange for me. My spidey senses, my intuition, was on high alert because our intel contact changed; the rhythm and style of our intel changed. As we got closer to the day in which we were going to deploy, intelligence kept changing. That raised my concern, but we ended up going anyway. When we got there, the HVTs were gone, and it was clear that shots had been fired,' said Barber. Barber was worried he was in significant danger and possibly being set up. 'We were being prepared for the one thing that we've always offered employers, and that is plausible deniability and that we were perhaps going to be the hidden hand that gets severed,' he said. Bales, a Special Forces veteran who was working on Barber’s team at the time, said he was concerned about a potential setup. 'Yes, setup is a mild term,' Bales said. 'The fact that people have lost their lives involved in this type of activity — and the links to which people have gone to suppress politically uncomfortable truths — is such that there is risk involved.' Barber was convinced his former employer, or someone pretending to be them, was determined to kill him. Barber was then on the hunt, using his skills and vast network of contacts to determine who was behind this shadow war fought over those missing hard drives. He says the trail led him right to the top. Last spring, Barber and his team were in Washington, D.C., conducting surveillance — and eventually confronting — one of their prime suspects. Where are UFOs coming from? 'I reached out to the director of security for the particular organization and a sister organization and set up a meeting with them because there were only two truths in my mind: Either they were complicit, or they were compromised,' he said. Barber said he got in contact with the head of security of his former private aerospace company and was basically told to 'forget it.' 'If he had any knowledge at all, it was clear he was trying to distance himself from it,' said Barber. 'He didn't want to get involved. But he did provide some advice on where we should go.' Barber was no closer to finding out who wanted him dead, but he knew that he was no longer doing the mission he signed up for when he first enlisted. To make it stop, he would need more than his handpicked team: He would need Congress, he would need funding, and he would need to go public. Startling UAP footage Barber says he has been recruiting individuals from within the program and forming a new team in coordination with government agencies. Barber would not name the various agencies he’s recruiting from but hopes to 'very soon.' His Skywatcher Team has already deployed on behalf of the U.S. government to investigate last year’s drone sightings on the East Coast. But before that, they were on the hunt for something even more elusive. In August of 2024, Barber and the Skywatcher Team conducted their own operation, with a psionic asset, to see if they could summon a UAP themselves. The team hoped to quietly gather evidence for Skywatcher but instead found themselves in danger once more. According to the team, Barber says a UAP psychic dogfight erupted in the sky above them. He believes the craft summoned by the team was warring with a rogue UAP piloted by an unknown entity attempting to intercept Skywatcher’s operation. 'And then things got a little weird,' said Barber. 'I'd say, four or five minutes into the operation, (the psionic) goes, ‘Something's going on, something's wrong. Get me out of here.’ And right about that time, our overwatch, Fred, looked up to the sky and saw a disc, a classic lenticular-shape disk.' What Fred Baker and the rest of the team saw was an oval egg — exactly like the one Barber had a previous encounter with. NewsNation has independently obtained video recorded during one of those UAP retrieval operations. The extraordinary footage shows a view from the belly of a helicopter retrieving one of those mysterious eggs. The egg resembles a UAP encountered by U.S. Navy fighters off the East Coast in 2015, suggesting a possible connection between these anomalous objects. Aside from releasing data and footage like this to the public, the Skywatcher Team feels it also has to push the federal government to disclose what it knows about the UAP program — and any criminal activity that may have been perpetrated over the years to keep it secret. NewsNation has confirmed that last fall, Barber met with staffers for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, now Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state. 'I feel I was able to fill in gaps that have been there for a long time that no other whistleblower has been able to do,' Barber said of the meeting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/hfr-uap-recovery-video-egg-shaped-object-exclusive/	2025-01-18T16:54:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/MainbarThumbnail.png?w=900
CDC urges hospitals to fast-track bird flu testing	Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that hospitals speed up testing people who are hospitalized with the flu for H5N1 bird flu. Health care workers in hospitals are urged to perform additional testing on patients hospitalized with influenza A — ideally within 24 hours of admission — to determine whether they have bird flu, according to a CDC advisory issued Thursday. The advisory comes amid concerns that cases of H5N1 avian influenza will sicken more people in the United States. CDC officials confirmed earlier this week that a second San Francisco child contracted bird flu last week, and earlier this month, a 65-year-old Louisiana man became the first person to die from the disease in the United States. FDA proposes putting nutrition labels on the front of packaged foods Principal Deputy Director for the CDC Nirav Shah said the agency is not changing its guidance out of growing concern about the H5N1 bird flu virus. Instead, officials want to speed up an already slow system that runs the risk of becoming backlogged amid a surge in seasonal flu cases. More than 100,000 people have been hospitalized with the flu since October, according to CDC data. Officials said they expect more than 200,000 flu hospitalizations by the end of the winter. There have been 67 confirmed bird flu cases across 10 states since March, with 40 of those cases linked to exposure from infected dairy cows. About two dozen of those cases have been linked to infected poultry and one to a backyard flock of birds. CDC officials said there is still a low risk of contracting H5N1 bird flu and a moderate pandemic risk stemming from the current age of the virus. There are different types of influenza, and H5N1 avian influenza is caused by a kind of influenza A virus, which is a category of flu that also includes most seasonal variants of the virus. Currently, hospitals will occasionally test for influenza in patients who appear to have the virus. Most influenza tests performed in hospitals or other health clinics can show if someone has a seasonal variant of the flu, but they cannot detect bird flu. Many hospitals will test for the H5N1 bird flu variant by sending bulk batches of influenza A samples to public health laboratories every few days, according to Shah. US to hit 2 million annual new cancer cases for the first time 'But this system can take time, and sometimes by the time the results of the subtyping are in, the patient may already be discharged,' said Shah. Hospitals that have the equipment to test for the H5N1 bird flu subtypes are urged to do so in house, as close to the time of admission as possible, particularly for patients with influenza in intensive care units. CDC officials said they are working with hospitals that cannot test for influenza subtypes to connect them with public laboratories that can test influenza samples in real time. The new guidance is one of a few new efforts from the Biden administration to prepare for an H5N1 bird flu pandemic before President-elect Donald Trump takes office later this month. Other efforts include the Department of Agriculture launching a national program to test for bird flu in untreated milk and $211 million in new funding to address emerging infectious diseases.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/cdc-bird-flu-testing-hospitals-cases/	2025-01-18T15:15:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24228761933243-e1728569319445.jpg?w=900
First residents allowed back to communities ravaged by LA fires	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Some residents affected by the Palisades Fire are being allowed to return home and begin taking the first steps on a long road to recovery. Repopulation began Friday afternoon in communities where evacuation orders had been issued and have since been downgraded by officials. As of early Saturday morning, the Palisades Fire was 43% contained. Since erupting on Jan. 7, it has scorched more than 23,000 acres, destroyed thousands of structures in the Pacific Palisades, and led to the deaths of ten people. How to build a budget to help you save in 2025 Simultaneously, the Eaton Fire, which was 73% contained as of publication, reduced thousands of structures to ash and rubble further east in the Altadena area after breaking out on the same day as the Palisades Fire. The fires have killed at least 27 people as of Friday and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in the residential enclaves of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. In the wake of the fires, rents have surged and uncertainty over insurance settlements has left some of the displaced in limbo. The Eaton and Palisades fires that erupted last week have collectively burned almost 4 square miles of highly dense parts of Los Angeles, more than double the urban acreage consumed by the region's Woolsey Fire in 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Silvis Lab at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles said Thursday it expects a 'much-needed break from the fire weather concerns' for the end of this week. However, 'next week is a concern,' the weather service said. 'While confident that we will NOT see a repeat of last week, dangerous fire weather conditions are expected,' the NWS in LA added. A moderate red-flag warning is predicted Monday and Tuesday, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said at a news conference.

Can Donald Trump save TikTok ahead of ban?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump could issue an executive order to save TikTok once he's in office, according to reports. In doing so, it would suspend the enforcement of the ban or sale for 60 to 90 days, buying the new administration time to find a solution. The Supreme Court ruled the social media app would be banned in the U.S. on Jan. 19, a day before Trump’s inauguration, unless the Chinese-owned company was sold. Trump tried to ban it during his first term as president but could be changing his tune on the popular video platform. Trump’s goal is 'perhaps to buy himself more time,' political contributor Dr. Lauren Wright, said on 'NewsNation Live Weekend.' 'That's what I would expect the executive order to do.' Lawmakers first proposed a ban in 2023, claiming it poses a national security threat, alleging the Chinese government could be spying on American users. What happens to TikTok and its users after ban starts Sunday? Wright, who teaches courses on the presidency and executive power at Princeton University, said she concurs the app threatens national security. 'Most Republicans agree on that, but young people are not persuaded by that argument. A lot of them found President Trump on the app, and a ton of small businesses use this, in addition to young people who just really like the app and their favorite social media platform,' Wright said. 'Trump sees the benefits of it, and I'm sure he's getting a lot of pressure from Republicans in Congress … about the very real security concerns.' She said it’s a 'no-brainer' that Trump would move to prevent the ban. In recent weeks, a new Chinese-owned app called RedNote has emerged in popularity. 'There are certainly other potential replacements that China is already flooding the marketplace with that would do the same thing,' Wright said. 'But for a lot of Americans who use (TikTok) every day, it's an economic question and a very real annoyance for them.' Kevin O’Leary says he’s offering $20B cash for TikTok Trump issued an executive order in 2020, claiming the app was capturing mass amounts of information about Americans. A judge blocked this under the Biden administration. So can Trump successfully lift the ban this time? 'He certainly has leverage based on how many Americans voted for him last time around, (and) he has the understanding of the app because it helped his campaign a lot,' Wright said. 'He's reportedly said he has a soft spot for it for that reason,' Wright added. 'He has a direct line to the American people. But I really think if he wants TikTok to go away, all Republicans in government, and there are definitely some Democrats on this side of the argument too, need to articulate more clearly to the American people, what are the risks? What is this doing?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tiktok-ban-potential-executive-order/	2025-01-18T10:09:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67632728725895.04797781.jpeg?w=900
How to build a budget to help you save in 2025	(NewsNation) — With 2025 in full swing, there is no better time to start the year off with less financial stress. Thirty-six percent of Americans owe an average of $1,181 in credit card debt from holiday shopping. Crafting a tailored budget to your financial needs is essential to paying off what you owe -- and avoiding interest. NewsNation spoke with a personal financial expert about how to build a budget. How to save for retirement without a 401(k) 5-step process to building a budget Elizabeth Ayoola with NerdWallet, a financial services company, recommends following a five-step process. Determine your after-tax income. Add up all your income, including side gigs, after taxes to know how much you have to work with each month. Choose a budgeting system. This is not a one-size-fits-all, so try different methods to see which one works best for you. Track your progress. Some may struggle with consistency, so tracking your progress is important to achieve your financial goals. NerdWallet suggests using budgeting apps to track expenses. Automate your savings. Set up an automatic deduction from your checking account to your savings account. You can also automate your bills to deduct from your checking account without having to think about it every month. However, NerdWallet cautions against overdraft fees if you don't have enough in the account. Practice budget management. Update your budget as your lifestyle and financial situation change. If you get a new job, get married, lose income sources, or develop a new health condition, you should review and adjust your budget. List: Budgeting apps that can help you get on track Budgeting methods There are different budgeting methods to follow, from the zero-based budget to the pay-yourself-first budget. What works for one person may not work for the next. For the overspender, Ayoola recommends the zero-based budget system, which involves allocating every dollar to something until your balance reaches zero. 'This can be a little bit meticulous, but the good thing about this system is it really helps you to see where every single dollar is going,' Ayoola said. 'The goal is to get to zero at the end of the month and allocate every single dollar that you have, giving it a home, essentially. So it can be good to track spending expenses and see where all your money is going.' For the person who doesn't want to track every dollar: 'They may try the pay-yourself-first method,' Ayoola said. 'Essentially what this is is you pay yourself first. ... and you put money toward savings, and then you can essentially spend the rest on bills and whatever you want.' Other methods include the envelope system, the no-budget budget, and incremental budgeting. IRS to send $2.4B in unclaimed stimulus payments: Who is eligible? Budgeting tools 'Budgeting apps can be extremely helpful because they can help you do everything from start to finish when it relates to budgeting,' Ayoola said. 'If you know that you're more hands-off and you want something that's not too meticulous, you may also consider using budgeting apps.' Budgeting apps allow you to customize your budget, personalize it to your spending and lifestyle, track your net worth, review educational resources, and track expenses. 'These apps will link to your financial institutions for you to see all of your expenses in one place and also group them into different budgeting categories so you get a clearer picture of where all your money is going,' Ayoola said.

US to hit 2 million annual new cancer cases for the first time	(NewsNation) — The number of cancer cases is expected to cross the two million mark in 2024 — the first time — according to estimates by the American Cancer Society. Just over 2 million new cancer cases are projected from 2024 as more than 611,000 deaths occurred last year, according to the American Cancer Society's yearly report, published Friday in its medical journal 'CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.' That equates to 5,500 daily cancer diagnoses, as cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. overall. Although total cancer rates and death counts are down, the cancer incidence rates for common types are rising. Cancer incidence is the number of new cases per year, usually at a rate per 100,000 people, whereas the number of cancer cases is the total number in a population. 'Rising diagnoses of six of the most common cancers (breast, prostate, endometrial, pancreatic, kidney, and melanoma) threaten that longstanding downward trend,' the report said. Experts attribute the overall decline to reductions in smoking, earlier detection, and improved treatment options. Rising cases in younger people, women For a long time, cancer risk increased with age and was more likely to develop in people older than 65. Now, more people between the ages of 50 and 64 are being diagnosed. And for people younger than 50: 'Especially notable is the rise in colorectal cancer diagnoses among people younger than 50,' the study says. 'In the late 1990s, colorectal cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in this age group, and now, it is the first cause of cancer death in men younger than 50 and the second cause in women that age.' Women are facing an increase in cases, particularly with cervical cancer in women 30 to 44 years old and liver cancer, while racial disparities in diagnoses persist. Because it takes years to compile data, researchers still need to analyze how the pandemic affected cancer statistics. 'Researchers expect that the public health crisis of COVID-19 will be found to have delayed diagnoses and led to worse outcomes and more deaths,' researchers said. 'But it will take many years to parse out those effects.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/2-million-new-cases-cancer-2024/	2025-01-18T06:44:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/breast-cancer-AI-e1728571514261.jpg?w=665
Mother of woman killed in Eaton Fire sues California utility	NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The mother of a woman who was killed in the Los Angeles-area Eaton Fire on Friday sued Southern California Edison (SCE) in what may be the first death-related case brought against the electric utility in connection with the disaster. Multiple fires that began to burn and quickly spread across Los Angeles in strong Santa Ana wind gusts last week have killed more than two dozen people and charred some 40,000 acres of the second-largest U.S. metro area. While official investigators have not released the cause of the Eaton Fire near Pasadena, SCE has fielded a growing number of lawsuits accusing the utility's equipment of sparking the initial flames. Altadena resident Evelyn Cathirell sued SCE for wrongful death after the remains of her daughter, Evelyn 'Petey' McClendon were found in their shared home after it was destroyed by the blaze. State Farm cancels Super Bowl ad over California wildfires 'Petey's final hours were filled with chaos and panic,' said the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. 'The surroundings were straight out of a disaster movie with embers blowing freely in the wind, spot fires sprouting up in all directions, and a ceaseless wind.' Cathirell's legal action follows multiple lawsuits filed against SCE this week by residents and business owners with destroyed property. Late Thursday night, attorneys for a woman who lost her home in the Los Angeles-area Eaton Fire filed an emergency request for SCE to preserve additional electrical equipment to be examined in blaze investigations, court filings show. Evangeline Iglesias, who is among those suing SCE after her Altadena home was decimated in the inferno, asked the Los Angeles Superior Court to halt efforts by SCE to destroy some distribution lines and other electrical equipment in the burn area, according to court documents. A spokesperson with SCE said the company is focused on restoring power to affected areas. The company said it is aware of lawsuits related to the Eaton Fire and will review them. SCE, which is the main subsidiary of Edison International, previously said it preserved some power equipment to be examined in fire investigations. Wisdom of a California grandmother, 90, goes viral amid Eaton Fire tragedy The law firm representing Iglesias, Edelson PC, said in the filings that SCE told the firm in letters that it planned to imminently remove physical power infrastructure in the burn area unless told specifically which equipment to keep. That level of specificity, Edelson argued in its emergency request to the court, was unreasonable, 'particularly where most or all of that evidence is owned by SCE and where SCE has unique knowledge of the fire's origin and spread,' the filings showed. Multiple investigations into the cause of the Eaton and Palisades fires -- the two most destructive fires in California -- are ongoing.

Mass deportation raids could start in Chicago as soon as Tuesday:...	CHICAGO - Mass deportation raids threatened in Chicago could start as soon as Tuesday, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming border czar Tom Homan have threatened to begin the raids in Chicago in the lead up to the new administration. According to the Wall Street Journal, four people familiar with the planning said on the day after Trump's inauguration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will send 'between 100 and 200 officers' for the operation. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have said the city's law forbids CPD from coordinating with ICE. Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Transit Authority, the Chicago Park District and Community Colleges of Chicago have all been directed not to allow ICE access into any of its buildings.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/mass-deportation-raids-could-start-in-chicago-as-soon-as-tuesday-report/	2025-01-18T05:39:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/generic-chicago-flag.jpg?w=900
Engineer Tedesco brothers use retrofitted RV to track UAPs	(NewsNation) — Two brothers are using a mobile field lab tricked out with various forms of technology as they seek out more answers about unidentified anomalous phenomena and other objects flying around the sky. John and Gerry Tedesco have transformed a retrofitted RV into a fully functional laboratory that tracks UAPs, aka UFOs, and other objects. The efforts come as lawmakers and U.S. residents remain frustrated by a lack of answers over a series of drone sightings around the country. The brothers use their lab, which they have called 'The Nightcrawler,' to collect data. SpaceX loses spacecraft after catching rocket booster at the launch pad in latest Starship test The Tedesco brothers are both engineers who use The Nightcrawler to report their findings on UAPs to the FBI. The two men were recently summoned to a Long Island airport where a series of drone sightings have been reported around the Francis Gabreski Airport in recent weeks. Watch NewsNation Saturday at 8 p.m. ET for 'HUNTING UFOS: THE CRASH RETRIEVAL' The brothers provided NewsNation with an exclusive look at the Nightcrawler rolling lab, which includes a specialized camera that includes a 36x optical zoom, night vision and other technology, including Geiger counters, G4 sensors and monitors.

They then compare their data to information associated with commercial and private aircraft that may be in the air at the time. The Nightcrawler’s vertical system can reach up to 70,000 feet into the air to track any moving objects in the sky as well as any radioactive particles that may be in the air. The FBI is said to be looking into the data that the brothers have collected about recent sightings. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to deliver a report on drone sightings around the United States over the past few months shortly after taking office next week. Federal agencies had previously said that drones and other objects spotted in the sky were not the property of the U.S. military or other foreign governments.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/tedesco-brothers-rv-track-ufos/	2025-01-17T12:28:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Nightcrawler.jpg?w=900
Trump inauguration moved indoors due to bitter cold forecast	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration has been moved indoors after forecasts showed bitter cold weather expected for Monday, according to NewsNation's partner The Hill. Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will take the oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda as opposed to the usual location at the west front of the Capitol. The forecast for Washington, D.C., shows an expected high in the low 20s on Monday, with a wind chill in the single digits. How to watch Trump’s inauguration on NewsNation That would make it the coldest inauguration on record since President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Reagan also moved his ceremony indoors because of the weather. The change means fewer people will be able to watch the ceremony, which will also be broadcast on TV. On Truth Social, Trump posted that the decision was made because he did not want anyone hurt or injured at the event and said the Capitol One Arena would be open for a live viewing and the inaugural parade. Trump indicated he would join the crowd at the arena for his planned victory rally following his swearing in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-inauguration-indoors/	2025-01-17T09:19:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192426947.jpg?w=900
TikTok ban upheld by Supreme Court	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a law banning TikTok in the United States by Jan. 19 unless it’s sold by Chinese parent company ByteDance. 'There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,' the Supreme Court opinion said. 'But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.' Early in arguments that lasted more than two and a half hours, Chief Justice John Roberts identified his 'main concern': TikTok’s ownership by China-based ByteDance and the parent company's requirement to cooperate with the Chinese government’s intelligence operations. President-elect Donald Trump has indicated he plans to help negotiate a deal to sell the social media platform from ByteDance after his inauguration on Monday. He asked the Supreme Court to pause the ban to give his administration time to negotiate a deal. President Joe Biden said this week he would not enforce a ban if it was upheld. A White House official told NewsNation Thursday, 'it will be up to the next administration to implement.' What happens to your TikTok account? TikTok users who already have the app on their phones will continue to have access to it. But new users won’t be able to download the app and existing ones will no longer be able to receive updates. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings. ByteDance and TikTok have been saying that divestment is not feasible, and that if the ban is allowed to go into effect, the app will effectively go dark. What happens if ByteDance can't find a buyer? If TikTok isn’t sold to an approved buyer, federal law would prohibit app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google, from offering the popular app. It would also bar internet hosting services from hosting TikTok. Why was TikTok facing a ban? President Joe Biden signed a law last April stating that ByteDance, which owns TikTok and is based in China, had a Jan. 19 deadline to sell the platform to an approved buyer or face being banned in the U.S. U.S. officials argued that the vast amounts of user data that TikTok collects, including sensitive information on viewing habits, could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. They were also concerned that the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who could pressure ByteDance to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. TikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. The law came under a larger foreign aid package called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. TikTok has been fighting the law ever since. What did Tiktok say about the ban? TikTok and ByteDance — along with some content creators and users — argued the law violates constitutionally protected free speech rights. 'Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free speech case that matters to so many people,' lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. TikTok said in previous court briefs that a ban 'will silence the speech of applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts and other matters of public concern.' The platform also contends it operates separately from its Chinese parent company and will not be subject to pressure from the American adversary. TikTok embattled in legal challenges all over the world With billions of users spanning the globe, concerns around TikTok have sparked in several countries. The company faces outright or partial bans in at least 20 nations, The New York Times reported. India banned the app in 2020 as tense relations with China exploded into combat along their shared border, the Times reported. Nepal took TikTok offline for nearly a year for not shutting down content the government described as hate speech, according to the Times.

Live updates: Kristi Noem has confirmation hearing; Senate holds ...	South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R), President-elect Trump's pick to head the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is set to appear for her confirmation hearing before a Senate panel on Friday. The purview of DHS involves immigration and federal emergency management — two hot-button topics. Immigration was one of Trump's signature issues and has been a top priority for Republicans in the new Congress, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which falls under DHS, has been in the spotlight since Hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated the southeastern U.S. and historic fires broke out in California. Also on Friday, the Senate is poised to vote on cloture for the Laken Riley Act, an immigration bill that has split Democrats. The measure, named after a Georgia college student who was killed in February by a man who had crossed into the U.S. without permission, would mandate federal detention of immigrants without legal status accused of theft, burglary and other related crimes. It is poised to be the first bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, but has also earned the support of a number of Democrats in both chambers.

Armed California resident keeps watch for looters during wildfire...	(NewsNation) — Officials say they are making progress fighting the Los Angeles-area wildfires that started last week. However, problems still linger, not only for the thousands who have lost everything in the fires but also for those whose homes and businesses are still standing. About 82,000 people are under evacuation orders. Some California residents are defying those orders to protect their property, as well as that of their neighbors. Mel Gibson: They didn’t tell LA firefighters ‘the reservoir is empty’ One woman who talked to NewsNation said she is going into her neighbor's houses and cleaning out refrigerators so they won't smell. Altadena resident EveAnna Manley is keeping herself armed in an attempt to scare looters away. 'To be looting during a natural disaster is the lowest form of human behavior,' Manley said. Manley has a sign in her yard that warns: 'If you are looting, we are shooting.' What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency 'It's a bit of a joke, but it's to remind someone — please don't just steal my freaking Starlink,' Manley told NewsNation. 'I know what the laws are as well, and I'm trying to make sure I'm always legal with my firearm control.' Authorities have made multiple looting arrests. On Monday, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced charges against 10 people in four separate incidents during the wildfires’ onset. Two people were charged with first-degree residential burglary, looting and grand theft for allegedly stealing over $200,000. Security has been heightened in the areas hit by wildfires, with people having to go through several different checkpoints to get through the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/wildfire-looting-residents-fight-back/	2025-01-16T11:56:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25010617515175.jpg?w=900
Drone sightings over Long Island airport spark concerns	(NewsNation) — Repeated drone sightings over a Long Island airport have prompted local law enforcement officials to turn to technology to determine who may be behind the mysterious objects. Officials have reported an unusually high number of drone sightings near Francis Gabreski Airport in Suffolk County in recent weeks. The sightings have taken place in highly sensitive areas, including over runways and in restricted air space. That has prompted investigators to turn to Dedrone, a highly sophisticated detection system that uses radar, cameras and artificial intelligence to pinpoint drones in real time. Watch NewsNation’s TV special: 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' on Saturday, Jan. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. The airport is also home to the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York Air National Guard, which has increased concerns over the sightings. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to make drones a priority, saying he would issue a report on the objects soon after taking office. David Lynch, ‘Twin Peaks’ creator and filmmaker, dies at 78 Christopher Brockmeyer, the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office chief deputy chief, said officials will use the drone detection technology to get to the bottom of the sightings around the airport property. 'We’re going to use that information to potentially go and knock on doors and locate the actual operator and have a conversation as to what they’re doing,' Brockmeyer said. Officials from the airport and the Air National Guard told NewsNation some of the drone sightings involved objects as large as cars. On Christmas Day, officials reported 17 different sightings at the airport.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/drones-long-island-airport/	2025-01-16T11:29:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2189936159_bdca8a-e1734653140947.jpg?w=800
LAFD officials demand chief's ouster for wildfires mismanagement	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley has come under attack for her handling of the deadly wildfires. Several current and former LAFD battalion chiefs and administrators are calling for her retirement. In a scathing five-page letter obtained by NewsNation, the group puts the number of fatalities and the loss of property at Crowley’s feet and says her retirement 'would be best for the citizens of Los Angeles' and members of the department. Crowley told Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass that nearly $18 million in budget cuts within the department’s budget would affect its ability to respond to emergencies. In a memo to the mayor, Crowley wrote that the cuts 'has severely limited the department’s capacity to train for and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires,' NBC Los Angeles reported. UAP whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclusive An LAFD memo shows that Bass had requested an additional $48.8 million in budget cuts and indicated that 16 fire stations would need to close as part of the cuts. In the letter, which was sent on Monday, the group referred to Crowley’s comments regarding budget cuts as 'ill-advised and poorly timed' and took attention away from the efforts being made to control the wildfires, which have claimed at least 25 lives. 'When this incident is over, there will be time for investigations, after action reviews, reflection and of course, finger-pointing and the placement of blame, which apparently you have already started,' the letter states. FILE_4779Download Sources told NewsNation that a group of around 100 fire chiefs and former chiefs have received the letter, as has Crowley. The group wrote that the lack of experience, arrogance and inability to manage and lead the department contributed to its failings in dealing with the Palisades fire. The letter claims Crowley, who took office in March 2022, was aware of LAFD budget issues before taking office. The group of chiefs and former chiefs wrote that Crowley 'went along' with the budget cuts, which are now coming back to haunt the chief. The group blames Crowley for ignoring preventative systems and mechanisms previously put into place to deal with the current wildfires. The letter also blames Crowley for her lack of response in evacuating residents from residential neighborhoods affected by the fires. The chiefs wrote it is LAFD’s responsibility to support and assist with evacuation efforts. That did not happen in this case, the group wrote. 'As harsh as this sounds, the horrific truth is that you and your command staff own this terrible loss of light,' the letter states. Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire? John Knox, a 23-year LAFD veteran who was fired in 2021 for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, told NewsNation that he describes the situation as a 'complete and utter lack of leadership.' Knox told NewsNation that a lack of pre-deployment when the city knew about the looming catastrophe was a failure on the chief’s part. He also said department officials suspended the testing of hydrants due to budget cuts. The letter criticizing the chief's leadership comes as questions continue as to why local reservoirs were empty as firefighters began to battle the sweeping fires. For instance, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which is a 117-million-gallon water resource near Pacific Palisades was empty and undergoing renovations when the fires began. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an investigation into why the reservoir was empty and told reporters that all of the region's reservoirs were operating and full. However, data from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power show that five other reservoirs are currently empty. The reservoir issue has already led to one lawsuit being filed, the Associated Press reported. The group also pointed to several critical issues under Crowley’s watch that the chief has ignored or failed to resolve. Among those were a lack of mechanics and support personnel; multiple lawsuits by females, minorities and command officers related to retaliation, harassment and hostile work environment issues; as well as extreme call load and work issues. The group said Crowley did nothing to put mechanisms in place that dealt with a large exodus of experienced fire service professionals. The letter states that more than 125 senior-level chief officers have retired in the last year. The letter states that many of those who left the department were veterans of wildfires who would have been beneficial in dealing with the current fires burning around Los Angeles County. 'While no one is saying that this fire could have been stopped, there is no doubt among all of us that if you had done things right and prepared the LAFD for an incident of this magnitude, fatalities would have been reduced, and property would have been saved,' the group wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/lafd-chief-attack-deadly-wildfires/	2025-01-16T09:33:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25011203379482.jpg?w=900
Live: Lawmakers host hearing over Trump's 'Remain in Mexico' poli...	(NewsNation) — Less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump is set to enter the White House for his second non-consecutive term, senate lawmakers are hosting a hearing about his controversial 'Remain in Mexico' immigration policy. During his first term, Trump implemented the policy, also called 'Migration Protection Protocols,' which required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their claims were processed. Democratic President Joe Biden's administration ended it in 2022. In the 2024 election, Trump said he plans to reinstate the 'Remain in Mexico' policy and start other hard-line immigration measures such as mass deportations. What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the Republican chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also said he would immediately take up the matter. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing is set to start at 9 a.m. ET. Those testifying include Kenneth Cuccinelli, a former senior official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies and Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight for The Washington Office on Latin America. Lutheran Social Services, an immigration relief and refugee welcome agency, in a statement ahead of the hearing, criticized 'Remain in Mexico' as a stark departure from longstanding U.S. asylum procedures and protections. When it was in effect, 'families and individuals faced dangerous and unsafe conditions, including violence, exploitation, and inadequate essential services like healthcare, education, and housing' in northern Mexico, Lutheran Social Services said. The American Civil Liberties Union challenged 'Remain in Mexico,' saying it left 'vulnerable asylum seekers stranded.' 'The Migration Protection Protocols (MPP) policy was one of the most abusive and egregious of President Trump’s attacks on the asylum system, exposing vulnerable people to violence and murder,' the ACLU said in a statement to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 'The policy was a boon to organized crime in Mexico and inflicted horrendous and lasting harm on asylum seekers, including their minor children.'

Two Americans to be released from Gaza in first phase of ceasefir...	Two Americans, Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, are expected to be released as part of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal that emerged Wednesday after being held for 15-months by Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza, according to a senior administration official. The deal includes the release or older males and those who were wounded on Oct. 7, of which Seigel and Dekel-Chen apply. The first phase in total includes the release of hostages that are women, elderly males and the sick and wounded. The third American being held by Hamas, Edan Alexander, is a 21-year-old American-Israeli who served in the IDF. Uniform soldiers are part of the second phase of the deal. The official said that they spoke with Alexander’s father last night and are committed to getting Edan out. 'We will see — and I don’t want to say until we actually see them — but Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen will come out in the first day and Edan will come out of Gaza, no doubt about it,' the official said. The administration is in regular contact with the families of the Americans being held and are 'committed' to getting them all out, whether they are living or not, according to the official. Wednesday’s deal largely aligns with a multiphase proposal President Biden first put forward in late May, which included the release of American hostages, remains of hostages who were killed and a surge in humanitarian assistance during the first phase. Biden had announced that Americans would be released in the initial six-week phase earlier on Wednesday. 'I’m proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well, and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home,' the president said. The official told reporters that the administration didn’t have full confidence that a deal would come together until 'late this afternoon' in the Middle East, saying that Hamas tried to bring up more issues this morning and the U.S. 'held the line on that.' The official also gave credit to President-elect Trump’s team for their help in the hostage deal negotiations, saying that Biden’s Mideast negotiator Brett McGurk and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff were both pivotal in the 'last 96 hours.' 'Steve and Brett have been talking regularly about the process, Brett has been keeping Steve fully informed,' the official said. When asked if the hostage deal would have happened if Trump wasn’t elected in November, noting that the first group of hostages will be released the day before Trump’s swearing in, officials said 'any negotiation, any breakthrough diplomacy, sometimes we just need a deadline.' Trump on Wednesday claimed the credit for himself, saying a deal would not have happened without his victory in November. Meanwhile, Biden replied, 'Is that a joke?' when asked by a reporter whether he or Trump would get credit for the deal.

Families of hostages grateful but cautious about ceasefire deal	(NewsNation) — With the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal expected to begin Sunday, the families of hostages are hoping to once again see their loved ones in front of them. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal that could see the first release of American hostages within days, as part of a broader agreement to free 33 captives during a 42-day pause in fighting. The deal, which awaits approval from Israel's security Cabinet in a Thursday vote, would include the release of two Americans — Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen — in its first phase, according to a senior administration official. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal Of the seven Americans believed held by Hamas, only three are presumed alive. The third, 21-year-old American-Israeli Edan Alexander, a former IDF soldier, would be part of a second phase of releases. In exchange, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, following a pattern seen in previous hostage negotiations. Phase three calls for the return of the bodies of remaining hostages and the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which is largely devastated and faces decades of rebuilding. After 466 days in captivity, it remains unclear how many of the approximately 100 hostages still held by Hamas are alive. Officials estimate more than a third of all hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack have died. For families of the hostages, the wait continues. While some may soon reunite with their loved ones, others face the grim possibility of receiving confirmation of deaths during captivity.

They have had no word about him whatsoever in the month since their nightmare, and that of the other hostage families, began on October 7. Biden, who has pledged solid support for Israel in its war against Hamas, showed compassion as he spoke to the families for more than an hour and said he is determined to secure the release of the hostages, Ronen Neutra said.

Various commemorations are taking place around Israel to mark the anniversary of the Hamas attacks in Israel. On October 7, 2023, members of Hamas mounted a series of attacks and raids on Israeli citizens in the Gaza Envelope border area of Israel. 251 Israelis and foreigners were kidnapped with nearly 100 still unaccounted for and 1139 people were killed.

(The Hostages Families Forum via AP) Jonathan Dekel-Chen revealed his son Sagui, held captive since Oct. 7, may not even know he has a new daughter, born two months after his capture. 'I simply do not know if Sagui even knows that his family survived the massacre,' Dekel-Chen said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' His 36-year-old son is among those expected to be freed in the first phase of releases. 'I will feel joy when Sagui is able to embrace his little girls,' Dekel-Chen said. The last confirmed proof of life for Sagui came over a year ago, when released hostages reported briefly encountering him wounded but alive in Hamas tunnels beneath Gaza. 'When he does emerge from that ambulance, we will embrace him in all meanings of the word and help him in all ways necessary to rebuild his life,' Dekel-Chen said while tempering his optimism about his son's condition after 466 days in captivity. While grateful for his son's expected release, Dekel-Chen said that many hostages remain in what he called 'hell holes' under Gaza, including 29 from his own Kibbutz Nir Oz. Some of those captives, he learned, were subsequently killed by Hamas. 'We cannot leave a single hostage behind,' he said. What happens to the hostages in Gaza after ceasefire deal? Omer Neutra's parents hope for a 'proper burial' The parents of a deceased American hostage called the ceasefire 'a deal with the devil' while supporting the necessary compromise to bring home the remaining captives. 'This is not a good deal,' said Ronen Neutra, whose 21-year-old son Omer was confirmed dead after 422 days in captivity. 'But on October 7, 2023, they took 250 people out of their beds… and unfortunately, we have to do a deal with the devil.' Omer Neutra, a first responder who rushed to defend Israeli villages during the October attacks, was among the 98 hostages still in Gaza. His parents learned of his death last month after advocating for his release at the Republican National Convention and in meetings with President Joe Biden. His mother, Orna Neutra, described 'mixed emotions' about the agreement. While supporting the deal, the Neutras now fight for a different outcome — the return of their son's body for 'proper burial.' The parents praised the bipartisan cooperation between the outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump's team in securing the agreement. 'There's no daylight between the two teams,' Orna Neutra said, noting both administrations helped push the deal forward.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/families-hostages-ceasefire-deal-reaction/	2025-01-15T16:41:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot_61eeee.jpg?w=900
Whistleblower says UFO retrieval program exists: NewsNation exclu...	(NewsNation) — A U.S. Air Force veteran believes he was involved in the recovery of alien technology while working for a long-rumored secret UFO retrieval program. In an exclusive interview with NewsNation, whistleblower Jake Barber said he has contracted as a helicopter pilot to retrieve all kinds of downed craft, some of which he believes are of nonhuman origin. 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,' Barber told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart. 'It was not human.' Former Navy rear admiral supports UFO whistleblower claims Watch the full interview during NewsNation's TV special: 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower' on Saturday, Jan. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. When asked to describe the object, Barber said: 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' He added: 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.' Other whstleblowers, including Lue Elizondo and David Grusch, have alleged a secret government UFO program exists but Barber says he knows it's true because he's part of it. What we know about UFOs from whistleblowers to secret programs 'Over the last couple years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence) and it was not a unique experience,' Barber said. Three high-level military veterans are backing up Barber's story, on the record and on-camera to NewsNation. NewsNation has also obtained exclusive, never-before-seen video of one of these alleged UFO crash retrievals.

Los Angeles fire captain loses home to Eaton Fire	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — A man tasked with protecting the Los Angeles area from raging wildfires now ranks among those who have lost their homes and everything inside. Capt. Al Hugo, a 32-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department, lived in his Altadena home with his wife, Carmen, for 20 years. As the Eaton Fire ignited on Jan. 7, the fast-moving blaze eventually reached Hugo’s neighborhood. LA-area wildfires: At least 25 have died as winds strengthen He and his wife quickly evacuated with their four dogs, leaving their belongings behind. Although wildfires have threatened his community before, he said the flames had never reached his neighborhood until now. The next day, the family learned their home was completely destroyed by the fire. 'It was surreal,' Hugo told Nexstar's KTLA. 'It's painful because you’ve [spent] a lot of time there. I’ve been there for 20 years so I got a lot of memories and a lot of mementos that we lost, but I’m just thankful that my family and my pets are good.'

Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire?	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump celebrated the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal on Wednesday and said it wouldn't have happened if not for his win in the 2024 election. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.' Israel-Hamas hostage deal The deal, which will see 33 Israeli hostages freed and pause the war, comes after more than 15 months of fighting. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal In his post, Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue 'to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.' Witkoff had joined Biden’s Mideast adviser Brett McGurk for the recent round of talks in Doha, the Qatari capital. A senior U.S. official described McGurk and Witkoff’s coordination as a fruitful partnership, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, outgoing President Joe Biden emphasized his role in getting the deal done, telling reporters: 'This is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May.' When asked how much he credits the Trump team, Biden said: 'I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do.' Israel-Hamas ceasefire comes days before Trump's inauguration The ceasefire comes just days before Trump is set to begin his second term. Last week, Trump warned all hell would break loose if Hamas didn't release the Israeli hostages before his inauguration, though it's unclear how much that threat tipped the scale. What happens to Israeli hostages now? One diplomat who was briefed on the negotiations did credit progress in the talks, in part, to Trump's influence, saying it was 'the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal,' according to the Washington Post. The New York Times said Trump's election win and his team's work were, according to multiple people, a factor in the deal getting done. Jonathan Panikoff, director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told the AP the deal shows how powerful foreign policy can be when it's bipartisan. 'Both the outgoing and incoming administration deserve credit for this deal and it would’ve been far less likely to happen without both pushing for it,' he said. Biden cheered the agreement in remarks Wednesday, chalking it up to 'dogged and painstaking American diplomacy.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next	(NewsNation) —A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was reached Wednesday after more than a year of negotiations and is expected to be carried out in three phases beginning Sunday. Qatar, acting as an intermediary, and President Joe Biden heavily pushed the two sides to reach an agreement that would secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. 'This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,' Biden said in a statement. What happens to Israeli hostages now? Biden said the ceasefire deal was the same one he introduced to both sides in May 2024. 'The road to this deal was not easy,' Biden said during a news conference announcing the deal. 'This is one of the toughest negotiations I’ve ever experienced.' President-elect Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Qatar for discussions. Trump celebrated the deal on Truth Social, taking credit for its success and saying it would not have happened if he had not won in November. Phase one of the ceasefire deal Phase one of the ceasefire deal is expected to take place over a six-week timeframe. Thirty-three Israeli hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas in 2023 will be returned under the first phase of the deal. These hostages include women, children, people over the age of 50 and the sick or injured, which were given special focus under the deal which passed after more than a year of negotiations, Qatar’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Wednesday. In return, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The remaining American hostages are also expected to be released in the initial phase of the ceasefire deal, a U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. Israel, Hamas reach three-phase ceasefire deal Phase one also includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza. Palestinian civilians will be allowed to return to their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, and humanitarian aid will begin to flow into the Strip, Biden said. 'The surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin, and innocent people can have greater access to these vital supplies,' he said. Hamas and Israel will begin negotiations for phase two in these six weeks, he added. There are still a number of negotiations that need to take place before phase two can be mapped out, but if the negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue as long as talks are ongoing, Biden said. Phase two of the ceasefire deal Biden said phase two would be a 'permanent end of the war,' where a temporary ceasefire would become a permanent one. Phase two will consist of the return of the remaining living Israeli hostages, including male soldiers. All remaining Israeli forces would also withdraw from Gaza under this phase, he said. Phase three of the ceasefire deal The third phase is expected to address the handing over of the remaining bodies of dead hostages and the start of Gaza’s reconstruction, according to Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ceasefire-deal-timeline/	2025-01-15T12:04:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/bidenjoe_112624gn16_w.jpg?w=900
Details need to be addressed in Israel-Hamas ceasefire	(NewsNation) — Negotiations involving a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have been ongoing for more than a year, but nearing an actual agreement has never been this close to bringing 15 months of fighting to an end. But before a ceasefire is officially declared, several details still need to be addressed, Ret. U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen, Richard Newton told NewsNation. 'I believe we’re on a path to have at least an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but nothing is final at this point,' Newton, a senior NewsNation contributor, said on Wednesday. What happens to Israeli hostages now? There are still several implementation details to be ironed out before the ceasefire is finalized. This will include exactly how Israeli hostages will be released as well as how Palestinians are released from jail and where they will be sent, Newton said. Other issues include the flow of humanitarian aid and who will control that flow into Gaza. 'There are many details we need to have sorted out here,' Newton said, adding, 'But we are still a long way out from the end of what will be, at least through the first phase of what we think is going to be a deal.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government officials still need to sign off on the ceasefire. Newton said that Netanyahu is 'setting the conditions' for the ceasefire, but that Monday’s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump may have emboldened the prime minister to act. 'The emphasis is on Israel and the emphasis is on who’s leading this effort — not Hamas, but Prime Minister Netanyahu,' Newton said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/details-addressed-israel-hamas-ceasefire/	2025-01-15T11:44:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771c6185c5905.15866153.jpeg?w=900
Biden to outline accomplishments in farewell address	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden is expected to outline the accomplishments of his four years in the White House during a farewell address to the nation Wednesday night. The reported ceasefire announced between Israel and Hamas will most likely change the tenor of the prime-time address, on which White House officials said Biden will work until the last minute to finalize. The speech was originally set to reflect on Biden’s presidency as well as the moment in which the country finds itself as President-elect Donald Trump takes office next week. White House officials said the address will not include 'a laundry list' of Biden’s accomplishments as president but rather an overview of the time since Biden took office in 2021. What happens to Israeli hostages now? In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden said the country has the strongest economy in the world after his administration created a record 16.6 million jobs. He also said inflation continues to come down while the racial cap is the lowest it has been in 20 years. 'I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake,' Biden wrote. 'The very nature of who we are was at stake. And, that’s still the case.' Biden called serving the U.S. for more than 50 years the 'privilege of my life' and wrote he has 'been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.' 'History is in your hands,' Biden wrote. 'The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep the faith and remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there is simply nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.' What to make of the final polling of the Biden years Biden is also expected to address his future plans and those of the Democratic Party, which lost control of the U.S. Senate as well as the White House in November. The Republicans also maintain control of the U.S. House as Trump begins his second term as president. Biden is considering taking additional actions as president before Trump assumes control of the White House on Monday. Biden, who commuted about 1,500 sentences in December, is said to be considering more pardons and executive orders, which could be difficult for Trump to undo once he takes office. Biden issued 39 presidential pardons to Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes; several were issued to people who have already been released from prison. Among the pardons issued was one for Biden’s son, Hunter, who the president previously said he would not pardon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-accomplishments-farewell-address/	2025-01-15T11:02:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192231820.jpg?w=900
Malibu mayor: No expedited re-entry permits for evacuation zones	(NewsNation) — Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart on Facebook debunked a false claim that the city is giving out expedited re-entry permits into evacuation zones as wildfires continue blazing in southern California. At least 25 people have died in the fires that started last week, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service because high winds are expected to cause extreme fire weather. About 88,000 people are under evacuation orders because of the fires. What Trump said he will do on Day 1 'I want to assure you that city staff have been working around the clock alongside our partners to respond to this historic and unprecedented event,' Stewart said in a letter to Malibu residents. This work includes inspecting infrastructure, clearing streets of debris, assisting with damage assessments and stabilizing the area to pave the way for safe re-entry and rebuilding, Stewart said. 'We ask for your patience and understanding as our teams — along with law enforcement, fire crews, and utility providers — continue this vital work,' Stewart said. While some residents have hired private contractors who requested access to the evacuation zones, Stewart said they are not permitted to go in them at this time. 'We urge all residents to adhere to the evacuation orders for their safety and the safety of the crews working in these areas,' he said. 'To our residents, I want to acknowledge the frustration and hardship you are experiencing. Many of you are understandably anxious to return to your homes. We hear you, and we are doing everything in our power to make that happen as quickly and safely as possible.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/malibu-mayor-no-re-entry-permits-evacuation-zones/	2025-01-15T10:39:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25013163967406.jpg?w=900

War between Israel and Hamas On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas took approximately 240 civilians and soldiers hostage during the attack in Southern Israel. Hamas released around 100 hostages during a negotiated pause in fighting. A total of 70 hostages have died, the Wall Street Journal reported. Human rights organizations have warned of a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which has long been blockaded with civilians unable to flee the area. Instead, they are displaced to different parts of the Gaza Strip as Israel has announced evacuation orders in cities and towns prior to military strikes. Israel says 405 soldiers have been killed in the conflict, while Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed. It is not clear how many of those are combatants and how many are civilians.

Rubio to say he'll put US interests 'above all else' at hearing	(NewsNation) — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio will say at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that as part of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, he will place American interests 'above all else.' 'Placing our core national interests above all else is not isolationism,' Rubio will tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. 'It is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our national interest is not some outdated relic.' 'The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us,' Rubio is set to say in the opening statement. What Trump said he will do on Day 1 Rubio's confirmation is expected to go smoother than other Trump cabinet picks such as Fox News host Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, Trump's choice for defense secretary, faced questions over allegations of sexual assault, excessive drinking and his divisive views on women in combat and minorities. On the other hand, Rubio has gotten bipartisan support, including from Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said he plans to vote yes on his nomination. 'I believe Senator Rubio has a thorough understanding of the United States’ role on an international scale, has served with honor on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and is a good choice to lead the State Department,' Durbin said Monday, noting the two share similar views on issues such as the 'continued threat of China' and 'recent sham election in Venezuela.' Born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, Rubio would be the first Latino to serve as Secretary of State if confirmed. While serving in the Florida legislature, Rubio was the first Cuban American to act as the state's speaker of the House. After his election to the U.S. Senate in 2011, Rubio unsuccessfully ran to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016. Although he once had a combative history with Trump, Rubio has since positioned himself as an ally of the president-elect.

Pam Bondi, Trump's AG nominee, faces Senate hearing	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general, will face questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. She is expected to face tough questions about her loyalty to Trump, who has pledged to use the Department of Justice to target his perceived political enemies. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, will likely be one of the most closely watched Cabinet members as Democrats express concerns that Trump may attempt to bend the DOJ to his will. Bondi's hearing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET. Senate hearings are scheduled this week for Trump's picks for more than a dozen top administrative positions. Democrats’ hopes of derailing Trump nominees fading fast Who is Pam Bondi? Bondi was a prosecutor for nearly two decades in the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office before becoming Florida’s first female attorney general in 2010. She served as Florida’s attorney general for eight years. She campaigned for the state’s top legal office by challenging then-President Barack Obama’s signature health care law and calling for her state to adopt Arizona’s controversial 'show me your papers' immigration law. As attorney general in Florida from 2011 to 2019, Bondi was vocal on human trafficking issues and urged tightening state laws against traffickers. After that, she worked as a lobbyist for Ballard Partners. How will the Pentagon change under new Trump administration? In addition, Bondi represented KGL Investment Company KSCC, a Kuwaiti firm also known as KGLI. She lobbied the White House, National Security Council, State Department and Congress on immigration policy, human rights and economic sanctions issues, the Associated Press reported. Sources tell NewsNation that Bondi is trusted by Trump and that she spends time at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Bondi was a senior adviser on Trump’s first impeachment defense team when he was accused in 2020 of abuse of power for allegedly pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Trump was ultimately not convicted.

Border billboards warn against unregulated cabbies, rideshare dri...	SAN DIEGO (Border Report) — Billboards warning people — especially women — not to accept rides from unregulated drivers went up a few weeks ago near the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry. They show a worried woman holding a suitcase while a driver in a parked car extends his arm offering her a ride. The messaging is in Spanish telling people not to accept the rides and not 'to play with their lives.' Since 2023, these drivers, called 'wildcatters,' or raiteros in Spanish, have become entrenched outside pedestrian border crossings. San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, the Metropolitan Transit System and other agencies have launched a public campaign warning people against these 'wildcatters,' calling them 'unregulated and unpermitted ride-sharing services.' 4-year-old migrant found alone at the border reunites with mother After a number of complaints from citizens and cab drivers who say the wildcatters are taking business away from them, Stephan got involved. 'It is simply dangerous and unsafe to have passengers transported in a vehicle that is often uninsured, with an unlicensed driver with an unknown background check,' Stephan said back in November. The billboards themselves have been up for only a few weeks. 'We have received reports of exploitation for human trafficking where vulnerable women are in these cars,' Stephan said. 'Protecting the safety of San Diego County residents, commuters and others who cross the border falls squarely in our mission of preventing crime. We are also working closely with our law enforcement and transportation partners to hold those who are not authorized to offer this type of service accountable for their crimes.' Stephan said the campaign is all about public education and awareness. 'We want to empower passengers to understand the difference between an unlicensed driver and a legitimate taxicab or ride-sharing vehicles,' she said. Offering rides for a fee is against the law and carries penalties. 'It is a misdemeanor that carries jail time and it also carries a fine of up to $500,' Stephan said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-billboards-warn-unregulated-cabbies-rideshare-drivers/	2025-01-15T03:14:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/wildcatter-billboard.png?w=537
Particularly Dangerous Situation' forecast for fire-scarred Los ...	LOS ANGELES (NEXSTAR) — Millions of Southern Californians were on edge as a final round of dangerous fire weather was forecast for the region on Wednesday, along with a rare warning of a 'Particularly Dangerous Situation' for an area near where two massive blazes have killed at least 25 and destroyed thousands of homes. Updates: Containment grows on Palisades, Eaton fires; winds return Disabled Eaton Fire victim escaped deadly flames in wheelchair Firefighters got a reprieve Tuesday when winds were unexpectedly light and they were able to make progress battling the two huge Los Angeles area fires and quickly snuff out several new fires. The Eaton Fire burning just north of Los Angeles and the Palisades Fire that destroyed much of the seaside LA neighborhood of Pacific Palisades broke out Jan. 7 in conditions similar to what’s expected Wednesday. High winds last week pushed flames at remarkable speed and carried fire-sparking embers sometimes miles away. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings – done when temperatures are warm, humidity is low and strong winds are expected – from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. from the Central Coast 275 miles (443 kilometers) south to the border with Mexico. The 'Particularly Dangerous Situation' was in effect for an area that includes parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 'Key message: We are not out of the woods yet,' the weather service said in a post late Tuesday. 'The winds underperformed today, but one more enhancement could happen tonight-tomorrow.' The devastation of the Palisades Fire is seen at sunset in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Ethan Swope) More than 77,000 households were without electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes. A state of alert Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice. They remained vigilant, keeping an eye on the skies and on each other: Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes. Of those, three people were arrested on suspicion of arson after being seen setting small fires that were immediately extinguished, LA Police Chief Jim McDonnell said. One was using a barbecue lighter, another ignited brush and a third tried to light a trash can, he said. All were far outside the disaster zones. Authorities have not determined a cause for any of the major fires. Among nine people charged with looting was a group that stole an Emmy award from an evacuated house, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said. The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds. Now backed by firefighters from other states, Canada and Mexico, crews were deployed to attack flareups or new blazes. The firefighting force was much bigger than a week ago, when the first wave of fires began destroying thousands of homes in what could become the nation's costliest fire disaster. Kaylin Johnson and her family planned to spend the night at their home, one of the few left standing in Altadena, near Pasadena. They intended to keep watch to ward off looting and to hose down the house and her neighbors’ properties to prevent flareups. 'Our lives have been put on hold indefinitely,' Johnson said via text message, adding that they cannot freely come and go because of restrictions on entering the burn areas. 'But I would rather be here and not leave than to not be allowed back at all.' Packed and ready to go Residents said they were ready to make a hasty escape. Javier Vega, who said he feels like he has been 'sleeping with one eye open,' and his girlfriend have planned out how they can quickly pack up their two cats, eight fish and leopard gecko if they get orders to evacuate. 'Typically on any other night, hearing helicopters flying overhead from midnight to 4:00 in the morning, that would drive anyone crazy,' Vega said. But figuring they were helping firefighters to keep the flames from threatening their neighborhood, he explained, 'it was actually soothing for me to go to sleep.' Preparing for another outbreak Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals, while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials who were criticized over their initial response expressed confidence that the region is ready to face the new threat. The mayor said she was able to fly over the disaster areas, which she described as resembling the aftermath of a 'dry hurricane.' Winds this time were not expected to reach the same fierce speeds seen last week but they could ground firefighting aircraft, LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. He urged homeless people to avoid starting fires for warmth and to seek shelter. Wildfires on the rise across LA With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area. Firefighters have jumped on small blazes that popped up, quickly smothering several in Los Angeles county, including a blaze Tuesday evening in the Angeles National Forest. The four largest fires around the nation’s second-biggest city have scorched more than 63 square miles (163 square kilometers), roughly three times the size of Manhattan. Of these, the Eaton Fire near Pasadena was roughly one-third contained, while the largest blaze, in Pacific Palisades on the coast, was far less contained. Searching for victims The death toll is likely to rise, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna. Nearly 30 people were still missing, he said Tuesday. Some people reported as missing earlier have been found. Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. The process of locating and identifying the deceased remains slow, with some of the victims still in the location where they died. In many cases, this is because investigators are still unable to access certain areas due to the dangers left behind by the wildfire, like gas leaks, smoldering debris and unstable structures. Another hurdle for the DME’s office is that normal identification processes, such as visual identification and fingerprinting, may not be available to investigators. Of the 25 deceased, 17 died in the Eaton Fire and 8 in the Palisades Fire. While the medical examiner’s office has publicly identified several of the victims, the others have been identified by family members or friends.

Wildfire smoke's long-term health effects, explained	(NewsNation) — Fires in the Los Angeles area have stretched across tens of thousands of acres, spreading smoke and ash throughout Southern California. Breathing in smoke, which contains tiny particles called PM2.5, can spread chemicals, dust, soot and metals throughout the human body. In short doses, smoke exposure has been linked to premature death, hospital admissions, bronchitis, asthma attacks and other respiratory and cardiac problems, the California Air Resources Board said. And long-term exposure can cause another host of issues, Dr. Lipi Roy tells NewsNation. How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke Wildfire smoke's long-term health effects Roy warned that long-term exposure can lead to dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and lung cancer, among other diseases. The World Health Organization associates 7 million premature deaths annually to indoor and outdoor air pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency says there aren't enough studies to accurately link long-term wildfire smoke exposure over multiple seasons to specific diseases, though short-term and cumulative short-term exposure can cause myriad problems. Los Angeles wildfire survivors describe ‘hellscape’ they left behind Smoke exposure can especially pose a problem when the smoke comes from urban areas with more than just vegetation to burn, Roy said. 'Houses have paint, rubber, metal, steel. When those burn, they release really toxic fumes and ash,' Roy explained. Particle pollution also triggers asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes and can cause death, according to the American Lung Association. People at the highest risk — children, the elderly, those with respiratory or heart conditions and people with compromised immune systems — may experience more severe effects, such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, fatigue and/or chest pain. How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke The best way to protect yourself from wildfire smoke is to get far away from the source. If movement isn’t an option, it’s best to stay indoors and limit any outdoor activity. Inside, make sure your doors and windows are tightly closed and sealed. An air filter or HVAC system with air filters can help maintain healthy indoor air quality, and portable air purifiers can help, as well, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s important to run your fan the entire time; otherwise, the air will only be filtered when cooling. If your system operates using a fresh air intake, close it. If you have to stay outside, wearing an N95 respirator mask and taking frequent breaks is crucial for your well-being.

Jay Leno feeds LA’s first responders: ‘They’re great men and wome...	(NewsNation) — Comedian Jay Leno's goal is simple: Feed the people who are 'there to save your life' amid raging fires in the Los Angeles area. The legendary late night talk show host, 74, cooked up more than $21,000 worth of ribs, chicken and more for the first responders who spent the past week battling flames in Southern California. 'My God, these guys can eat. They went through the whole thing. We need more food,' Leno said. 'So we got more food today. Got more food tomorrow, more food Thursday.' LA wildfire victims contend with price-gouged rental prices Leno likened the Los Angeles Fire Department's setup to a 'military operation,' commending their ability to work tirelessly, even as flames turn the area into a 'war zone.' 'Everybody thinks Malibu is heaven, but you have heaven and hell, literally, on the same street,' Leno said. 'Over here, there's nothing, and over here, it's just the chimneys that are standing.' Sitting in front of his vintage fire truck, Leno told 'CUOMO' on Tuesday that he's seen an unparalleled sense of community and care among Californians during the tragedy. LA wildfires arson suspect reportedly entered US illegally 'It doesn't matter what sign you have on your lawn. You know, it's come down to neighbors caring for one another,' Leno said. 'I haven't heard one political opinion. I just heard people ask, 'How can we save this?'' he added. At least 24 people have died in the wildfires. As of Tuesday, AccuWeather estimates the total damage and economic loss from the fires could be $135-150 billion and Poweroutage.us shows at least 85,000 people across California are without power.

A look at the terms — and tensions — in the Israel-Hamas draft ce...	CAIRO (AP) — If the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal goes according to the current draft, then fighting will stop in Gaza for 42 days, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed. In this first phase Israeli troops will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as stepped-up aid flows in. The question is if the ceasefire will survive beyond that first phase. That will depend on even more negotiations meant to begin within weeks. In those talks, Israel, Hamas, and the U.S, Egyptian and Qatari mediators will have to tackle the tough issue of how Gaza will be governed, with Israel demanding the elimination of Hamas. Without a deal within those 42 days to begin the second phase, Israel could resume its campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas – even as dozens of hostages remain in the militants’ hands. Hamas has agreed to a draft of the ceasefire deal, two officials confirmed, but Israeli officials say details are still being worked out, meaning some terms could change, or the whole deal could even fall through. Here is a look at the plan and potential pitfalls in the draft seen by the Associated Press. Swapping hostages for imprisoned Palestinians During the first phase, Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. By the end of the phase, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed. Some 100 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. On the first official day of the ceasefire, Hamas is to free three hostages, then another four on the seventh day. After that, it will make weekly releases. Which hostages and how many Palestinians will be released is complicated. The 33 will include women, children and those over 50 — almost all civilians, but the deal also commits Hamas to free all living female soldiers. Hamas will release living hostages first, but if the living don’t complete the 33 number, bodies will be handed over. Not all hostages are held by Hamas, so getting other militant groups to hand them over could be an issue. In exchange, Israel will free 30 Palestinian women, children or elderly for each living civilian hostage freed. For each female soldier freed, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 serving life sentences. In exchange for bodies handed over by Hamas, Israel will free all women and children it has detained from Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Dozens of men, including soldiers, will remain captive in Gaza, pending the second phase. Israeli pullbacks and the return of Palestinians During the proposed deal's first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a kilometer (0.6 miles) wide inside Gaza along its borders with Israel. That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza’s population driven into massive, squalid tent camps, Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes, even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel’s campaign. But there are complications. During the past year of negotiations, Israel has insisted it must control the movement of Palestinians to the north to ensure Hamas does not take weapons back into those areas. Throughout the war, the Israeli military has severed the north from the rest of Gaza by holding the so-called Netzarim Corridor, a belt across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. That allowed them to search people fleeing from the north into central Gaza and bar anyone trying to return. The draft seen by the AP specifies that Israel is to leave the corridor. In the first week, troops would withdraw from the main north-south coastal road — Rasheed Street — which would open one route for Palestinians returning. By the 22nd day of the ceasefire, Israeli troops are to leave the entire corridor. Still, as talks continued Tuesday, an Israeli official insisted the military will keep control of Netzarim and that Palestinians returning north would have to pass inspections there, though he declined to provide details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed negotiations. Working out those contradictions could bring frictions. Throughout the first phase, Israel will retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the strip of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, including the Rafah Crossing. Hamas dropped demands that Israel pull out of this area. Humanitarian aid In the first phase, aid entry to Gaza is to be ramped up to hundreds of trucks a day of food, medicine, supplies and fuel to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. That is far more than Israel has allowed in throughout the war. For months, aid groups have struggled to distribute to Palestinians even the trickle of aid entering Gaza because of Israeli military restrictions and rampant robberies of aid trucks by gangs. An end to fighting should alleviate that. The need is great. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant among Palestinians, crammed into tents and short on food and clean water. Hospitals have been damaged and short of supplies. The draft deal specifies that equipment will be allowed in to build shelters for tens of thousands whose homes were destroyed and to rebuild infrastructure like electricity, sewage, communications and road systems. But here, too, implementation could bring problems. Even before the war, Israel has restricted entry of some equipment, arguing it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. Another Israeli official said arrangements are still being worked out over aid distribution and cleanup, but the plan is to prevent Hamas from having any role. Further complicating matters, Israel's government is still committed to its plan to ban UNRWA from operating and to cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. The UN agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The second phase If all of that works out, the sides must still tackle the second phase. Negotiations over it are to begin on Day 16 of the ceasefire. Phase two's broad outlines are laid out in the draft: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues. Israel has said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated and it cannot rearm — ensuring Hamas no longer runs Gaza. Hamas says it will not hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from everywhere in Gaza. So the negotiations will have to get both sides to agree to an alternative for governing Gaza. Effectively, Hamas has to agree to its own removal from power — something it has said it is willing to do, but it may seek to keep a hand in any future government, which Israel has vehemently rejected. The draft agreement says a deal on the second phase must be worked out by the end of the first. Pressure will be on both sides to reach a deal, but what happens if they don’t? It could go in many directions. Hamas had wanted written guarantees that a ceasefire would continue as long as needed to agree on phase two. It has settled for verbal guarantees from the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Israel, however, has given no assurances. So Israel could threaten new military action to pressure Hamas in the negotiations or could outright resume its military campaign, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened. Hamas and the mediators are betting the momentum from the first phase will make it difficult for him to do that. Relaunching the assault would risk losing the remaining hostages — infuriating many against Netanyahu — though stopping short of destroying Hamas will also anger key political partners. The third phase is likely to be less contentious: The bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a 3- to 5-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/ap-a-look-at-the-terms-and-tensions-in-the-israel-hamas-draft-ceasefire-deal/	2025-01-14T18:23:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67871caf070ef3.61325871.jpeg?w=900
Biden to lift Cuba terrorism designation, reversing Trump decisio...	The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it will remove Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism (SST) in exchange for the release of political prisoners jailed for protesting against the regime in July 2021. The Trump administration placed the SST designation on Cuba in the last week of the president-elect's first term, and Biden officials said they are in contact with the Trump transition team over their action. 'This issue is among the issues on which they've been in communication,' a senior administration official said in a call with reporters. The administration, required by law, is notifying Congress of the decision, allowing them to review it, although there’s little that lawmakers can do to block the lifting of the designation. Cuban officials had fought tooth and nail for removal from the SST list throughout President Biden’s term, but had generally not received much buy-in from administration officials. Officials briefing reporters on Tuesday said that the U.S. constantly reviews SST designations, and, in the case of Cuba, the administration does not have information supporting it being a state sponsor of terrorism. They added that the U.S. had received numerous diplomatic requests for the designation to be lifted. This includes from Colombia, a senior administration official said, where officials noted 'positive role that Cuba has made in the Colombian peace talks.' 'We believe these actions will be broadly well received in the region and beyond,' said a second administration official, adding other countries supporting the move include Brazil, Chile, Spain and Canada, as well as the European Union. Administration officials also noted a critical role played by the Catholic Church. 'We have been in close coordination with a range of actors, including the Catholic Church, to create an improved environment in Cuba,' the official said. Biden on Saturday also awarded Pope Francis the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, and made him the first person to receive the added commendation of 'with distinction' from the president. The U.S. is lifting the SST designation and taking additional relief actions on Cuba as goodwill actions to facilitate the release of unjustly detained individuals. The administration said they understand the Catholic Church has been in dialogue with the Cuban government 'to undertake a set of actions that will allow for the humanitarian release of a significant number of political prisoners in Cuba and those who have been detained unjustly.' Amnesty International estimates that Cuba has jailed 671 people for taking part in protests in July 2021. 'We do anticipate that these releases will happen very soon, and we do anticipate that there will be people who are released from detention in Cuba before the end of the Biden administration on January 20,' one senior administration official told reporters. The Biden administration is taking two other actions to incentivize Cuba’s release of political prisoners. This includes Biden blocking U.S. nationals or other individuals to bring claims in U.S. courts over property confiscated by the Cuban Revolution, issuing a waiver for Title III of the Helms Burton Act Biden is also rescinding a Trump-era sanctions policy against Cuba, called 'National Security Presidential Memorandum 5,' ending restrictions on financial transactions with certain Cuban entities. 'The principal impact of this rescission is that it will eliminate the so-called restricted list, which is the list of certain entities in Cuba that are subject to certain prohibited financial transactions,' the administration official said. Biden’s last minute removal of Cuba from the list mirrors Trump’s 2021 move to designate the island a state sponsor of terrorism, with both U.S. presidents leaving behind a political hot potato for their 2020 opponent in their final days in office. Trump left Biden with the dubious choice of either giving the appearance of siding with the Cuban communist regime, or leaving the designation and further depressing Cuba’s economy, a major factor behind emigration from the island. Now Trump will have to make the opposite choice, either taking a hardline approach and dealing with potential Cuban migration or letting Biden’s decision congeal. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, introduced legislation in February 2023 that would prevent Cuba’s removal from the SST list until democratic elections are held in the country, a transition government is in power and all political prisoners are released. Rubio will sit for a confirmation hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday where he is likely to face questions from his colleagues over whether the Trump administration will maintain Biden’s actions or reverse them. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a Tuesday statement that he would work to reverse Biden's decision. 'Today’s decision is unacceptable on its merits. The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision,' Cruz said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-to-lift-cuba-terrorism-designation-reversing-trump-decision-in-final-week-in-office/	2025-01-14T12:21:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Biden-Trump_Evan-VucciandManuel-Balce-CenetaAP.png?w=900
LA wildfires arson suspect reportedly entered US illegally	(NewsNation) — An alleged arson suspect connected to the California wildfires entered the country illegally from Mexico, officials said in a statement. Police had been questioning the involvement of Juan Manuel Sierra-Leyva, 33, in starting a fire that may have contributed to the wildfires. Sierra-Leyva is a 'Mexican national who entered the U.S. unlawfully at an unknown date and location without inspection by an immigration official,' a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement read. How do wildfires start, and how long do they last? The man was allegedly chased and apprehended by residents of Woodland Hills after they saw him setting fire to old Christmas trees and debris with what one resident described as a 'flamethrower' soon after the massive wildfire began Thursday, the New York Post reported. Sierra-Leyva has had multiple encounters with law enforcement since November 2016 for a variety of charges, ICE stated.

Dementia cases expected to double by 2060: Study	Dementia cases in the U.S. are expected to double by 2060 when around 1 million Americans are projected to develop the memory-losing condition every year, according to a new study that was published Monday in the medical journal Nature Medicine. The study found that the risk of developing dementia after turning age 55 is around 42 percent. Dementia is a group condition that includes loss of concentration, judgment and memory. Princess Kate in remission from cancer The collaborative study was funded by the National Institutes of Health to NYU Langone. It relied on the data garnered from the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study, which began in 1987 and has tracked the cognitive function and vascular health of participants. 'Our study results forecast a dramatic rise in the burden from dementia in the United States over the coming decades, with one in two Americans expected to experience cognitive difficulties after age 55,' said Josef Coresh, the study’s senior investigator and epidemiologist. The researchers discovered that a lifetime risk of suffering from dementia for men after turning 55 is 35 percent while it is 48 percent for women. For the most part, the higher risk among women is because of their lower death rates, according to researchers. The study also found those who had a variant of the APOE4 gene are at a higher risk of developing dementia. How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke Blood pressure control and preventing diabetes are one of the ways to slow down cognitive decline and prevent dementia, according to researchers. 'The pending population boom in dementia cases poses significant challenges for health policymakers in particular, who must refocus their efforts on strategies to minimize the severity of dementia cases, as well as plans to provide more healthcare services for those with dementia,' Coresh said. A study from September last year found nearly one in five dementia cases are linked to vision impairment, suggesting that diagnosis rates could drop with more sufficient eye health.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/dementia-cases-2060-study/	2025-01-14T11:19:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AlzheimersGettyImages-1125084447.jpg?w=900

Aerial footage of the area captured by NewsNation affiliate KTLA's Sky5 on Monday showed more than a dozen investigators riding and walking the area, presumably looking for an ignition point for the Palisades Fire.

(KTLA)An area along the Temescal Ridge trail cordoned off by yellow crime scene tape seen from Sky5 on Jan. 13, 2025. (KTLA) One area along the route, around several rock formations and near a visible burn scar, was cordoned off with yellow crime scene tape, footage showed. While the cause of the fire and its starting point remain under investigation, the general area around Skull Rock was the site of a small New Year’s Eve brush fire, reportedly ignited by fireworks, that burned for several hours before being extinguished by a water-dropping helicopter, the Los Angeles Times reported. (A nearby resident also told The New York Times that he observed a haze over that area — though no flames — on Jan. 7, but doubted that any brush from the New Year's Eve fire could still be smoldering.) Because the location is frequented by the public, sources familiar with the investigation told the L.A. Times it’s possible the Palisades Fire started in the same spot, and added that 'it appears to have human origins,' though the investigation is in its early stages. Mother of former child star killed in Palisades Fire speaks on devastating loss Investigators are likely looking into whether the Palisades Fire could have been a rekindling of the alleged fireworks-related fire on New Year’s Eve as well as scorched power-line poles in the area. 'There’s been no definitive determination that it is arson at this point, but we are looking at every angle,' LAPD Asst. Chief Dominic Choi said, as reported by the L.A. Times. Historic Powerball winner reportedly loses Malibu home in Palisades Fire As of Cal Fire’s latest update at 5:30 p.m., the Palisades Fire, which has claimed the lives of eight people and destroyed at least 10,000 structures, is 23,713 acres and 14% contained.

LA wildfire victims contend with price-gouged rental prices	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles County residents displaced by the deadly wildfires are now contending with another obstacle in trying to find a new place to live: Rising rental prices that, in some cases, are illegal. Price gouging on rental properties and other necessities such as food and other household items has drawn the attention of the California Attorney General’s Office, which told the media outlet LAist that the state bans price gouging. Under state law, price gouging occurs when the normal price of an item or service rises by more than 10%. But, the attorney general says that existing laws banning price-gouging haven't kept some landlords from spiking their rentral price asks. School funding a ‘guarantee’ amid LA closures: State superintendent But in the wake of the wildfires that have displaced tens of thousands of local residents, rental prices around the region have jumped considerably. The New York Times reported that a recent review of rental properties showed increases ranging from 15% to 64%. One listing for a Bel Air home was listed at $29,500 per month, which was previously listed at $15,900. Los Angeles real estate agent Nikko Santo Pietro told NewsNation on Monday, says that the wildfires have brought out the best and worst of people. The latter includes some landlords charging 'astronomical' rents. 'It's inhumane, it's not right morally,' he said. The realtor said the matter is currently a 'gray area' as real estate professionals await word from the Department of Real Estate and from Bonda's office. California Attorney General Rob Bonta told the outlet that anyone noticing price gouging should immediately report it to his office’s website. 'If prices look really out of whack — if they look like they've increased from what you're used to — report it to us,' Bonta told the website. 'We'll take it from there. We'll evaluate it. We'll hold folks accountable and enforce if necessary.' Other officials have spoken out to landlords who have spiked the price of their properties. 'This is absolutely unacceptable and illegal to do in the face of this horrible tragedy,' State Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin said at a news conference Sunday, according to NBC News. In California, a database of areas designated as being hit by disasters is available and includes a designation stating that price gouging is illegal in these areas. Among the affected areas are communities ravaged by the wildfires in which at least 26,000 people have applied for disaster relief funds. President Joe Biden announced on Monday that victims of the wildfires will receive a one-time payment of $770 to purchase basic necessities after being displaced. But the jump in rental costs around Los Angeles County is not exclusive to the wildfires, National Housing Law Project attorney Natalie Maxwell told USA Today. Maxwell said that her office sees people taking advantage of disasters as a way of an 'opportunity to make additional money.' Firefighters deploy as strong winds threaten more LA neighborhoods 'We see that over and over,' Maxwell said. USA Today reported that California Penal Code 396 specifically prohibits landlords from evicting tenants to offer the property up at a higher price to someone else. The law is also the statute that defines price gouging as anything that is more than 10% higher than the normal price. The law went into effect when California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and covers a range of goods and services. Yet, with so many people seeking shelter in the wake of the wildfires, The New York Times reports some people won’t allow the price of moving in from doing so. 'There will be a desperation on the part of folks who will need housing, and an opportunity for property owners to take advantage of that,' Rachel Bogardus Drew, senior research director at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable-housing nonprofit, told The New York Times. However, landlords who are found guilty of price-gouging face up to a year in jail and fines, Bonta told the BBC. 'This is California law [and] it's in place to protect those suffering from a tragedy,' Bonta said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/wildfire-victims-price-gauged-rental/	2025-01-14T10:08:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192687291.jpg?w=900
Pete Hegseth faces fiery confirmation hearing for defense secreta...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is heading into a potentially explosive Senate confirmation hearing. Hegseth, a former TV show host and military veteran, will answer questions about allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking, as well as his views on the current state of the U.S. military. The hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee is set to start at 9:30 a.m. ET. It's the start of a weeklong marathon as senators begin scrutinizing Trump’s choices for more than a dozen top administrative positions. The Republican-led Senate is rushing to have some of Trump’s picks ready to be confirmed as soon as Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, despite potential opposition to some from both sides of the aisle. Hegseth to answer assault allegations Hegseth, 44, could be confirmed as defense secretary with only Republican support, but he can't afford to lose more than three Republican votes if his nomination moves to the full Senate. A major issue surrounding his confirmation involves allegations of sexual assault. While Hegseth was never charged, the alleged victim, who organized a Republican women’s event, claims they met in a hotel room in 2017, where Hegseth allegedly took her phone and refused to let her leave. Jack Smith: Evidence could have convicted Trump in Jan. 6 case A nurse who saw the alleged victim days later stated the woman requested a sexual assault exam and recalled little of the night but believed her drink may have been spiked. Hegseth’s attorney has confirmed he paid the accuser to avoid a lawsuit. Sen. Joni Ernst a must-watch at Hegseth hearing Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a veteran and sexual assault survivor, could play a pivotal role in Tuesday’s hearing. Ernst has met with Hegseth twice and described the discussions as productive. Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, both sides spoke about the significance of the event. The hearing is expected to address several topics, including Hegseth’s past comments opposing women in combat roles and accusing the military of being 'woke.' What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency Although he has since walked back some of those comments, emphasizing the contributions of women in the military, a report last month detailed concerns from Fox News employees about Hegseth’s drinking habits. He has vowed not to drink if confirmed. If appointed, Hegseth would lead the Department of Defense, the federal government’s largest employer, overseeing 3.4 million service members and civilians with an annual budget of approximately $850 billion.

Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a Gaza ceasefire and the...	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas has accepted a draft agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages, two officials involved in the talks said Tuesday. Mediator Qatar said Israel and the Palestinian militant group were at the 'closest point' yet to sealing a deal. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed agreement, and an Egyptian official and a Hamas official confirmed its authenticity. An Israeli official said progress has been made, but the details are being finalized. The plan would need to be submitted to the Israeli Cabinet for final approval. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end the 15-month war and secure the release of dozens of hostages captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered it. Some 100 people are still captive inside Gaza, and the military believes at least a third them are dead. Any deal is expected to deliver a pause in fighting and bring Israel and Hamas a step closer to winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought, a conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. It would bring relief to the hard-hit Gaza Strip, where Israel's offensive has reduced large areas of the territory to rubble and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of whom are at risk of famine. Meanwhile, dozens of Israeli hostages would be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity. Officials have have expressed optimism before, only for negotiations to grind to a halt. But they are now suggesting that they can conclude an agreement ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose Mideast envoy has joined the negotiations. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said at a weekly briefing Tuesday that the ongoing negotiations were productive, while declining to get into the details. 'Today, we are at the closest point ever to having a deal,' he said. Hamas, meanwhile, said in a statement that the ongoing negotiations had reached their 'final stage.' In the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250. Around half those hostages were freed during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israeli strikes across Gaza overnight and into Tuesday killed at least 18 Palestinians, including two women and four children, according to local health officials, who said one of the women was pregnant and that the baby died as well. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. A three-phase agreement The three-phase agreement — based on a framework laid out by U.S. President Joe Biden and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council — would begin with the gradual release of 33 hostages over a six-week period, including women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Among the 33 would be five female Israeli soldiers, each of whom would be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 convicted militants who are serving life sentences. The Israeli official said Israel assumes most of the 33 are still alive. During this first, 42-day phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from population centers, Palestinians would be allowed to start returning to their homes in northern Gaza and there would be a surge of humanitarian aid, with some 600 trucks entering each day. Details of the second phase still must be negotiated during the first. Those details remain difficult to resolve — and the deal does not include written guarantees that the ceasefire will continue until a deal is reached. That leaves the potential for Israel to resume its military campaign after the first phase ends. The Israeli official said 'detailed negotiations' on the second phase will begin during the first. He said Israel will retain some 'assets' throughout the negotiations, referring to a military presence, and would not leave the Gaza Strip until all the hostages are back home. The three mediators have given Hamas verbal guarantees that negotiations will continue as planned and that they will press for a deal to implement the second and third phases before the end of the first, the Egyptian official said. The deal would allow Israel throughout the first phase to remain in control of the Philadelphi corridor, the band of territory along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas had initially demanded Israel withdraw from. Israel would pull out from the Netzarim Corridor, a belt across central Gaza where it had sought a mechanism for searching Palestinians for arms when they return to the territory's north. In the second phase, Hamas would release the remaining living captives, mainly male soldiers, in exchange for more prisoners and the 'complete withdrawal' of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to the draft agreement. Hamas has said it will not free the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the past vowed to resume fighting until Hamas’ military and governing capabilities are eliminated. Unless an alternative government for Gaza is worked out in those talks, it could leave Hamas in charge of the territory. In a third phase, the bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a three- to five-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision. Growing pressure ahead of Trump's inauguration Israel and Hamas have come under renewed pressure to halt the conflict in the lead-up to Trump's inauguration next week. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, recently joined U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators in the Gulf country’s capital, Doha. Trump said late Monday that a ceasefire was 'very close.' 'I understand ... there’s been a handshake and they are getting it finished -- and maybe by the end of the week,' he told the American cable channel Newsmax. Hamas has blamed Israel for the repeated setbacks in the negotiations, saying that on more than one occasion, the militant group had accepted a proposal from mediators only to see Israel reject it or launch a new military operation immediately afterwards. Israel and its close ally the United States have blamed setbacks on Hamas. ___ This story has been updated to correct that some 100 people are still being held captive in Gaza, including foreign nationals, not 100 Israelis. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Jack Smith: Evidence could have convicted Trump in Jan. 6 case	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Special counsel Jack Smith, who investigated Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, said in a new report that he believes the evidence against the president-elect was enough to convict him had he not won the 2024 election. 'Indeed, but for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the presidency, the office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,' Smith wrote in the 137-page report. The report, arriving just days before Trump returns to office on Jan. 20, focuses fresh attention on his frantic but failed effort to cling to power in 2020. Special counsel defends prosecuting Trump Smith defended his prosecution of the president-elect in the report, stating his team 'stood up for the rule of law' and said they set an example to fight for justice. Smith alleged that then-President Trump knowingly spread false claims of election fraud, claiming Trump weaponized those lies to try to stay in power. 'The throughline of all of Mr. Trump’s criminal efforts was deceit — knowingly false claims of election fraud — and the evidence shows that Mr. Trump used these lies as a weapon to defeat a federal government function foundational to the United States’ democratic process,' the report states. What Project 2025 says about the first 180 days of a presidency The special counsel also detailed how Trump allegedly used his status on social media to target witnesses, courts and U.S. Department of Justice employees, adding his office had to protect witnesses from threats and harassment. 'A significant challenge that the office faced after Mr. Trump's indictment was his ability and willingness to use his influence and following on social media to target witnesses, courts and department employees,' the report states. Read the full report: Trump slams Smith's report Trump responded early Tuesday on his Truth Social platform, calling Jack Smith 'deranged' and claiming he was 'totally innocent': 'Deranged Jack Smith was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his 'boss,' Crooked Joe Biden, so he ends up writing yet another 'Report' based on information that the Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs ILLEGALLY DESTROYED AND DELETED, because it showed how totally innocent I was, and how completely guilty Nancy Pelosi, and others, were. Jack is a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide. THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN!!!' The president-elect promised to fire Smith when he returned to the White House. Smith submitted his report to the DOJ on Jan. 7 and resigned as special counsel on Jan. 10. David Weiss condemns pardon, defends record in Hunter Biden prosecution report Trump had been indicted in August 2023 on charges of working to overturn the election, but the case was delayed by appeals and ultimately significantly narrowed by a conservative-majority Supreme Court, which held for the first time that former presidents enjoy sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. Though Smith sought to salvage the indictment, the team dismissed it entirely in November because of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.

Strong winds forecast for LA threaten wildfire fight	LOS ANGELES (NEXSTAR) — Additional water tankers and scores of firefighters have arrived in the Los Angeles area ahead of fierce winds that were forecast to return and threaten the progress made so far on two massive infernos that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Firefighters give behind-the-scene look at heroic battle with Eaton Fire Crews stop forward progress of fast-moving brush fire in Ventura County On Monday, planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals, while crews and fire engines were being placed near particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush. Dozens of water trucks rolled in to replenish supplies after hydrants ran dry last week when the two largest fires erupted. Tabitha Trosen and her boyfriend said she feels like they are 'teetering' on the edge with the constant fear that their neighborhood could be the next under threat. The facade of the Altadena Community Church stands amidst damage from the Eaton Fire on Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, in Altadena, Calif. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) 'Our cats are ready to go, we have their carriers by the door prepped with their little stuffed animals and things like that,' Trosen said, adding that she's packed things as she thinks about what she could lose. 'It’s like, how do I take care of myself, and what are the things that will ground me as a human and remind me of my background and my life and my family.' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials — who have faced criticism over their initial response to fires that began last week — expressed confidence Monday that the region was ready to face the new threat with additional firefighters brought in from around the U.S., as well as Canada and Mexico. 'We’re absolutely better prepared,' LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said when asked what will be different from a week ago, when hurricane-force winds propelled multiple fires across the parched, brush-filled region that hasn’t seen rain in more than eight months. There have been more than a dozen wildfires in Southern California since Jan. 1, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area. The latest started late Monday in a dry riverbed in Oxnard, about 55 miles (about 89 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, and was burning in an agricultural area. Live footage from AlertCalifornia showed flames of the Auto Fire spreading near the River Ridge Golf Course around 8 p.m. Although no residential structures are within the evacuation zone, Ventura County spokesperson Andrew Dowd said 'Anyone in and around the river bottom needs to get to a safe location.' The winds are predicted to pick up starting early Tuesday and continue through midday Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. They are not expected to reach hurricane-force like last week, but could ground firefighting aircraft, Marrone said, warning if winds reach 70 mph (112 kph), 'it’s going to be very difficult to contain that fire.' Fire officials advised residents in high-risk areas to just leave home – and not wait for formal evacuation orders -- if they sense danger. That’s exactly what Tim Kang of La Crescenta did last Wednesday. Feeling sick from the smoky air and fearful of nearby fires spreading, Kang and his brothers packed up and have stayed away from their neighborhood. 'Everything just felt like, ‘Oh man, the world’s ending,’' said Kang, who's staying with his girlfriend in Pasadena. In less than a week, four fires around the nation’s second-biggest city have scorched more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), roughly three times the size of Manhattan. The National Weather Service warned the weather will be 'particularly dangerous' on Tuesday, when wind gusts could reach 65 mph (105 kph). A large part of Southern California around Los Angeles is under this extreme fire danger warning through Wednesday, including densely populated Thousand Oaks, Northridge and Simi Valley. The Eaton Fire near Pasadena is roughly one-third contained, while the largest blaze in Pacific Palisades on the coast is far less contained. Search for victims continues The death toll is likely to rise, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Monday. At least two dozen were missing, he said. Luna said he understands that people are eager to return to their homes and neighborhoods to survey the damage, but he asked for their patience. 'We have people literally looking for the remains of your neighbors,' he said. At a Monday evening community meeting about the Palisades Fire, a Los Angeles Police Department official said many people reported as missing had been found. It wasn’t clear if there was overlap in the numbers shared by the sheriff. Checking on their homes The slower winds over the weekend allowed some people to return to previously evacuated areas. Many had no idea if their homes or neighborhoods were still standing. Jim Orlandini, who lost his hardware store in Altadena, a hard-hit neighborhood next to Pasadena, said his home of 40 years survived. 'The whole time I was thinking, I don’t know what I’m going to find when I get back here and after 40 years, you know, you got a lot of stuff you forget about that would disappear if the house burned down. So we’re thankful that it didn’t.' Warnings to stay out of disaster zones LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from burned neighborhoods filled with broken gas lines and unstable buildings. Just under 100,000 in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. Fighting flames on multiple fronts Firefighters over the weekend fought flames in Mandeville Canyon — home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities — after the Palisades Fire spread, prompting new evacuation orders. Crews continued battling there Monday before potentially strong winds could push the flames toward the famous J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles. Beyoncé, Disney and other celebrities and entertainment organizations have pledged millions to help those who have been displaced or lost their homes. Other stars — and ordinary people — have left large donations of clothing and other items along street corners in around the city. Investigating looting, fundraising scams Dozens of people have been arrested for looting after the wildfires. Officials are now starting to see price gouging and scams, including with hotels and short-term rentals and medical supplies, said Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Counting up and investigating the destruction The fires that began Tuesday north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 homes, cars and other structures. Authorities haven’t determined an official cause for any of the fires. Southern California Edison has acknowledged agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a smaller blaze. A lawsuit filed Monday claims the utility's equipment sparked the much bigger Eaton Fire. Edison did not respond to a request for comment and last week said it had not received any suggestions that its equipment ignited that blaze. AccuWeather’s early estimates suggest the fires could be the nation’s costliest ever, topping $250 billion including what’s to come in the next days. The reconstruction cost for commercial and residential properties inside areas with active fires could be $14.8 billion, according to real estate data tracker CoreLogic.

McALLEN, TEXAS (Border Report) -- Representing migrants who died while trying to cross the border last year, 600 wooden crosses covered a field for a month in Eagle Pass, Texas. US ‘knowingly killing migrants,’ county official says Many of the crosses had blue or pink marks indicating the young boys and girls who died, organizers with the Border Vigil, a human rights program by the Eagle Pass Border Coalition, told Border Report on Monday. Volunteers remove crosses at Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas, during a ceremony on Jan. 11, 2025. (Photo Courtesy Eagle Pass Border Coalition Border Vigil) The memorial of crosses were set up on Dec. 14 in a field at Shelby Park -- a park that that's been partially closed to the public because it is the staging point for Operation Lone Star, Texas' border security initiative in Eagle Pass. New border base camp staffing up in Eagle Pass Volunteers removed the crosses on Saturday. 'One of the reasons that we do it all at once and then take it down, is to show this is what happened this year,' coalition co-founder Amerika Garcia-Grewal said. This is the second year that the organization has put up the crosses at Shelby Park. 'It was an emotional and moving experience walking among the 600 crosses representing people who died either trying to swim the river,' said Mike Garcia, co-founder of the Border Vigil. 'To understand that each one of those crosses represented the loss of someone's life. The pink tipped crosses were for children, for girls and the blue tipped ones were for boys and there was a lot of them there. It's knowing what all that's about and the family still doesn't know for some of them. What happened to them? Where did they end up? It really made you think.' US ‘knowingly killing migrants,’ county official says 'It was sad to see so many people died reaching for the American dream,' said Ana Guardiola, director of Ballet Folklórico De Las Águilas, which performed at the ceremony to the song 'La Llorona.' At the end of the song, community members and clergy joined the dancers and walked among the crosses for a moment of silent contemplation and to reflect on the significance of the memorial, organizers told Border Report. 'We pray that God will comfort the families that have lost a loved one who was only looking for a safer and better life for their families,' Pastor Javier Leyva told participants.

Poll: Do Americans want more states? Are we on the right track no...	Editor's Note: Beginning at 11 a.m. ET, the video player above will feature live analysis of the latest Emerson findings on public sentiment at the end of the Biden Administration. (NEXSTAR) – On the eve of President Trump's return to the Oval Office, Emerson College Polling conducted a survey to gauge public sentiment on a swath of issues including the popularity of Presidents Joe Biden and Jimmy Carter, the criminal proceedings against former President Trump and the potential expansion of United States territories. A January 10-11 survey of 1,000 registered voters found President Joe Biden with a 37% approval rating in the final week of his presidency, 12 points lower than when Emerson first polled his approval in 2021. A deeper look into the number reveals continued perceptions of a struggling economy likely dragging on Biden, as they did during the General Election last year. The economy remains the top issue for voters (36%) followed by Immigration (17%) and healthcare (12%).The poll does offer hope for Mr. Biden's legacy over time, as respondents held broadly positive feelings about fellow one-term Democrat Jimmy Carter. Of those surveyed, 59% held a favorable opinion of Carter, who died on December 29th, with only 16% stating a negative opinion of the Georgia lawmaker. President-elect Trump enjoys 52% approval as he returns to the White House, but a majority of those same voters (55%) stated it was appropriate to hold the future president accountable in court for falsifying business records. 'Trump’s conviction continues to highlight partisan divides, independents aligning more with Democrats on this issue,' Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling said in a news release. 'Eighty-seven percent of Democrats and 57% of independents think the trial was appropriate to hold Trump accountable, while 79% of Republicans hint the trial was a political witch hunt.One of Trump's most headline-grabbing proposals, expanding the footprint of the United States, earned a cool response from survey participants. Sixty-seven percent of those polled believe the US should stay the size it is, while 20% think the country should add states or additional territories. Thirteen percent were neutral on the proposition. More broadly, November's election seems to have done little yet to convince Americans that the country is moving toward a brighter future.

Incarcerated firefighter program turns 'negative into positive'	(NewsNation) — Royal Ramey, co-founder and CEO of the Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program, says he turned a 'negative into a positive,' leading to a career he loves. Ramey previously worked as a firefighter while incarcerated and now wants to help others follow a similar path. 'My experience was a roller coaster emotionally and physically,' Ramey said during an appearance on 'Banfield.' 'Now, I'm trying to help others find that path as well.' Biden to convene top officials on LA wildfires response Incarcerated firefighters earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to CDCR. Overall pay can depend on their skill level. Wage levels doubled in 2023, up from between $2.90 and $5.12 per day, CBS News reported. The California conservation or fire camp program, which has been around since the 1940s, has drawn criticism for its low pay and the high risks involved. As of Friday, over 900 prison inmates have been deployed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to help contain the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires, the department confirmed to CBS News. The crews of incarcerated firefighters include several graduates from the Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program.

LA wildfires: Four members of the same family each lose their hom...	(NewsNation) — While wildfires devastating wealthy Los Angeles neighborhoods have dominated headlines, the historic community of Altadena is facing its own crisis as multiple generations of families lose their homes to the flames. Among them are the Williams sisters, whose family exemplifies Altadena's tight-knit community — California's first middle-class Black neighborhood, established during the Great Migration as a sanctuary from Jim Crow laws. 'The community is super strong, and we always have been,' Eshele Williams said Monday on NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' 'You're talking about generational home ownership, but the families that still live in Altadena, we've never moved.' Now, the area's nearly 50,000 residents are a diverse mix, with Black and Latino residents comprising half the population. Biden: Govt. to give $770 to each resident affected by LA wildfires Three Williams sisters, along with their parents who once fostered local children, lost their homes to the fires. A fourth sister's home remains standing but is currently inaccessible. The extended family — 17 people, four dogs and a 40-year-old family parrot named Hank — are now sharing a hotel room. Their mother, Matilda Williams, said that family unity is key to their survival. 'Our faith, our unity, definitely, and the love we have for each other — when something goes wrong, we all gather together,' she said. The Williams family has started two GoFundMe pages to rebuild their homes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/la-wildfires-family-loses-four-homes-altadena/	2025-01-13T19:54:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-2-3.jpg?w=900
LA price gauging is 'inhumane': Real estate agent	(NewsNation) — Officials are warning landlords in the Los Angeles area against price gauging, which is prohibited in California during a state of emergency. Nikko Santo Pietro, Los Angeles real estate agent and son of 'Wheel of Fortune’s' Vanna White, said the supply of housing is 'so limited' and that he can only imagine what the fires will continue to do for prices across Los Angeles County. Santo Pietro said price gouging has previously been defined as raising prices by 10% over the preemergency price. However, he's awaiting guidance from the Department of Real Estate to clarify what is allowed and what isn't allowed. For now, the exact definition of price gouging is in a 'gray area.' 'We are seeing landlords and agents charging astronomical numbers for rent,' Santo Pietro said during an appearance on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'It's inhumane. It's not right, morally.

Suspected looter dressed as fireman detained near homes damaged i...	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — Two alleged looters, one of whom was dressed as a firefighter, were detained by Los Angeles County authorities on Sunday along the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades. It’s unclear exactly what time the suspects were stopped, but a local photographer spotted the pair on a scooter and a moped. One of the suspects was dressed in fire boots, jeans, and a yellow fire jacket emblazoned with Cal Fire’s old acronym CDF, which stood for California Department of Forestry and Fire. Mother of former child star killed in Palisades Fire speaks on devastating loss Eric Fox told Nexstar's KTLA he saw the pair riding up the Pacific Coast Highway. Homes along Pacific Coast Highway are seen burned and damaged while a few still stand after the Palisades Fire, Jan. 12, 2025, in Malibu, Calif. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) 'As I pulled up to the checkpoint to report them, the deputies had already detained them,' Fox explained. Two crime prevention unit deputies from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department's Santa Clarita Station, who were assisting with the Palisades Fire, made the stops, along with California Highway Patrol and National Guardsmen, who were all manning the checkpoint. Photos of the two individuals show them in handcuffs sitting on the sidewalk just outside the Getty Villa as deputies search them. Sheriff’s officials posted an image of the handcuffed fake firefighter on social media. LA area wildfires: At least 24 have died, strong winds expected No information was provided on the alleged looters' identities or if they were caught with any stolen property. Officials later said the person dressed as a firefighter was released. It was unclear what happened to the suspect pictured wearing a helmet and boots. Approximately 50 miles away in Irwindale, firefighters battling a small brush fire near Rivergrade Road and the 605 Freeway, spotted an alleged arsonist starting fires. The suspect, a 29-year-old Baldwin Park resident, was taken into custody by police. In Santa Monica, officials said that in the last five days, 39 people have been arrested in evacuation zones, 10 of whom were found in possession of burglary tools and are considered burglary suspects. L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is set to announce charges on Tuesday against suspects in several recent arrests for arson and looting.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/wildfire-looters-los-angeles/	2025-01-13T14:28:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25013600160213-e1736804871547.jpg?w=800
Biden: Govt. to give $770 each to residents affected by LA wildfi...	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden announced Monday that federal aid is flowing to Los Angeles as California battles its worst wildfires in state history, with containment levels varying from 14% in Pacific Palisades to 100% in Ventura. Biden and senior officials met Monday night to discuss the ongoing federal response to the Los Angeles County wildfires as Biden’s White House tenure draws to a close. Biden has vowed the federal government will cover 100% of the disaster response costs for the next six months connected to the fires, which have claimed at least 24 lives. 'We are not waiting until the fires are over to help victims. We are helping them all right now. All those affected are going to receive a one-time payment of $770,' Biden said. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues The federal government will cover all firefighting costs for the next 180 days. Nearly $5.1 million in immediate aid has been distributed, with affected residents eligible for one-time payments of $770. FEMA reports about 33,000 people have registered for assistance. 'It's going to cost tens of billions of dollars to get Los Angeles to what it was,' Biden said during a briefing with Vice President Kamala Harris and emergency officials. 'We are going to need Congress to step up with the funding.' Officials will also work to determine what is left for the federal government to address on the fires before Biden leaves office next week. The briefing determined how the White House and administration officials can better assist state and local officials in California. The meeting included Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell, who said in various media interviews that she did not feel that California officials were unprepared to deal with the fires. Instead, she said 100 mph winds and dry conditions contributed to the inevitability of the damage being caused by the fires. Rep. John Moolenaar: Why won’t ‘Chinese Communist Party’ sell TikTok? Criswell in the briefing said about 700-800 people are staying in eight emergency shelters, while others have found refuge with family or in hotels. She has directed her team to personally assist families struggling with documentation requirements for aid. In terms of the federal response, the Department of Defense has provided infrared imaging technology to assist firefighters in battling the deadly fires. Additionally, at least 1,800 National Guard troops have been deployed to the region to assist with the wildfires. U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore warned of critical fire conditions through Wednesday, with wind gusts expected to reach 70 mph. However, he noted that approximately 15,000 additional firefighters are available if needed. Bob Fenton, who managed the Maui wildfire response, will coordinate federal support and debris removal efforts in Los Angeles, working with FEMA, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers. Officials expect weather conditions to improve by Friday, with cooling temperatures and increased humidity forecast. 'The next 48 hours are very critical,' Harris said. 'This is the time everyone must remain vigilant.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-top-officials-wildfires-response/	2025-01-13T11:59:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25012100489450.jpg?w=900
Unauthorized drone flights double; 3 arrested during LA fires	(NewsNation) — Three people have been arrested as unauthorized drone flights have doubled in southern California as firefighters work to contain multiple wildfires that have devastated the LA area. LA County Sheriff Robert Luna announced Monday that three people were arrested for two drone incidents during a briefing on the fires. The use of unauthorized drones is hindering the ability of firefighters trying to contain the fires that have burned more than 40,000 acres, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and resulted in 24 confirmed deaths. Los Angeles wildfire survivors describe ‘hellscape’ they left behind On Friday, firefighting aircraft trying to contain the Palisades wildfire were forced to leave the area because of unauthorized drones in the air. In an earlier incident Thursday, a Super Scooper aircraft used to drop large quantities of water on fires was damaged after a collision with a small drone. The incident left a hole in the wing and grounded the plane until it could be fixed. The FBI is investigating the incident, saying the drone violated temporary airspace restrictions the FAA instituted during the fires. California authorities say there have been at least 40 incidents in which unauthorized drones have forced firefighting aircraft to pause operations, putting more lives at risk as the fires continue to spread and firefighters on the ground are left without air support.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/unauthorized-drone-double-la-fires/	2025-01-13T09:18:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192352117.jpg?w=900
LA-area wildfires: Private crews charge thousands, inmates make $...	(NewsNation) — Thousands of first responders are fighting the flames as wildfires continue scorching the Los Angeles area. Along with agencies such as the Los Angeles Fire Department, the California National Guard and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, currently incarcerated people are helping out in the emergency response. In addition, some people and businesses have hired private firefighters to protect their property. Other states such as Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Idaho and New Mexico are assisting California. Mexican emergency crews and Canadian aircraft have been sent over the border to help as well. What we know about how the LA wildfires started Inmates fighting LA wildfires Incarcerated firefighters make $10.24 a day, and they get an extra dollar for each hour they've responded to a blaze. That means, for a 24-hour shift, an inmate with the lowest skill level could make almost $27 a day. This is lower than minimum wage and the rate Cal Fire gives its nonincarcerated seasonal firefighters. Those firefighters make a base salary of $3,700 to $4,600 a month. California has nearly 1,000 inmates pitching in. Incarcerated people who want to participate in the program have to volunteer. To be eligible, they must have eight years or less remaining on their sentence. Convictions involving sex offenses or arson, as well as a history of escapes, will disqualify them from the program. Inmates can have two days taken off their sentences for every day they serve in a fire crew. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events Calls are growing for the incarcerated crews to earn more. Kim Kardashian recently said in an Instagram story that the 'hundreds of incarcerated firefighters, risking their lives to save us' get paid almost nothing, and urged California Gov. Gavin Newsom to increase their wages. 'We never know who we're going to need,' Sam Lewis, executive director of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, said. 'When people go to prison or jail, we forget about them, we throw them away, and we assume that they may not have value as a society. That's not true. People are resilient. People can change, and we should always want to be able to give a person a second or third chance to be able to become the best version of themselves.' Private firefighters Meanwhile, private crews are being paid as much as $2,000 an hour to protect residences and businesses in Los Angeles County. The National Wildfire Suppression Association represents over 300 private wildland fire service contractors. Many are contracted by insurance companies to protect the homes of those they provide policies for. Industrial corporations, such as those that work in oil, gas or vineyards, hire private crews to safeguard their property and manage potential fire risks. Private fire crews bring their own water supply and are typically armed with their own hoses, blocking gel and supplies. Cal Fire says the for-hire contractors aren't on the front lines and are not getting in the way of its critical work. 'Corporations are welcome to hire their own firefighters to protect their facilities, whether it's on a facility property, or if it's a series of stands or poles,' David Acuna, of Cal Fire, said. 'Or if a private homeowner wants to have the insurance company hire them, of course, we're not going to stop that, but we cannot and will not delegate to private firefighters the operations that we need to have complex coordination with.' California legislators passed a law in 2018 to regulate private firefighting. It requires them to coordinate with public fire agencies and prohibits them from using emergency lights or sirens. LA wildfire aid from other countries Mexico has sent 72 firefighters and emergency personnel to California. They were transported to a mobile station for a safety orientation before being dispatched on Monday. 'Emergencies have no borders — we are deeply grateful to our neighbors in Mexico for their unwavering support during one of our greatest times of need,' Newsom said according to NewsNation local affiliate KTLA. 'Thank you to President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo for lending the best of the best.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has dispatched aerial firefighting aircraft to California as well. He said Canada is 'always here to help our American friends.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-area-wildfires-private-inmate-firefighters/	2025-01-13T08:05:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25013163967406.jpg?w=900
LA area wildfires: At least 24 have died, strong winds expected	(NewsNation) — At least 24 people have died in the Los Angeles area wildfires that have been blazing since last week. Crews got some relief over the weekend as the winds died down, but the gusts are expected to pick up later Monday and Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions with sustained winds of 50 mph. In the mountains, they're set to reach 70 mph. Over 12,000 structures have been destroyed in the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires. The biggest of them, Palisades, is still only 13% contained. More than 150,000 people are still under evacuation orders. Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said Sunday that some residents won’t be allowed to return to evacuation zones until the forecasted Red Flag event on Jan. 15 ends. Most Los Angeles Unified schools and all of the district's offices are set to open Monday. 'Conditions have improved for a majority of areas across the Los Angeles region and the District is confident it is safe for students and employees to return to campuses,' the school district said in a statement. Schools remaining closed because of mandatory evacuation orders are: Canyon Charter Elementary, Kenter Canyon Charter Elementary, Palisades Charter Elementary, Marquez Charter Elementary, Topanga Charter Elementary, Lanai Road Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School. At a Monday afternoon press conference, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is set to announce charges against a group of people in a residential looting in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, as well as arson charges against a man in the city of Azusa. What we know about how the LA wildfires started Palisades Fire According to CalFire, the Palisades Fire has scorched 23,713 acres and is 13% contained as of Monday morning. Eight of the 24 deaths in the wildfires are attributed to Palisades, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office. Four people are missing from the Palisades Fire zone, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. The blaze was first reported as a vegetation fire around 10:30 a.m. PT Tuesday. What happens on Inauguration Day? A schedule of key events Eaton Fire The Eaton Fire burned 14,117 acres and is at 27% containment, per CalFire. Sixteen of the deaths from the wildfires are from Eaton, the LA County coroner's office said. Luna said 12 people are missing in the Eaton Fire zone. Hurst Fire The Hurst Fire burned 799 acres and is 89% contained, CalFire said. How much damage have wildfires caused? Accuweather estimates that the total damage and economic loss from the fires to be $135-150 billion. There are 207,980 customers without power in California, per Poweroutage.us. Mark Pestrella, director of Los Angeles County Public Works Director, said sewer, power and transportation systems have been damaged significantly. All Los Angeles Unified schools and offices will remain closed until the conditions improve, Superintendent Alberto Carvalhohe said.The district has lost two elementary schools, and one high school is significantly damaged, Carvalho said. Other closures include NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, The Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Getty Villa, which will not open until Monday, Jan. 13. Angeles National Forest is temporarily closed for public safety through Wednesday, Jan.15. On X, the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team announced their Thursday game is being rescheduled. So far, the Wild Card playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams football team and Minnesota Vikings is still set for SoFi Stadium on Monday. If needed, though, the teams said they will play in Phoenix. The Altadena Golf Course has been destroyed, according to Johnny Eusebio, general manager.

When the flames first started, she grabbed her dog, Delilah, and her laptop, leaving behind her home, vehicle and precious keepsakes. That includes a recently-received scrapbook of her mother, who died when she was 6-years-old, and the handprints and footprints of the son she lost. Some of those precious memories are in a fireproof lockbox — which she hopes 'by some miracle, could be in the rubble.' Death toll rises to 24 in LA wildfires, more wind expected Nativo is one of the many thousands forced to leave behind their homes as wildfires scorch the Los Angeles area. The fires continued Sunday, with the Palisades blaze, Eaton Fire and more spreading across more than 38,000 acres of Southern California. Nativo said that, while the Pacific Palisades is often conflated as a mega-rich neighborhood, the people who lived in her building were hard-working, middle-class people, not just 'millionaires and celebrities.' 'I'm very blessed. I have this friend who's given me her guest house as a retreat for now, but I think about how many people are displaced, and how many people are in shelters and just are left with nothing?' Nativo told NewsNation. A firefighter battles the Palisades Fire in Mandeville Canyon on Saturday, Jan. 11, 2025, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Jae C.

(Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) Parents separated from children during fire As Natalie Mitchell escaped the fire in Pacific Palisades, her children were at school, spread out across Los Angeles County. 'That night, there was a moment where I thought, 'I don't know if we're going to make it out of here,'' Mitchell told NewsNation. Within minutes of seeing the spark of fire on a hill, Mitchell and her husband watched it grow rapidly -- and decided to leave. 'We took whatever we could, we jumped in the car, we started going down the hill,' Mitchell said. 'There was no one else on the road. It was pitch black, and the visibility at one point was, I couldn't, we couldn't see.' Watching the homes around them burn, the couple realized that, if anything were to happen, their children would lose them both. 'And we thought, what do we do?' Mitchell said. Maneuvering around firetrucks, the pair made it down the mountain and to safety. Her children — separated themselves at first — were picked up by members of Mitchell's 'wonderful community.' 'We're happy to be together. We're happy to be safe, and that's the most important part,' she added. 'It's really, really hard. I feel like, every hour, I get a new update on a friend that's lost their home.' CA firefighters face impersonators, staffing shortages, low pay Couple loses Altadena home in fire Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling knew the wind would be an issue. 'But we didn't really anticipate the devastation that was to come,' Kiessling said. The couple, along with their nearly 4-year-old daughter, lived in Altadena — where the Eaton Fire raged. Kiessling said she grew more unnerved and anxious as the night went on, leading the trio to evacuate overnight on Wednesday before any orders had been passed down. 'By 5 a.m., our burglar alarms started going off. And later when we checked, every single alarm in our house tripped within four minutes.

CA firefighters face impersonators, staffing shortages, low pay	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles firefighters battling historic urban blazes face mounting challenges beyond the flames, including criminals impersonating first responders and critical staffing shortages. Officials report 29 arrests connected to the fires, including an incident where police detained two men on Vice President Kamala Harris's property during curfew hours. In one of the most brazen cases, authorities arrested a man dressed as a firefighter who was caught burglarizing a home in the evacuation zone. 'Zero tolerance for crime,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. 'If you are bold enough to go into a fire area and attempt to break in homes or [engage in] looting of any type, you will be arrested.' Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said he encountered a man dressed as a firefighter burglarizing a home. 'I saw a gentleman that looked like a firefighter, and I asked him if he was okay because he was sitting down. I didn’t realize we had him in handcuffs. We are turning them over to LAPD because he was dressed like a fireman and he was not. He just got caught burglarizing a home,' Luna said. Meanwhile, firefighter advocacy groups are pushing for permanent pay increases as staffing shortages reach critical levels. While California state firefighters earn approximately $52,000 annually, U.S. Forest Service wildland firefighters make significantly less at about $36,000 per year, with no hazard pay or health insurance benefits. What we know about how the LA wildfires started Federal wildland firefighters currently receive a temporary pay increase authorized by President Joe Biden, extended through March. Without congressional action to make the increase permanent, these firefighters could see their wages cut in half. The crisis is exacerbated by year-round fire seasons, with many firefighters working 18-22 hour shifts under dangerous conditions. 'At base rate, it's 50 to 100% difference between the feds versus an organization like Cal Fire that's paying significantly more,' Luke Mayfield, president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters said. Adding to the strain, a large portion of the federal firefighting workforce is typically laid off outside traditional fire seasons, despite the evolving nature of fire threats. 'A lot of that mitigation and management work is hazardous. It should have hazard pay attached to it,' Mayfield said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/ca-firefighters-face-impersonators-staffing-shortages-low-pay/	2025-01-12T17:19:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675913a511c130.57131305.jpeg?w=900
Trump slams officials’ handling of Los Angeles inferno: 'Incompet...	WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump slammed Los Angeles officials’ handling of the wildfires Sunday, calling them 'incompetent' and questioning why they have not yet contained the blaze. 'The fires are still raging in L.A,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.' Death toll reaches 16 in LA wildfires, more wind expected 'Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place. This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?' he concluded. As Los Angeles continues to burn, California politicians have come under sharp criticism by the soon-to-be 47th president, specifically for the state’s water management. Trump has hurled blame at Governor Gavin Newsom (D) – whom he has feuded with for years – for the wildfire crisis, proclaiming he should resign. In a post on his social media site earlier in the week, Trump wrote that Newsom 'refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water' to areas now burning, alleging he prioritized 'small fish' over California residents. Newsom swiped back Saturday, insisting Trump’s accusations were 'made up' and 'delusional.' 'The Delta smelt somehow being culpable of somehow leading to some of the challenges that we face down here… it’s made up, it’s delusional,' Newsom said during an interview on 'Pod Save America'. 'It’s so profoundly ignorant and yet [Trump] absolutely believes it,' Newsom continued. 'It’s not an ignorance on his part, it’s sort of an indelible misinformation that he sort of manifested a falsehood and he decided to bring it into this crisis, in a profoundly demeaning and damaging way.' The governor has since launched a website to combat 'misinformation' being spread about the disaster, which addresses claims on resources, funding, and policies. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues Newsom sent a letter to Trump dated Friday – and publicly posted to his X account – inviting the president-elect to survey the devastation firsthand and meet with fire victims and first responders. The California governor said Trump has not responded to his invitation as of Sunday. At least 16 people have been killed by the inferno in the Los Angeles region, and officials warn there will likely be 'a lot more' added to the death toll. The wildfires have burnt at least 40,000 acres and destroyed at least 12,000 structures.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-los-angeles-wildfires/	2025-01-12T12:36:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192426947.jpg?w=900
Altadena, small LA-area town, decimated by Eaton Fire	(NewsNation) — Rubble and debris litter the small town of Altadena, California, whose approximately 44,000 residents are scrambling after the Eaton Fire destroyed homes, churches, businesses and everything in between. 'Hotel to hotel until I get some assistance. I have nothing but my dogs and me,' said Tonya Robinson, who lives in Altadena, as she fought back tears. 'One thing I do have is God. My church here where I'm at right now, I got food, I got blankets, I got food for my dogs. I got everything that I need right now.' Altadena, about 14 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, is known for its resilient working class. The Eaton Fire was 27% contained as of Sunday morning, according to the Los Angeles National Forest. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., recently spoke to NewsNation about the area, which is within her district. 'Altadena has working people, people who may not have enough money by which to go and rent a hotel, maybe for, you know, months to come,' she said Friday. 'I would like to ask you and any other media individuals that may be listening to do everything that you can to get attention on Altadena.' Waters said the area 'has just about been flattened.' California’s working class overlooked amid wildfires, US rep says Up in flames within four minutes Altadena residents Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling lost their home in the Eaton Fire after evacuating with their 3-year-old daughter, who will turn four soon. 'We went to bed feeling a little uneasy, and I was checking my phone every few minutes for updates,' Kiessling said. The next morning, Rhodes went outside to get the car ready. 'Within minutes, he came inside and said, 'We have to go right now,'' Kiessling said. 'It took four minutes for our house to go up (in flames).' They were one of more than 150,000 who were forced to flee in the greater Los Angeles area. They were only able to grab some clothes and important papers and drove about 40 miles away to stay with friends. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues 11 dead, all from Altadena Eleven people have died from the Eaton Fire, all of which were Altadena residents, NewsNation affiliate KTLA reported. Scenes of devastation have replaced what was once a thriving middle and working class community in Altadena. In a matter of days, thousands have lost their homes. In some cases, entire blocks are wiped off the map. Homes passed down from generation to generation are gone. 'Everything's gone, and it's just so devastating, just my whole neighborhood, both streets, I'm a corner house, and from the small street going down to the street going across, there's no homes, maybe one. And it's just, it's just devastating,' said Kimberly Grant, an Altadena resident and business owner, to NewsNation. Altadena town Councilmember Sylvia Vega detailed the devastation on NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning. 'When something happens, you want to be able to be able to go to your church, you want to be able to go to school and have some normalcy, and for so many in our community, they're not going to have that.' She has a message for her constituents. 'We will rebuild,' Vega said. 'We will survive.' Strained water supply The area is dealing with a water system issue, resulting in unsafe drinking water and a lacking supply. Power outages are widespread as well. The water still needs to be assessed. 'We need to know that our drinking water will be safe,' said Altadena Councilmember Milissa Morona, whose home was spared but neighbors weren't so lucky. 'If winds pick up, I fear I may lose my house as well,' she said. 'When I was leaving my house yesterday a couple days ago, there were tornado-type winds coming at me with fireballs. I don't know that they (firefighters) could have done anything.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/altadena-california-eaton-fire-destruction/	2025-01-12T09:54:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192352117.jpg?w=900
Police detain 2 near VP Harris’ LA-area home for curfew violation	BRENTWOOD, Cali. (KTLA) — Two people were detained at Vice President Kamala Harris' Brentwood, California, home on Saturday, police confirmed to NewsNation affiliate KTLA. The Los Angeles Police Department said a call came into the West L.A. station around 4:40 a.m. —- during curfew hours, which were set amid the ongoing wildfires — reporting a potential burglary on the vice president’s property. Officers responded to the residence, located on Bundy Drive north of Sunset Drive, and found two individuals on the property. LAPD said officers detained the two people who were breaking curfew, but have since released them as they found no evidence that they were committing a crime. Details are extremely limited, police did not immediately say what the two people were doing on the vice president’s property or whether the incident would be further investigated. National Guard members and local enforcement from the LAPD, Santa Monica Police, and Airport Police Departments reminded residents that they will continue to patrol fire zones from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., ready to arrest anyone for trespassing, looting or any other type of violation. Brentwood, as well as communities in the San Fernando Valley, were growing areas of concern as the Palisades Fire began climbing inland over the mountains on Friday and Saturday. The Palisades Fire, already one of the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history, erupted on Tuesday, Jan. 7. As of Saturday evening, it had claimed 5 lives, burned 23,654 acres and was 11% contained. More than 5,000 structures, many of them homes, have been destroyed in the Pacific Palisades and Malibu.

More than one dozen arrests related to suspected looting have already been reported within the Los Angeles area wildfire zones, authorities said last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/police-detain-2-near-vp-harris-la-area-home-for-curfew-violation/	2025-01-12T08:35:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-6-5-e1736696582730.jpg?w=800

Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issue...	(NewsNation) — California is battling not only wildfires but also looting, price gouging and challenges with insurance companies. Law enforcement officers have arrested more than 20 people on suspicion of looting in recent days. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna condemned the criminal activity, saying 'it's a despicable crime and you're going to go to jail, bottom line.' California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Saturday he is doubling the National Guard presence to approximately 1,700 troops to combat devastating wildfires. The expanded response includes more than 12,000 first responders and 1,500 pieces of firefighting equipment as multiple blazes continue to threaten the region. ‘Very dire’ conditions ahead for LA wildfires: Weather Service The crisis is compounded by insurance challenges. State Farm canceled 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades last July, representing 70% of their coverage in the area. In response, California has implemented a one-year moratorium on insurance companies canceling or failing to renew policies for homeowners affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Total damage from the devastating wildfires scorching Southern California could amount to $135 billion to $150 billion, according to AccuWeather. The wildfires were previously estimated to cost around $50 billion, $10 billion of which is expected to be insured, according to JPMorgan. California Attorney General Rob Bonta warned residents about potential scams and price gouging, which is illegal during a state of emergency. LA fire chief says city failed department amid ongoing wildfires Officials advise residents to verify credentials and avoid paying for services upfront. The insurance crisis extends beyond California. A Senate report found companies are withdrawing coverage across the country, including in Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama, the Carolinas and New England states, leaving thousands of Americans unable to secure mortgages. Insurers began dropping plans after 2017 and 2018 when back-to-back wildfires in California resulted in losses totaling $23 billion. Insurers paid out twice as much in claims as they received in premiums. That has left major insurers reluctant to do business in the state. Allstate dropped its business entirely in California in 2023, saying it would come back if regulatory changes were made to protect its bottom line. Insurance industry experts attribute the withdrawals to unprofitable risk levels in certain regions, creating a growing national housing accessibility challenge.

LA fire chief says city failed department amid ongoing wildfires	(The Hill) — Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said during an interview Friday that the city failed the department amid the ongoing wildfires in Southern California that have taken at least 11 lives and burned more than 37,000 acres. Crowley was interviewed by Fox11 on Friday and asked if the city of Los Angeles failed her department, referring to the Santa Ynez Reservoir being shut down and empty. The fire department chief, at first, did not answer the question from Fox11 reporter Gigi Graciette, telling her that the department is tasked with protecting the public. Graciette asked again. Crowley did not respond directly. After asking for a third time 'did they fail you?' Crowley responded 'yes.' When asked about the Santa Ynez Reservoir, Crowley said that when firefighters operate in the field, they expect to have water, but if there isn’t any available, 'they’re going to go find water.' 'So my stance on this is when a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water. We don’t control the water supply. Our firefighters are there to protect lives and property and to make sure that we’re properly trained and equipped,' Crowley said Friday. The reservoir in the Pacific Palisades was closed for repairs and empty as wildfires raged through the region, according to multiple media reports. The reservoir normally holds 117 million gallons of water. 'That’s my position on this. So if there’s no water, I don’t know how the water gets to the hydrants. Please defer that to DWP or whomever controls that part,' she added. 'But I can tell you the resiliency of our firefighters. If there’s no water, they’re going to go find water. They’re going to figure out a way to do the best they can with what they’ve got in a very dynamic situation.' The DailyMail reported Friday night that the Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, fired Crowley on Friday afternoon. Bass’s office denied the reporting on Friday night, telling The Hill in an emailed statement that the report 'is false.' LAFD public information officer Erik Scott then wrote on the social media platform X that Bass and Crowley met Friday, but clarified that the fire department head 'was not dismissed and is in full command' of the LAFD. 'Their foremost priorities continue to be fighting the current wildfires and safeguarding Angelenos,' Scott wrote just past midnight on Saturday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-fire-chief-says-city-failed-department-amid-ongoing-wildfires/	2025-01-11T15:11:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25010603828548-e1736603308713.jpg?w=900
What are the risks of wildfire smoke inhalation?	(NewsNation) — As multiple wildfires continue to scorch tens of thousands of acres in the Los Angeles area, people face dangerous air quality levels and exposure to smoke inhalation. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency Friday. Dr. David Hill, board chair of the American Lung Association, joined 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Saturday morning to discuss the health risks of smoke inhalation. 'These are widespread fires producing a lot of smoke that's toxic, and it's a danger to the entire public,' Hill said. 'Everyone breathes, so this is something everyone, particularly in the greater Los Angeles area, has to be taking seriously.' What are the risks of smoke inhalation? There are both short-term and long-term risks. The short-term risks include lung injury, particularly for high-risk groups. 'This is not just wood smoke that's burning. There are dangerous chemicals in houses and in schools and industrial facilities and all these buildings that are burning that are very toxic,' Hill said. High-risk groups include children, pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with preexisting conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease or diabetes. 'But again, anybody who's breathing this toxic smoke is at risk.' Long-term risks include a higher rate of asthma, worsening lung and heart disease and other complications. 'These particles are so small that they get deep into the lungs and cause inflammation and can also pass directly into the bloodstream and cause problems,' Hill said. 'So, we see an increased risk of Parkinson's disease of cognitive decline, which is why everyone needs to limit their exposure to this to the best degree.' How to protect yourself from smoke inhalation Per Hill's recommendations, people in smoky areas should do the following: Evacuate when urged or ordered to do so Pay attention to air quality indexes Stay indoors as much as possible Set air conditioning to recirculation when leaving home or another building Keep windows closed Close any fireplaces Run central A/C if it's available Wear an N-95 mask if going outside 'A cloth mask is not going to stop these particles from getting into your lungs,' Hill said. 'N95 and N100 masks are necessary.' Wildfire smoke can travel long distances. 'Even though you may not be under an evacuation order, it does not mean your air quality is going to be good locally.' Hill urged people to pay attention to air quality indexes available online at airnow.gov.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/wildfire-smoke-inhalation-risks/	2025-01-11T13:48:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/gettyimages-2192534400-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
California's working class overlooked amid wildfires, US rep says	(NewsNation) — Natural disasters do not discriminate against their victims. From celebrities in the Hollywood Hills to residents in nearby towns, people are grieving the loss of their communities, homes, belongings and memories from the Palisades Fire and other wildfires. However, one official says the working class, particularly in Altadena, California, is being overlooked. 'Altadena has working people, people who may not have enough money by which to go and rent a hotel, maybe for, you know, months to come,' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., on NewsNation’s 'CUOMO' Friday night. 'I would like to ask you and any other media individuals that may be listening to do everything that you can to get attention on Altadena.' She said the area 'has just about been flattened.' Gov. Gavin Newsom Invites Donald Trump to California amid wildfires 'Not everybody's rich, and we have people who don't know where they're going, people who are in temporary situations that need some help and finding a place to live,' Waters said. 'We have people who need food, we have people who need healthcare, all of that, and so that's what I'm concentrated on.' Multiple wildfires have broken out in the greater Los Angeles area in the past week, spanning 36,000 acres, destroying more than 12,000 structures and killing 11. A political 'blame game' has erupted between Democrats and Republicans over the state’s leadership and handling of environmental concerns. But Waters said the focus should be on getting resources to the people who most need it. Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report 'I'm not into the blame game. I'm not into talking about whether or not (Governor) Gavin Newsom is trying to protect himself and run for president. None of that,' Waters said. Critics have pointed to actions by the governor and local mayors to reduce funding to fire departments and cut deals with electric and insurance companies. 'First thing you gotta understand is services cost money, and we should be willing to get the richest people in this country, the richest 1% that is protected, make sure they pay their fair taxes so that we can have the money to provide the services,' Waters said. How to help victims of LA wildfires She urged news media outlets to provide resources to those impacted rather than focus on politics. 'The fact of the matter is we all should have heavy hearts right now,' she said. 'Damn it. You can do the politics later. You can come and talk about Gavin Newsom later … But don't use up this precious time to do petty politics. Use the time to educate and to share information and to let people know where they can get some food, where they can get a place to stay, where they can get some clothing on and on and on.' NewsNation compiled a list of resources on how to help.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/californias-working-class-overlooked-amid-wildfires-us-rep-says/	2025-01-11T08:42:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25011203379482.jpg?w=900

As wildfires continue to rage across Los Angeles County, Soon-Shiong criticized LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom's handling of the city before the crisis. 'It's so crazy we have leaders that are reactive rather than proactive,' Soon-Shiong said during an appearance on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'We have to ask ourselves where are we spending the money and why. Where is the actual planning of preparing for this.' 'With this event, we really must investigate,' Soon-Shiong added. 'That's the basis of the paper. Speaking truth to power. And really investigating the root cause of all these issues and making sure it doesn't happen again.' Drone crashes into firefighting aircraft over Palisades: FAA Soon-Shiong directed the public on X to follow his paper for live updates on the situation while calling out Bass. The Los Angeles Fire Department's budget was cut by approximately $17 million, according to a Newsweek fact check, contrary to Soon-Shiong's claim that Bass reduced it by $23 million. 'Our hearts go out to those who have lost their homes and are seeking shelter. Fires in LA are sadly no surprise, yet the Mayor cut LA Fire Department’s budget by $23M. And reports of empty fire hydrants raise serious questions. Competence matters…Follow @latimes for live coverage in partnership with @Spectrum. The live camera view coverage will give our readers a real time view of the fires and the stream is open to all Angelenos. Stay safe,' Soon-Shiong wrote. Prior to the 2024 election, a number of staff members of the Los Angeles Times editorial board resigned after Soon-Shiong blocked the board’s plan to endorse Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for president. He also announced his intention to overhaul the Times’ editorial board to add more conservative voices, which prompted the paper’s union to publicly rebuke him and longtime columnist Harry Litman to resign. Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report More than 36,000 acres have been burned in total as wildfires continue to rage across the Los Angeles area, and at least 10 people have died. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Friday that 153,000 residents are still under evacuation orders, and 16,000 are under evacuation warnings.

Fire chief urges public to trust alerts despite false warning	(NewsNation) — Kenichi Haskett, section chief for the LA County Fire Department, urged the public to trust emergency alerts despite a false evacuation warning sent to millions of LA County residents this week. 'Unfortunately, it went out,' Haskett told NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'I hope people don't avoid a warning. … If they see smoke, smell smoke, they should be at least ready and packed to go. You need to be packed and ready to go under a warning.

FEMA Fire admin: No amount of resources could've stopped LA blaze...	(NewsNation) — No amount of water and no number of firefighters on the ground could have stopped the blazes raging in the Los Angeles area from spreading, the head of FEMA's U.S. Fire Administration told 'The Hill on NewsNation.' 'What we have to understand is that with every resource brought to bear on this particular fire ... no one was getting in front of this fire,' Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell said. 'The fuel load on this fire, the wind speeds and the variables at play were astronomical. These extreme conditions (were) like a blowtorch.' What we know about how the LA wildfires started Federal and state officials, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, have been criticized for water shortages and budget cuts that some say compromised firefighters' ability to prepare for and battle the blazes. In a memo just last month, LA Fire Department Fire Chief Kristin Crowley argued that cuts to her budget 'severely limited the Department’s capacity to prepare for, train for, and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires,' per NewsNation's Rich McHugh. As of Friday afternoon, the fires in the LA area have burned over 37,000 acres, destroyed 10,000 properties and left 10 dead.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/fema-us-fire-admin-la-blazes/	2025-01-10T17:00:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192299042_e86313.jpg?w=900

US added a strong 256,000 jobs in December as unemployment rate d...	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. hiring picked up unexpectedly in December as employers added a strong 256,000 jobs, another sign of the economy’s resilience in the face of high interest rates. Job growth rose 212,000 last month from November, the Labor Department reported Friday. For all of 2024, the economy added 2.2 million jobs, a solid number but down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 6.4 million in 2021 as the economy bounded back from massive pandemic layoffs. The monthly numbers beat forecasters’ expectation of around 155,000 new jobs and 4.2% unemployment. Healthcare companies added 46,000 jobs, retailers 43,000 and government agencies at the federal, state and local 33,000. But manufacturers cut 13,000 jobs. Labor Department revisions shaved 8,000 jobs from October and November payrolls. Average hourly wages rose 0.3% from November and 3.9% from a year earlier. The year-over-year wage gain was slightly less than economists had forecast. Stocks fell Friday morning on the expectations that the strong jobs report will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut interest rates. The economy doesn’t seem to need the help. 'It seems pretty certain that the pace of Fed rate cuts is now going to slow down,’’ said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. Getting a clear view of the U.S. job market hasn’t been easy the past few months. Hurricanes and a big strike at Boeing threw off the October jobs numbers, pushing them down and setting up a payback rebound in November that likely exaggerated the strength of hiring. Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, said that seasonal adjustments around the holidays may have affected the December numbers, but he added that nonetheless 'it is hard to say anything negative about the details of this report.'' Over the past few years, the economy and the job market have shown surprising resilience. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate – the fed funds rate -- 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to cause a recession but didn’t. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the economy kept rolling along. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product – the nation’s output of goods and services -- has expanded at a robust annual pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters. American workers enjoy unusual job security. Layoffs are running below the pre-pandemic trend. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that just 211,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the fewest in nearly a year. Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months of 2024. But Fed officials signaled at their December meeting that they planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months, and it remains stuck above the Fed’s 2% target.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/ap-us-economy-likely-added-153000-jobs-last-month-returning-to-normal-after-strike-and-hurricanes/	2025-01-10T06:24:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67812dff789253.01723206.jpeg?w=900
Supreme Court to hear arguments on fate of TikTok	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Supreme Court will hear arguments Friday as TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, makes a final attempt to block an impeding ban on the social media platform set to take effect in nine days. A rule, which was signed into law in April, requires TikTok to break ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance before Jan. 19 or it will be banned in the U.S. The case asks the high court to weigh the First Amendment against serious national security concerns. TikTok: What do polls say Americans think of it? Critics warn this decision could go beyond losing favorite social media influencers, potentially shaping the future of free speech. Oral arguments over the legislation will start at 10 a.m. ET. What's at stake? TikTok, with more than 170 million U.S. users, is at the center of a legal battle over First Amendment rights and national security. Lawyers for ByteDance argue that Congress overstepped by passing a law requiring the company to sell the app to an approved buyer or shut down in the U.S. They claim the law violates users' First Amendment rights since TikTok is a platform that allows users to share videos, views, and opinions. Congress, however, asserts that this is not about free speech but national security, claiming that China could force ByteDance to disclose the personal data of millions of Americans. What to know as TikTok argues in front of Supreme Court In a court filing, the U.S. Department of Justice highlights China's 'well-documented history' of forcing companies, including TikTok, to comply with its government's 'directives and refrain from disclosing those actions.' In response, ByteDance's legal team claimed the law would allow Congress to ban them from operating TikTok 'explicitly because they refused to censor views Congress' doesn't like. If SCOTUS upholds the ban, TikTok won't immediately vanish from devices but will be removed from app stores. Users won't receive updates and will gradually lose access as ByteDance winds down its support for the app.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/supreme-court-tiktok-ban/	2025-01-10T05:53:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Zoom-Titok_031124_AP_Damian-Dovarganes-e1734539458285.jpg?w=800
Trump to be sentenced in New York hush money case	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump faces sentencing Friday for his New York hush money conviction after the Supreme Court refused to intervene. With just 10 days before he is inaugurated for a second term, the president-elect will be the first convicted felon to be sworn into office. Friday's sentencing hearing is set to start at 9:30 a.m. ET. Trump, who is expected to appear by video from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, will have the opportunity to speak. Trump: 'We're going to appeal anyway' Merchan repeatedly postponed the sentencing, initially set for July. But last week, he set Friday's date, citing a need for 'finality.' He wrote that he strove to balance Trump's need to govern, the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, the respect due a jury verdict and the public’s expectation that 'no one is above the law.' Trump's lawyers then launched a flurry of last-minute efforts to block the sentencing on the basis of presidential immunity applying to Trump even as president-elect. Their last hope vanished Thursday night. 7 notable moments between VIPs at Carter’s funeral In a 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney-Barret declined to delay the sentencing, assuring Trump's status as the first felon to assume the presidency. The justices emphasized the lenient sentencing that has already been floated for Trump, writing: 'The burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court's state intent to impose a sentencing of 'unconditional discharge' after a brief virtual hearing.' Following the ruling, Trump said, 'We're going to appeal anyway, just psychologically, because frankly, it's a disgrace. It's a judge who shouldn't have been on the case. He's a highly conflicted judge, and they called for an appeal. So, I read it and thought it was a fair decision actually. So I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent.' 'Unconditional discharge' likely for Trump In May, a New York City jury found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Daniels was paid during the campaign to keep quiet about an affair she allegedly had with Trump, which he denies. Each count is punishable by up to four years in prison and/or a fine of up to $5,000. Merchan has suggested that he's unlikely to sentence Trump to prison. Instead, he's expected to impose the most lenient sentencing given the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the president-elect's imminent inauguration. That would likely result in an 'unconditional discharge,' meaning Trump would remain a convicted felon but face no legal penalties for the crime.

LA DA: 'Max punishment' will be sought for looters, arsonist	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Thursday that the penalty for the suspected arsonist considered responsible for one of the LA wildfires could be as high as homicide and could result in life in prison. 'Justice will be swift. It will be firm, and the maximum punishment will be sought,' Hochman said during an appearance on NewsNation's 'Banfield.' 'Our goal is to send this warning,' Hochman added. 'Whether it’s looting, these internet scams, robbery or future arsons. … the day and age of a DA’s office standing on the sidelines is over. We want to bring justice, and we will.' Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report The Kenneth Fire, which erupted close to homes in the area of Calabasas and Hidden Hills, is now considered a crime scene. Investigators believe the fire may have been purposefully set, and it was citizens who helped detain the suspect. LAPD Senior Lead Officer Sean Dinse informed NewsNation's Brian Entin that one person is in custody. The Kenneth Fire is just one among five wildfires ravaging LA County. The fire was first reported around 2:30 p.m. in an area of dry brush in the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, north of U.S. Highway 101. The Kenneth Fire has burned over 900 acres and is 0% contained. At least 20 people have been arrested for alleged looting this week during the wildfires. L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger has also warned that looters in the fire zones will be held accountable. 'There is no excuse' for such behavior, Barger said on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'Thank God we've got a district attorney that recognizes we will prosecute people who break the law.' Barger said she'll make sure L.A. District Attorney Nathan Hochman 'gets all the resources' to prosecute looters 'to the fullest extent of the law.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/la-da-punishment-guilty-looters-arsonist/	2025-01-09T21:32:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/gettyimages-2192534400-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Supreme Court refuses Trump’s request to block Friday’s criminal ...	The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision on Thursday refused President-elect Trump’s request to halt his criminal sentencing, now just hours away, closing off Trump’s last remaining pathway to avoid receiving his punishment for his 34-count felony conviction in New York. On Friday morning, Trump’s hush money sentencing will secure his status as the first felon to assume the presidency. Trump can attend virtually, as Judge Juan Merchan is slated to hand down an unconditional discharge, a rare alternative to prison or probation that has no strings attached. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberals to deny Trump’s request. Four of the court’s conservatives, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, dissented. Among other reasons, the court in its order indicated it was denying Trump’s request because 'the alleged evidentiary violations at President-Elect Trump’s state-court trial can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal.' 'Second, the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect’s responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court’s stated intent to impose a sentence of ‘unconditional discharge’ after a brief virtual hearing,' the order continued. Speaking at a previously scheduled event at Mar-a-Lago minutes later, Trump said he read the court’s order and highlighted how it noted his future appellate options. 'I read it, and I thought it was a fair decision, actually,' Trump said. 'So I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent.' The Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment on the decision. The Supreme Court’s denial of Trump’s emergency application caps his extensive efforts to stave off his sentencing. When a jury convicted him on 34 felonies in May, the proceeding was originally set for July. After the Supreme Court handed down its ruling carving out immunity for former presidents, however, Trump managed to effect multiple delays, eventually pushing the proceeding until after the election.

Mel Gibson: Loss of Malibu home in LA fires 'devastating'	(NewsNation) — Film actor and director Mel Gibson told NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' on Thursday that his Malibu home has been destroyed by the wildfires raging in the Los Angeles area, calling the experience 'devastating.' 'It's emotional,' Gibson said. 'I had my stuff there. I've been relieved from the burden of my stuff because it's all in cinders.' Gibson told Vargas that he was in Austin, Texas, appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast when he learned the fire had broken out. He says that while speaking with Rogan, he was 'ill at ease' because he'd heard his neighborhood was in flames. How to help victims of LA wildfires 'I thought, 'Eh, I wonder if my place is still there,'' Gibson said. 'When I got home, sure enough, it wasn't there.' The 'Mad Max' actor is one of many Hollywood stars who have lost their homes, with others affected including Billy Crystal, Paris Hilton and Cary Elwes. Gibson noted that he was surprised by the intensity of the damage and by what seemed to be the randomness of which houses were destroyed in his neighborhood. '(The area) was completely toasted. I've never seen such a complete burn,' Gibson told Vargas, saying he isn't sure if he'll rebuild there but that he was grateful for the generosity of those living nearby and the fact his family was safe. As of Thursday afternoon, the Los Angeles wildfires have burned nearly 29,000 acres, destroyed thousands of structures and forced almost 180,000 people to evacuate their homes. Five have died as a result of the fires.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/mel-gibson-loses-malibu-home-wildfires/	2025-01-09T16:00:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192365794.jpg?w=900
Drones spotted at nuclear power plant in southern Minnesota	(NewsNation) — Police in southern Minnesota saw two drones flying around a nuclear plant Wednesday but were unable to identify the pilot. Shortly after 6:30 p.m., local dispatch received a call about 'four to five' drones flying around the Prairie Island Nuclear Plant in Welch, Minnesota, according to a news release from the Red Wing Police Department. Mystery drones: Where have they been spotted? When officers arrived, they spotted two drones flying around the nuclear plant and Lock and Dam #3. The officers continued to monitor the drones until they left the area, the release said. Police were unable to locate the drone pilot or pilots. 'There is no active threat to the public and the incident is not currently under active investigation by the Red Wing Police Department,' the release said. Why is it hard to identify drones? Drones are prohibited from flying over nuclear power plants and other 'sensitive facilities,' according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Prairie Island is one of two nuclear power plants in Minnesota. It's located along the Mississippi River near the Wisconsin border.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/drones-nuclear-plant-minnesota/	2025-01-09T15:08:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1311146754.jpg?w=900
We were a neighborhood': LA County wildfire victim	(NewsNation) — The two palm trees that stand in front of what was once the home of a victim of the Palisades fire are named for her twin grandsons. They now serve as a reminder of what once was in the Altadena community of Los Angeles County. The remains of the brick home are part of a neighborhood devastated by the wildfires that have burned tens of thousands of acres and have left at least five people dead. But the home’s owner, who identified herself as Fran, tells NewsNation that neighbors are now coming together to cope. Fran told NewsNation she and her husband have lived in the community for 26 years. After the wildfires began earlier this week, she and others are putting together the pieces of their lives that have been torn apart. How to help victims of LA wildfires 'We were a neighborhood,' she said. '(We) helped one another, greeted one another. We’re always here for one another, and we’re still going to be here for one another.' Fran described the community as a beautiful place made up of smaller homes and a collection of residents who raised their children in the same quiet neighborhood. 'It was friendly,' she told NewsNation. 'A good place to be.' Fran said after the wildfires began earlier this week, she learned she had 20 minutes to evacuate. She said she wasn’t able to collect much and was left feeling scrambled. Her neighbors grabbed the possessions they could and left. Within an hour of the fires being reported, the homes in her neighborhood were gone. 'We still can’t believe it,' Fran told NewsNation. 'None of us has anywhere to go. Nowhere to go.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/neighborhood-wildfire-victim/	2025-01-09T13:01:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192444689.jpg?w=900
Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report	(NewsNation) — Total damage from the devastating wildfires scorching Southern California could amount to between $135 billion to $150 billion, according to AccuWeather, a private company specializing in weather data. The wildfires were previously estimated to cost around $50 billion, $10 billion of which is expected to be insured, according to JPMorgan. As homeowners try to recover from the fires, they could face challenges. Many homeowners in California have already experienced difficulty getting insurance, and some have had their insurance canceled. Last summer in Pacific Palisades, 70% of State Farm customers, about 1,600 homeowners, lost coverage when the insurer dropped policies in and around the Santa Monica mountains. How to help victims of LA wildfires There are 9,000 households in Palisades alone, and more than 100,000 Californians have lost coverage since 2019, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. One resident, who was forced to evacuate and does not know if her home survived, received a letter from State Farm in March. 'We are sorry that we cannot continue this insurance, therefore your policy will not be renewed,' the letter read. 'Personal lines, homeowner and dwelling fire insurance policies that present the most substantial wildfire, fire following earthquake hazards, or that are in areas of significant concentration are no longer eligible.' Homeowners have largely replaced their fire coverage with a state plan of last resort called the California FAIR Plan — an insurance pool that covers up to $3 million in damages for residential properties and $20 million for commercial properties. This will be the first major test of the FAIR system. Trump says Newsom should resign as Los Angeles wildfires rage Insurers began dropping plans after 2017 and 2018 when back-to-back wildfires in California resulted in losses totaling $23 billion. Insurers paid out twice as much in claims as they received in premiums. That has left major insurers reluctant to do business in the state. Allstate dropped its business entirely in California in 2023, saying it would come back if regulatory changes were made to protect its bottom line. With similar issues facing Florida residents, the U.S. could see some significant population shifts as homeowners in two of the most populous states find they can't receive coverage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-wildfire-damage-50-billion/	2025-01-09T12:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192374864.jpg?w=900
LA fire damage likely to be the costliest in US history	(NewsNation) — The wildfires burning across Los Angeles could be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The blazes — which are ripping through some of the nation's priciest real estate — are likely to cause between $52 billion and $57 billion in damages and economic loss, according to a preliminary AccuWeather estimate. 'This is already one of the worst wildfires in California history,' AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said in a statement Wednesday. LA fires: Crews nationwide head to California to aid firefighters Some of the worst damage is located in Santa Monica and Malibu, where median home values are over $2 million, AccuWeather said. 'Should a large number of additional structures be burned in the coming days, it may become the worst wildfire in modern California history based on the number of structures burned and economic loss,' Porter noted. Home to nearly 10 million people, Los Angeles County is the most populated county in the U.S. and has properties worth more than $2 trillion in total. How to help victims of LA wildfires Los Angeles fire officials said Thursday that thousands of homes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades fire, the Los Angeles Times reported. Some of the biggest stars in Hollywood are among those who have lost homes, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Paris Hilton. 'Heartbroken beyond words,' Hilton wrote in an Instagram post of a news clip. 'Sitting with my family, watching the news, and seeing our home in Malibu burn to the ground on live TV is something no one should ever have to experience.' If AccuWeather's $52 billion estimate is correct, the Los Angeles fires could rank among the costliest disasters in U.S. history, most of which are hurricanes. Hurricane Katrina is the most expensive U.S. natural disaster, with an estimated cost of $200 billion, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A separate estimate from JPMorgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar also pegged total economic losses from the LA fires at close to $50 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. That total includes insured losses at more than $20 billion and 'even more if the fires are not controlled,' Bhullar said. Those losses would make the Los Angeles-area infernos the costliest wildfires in U.S. history. Previously, the Camp Fire in 2018 was the most destructive wildfire in history — causing an estimated $12.5 billion in insured losses, WSJ said. Another estimate put overall losses at $16.5 billion. AccuWeather's preliminary estimate includes both insured and uninsured losses, as well as the cost of evacuations and other economic impacts. But as the fires continue to burn around the Los Angeles area, there's a good chance the losses will worsen in the days ahead. At least 180,000 people have been ordered to evacuate and five have died as of Thursday morning.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-fire-damage-costliest/	2025-01-09T11:19:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192342935.jpg?w=900
Palisades resident describes 'apocalyptic' fires	(NewsNation) — Matt Wilmont filmed scenes of the Palisades wildfire from his motorcycle while attempting to get to a friend's house to check on the dwelling and his pets. Wilmont told NewsNation that he's never seen anything like this in his life, though he has been through several fires in Malibu. 'I've never ever, ever seen a fire like this in Los Angeles in my lifetime and I honestly don't think ever, because before my lifetime it was all orange groves and there was no population in the Valley and Hollywood was a fraction of what it is now because of development,' he said. How to help victims of LA wildfires Having grown up in Pacific Palisades, Wilmont says many landmarks dear to his heart have burned down, including Palisades High School. He wasn't able to reach the home but said thinks it may have made it. 'It was apocalyptic,' he said, 'I've seen these fires. They're never at this level of heat, at this level of smoke, never ever at this level of wind in such a population area.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/resident-apocalyptic-fires/	2025-01-09T11:08:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/wildfire_homepage_4.jpg?w=900
What we know about how the LA wildfires started	(NewsNation) — Several fast-moving wildfires continue to devastate the Los Angeles area, and investigators are working around the clock to figure out exactly what sparked the ferocious blazes. Thousands of acres have been scorched as wildfires continue to rip through parts of Los Angeles County. Five people have died, according to Nicole Nishida, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Officials said 130,000 residents are under evacuation orders because of the fires, and thousands have been displaced. What do we know about the start of the LA-area fires? Little is still known about how the fires started. The Los Angeles Fire Department’s arson investigation team is currently investigating the cause, Margaret Stewart, Los Angeles Fire Department public information officer, told NewsNation on Thursday.

(AP Photo/Ethan Swope) Online chatter, including from Elon Musk, has circulated speculation that arson could be the cause of the Sunset fire that sparked in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, but Stewart said that is still unknown. 'The cause of the fire will be investigated. Whether that's arson or not, that is to be determined,' she said. 'Our arson investigators are the ones that investigate the cause of the fire. That doesn't mean that it's an arson fire, it's a cause investigation.' Though it’s unclear what started the fires, it is more clear how they spread so quickly. How do wildfires start, and how long do they last? Weather conditions determine how much a wildfire grows, according to National Geographic. Wind, high temperatures and little rainfall can all leave trees and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays a big part, as well, as flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill. The Los Angeles wildfires are being fueled by what the National Weather Service said could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in over a decade, coupled with a prolonged drought in the area. 'It’s been bone dry from about Santa Barbara southward, only a few sprinkles since last season. So we’re going on 9 to 10 months now without meaningful rain,' Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, told NewsNation affiliate KTLA. What is being done to find out the cause of the LA fires? Stewart said the fire department is employing all resources to stop the fires and determine their cause, but winds have been challenging. How to help victims of LA wildfires 'The wind conditions that we are facing prevented us from being able to use all of our resources in the way that we would aim to use them, specifically our air assets. Since yesterday morning, all of our fast air assets have been working, and we've been in 24-hour operations, and so that will continue,' she said. How long could the fires last? While some of the five separate fires have been contained, it is still unknown how long the larger ones could last. The Sunset fire is 'under control,' Stewart said, adding that there are no more evacuations in the areas affected. The Woodley fire, which has burned 30 acres, is 'controlled,' and the Lidia Fire was 40% contained by Thursday morning. But it could be days and even weeks before the monstrous Palisades fire is taken down. As of Wednesday afternoon, the rapidly moving wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area has spread to more than 17,234 acres.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/how-la-wildfires-started/	2025-01-09T10:36:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/wildfire_homepage_1.jpg?w=900
LA County wildfires halt television production schedules	(NewsNation) — The wildfires that continue to burn around Los Angeles County have halted the production of several popular television shows including 'Grey’s Anatomy,' 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' 'NCIS' and 'Hacks' and have resulted in the cancellation of several Hollywood events. Film LA, which is the permitting agency for production shoots around Los Angeles, said in a statement that due to the wildfires that have brought 'unprecedented risk to life and property,' 'personnel resources ordinarily available' to support film production may not be available due to the local state of emergency. The statement also said that the Los Angeles Fire Department has specifically instructed that all permits for filming across Los Angeles communities of Altadena, La Crescentia, La Canada/Flintridge and unincorporated Pasadena be withdrawn. The agency said that other permits may be revoked. Winter storm producing snow, ice moves across the South Variety reported that although the sound stag;les where production has been halted are not affected directly by the fires themselves, the air quality is dangerous to the health of local residents. Several production companies, including NBC Universal, which includes shows including 'Hacks,' 'Loot' and 'Suits: LA;' CBS Studios ('NCIS', 'After Midnight' and 'The Neighborhood'); Warner Bros. ('Abbott Elementary,' 'All American') have closed due to the fires, Variety reported. NBC Universal officials told Variety that all of the major motion pictures the company has in production are currently being filmed outside of Los Angeles, the report indicated. Disney-20th Century Fox which produces 'Grey’s Anatomy' and 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' has also shut down production, the report said. The halt in production of the hit TV shows comes just more than a year after a nearly five-month strike that affected filming schedules around Hollywood. An agreement was reached in November 2023 after five days of marathon negotiations between unionized screenwriters and studios. Variety also reported that several premiers and other Hollywood events have canceled events due to the wildfires, which have burned tens of thousands of acres and are responsible for at least five deaths.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/wildfires-halt-television-production/	2025-01-09T10:24:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25007793599711.jpg?w=900

We can always use more, especially with this strength of wind. We could put an engine at every house and still have trouble with these 80-mile-an-hour gusts. the more the better. We will take as much as we can get. I know there's more resources on the way as we speak,' said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Brent Pascua. States along the East Coast, from New York to Florida, have also offered to assist if needed. What's the federal response to these fires? President Joe Biden has approved a major disaster declaration for California. The US Forest Service has air tankers working and extra ones on the way. Federal firefighting helicopters are there and ready as long as the winds allow, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved a grant to reimburse the state for firefighting costs. The California National Guard has also been deployed, and Navy helicopters with water delivery buckets are being sent to the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-fires-crews-nationwide-california-aid-firefighters/	2025-01-09T06:41:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192430789.jpg?w=900

How do wildfires start, and how long do they last?	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles wildfires are being fueled by what the National Weather Service said could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in over a decade. What's the cause of the LA fires? Cal Fire reports the actual cause of the fires is still under investigation. Los Angeles has declared a state of emergency as winds reach 35-55 mph, with higher gusts in the mountains and foothills. What to know about smoke from LA wildfires The death toll from the wildfires has risen to five, and more than 100,000 people are under evacuation orders, according to officials. Click here to view the LAPD’s interactive evacuation zone map. NewsNation's Chris Cuomo, who has covered wildfires for decades, believes we are 'nowhere near the end of it.' 'The reason the fires are growing in a way that we have rarely seen is that they are each and all being turbocharged by winds that are too much for everything and everyone,' Cuomo said. 'Nothing fuels fire like air. ... And the air is doing the most damage. The winds caused everything that we're seeing right now.' What causes wildfires? A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in wildland vegetation, often in rural areas, according to National Geographic. A lightning strike, or a human-made spark, are common causes of wildfires. However, it is often the weather conditions that determine how much a wildfire grows, according to National Geographic. Where are the Los Angeles area wildfires? Wind, high temperatures and little rainfall can all leave trees and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays a big part, as well, as flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill. In cities with roads near wildlife, such as in Southern California, it is very common for vehicles to accidentally ignite a fire, Luca Carmignani, a fire adviser from the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, previously told USA TODAY.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/how-wildfires-los-angeles-start/	2025-01-08T21:28:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/gettyimages-2192423453-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Fast-moving Sunset Fire erupts in Hollywood Hills, evacuations or...	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) - A fast-moving wildfire erupted in the Hollywood Hills, prompting a mandatory evacuation order for a wide area of the historic Hollywood entertainment district. Crews with the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to reports of the flames at 2350 Solar Drive, near Astral Drive, just after 5:30 p.m. Fire officials estimated the wildfire had charred at least 20 acres in the Runyon Canyon area as of 6:30 p.m., and upgraded it to 50 acres at around 8:15 p.m. A map showing evacuation zones for the Sunset Fire in Hollywood as of 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 8, 2024. (LAFD) Immediate mandatory evacuation were issued for residents on 'Laurel Canyon Blvd to the west, Hollywood Blvd to the south, Cahuenga Blvd/101 Fwy/Highland Ave. to the east and Mulholland Drive to the north,' officials said. The L.A. Emergency Alerts system advised residents near the fire to prepare for possible evacuation orders. 'This could be a critical situation. If you look at the top of the ridges where the embers are blowing off, the smoke is moving sideways, everything is moving horizontally, which means it’s going to be sending those embers way downrange,' Retired L.A. County Fire Cpt. Bob Goldman told KTLA. Aerial footage from Sky5 captured the balcony of one structure on fire, near Franklin Avenue and Vista Street, though firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze before it caused too much damage. Footage also showed water-dropping aircraft making runs at the flames on the southwestern side of the Sunset Fire where officials said the most intense activity was occurring. 'At the heel of the fire, active flames have been extinguished, though smoldering continues within the interior,' L.A. County Sheriff's officials said in a post to X. An evacuation shelter was established Pan Pacific Recreation Center, located at 7600 Beverly Blvd, L.A., 90036. An additional evacuation shelter has been set up at Hollywood High School, located at 1521 Highland Avenue, L.A., 90028. A voluntary evacuation zone was announced for a portion of Beverly Hills, according to the fire department, in areas north of Sunset and east of Coldwater Canyon Dr. Sheriff's officials in West Hollywood also advised residents to make way for emergency personnel.

Fire crews were already stretched incredibly thin while battling several other ongoing wildfires, including the nearly 16,000-acre Palisades Fire, which has destroyed an estimated 1,000 structures and the 10,600-acre Eaton Fire in Altadena and Pasadena that has, so far, claimed the lives of five people. While battling the Palisades Fire, crews struggled with poor water pressure and, in some cases, no water coming from fire hydrants that 'went dry' due to high demand on the city's water infrastructure. It is unclear if firefighters are still dealing with the issue.

Celebrities among those who lost homes as devastating Los Angeles...	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Wildfires that are burning in and around Los Angeles have burned the homes of several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Paris Hilton. California firefighters are battling wind-whipped fires tearing across the area, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled and straining resources as the fires burned uncontained Wednesday. Crystal and his wife, Janice, released a statement Wednesday saying their home of 45 years in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood was lost. 'Janice and I lived in our home since 1979. We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can’t be taken away. We are heartbroken of course but with the love of our children and friends we will get through this,' the Crystals wrote in the statement. Their neighborhood is a hillside area along the coast dotted with celebrity residences and memorialized by the Beach Boys in their 1960s hit 'Surfin’ USA.' In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways became impassable when scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases. 'Evacuated Malibu so last minute,' wrote Hamill in an Instagram post Tuesday night. 'Small fires on both sides of the road as we approached (the Pacific Coast Highway).' Less than 72 hours before, Hollywood’s highest-wattage stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes’ red carpet, the first major event of the exuberant and, for many, triumphant awards season. The revelry of awards season had quickly been snuffed out, too: Premieres of contenders like 'Better Man' and 'The Last Showgirl' were canceled, the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations were announced via press release instead of at a live event and weekend events like the AFI Awards were preemptively scrubbed. The Oscar nominations are also being delayed two days to Jan. 19 and the film academy has extended the voting window to accommodate members affected by the fires. Here's how celebrities and entertainment companies are being impacted by the fires burning in and around Los Angeles: Stars who lost homes in the wildfires Moore lost her home in the Altadena neighborhood near Pasadena. 'Honestly, I’m in shock and feeling numb for all so many have lost, including my family. My children’s school is gone. Our favorite restaurants, leveled. So many friends and loved ones have lost everything too,' the actor-singer wrote on Instagram in a post that included video of devastated streets in the foothill suburb. 'Our community is broken but we will be here to rebuild together. Sending love to all affected and on the front lines trying to get this under control,' Moore wrote. The Crystals expressed a similar sentiment about the Palisades. 'The Pacific Palisades is a resilient community of amazing people and we know in time it will rise again. It is our home,' they wrote. Elwes, the star of 'The Princess Bride' and numerous other films, wrote on Instagram Wednesday that his family was safe but their home had burned in the coastal Palisades fire. 'Sadly we did lose our home but we are grateful to have survived this truly devastating fire,' Elwes wrote. Hilton posted a news video clip on Instagram and said it included footage of her destroyed home in Malibu. 'This home was where we built so many precious memories. It’s where Phoenix took his first steps and where we dreamed of building a lifetime of memories with London,' she said, referencing her young children. 'The devastation is unimaginable. To know so many are waking up today without the place they called home is truly heartbreaking,' she wrote. Stars who have evacuated due to Palisades fire Jamie Lee Curtis said Wednesday on Instagram that her family is safe, but she suggested her neighborhood and possibly her home is on fire. She said many of her friends lost their homes. 'It's a terrifying situation and I'm grateful to the firefighters and all of the good Samaritans who are helping people get out of the way of the blaze.' Other stars who have homes in the area include Adam Sandler, Ben Affleck, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Many are awaiting word on whether their homes survived the flames. James Woods posted footage Tuesday of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Later, he confirmed he had evacuated and added: 'It tests your soul, losing everything at once, I must say.' Impact of the fire so far Officials didn’t give an estimate of structures damaged or destroyed in the wildfire, but they said at least 70,000 residents were under evacuation orders and nearly 30,000 structures were under threat. The fire burned down Temescal Canyon, a popular hiking area surrounded by dense neighborhoods of multimillion-dollar homes. Flames jumped famous Sunset Boulevard and burned parts of the Palisades Charter High School, which has been featured in many Hollywood productions including the 1976 horror movie 'Carrie,' the 2003 remake of 'Freaky Friday' and the TV series 'Teen Wolf.' The Palisades fire also destroyed the historic ranch house that belonged to Hollywood legend Will Rogers. It was among multiple structures destroyed at both Will Rogers State Historic Park and Topanga State Park. The historic Topanga Ranch Motel, built by William Randolph Hearst in 1929, also burned down. Rogers’ ranch, built on land he bought in the 1920s, occupied some 359 acres in what is now Pacific Palisades. It included a 31-room ranch house, a stable, golf course and riding trails. His wife donated it to California State Parks in 1944. The Critics Choice Awards, originally scheduled for Sunday, have been postponed until Feb. 26. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park closed for the day due to the smoky and windy conditions and the J. Paul Getty Trust said two of its museums, the Getty Villa and Getty Center, would remain closed for the next few days. Universal Studios also canceled shooting for numerous series, including 'Hacks,' 'Ted Lasso' and 'Suits LA.' The Walt Disney Co. closed its headquarters in Burbank, and canceled production on several series, including 'Grey’s Anatomy' and 'Doctor Odyssey.' ABC’s 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' which tapes in Hollywood, was canceled for Wednesday and will instead air a repeat. The production pauses added to further disruptions to the film and TV industry in Los Angeles, including the cancellation of the premiere to Universal’s 'Wolf Man' and postponement of the American Film Institute awards gala, scheduled for Friday. ___ AP Entertainment Writers Jake Coyle, Jocelyn Noveck, Lindsey Bahr and Jonathan Landrum Jr. contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/ap-celebrities-among-thousands-evacuated-in-los-angeles-fires/	2025-01-08T20:31:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/677f5234199e20.31130196.jpeg?w=900

The 'quad-demic': What is it, and how can you stay healthy?	(NewsNation) — Staying healthy in the New Year presents a new challenge for Americans who are coping with what health officials are calling a 'quad-demic,' which involves a quartet of infectious viruses that are making the rounds. Each of the maladies can target different groups and age ranges, but here’s what you need to know to avoid contracting these illnesses and some tips for remaining healthy. What is the quad-demic? Although the trifecta of flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are commonly paired, norovirus outbreaks around the United States have added to concerns of a quad-demic. 'All of the viruses are here, it’s just they’re affecting different areas a little bit differently,' Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told Fortune. What is HMPV, and should we fear another pandemic? Flu Cases of influenza, or the flu, reached 40 million between 2023-2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Most people recover from the flu within days to a couple of weeks, but some cases can become severe. Approximately 28,000 people died last flu season. Flu symptoms include: Fever or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue COVID-19 COVID-19 has become a part of life just as the flu once did. Cases are nowhere near as high as they were when the virus was first introduced, but the U.S. is still seeing positive tests, hospitalizations and deaths. COVID-19 antigen home tests indicating a positive result are photographed in New York. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) Between Oct. 1, 2024, and Dec. 14, 2024, the CDC estimates there were between 2.7 and nearly 5 million illnesses. Hospitalizations in major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York were all up sharply as the year came to an end and as 2025 began. COVID-19 symptoms include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sore throat Congestion or runny nose New loss of taste or smell Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea COVID-19 and flu symptoms are similar, but they are caused by different viruses. 'You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same,' the CDC advises. Anyone experiencing symptoms should take a COVID-19 test, which can be found at testing sites, your doctor’s office or over-the-counter at pharmacies. RSV RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs, usually peaking in December and January. The symptoms are similar to the common cold and other respiratory infections like the flu and COVID-19. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Infants and older adults are most susceptible. RSV can cause other illnesses like bronchiolitis, which is the inflammation of the lungs’ small airways, and pneumonia. RSV symptoms include: Runny nose Congestion Decrease in appetite Coughing Sneezing Fever Wheezing The CDC warns not all symptoms will appear at once and may come in stages. Infants may experience only irritability, decreased activity and breathing difficulties without the other symptoms. Norovirus The stomach bug is striking again. Norovirus is highly contagious, spreads through contact and causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines. This electron microscope image provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a cluster of norovirus virions. (Charles D. Humphrey/CDC via AP, File) The CDC reports about 19 to 21 million annual cases. People of all ages can get norovirus, but more severe infections occur in children younger than 5 years old, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Norovirus symptoms typically develop within 12-48 hours of exposure. They include: Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Fever Headache Body aches Dehydration What areas are affected? The illnesses are hitting various pockets of the country, according to Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director for the Infection Control and Prevention program at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Increases in flu cases have been the most problematic around the country, Hawkinson told NewsNation. New cases of COVID-19 are also being reported after the number of positive cases dropped following a spike over the summer months, he said. How to prevent getting sick Doctors are encouraging Americans who have not gotten a flu shot or the latest COVID-19 vaccine to avoid contracting one or more of the prevalent viruses. According to the CDC, 40.8% of adults have gotten the flu vaccine, while just 20% of Americans have been vaccinated for COVID-19 this season. A vaccine for RSV is also available for residents who are 75 years of age or older or those who live with certain health conditions. RSV vaccines are generally available to anyone 60 years of age or older, Hawkinson said. However, if residents got the RSV shot last year when the vaccine was first released, they do not need to get a second dose. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } There is currently no vaccine for norovirus, but doctors say the best way to avoid this virus is to follow good hygiene practices, including regular handwashing. Hawkinson told NewsNation it is not too late to get a flu shot. On average, 10 to 14 days are normally required to build up immunity to a virus after a vaccine has been administered. Flu shots that are administered now can still be effective, Hawkinson said. Are masks making a comeback? Masks became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic, and usage in places like hospitals, doctor's offices and dental practices remained in place. Now, some of those requirements are making a comeback. Amid threats of the quad-demic, hospitals such as Duke Health in North Carolina and Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts updated their masking and visitor guidelines, the Daily Mail reported. Hospitals in at least eight states including Wisconsin, California, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey and New York are either requiring or strongly recommending masks in their facilities, the report said. Exposure and hygiene are key in preventing all four illnesses, including hand-washing and staying home when ill. While requirements and mandates in medical facilities are changing, masks in public places like restaurants, bars and gyms remain a personal preference.

It is terrifying': Pacific Palisades resident details evacuation	(NewsNation) — Tricia Cosentino does not yet have much information to go on, but she fears the worst about the status of her Pacific Palisades home and tutoring business as several Los Angeles County wildfires rage on. Cosentino told NewsNation she has received text messages that suggest Palisades Village, a local shopping center, 'is totally gone' and the block where her business is located 'doesn’t exist anymore.' How to help victims of LA wildfires As far as her Palisades home goes, that too is unknown. Cosentino said she watched the wildfire before first responders arrived and did not believe it would be problematic. Thirty minutes later, she was running through her home to collect her belongings, including family mementos. Cosentino lives in Palisades Highlands, a canyon neighborhood located in the Santa Monica mountains. Even when her neighbors were ordered to evacuate, she said she was still not all that worried. As time passed, though, she said the situation intensified. Cosentino said she and family members had wet towels on their faces and that both hillsides were on fire as the family tried to make their way out of the neighborhood. 'I realized I couldn’t see, and I had no choice but to turn around and go back,' she said. An hour later, Cosentino said her family realized they were not safe at home. The family entered a long line that was part of the police escort and felt they were out of danger. As the family was escorted to the beach, Cosentino told her son to cover his face to shield him from seeing what was happening around them. 'When you looked behind (you), the hills were burning,' Cosentino said. She said her neighborhood is now in flames and that the reservoir that typically provides water to firefighters is empty. She said she has friends who have lost their homes along Pacific Coast Highway. LA wildfire evacuee abandons car, told ‘run for your life’ She says smoke is now billowing over the Pacific Ocean. 'It is terrifying,' Cosentino said. Cosentino said every time she receives a text message, it is from another person who has lost their home. Her tutoring center serves 150 students, Cosentino said. With their schools now gone, she said she hopes to help the pupils in any way she can. Cosentino said her husband owns a home in Ojai, 65 miles from Pacific Palisades, and that he is safe. But her community as she knows it — including historic buildings and the local theater where her daughter participated in plays — is now gone. She said she does not know if her home is still standing. 'That community — we are like a family,' Cosentino said. 'We are all displaced. … It’s really hard to wrap your head around the fact that everything you have and everyone you know is in the same situation.' 'It’s a nightmare, and we’re going to get through it,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/terrifying-pacific-palisades-details-evacuation/	2025-01-08T13:19:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25008142636991.jpg?w=900
Biden visited Los Angeles area fire station for wildfire briefing	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden visited a fire station in the Los Angeles area for a briefing as firefighters continue to battle the raging wildfires that have engulfed the area. Biden was joined by First lady Jill Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom at the Santa Monica Fire Station #5 for the brief visit. The president posted on X Tuesday that he would be providing any 'federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire.'

(NewsNation) — A Pacific Palisades resident says their community has 'lost' so much as wildfires continue to ravage the Los Angeles area. Pacific Palisades community council member Sue Kohl told NewsNation that embers from the massive wildfires blew over their entire town igniting much of the area. 'We've lost our churches, schools, pharmacies, restaurants, both supermarkets. hundreds and hundreds of homes,' she said. LA area wildfires: Two dead,’high number’ of injuries reported 'Those of us who live down below and what was always considered the safer areas, the place you not in the hills, these embers because of the winds blew out of those hills and went over the entire town.' Multiple wildfires are ripping through parts of Los Angeles County, all at 0% containment as of Wednesday morning. Two people were reported dead in the Eaton Fire, which is in the Angeles National Forest and Altadena area of Los Angeles County and Pasadena, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said. Officials have said more than 80,000 people are under evacuation orders because of all the fires. Kohl said she and many of the residents evacuated Tuesday, but the town still needs more firefighters to help battle the massive blaze. 'We don't have enough LAPD firemen and frankly with the winds the way they are, I mean, I don’t know what enough would look like because they're fighting an impossible battle,' Kohl said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/pacific-palisades-resident-says-community-lost-much/	2025-01-08T10:56:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25008142636991.jpg?w=900

UnitedHealth units ordered to pay $165M for misleading consumers	(NewsNation) — Three UnitedHealth-owned insurance companies must pay more than $165 million for deceptive conduct that misled thousands of consumers into unknowingly buying supplemental health insurance in Massachusetts. In a December order, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Helene Kazanjian said penalties stem from marketing practices between 2012 and 2016 by HealthMarkets and its two subsidiaries, The Chesapeake Life Insurance Company and HealthMarkets Insurance Agency, which were found to violate the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. The ruling follows a non-jury trial to assess damages after the companies were already deemed liable. What kind of masks protect from wildfire smoke? Kazanjian said sales agents were trained to hide policy costs from consumers, calling it 'egregious,' and 'targeting vulnerable consumers who could least afford their products. The nearly $50.1 million in restitution and $115.1 million in civil penalties awarded by Kazanjian was less than the $368 million sought by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell's office. Campbell hailed Kazanjian's decision, saying it awarded the state the largest civil penalties it has ever recovered under the state's consumer protection law. Want to avoid the stomach flu? Here's how to do it In a statement, UnitedHealthcare said it would appeal the decision, which is 'clearly unsupported by the evidence and contrary to established Massachusetts law,' according to Reuters. In 2020, Campbell's predecessor, now-Governor Maura Healey, accused HealthMarkets of a deceptive scheme cheating more than 15,000 residents out of more than $43.5 million since 2011, violating a 2009 settlement. In 2022, a different state court judge found HealthMarkets liable, leading to a damages trial in 2023.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/unitedhealth-units-pay-165m-misleading-consumers/	2025-01-08T08:46:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6733dc0fd18934.56547248.jpeg?w=900
LA County Fires: Evacuate as soon as you can, councilmember says	(NewsNation) — As wildfires ravage parts of southern California, Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president of the Los Angeles City Council, says people should leave the picture-taking to the professionals. 'We have people out trying to get videos for Tiktok and to help Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook or Instagram. We don't need your video on this,' Harris-Dawson told 'Morning in America' Wednesday. 'There's plenty of footage from the professionals — go inside, go to a place that is safe, and stay off the roads as much as possible.' While Harris-Dawson can understand some people also want to stay to protect their property, the problem with that is the potential danger to neighbors. Photos: Los Angeles wildfire engulfs Pacific Palisades 'Emergency resources may have to come and pull you out,' Harris-Dawson said. Tens of thousands of people are evacuating as three wildfires rip through parts of Los Angeles County. They were all at 0% containment as of Wednesday morning. 'We advise everybody, when there's an evacuation order, or even if you think there might be danger, evacuate as soon as you possibly can,' Harris-Dawson urged. 'Other than that, we're asking everybody that can stay off the roads so that our roads are open for emergency vehicles.' For those living in the neighborhoods affected by the fires, 'it is completely terrifying,' Harris-Dawson said. 'This is one of the mightiest sets of fires that we've seen in Southern California,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-county-fires-evacuate-soon-councilmember/	2025-01-08T07:23:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25008142636991.jpg?w=900
Cybertruck driver used ChatGPT to plan Las Vegas attack, police s...	LAS VEGAS (KLAS) – Police found a six-page manifesto on Matthew Livelsberger’s phone and said he used ChatGPT to plan his New Year's Day bombing at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a news conference Tuesday. Livelsberger, 37, shot himself in the head just before fireworks and other explosive material detonated in the back of a Tesla Cybertruck parked at the front entrance of the hotel. Livelsberger, a Green Beret in the U.S. Army Special Forces, was home on leave in Colorado Springs, Colorado, when he rented the Cybertruck and drove to Las Vegas. The explosion was set off using racing fuel and birdshot, the ATF said Tuesday. The blast was not triggered by a detonator but by an unknown 'flame,' which could include the gunshot Livelsberger used to kill himself. Cybertruck tracking in Las Vegas case raises privacy concerns Police suspect Livelsberger initially planned an attack at the Grand Canyon, potentially to launch off the glass skywalk there, but diverted to Las Vegas, police said based off more documents discovered on his phone. LVMPD Asst. Sheriff Dori Koren said police still do not know why he chose Trump Tower instead. During a news conference last week, FBI Special Agent In Charge Spencer Evans said Livelsberger didn't hold any animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump or Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In the manifesto, police found a 'variance of grievances' including political and social issues, such as criticisms of the current administration. Livelsberger wrote he had 'graphic encounters' replaying in his head from the Army and that he only intended to harm himself. Asst. Sheriff Koren said this added to the evidence previously discussed that Livelsberger likely suffered from PTSD. Vegas Cybertruck explosion driver ID’d as Army soldier from Colorado: Source Police also said Livelsberger used ChatGPT to help plan out the attack. A few of the entries posted in the application included 'How much Tannerite is equivalent to 1 pound of TNT?' and 'What pistol could set it off?' Other questions asked to ChatGPT included where to buy fireworks and the location of the largest gun store in Denver. 'We are saddened by this incident and committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly,' a spokesperson from OpenAI, who owns ChatGPT, said in a statement. 'Our models are designed to refuse harmful instructions and minimize harmful content. In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities. We're working with law enforcement to support their investigation.' 'This investigation is far from over,' McMahill, adding there was still a laptop, another phone, and a smartwatch to go through data on.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/cybertruck-driver-used-chatgpt-las-vegas-attack/	2025-01-08T03:37:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Untitled_1e3208-e1736297913812.png?w=800
Fierce overnight winds expected to fuel Pacific Palisades fire	(NEXSTAR) – Tens of thousands of residents were placed under evacuation orders Tuesday after a rapidly-spreading wildfire ripped through the affluent Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, according to Nexstar's KTLA. During a press conference Tuesday afternoon, California Gov. Gavin Newsom confirmed that he saw 'many structures' already destroyed by the fire and warned residents that intense, Santa Ana winds were expected to continue overnight between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. 'By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,' Newsom said. The Palisades fire was first reported around 10:30 a.m. PDT Tuesday in the 1100 block of North Piedra Morada Drive. By 3:30 p.m., the fire had exploded to more than 1,200 acres and was expected to keep growing amid strong Santa Ana winds.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel) There was no containment as of Tuesday afternoon, according to CalFire. By sundown, the fire had exploded to more than 2,900 acres and was expected to keep growing amid strong Santa Ana winds. Over 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders Tuesday evening. Evacuations were ordered for the entire community down to the Pacific Ocean, according to CalFire. The evacuation order also included areas of Malibu east of Las Flores. Evacuees were urged to travel south toward Pacific Coast Highway utilizing Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,' Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour.' The blaze ignited on a day when fire officials were bracing for gusts of up to 100 miles an hour, a speed the National Weather Service described as 'life-threatening,' 'extreme' and 'destructive.' The high winds combined with unseasonably dry conditions to make the situation even more combustible. Interactive 3D map shows Palisades Fire perimeter, evacuation zones More than 100 firefighters and pre-positioned strike teams were battling the blaze Tuesday, David Ortiz of the LAFD said. 'This is pretty much the worst possible scenario for a firefight,' said Ortiz. There was no initial estimate for the number of structures damaged or destroyed. However, news footage showed several homes ablaze. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Ortiz described the fire as a blowtorch and urged residents to follow orders if asked to leave. 'Do not stand in the way of this fire,' Ortiz said. Video from Alert California showed a large plume of smoke rising over the Santa Monica Mountains. KTLA spoke with actor Steve Guttenberg who said he was helping to move cars along Palisades Drive so fire trucks could get through and evacuees could leave. 'There are families up there, there are pets up there, there are people who really need help,' Guttenberg said. 'It's really important for people to help each other ... don't worry about your personal property, just get out. I have friends up there that can't get out right now and they've been given evacuation orders.' Fire crews have even resorted to using a bulldozer to move parked cars out of the way. The fierce Santa Ana winds driving the blaze arrived Tuesday along with morning snow in mountainous communities and inland rainfall, making for 'a rather bizarre forecast,' KTLA meteorologist Henry DiCarlo said. Pacific Palisades is located about 10 miles from Malibu, where the Franklin Fire burned more than 4,000 acres and burned several homes after erupting during similar windy conditions in December.

What could Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ look like?	President-elect Trump said that Republicans are working to craft a 'powerful' piece of legislation to advance his agenda. Republicans had already begun preparing to use a special procedure known as budget reconciliation to bypass Democratic opposition in the Senate to extend expiring provisions in Trump’s signature 2017 tax law. But calls have grown in the party in recent months to use the maneuver to enact other parts of Trump’s agenda, including border security. Divides have emerged among Republicans over how to act on those priorities, including whether a two-package or one-package approach is preferable, as leadership faces a tall task to keep the party unified behind a strategy — particularly the narrow House GOP majority. Here are some of the ideas that Republicans have floated including. Tax cuts Extending key parts of Trump’s signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been a top-of-mind issue for many congressional Republicans as they chart out their reconciliation wishlist. That includes individual provisions that are set to expire later this year, which, if lapsed, would mean higher income tax rates for most earners, a lower standard deduction, and a rollback of the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, among other changes. Republicans have signaled there could be some added tweaks, with Trump also reiterating his proposal to end taxes on tips. 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before,' he wrote on his Truth Social site this week. 'We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even better - NO TAX ON TIPS.' Border security Border security has also emerged as a key provision of whatever reconciliation bill Republicans attempt to pass. But they disagree on whether to pass it in one package with tax provisions, or in a separate, smaller package that can be done more quickly. 'Delaying border security is a dangerous idea,' Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. 'If you can do it all in April, maybe it works, but I’m very leery.' Republicans have floated funding for border wall construction and additional detention beds, though specifics are still under discussion. Trump, who said on Tuesday that he thinks he was elected 'largely because of the border,' has indicated he prefers one large bill, but signaled openness to a two-package approach. 'I like one big beautiful bill and I always have,' Trump said on Tuesday. 'I always will, but if two is more certain, it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff.' Trump additionally voiced support for taking action on areas like energy and defense as part of the potential package.His comments come as some Republicans have also raised concern over how tax reforms would fare under the two-pronged given the difficulty of moving two budget reconciliation packages, particularly when considering the party’s slim control in the House. Debt limit Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on Tuesday that part of the plan is for Republicans to act on the nation’s debt limit using the reconciliation process. 'The intention is to handle the debt limit in reconciliation in the process, and that way, as the Republican Party, the party in charge of both chambers, we then get to determine the details of that,' Johnson told reporters. 'If it runs through regular order or regular process and as a standalone, or as part of the appropriations, for example, then you have to have both parties negotiating, and we feel like we’re in better stead to do it ourselves,' he also said. Trump previously called on Republicans to act on the nation’s debt ceiling as part of a bipartisan deal that averted a government shutdown in December. But that effort fell flat as Democrats and some conservatives pushed back on the demand. The party out of power — which Democrats are this year — can demand major concessions in return for agreeing to raise the debt limit. Republicans successfully used the strategy in the last Congress to secure a deal with President Biden that suspended the debt ceiling through the end of 2024, along with caps on some federal spending. Spending cuts Republicans have also discussed the prospect of a deal to pair a $1.5 trillion increase in the debt limit with $2.5 trillion in spending cuts using budget reconciliation. At the time news broke of the handshake agreement last month, Republicans said the focus of the cuts would be mandatory spending, which also covers entitlement funding. Democrats seized on the news at the time, accusing Republicans of wanting to set sights on Social Security, but the special budget maneuver cannot be used to make changes to the program. Johnson appeared to rule out Republicans pursuing Medicare cuts as part of the reconciliation process when asked by CNN recently. 'No,' the Speaker said, adding Trump 'has made very clear, Social Security and Medicare have to be preserved and we are not, no one is coming in with the intention of cutting benefits in any way or anything.'

LA wildfire evacuee abandons car, told 'run for your life'	(NewsNation) — Ellen Bacher abandoned her car while fleeing the wildfire in Pacific Palisades Highlands after police approached her and said, 'Get out of your car, run for your life, and head toward the ocean.' Bacher, who has lived in the Highland section for 38 years, said her community knows there's only one road in and one way out, though they’ve always had a fire lane. 'The problem with this particular fire is the fire lane was on fire,' Bacher said during a Tuesday appearance on 'Banfield.' 'The bottom of Palisades Drive was on fire, so most people were trapped.' Bacher compared her day to the aftermath of 9/11, expressing gratitude for reaching safety with her family now safe in Long Beach. Palisades fire causes state of emergency declaration The rapidly moving blaze has spread to more than 2,900 acres, prompting mandatory immediate evacuations of nearby residents. There are 250 LAFD firefighters on scene, along with 46 engines, three trucks and five helicopters, officials said. Roughly 30,000 residents from 10,000 households have been ordered to evacuate.

How to stay safe during Southern California’s latest Santa Ana wind event 'Angelenos should be advised that the windstorm is expected to worsen tonight through tomorrow morning and to heed warnings, stay vigilant and stay safe,' the city recommended. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he reached out to President Joe Biden, who was in California when the blaze began and has started the process for receiving emergency funds. Newsom has declared a state of emergency.

What kind of masks protect from wildfire smoke?	(NewsNation) — With nearly 3000 acres burning in Califonia, health experts say N95 respirator masks offer the best protection against harmful wildfire smoke, provided they are worn correctly and fit properly. The masks, readily available at hardware stores and pharmacies, can filter out fine particles found in smoke that can irritate eyes, nose, throat and lungs, according to public health officials. However, they do not protect against hazardous gases sometimes present in smoke. Health officials emphasize that proper fit is crucial. The mask should have two straps that go around the head, seal tightly to the face, and be certified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 1,260 acres in hours Single-strap paper dust and surgical masks do not adequately protect from wildfire smoke. The most effective protection remains to stay indoors and limit outdoor activity during smoky conditions. Those who must be outside should take frequent breaks, as breathing through respirator masks requires more effort. Health officials warn that masks should be discarded when breathing becomes difficult, if they become damaged, or if the inside becomes dirty. They also note that respirator masks are not approved for children and will not work effectively for people with facial hair.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/masks-protect-wildfire-smoke/	2025-01-07T19:25:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/03/Masks-1-1-1.jpg?w=900
Migrant group being held near Acapulco by Mexican officials	(NewsNation) — Nearly 100 migrants who were part of a larger caravan moving from southern Mexico toward the U.S. southern border are being held in the coastal resort of Acapulco as part of an effort to keep them from crossing into the United States illegally. The migrants, who were part of a larger group who began traveling from Tapachula, Mexico, were originally traveling toward Juarez, Mexico, which is located just miles from the border and El Paso, Texas. However, as part of an operation known as 'Operation Carousel,' government officials are now breaking up migrant groups and are negotiating with them to travel to other Mexican states, sources told NewsNation. Facebook to end fact-checking, boost political content The dissolving of migrant caravans comes just two weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. The effort is being carried out to disperse migrants throughout the country to keep them far from the U.S. border, The Associated Press reported. The breaking up of the caravans also keeps large groups from accumulating in any one place. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has addressed the issue of deportations prior to Trump’s second term, making a surprising reversal on previous policy promises. Last month, Sheinbaum said Mexico would push the United States to send non-Mexican deportees to their countries of origin — now, she’s announced that Mexico is open to accepting foreign nationals. The policy of 'dispersion and exhaustion' has moved to the forefront of Mexican government officials’ immigration policy in recent years, according to the AP. Last year, it significantly reduced the number of immigrants reaching the U.S.-Mexico border, a former government official told the AP. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico over the migration of immigrants into the United States illegally. As part of Operation Carousel, Mexican authorities allow immigrants to walk for days before offering them a bus to various cities. Once there, they are promised to have their immigration status reviewed, the AP reported. A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told NewsNation the agency consistently monitors reports of mass migration to the U.S. southern border and stands ready to address any potential increase in migrant encounters. 11 migrants found locked in U-Haul in rural New Mexico President Joe Biden signed an executive order last year geared at securing the border. Under the presidential proclamation and the securing the border rule, noncitizens who cross into the United States without authorization will generally be ineligible for asylum. Migrants can face significant consequences, including removal from the United States, a five-year bar to return to the U.S., and potential additional criminal penalties that remain on their permanent record for years. 'We are aware of recent reports of a migrant caravan that has materialized in Southern Mexico, as we hear about several times per year,' the CBP spokesperson said. 'These reported caravans generally travel very slowly and often splinter before they make progress moving northbound towards the southwest border. The spokesperson said that the agency will continue to monitor developments in coordination with our foreign and interagency counterparts as we have with previous movements of migrants.' Although there has been a drop in encounters between illegal immigrants and immigration officials, smugglers and other 'bad actors' are continuing to spread false information that disregards the safety of vulnerable migrants, CBP officials said. 'The fact remains: the United States continues to enforce immigration law, and our borders are not open for those without a legal basis to enter the country,' the spokesperson said.

Actor Steve Guttenberg jumps into action as brush fire burns in P...	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — A wind-whipped brush fire is burning in Pacific Palisades, and large plumes of smoke can be seen for miles, but one well-known actor is jumping in to help. Residents evacuating the area were met with slow traffic along Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard near Highland Village. Numerous fire engines were in the area as crews battled the nearby flames. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 770 acres in hours During this time, many have jumped into action, like actor Steve Guttenberg who lives nearby. The actor told NewsNation affiliate KTLA that he has friends who are unable to evacuate because of the traffic jam on Palisades Drive. 'There are people stuck up there. So we're trying to clear Palisades Drive and I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars,' he revealed, pointing up to the hill where traffic was slowly making its way down. 'There are families up there, there are pets up there. There are people who really need help,' he said with worry in his voice. Wearing a facemask, the 'It Takes Two' actor explained how important it is for everyone to 'band together' during this time of need. Steve Guttenberg at the Golden Gala: A Celebration of Excellence at The Beverly Hilton on January 3, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Gilbert Flores/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty Images) 'Don't worry about your personal property. Just get out. Get your loved ones and get out.' He told KTLA that he's urging people who have left their cars on Palisades Drive to leave their keys behind so they can move the cars to make room for incoming fire trucks. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 770 acres in hours 'What's happening is people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot. We really need people to move their cars,' the 'Police Academy' actor explained. 'If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.' Generally, officials recommend people stay in their cars while evacuating and advise against abandoning their vehicles.

Los Angeles prepares for ‘most significant windstorm in more than...	Wild weather – including rain, snow, high winds and dangerous fire conditions – is how Southern California is starting 2025, and officials in the L.A. are taking no chances ahead of the adverse conditions. The National Weather Service has described the windstorm hitting SoCal as 'life-threatening,' 'extreme' and 'destructive,' and snow flurries were seen Tuesday morning in mountain communities; further inland, rain showers caused slick roadways. In L.A., Mayor Karen Bass announced Tuesday morning that the city has activated its Emergency Operations Center to a Level 2 to ensure the safety of all Angelenos. Rapidly growing wildfire spreads in Los Angeles area 'Parts of the Los Angeles region will potentially face one of the most significant windstorms in more than a decade, and I urge Angelenos to continue monitoring the storm and stay vigilant and safe,' Mayor Bass said in a statement. 'Power outages as a result of downed power lines, increased fire risk and falling trees and debris should be expected during this time and the impacts and dangers of a windstorm should be taken seriously.' The mayor’s office released a list of resources and helpful information for residents to use during the windstorm: Reporting and tracking power outages: Visit www.ladwp.com/outages or call 1-800-DIAL-DWP (1-800-342-5397) Reporting blocked roadways: Service can be requested through www.lacity.gov/myla311 or by calling 311; Angelenos are also encouraged to download the MyLA311 mobile app Red Flag Warning updates: Check www.lafd.org/redflag for the latest updates; Red Flag parking restrictions have been in place since 8 a.m. Tuesday and are set to last until further notice Outage updates: LADWP will regularly update their X page to inform residents of power outages Weather updates: Click here for the hyperlocal forecast for your community, or visit the National Weather Service for the regional forecast In case of emergency: Dial 911 How to stay safe during Southern California’s latest Santa Ana wind event In addition to downing trees and causing power outages throughout the region early Tuesday morning, the dangerously high winds are already fueling brush fires in the area, including one that erupted and was later contained in the Santa Ana Riverbed in Colton around 5 a.m. A much larger and more rapidly spreading vegetation fire broke out around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday in L.A.’s upscale Pacific Palisades neighborhood. By noon, area residents were being told to prepare to evacuate as it spread to over 200 acres in about an hour.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/los-angeles-windstorm-santa-ana/	2025-01-07T13:03:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25007638542773.jpg?w=900

Ex-President Jimmy Carter's body begins journey to Washington	(NewsNation) — The body of former President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Tuesday, where it will lie in state ahead of Thursday’s funeral at Washington National Cathedral. Carter, who died at the age of 100 last week, had been lying in repose at the Carter Center in Atlanta before the 39th president’s remains were taken to Dobbins Air Force Base on Tuesday. Inclement weather on the East Coast delayed transporting Carter’s body to Washington by about 90 minutes Tuesday. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know A small ceremony with Carter’s family took place at the Georgia Air Force Base before Carter’s remains were to be flown to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where another ceremony was scheduled to be held. Carter was scheduled to be taken to the U.S. Naval Museum before the former president's remains will be transported to the U.S. Capitol. Carter served in the Navy before he became a Georgia state senator and the state's governor. Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver a eulogy at a ceremony for lawmakers Tuesday afternoon before public viewing at the Capitol Rotunda begins. President Joe Biden will deliver a eulogy at the national funeral ceremony Thursday, which will coincide with a national day of mourning. The most recent national day of mourning was held in 2018 following the death of President George H.W. Bush. Carter will then be returned to his hometown of Plains, Georgia, where he will be buried next to his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter, who died at the age of 96 in 2023.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-body-washington/	2025-01-07T10:44:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25004778912187.jpg?w=900

Live: Trump speaks after sentencing delay denied in NYC case	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump may pursue a last-minute appeal after the New York judge overseeing his hush money case rejected his effort to delay sentencing, set for Friday. Judge Juan Merchan rejected a request to delay sentencing, keeping it just 10 days before Trump returns to the White House. 'This court has considered defendant's arguments in support of his motion and finds that they are, for the most part, a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past,' he wrote in a court filing Monday. Trump's attorneys had sought to postpone sentencing indefinitely, while they appealed. He has already been denied a dismissal in the case, which he argues could mark the 'end of the presidency as we know it' if upheld. Trump is expected to address the case on Tuesday during a news conference at 10 a.m. at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. Judge signals no punishment for conviction Merchan signaled he is inclined to impose no punishment for Trump’s 34-count felony conviction, given concerns about his immunity from criminal prosecution upon taking the oath of office. Should Selena's killer get parole? Responding sergeant says no He said an unconditional discharge 'appears to be the most viable solution' and would allow Trump to appear virtually. In May, a New York City jury found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Daniels was paid during the campaign to keep quiet about an affair she allegedly had with Trump, which he denies. Manhattan DA: Immunity doesn't apply with Trump not yet in office In a court filing this week, Trump's legal team argued for postponing sentencing, stating, 'The court should vacate the sentencing hearing until President Trump's immunity appeals are fully and finally resolved, which should result in a dismissal of this case, which should have never been brought in the first place.' They contend the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity should apply, citing jury evidence like social media posts and testimony from aides from Trump's time as president. NYC subway arson suspect set to be arraigned They also argue that immunity should extend since Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. However, the Manhattan DA's office opposes delaying sentencing, asserting that immunity shouldn't apply while Trump is out of office. Merchan has previously suggested he is unlikely to sentence Trump to prison.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/trump-react-judge-denying-delay-hush-money-case/	2025-01-07T06:57:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24345686164055.jpg?w=900
NYC subway arson suspect set to be arraigned	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The man accused of burning a woman alive while she was asleep on a New York City subway is set to be arraigned Tuesday on murder and arson charges. Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, will appear in a Brooklyn courtroom around 9:30 a.m. local time. Authorities plan to unseal the indictment Tuesday following his court appearance. NYPD identifies the victim as Debrina Kawam Zapeta-Calil is accused of using a lighter to set a woman's clothes on fire while she was asleep on a stopped F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 22. Prosecutors say Zapeta-Calil intensified the blaze by fanning it with a shirt before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned to death. Officers at the station reportedly smelled and saw smoke and observed the victim in the train car fully engulfed in flames, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The fire was extinguished, and the woman was pronounced dead. Could fandom cause jury nullification in Luigi Mangione trial? The victim was identified as 57-year-old Debrina Kawam, according to the New York Police Department. Zapeta-Calil was arrested on Dec. 23, after being taken into custody the previous day. He’s charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and arson. According to police, there is no connection or prior interaction between the suspect and the victim, though the indictment, set to be released later Tuesday, may reveal additional details.

Bill O'Reilly was in a 'Cabinet meeting' during Mar-a-lago visit	(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says President-elect Donald Trump is 'laser-locked' on fulfilling campaign promises and significantly more prepared for the presidency than during his first term following a recent private meeting at Mar-a-Lago. The author, who said he has met nine presidents so far, got a 'summons' from Mar-a-Lago and felt obligated to go as a journalist despite not knowing what he was called for. 'When a president says, 'Hey, come on over,' you go on over,' O'Reilly said Monday on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' O'Reilly described sitting in on a 'literal Cabinet meeting' at Trump's Florida estate, where he observed discussions about tariffs and other policy matters. Bill O’Reilly: ‘Woke movement is anti-American’ O'Reilly, who celebrated his 50th year in journalism, said Trump's grasp of presidential responsibilities has evolved considerably since 2017. 'Eight years ago, Donald Trump really didn't know what he was looking at as President of the United States, and he leaned on people for advice. That's gone. He knows exactly what the job is.' The meeting included former Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Peter Navarro along with Howard Lutnick and others, O'Reilly said. He described detailed discussions about using tariffs to pressure companies like Apple to move manufacturing from China to the United States. While Trump appears more knowledgeable about governance, O'Reilly predicted the next administration would face internal conflicts despite promises of strict discipline from incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Jimmy Carter ‘wasn’t a good president but tried’ to be: Bill O’Reilly 'The first year of every single presidential administration has been a bloodbath behind the scenes, and this one will be too,' O'Reilly said. 'People are going to try to stab each other to death, not literally, but figuratively.' O'Reilly's observations came from what he described as a three-hour visit to Mar-a-Lago, including both the meeting and dinner with Trump. '[Trump] certainly comes in in a very, very strong position, the strongest position of any president since maybe JFK,' O'Reilly said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/bill-oreilly-cabinet-meeting-mar-a-lago-visit/	2025-01-06T17:31:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-2.jpg?w=900
New migrant caravan heads toward US as Trump return draws closer	(NewsNation) — Sources in Mexico tell NewsNation a caravan of migrants has just taken off from Tapachula, Mexico, with hundreds heading north to Chiapas, Mexico, on foot. The majority of migrants are Venezuelan, sources say. The ultimate destination is reportedly Juarez, Mexico, located just miles from the border, and El Paso, Texas. It's the 10th such caravan to form in the southern municipality since October. According to Mexican immigration authorities, they expect even more of these caravans to form and depart in the coming days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump and his 'border czar,' Tom Homan, have promised to carry out mass deportations on a historical scale, decrying sanctuary cities and their leaders who plan to oppose such actions. New international rail bridge ‘milestone’ connecting Laredo, Texas, to Mexico completed The chances of the caravan reaching the United States' southern border are slim to none as Mexican immigration authorities continue to step up their efforts to deter and block migrant groups from even reaching Mexico City. Sources tell NewsNation authorities have dubbed this 'Operation Carousel' and that they are breaking up migrant groups and negotiating with them to travel to other Mexican states. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has addressed the issue of deportations prior to Trump's second term, making a surprising reversal on previous policy promises. Last month, Sheinbaum said Mexico would push the United States to send non-Mexican deportees to their countries of origin — now, she's announced that Mexico is open to accepting foreign nationals. Border patrol to be front and center at inauguration parade The stance shift comes as the Mexican government promises to open 25 new shelters to house deported migrants. Immigration attorney Rolando Vazquez, who primarily represents Venezuelan nationals, said these shelters will lead to self-deporting from Mexico. 'These foreign nationals are going to find it more desirable to be in their home country than it is to be in Mexico, and they'll eventually go back to their home country,' Vazquez said. 'And that's what we've seen in the past in the last Trump administration when they implemented the MPP program.' Sources in Tijuana and Matamoros tell NewsNation they expect migrants to rush the border in the final days before Trump's inauguration, as they fear the CBP One app will end at that point.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/migrant-caravan-tapachula-mexico/	2025-01-06T15:49:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Border-wall-Hidalgo-041423.jpg?w=900
Could fandom cause jury nullification in Luigi Mangione trial?	(NewsNation) — Increasing public sympathy for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, could pose the possibility of jury nullification despite the overwhelming evidence mounted against him, some legal experts say. Mangione faces multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism under federal and state charges in New York and Pennsylvania, after allegedly gunning down Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in Midtown Manhattan on Dec 4. The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Luigi Mangione’s fandom could lead to jury nullification Since his arrest, Mangione’s online fandom has rapidly grown, with supporters posting sympathetic messages, creating fan accounts and even raising thousands on crowdfunding sites to pay for his legal defense fund. To these sympathizers, Mangione’s alleged crime symbolizes a rejection of the American health care system. That, coupled with him being easy on the eyes, has turned Mangione into a 'modern-day Robin Hood,' former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told NewsNation. 'I have never seen a criminal defendant, much less an accused murderer, receive as much sympathy both on traditional media and social media. He is a folk hero of sorts to many,' Rahmani said. Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione? Rahmani said there is a 'very high possibility' of jury nullification in his case where a sympathetic juror could hold out for Mangione. This photo, provided by the Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, shows Luigi Mangione, a suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, receiving a citation for failing to observe a posted closed-area sign, in Honolulu, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2023. (Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources via AP) Jury nullification occurs when a jury returns a not guilty verdict even though jurors believe beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has broken the law. This may happen when jurors disagree with the law or the punishment. If that happens, there is a high probability of a mistrial, which happens when jurors aren't able to reach the same verdict, Rahmani said. A nullifying juror could also convince other jurors to choose an acquittal. Defense lawyers will lean in Mangione’s defense lawyers, like any defense attorneys, will try to utilize any possibility of nullification, former federal prosecutor Joel Cohen said. 'That’s their job,' he said, to find those nullifiers and keep them on the jury, and in this case, there is a real possibility of it happening. With the seemingly overwhelming evidence against Mangione, jury nullification could be what gets him acquitted or results in a mistrial, so the defense will lean into this, he said. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ In most cases, people come in with some sort of bias, and even when they say they are capable of putting that aside for the case, it still manages to creep in, Cohen said. While a juror does not have the right to nullify, once they are seated, they have the power to do it, he added. 'Most jurors who have that nullifying feeling are not going to be honest about it most of the time, so it's really hard to get into their heart and soul to find out what they're really thinking and what the reason is for wanting to be on the jury,' he said. That’s where judges and prosecutors really need to step up and do their best to weed it out, he said. The evidence will prevail over jury nullification Not all legal experts see nullification as a potential threat. 'I think it's very unlikely that a case like this is going to confront something like jury nullification,' Gregory Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law, said. 'Most of us hate insurance companies and have had difficult experiences dealing with insurance companies, but that doesn't mean we think people should be going around murdering insurance executives in the street.' Germain said it’s unlikely potential nullifiers will be able to hide that level of bias during the jury selection process. He adds that while Mangione does have a large fanbase, most 'people who want to live in a civilized society are not going to find him to be an appealing defendant.' 4 Luigi Mangione documentaries planned The mountain of evidence that appears to be against him will be too great for jurors to fling aside, he said. 'It just sounds like such an overwhelmingly strong case of murder that I just would be shocked if a jury came back with a not guilty verdict.' The larger dangers of jury nullification in Mangione case Jury nullification in the Mangione case could set a dangerous precedent that undermines the legal system, Rahmani said. 'If we can't convict murderers who are caught in broad daylight in Manhattan because of the nature of the victim, it's going to be a problem,' Rahmani said. Our legal system is based on fair, impartial juries, so anything that threatens that will pose issues. The sentiment is shared by Cohen, who said there are several 'dangers' of jury nullification, especially if it was done through deception during the jury selection process. If people think they will get off the hook because a victim is unsympathetic, that may lead to similar attacks, he said. In the Mangione case, it’s even more concerning because this appears to be a planned attack.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fandom-jury-nullification-luigi-mangione-trial/	2025-01-06T14:48:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6769efd59b9de0.24500426.jpeg?w=900
First US bird flu death confirmed in Louisiana	(NewsNation) — The Louisiana Public Health Department has reported the first bird flu-related human death in the United States. The patient, who was over 65, contracted bird flu after coming in contact with both a backyard bird flock and wild birds. That person was the first to contract a severe case of the illness in the nation, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient was 'reported to have underlying medical conditions,' health officials said in the release. Feeling sick? Here’s what you might have 'The Department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient’s family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one.

Trump pitches 'merged' US, Canada after Trudeau resignation annou...	(The Hill) - President-elect Trump pitched the idea of a 'merged' United States and Canada after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, noting there would be no tariffs if the two countries were one. 'If Canada merged with the U.S., there would no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them,' Trump posted to his Truth Social site. 'Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!' Congress formally certifies Trump’s election win Trudeau announced Monday that he would be resigning before general elections later this year. His Liberal Party is polling poorly as tensions with Trump have risen over the issue of tariffs. 'This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I’m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,' Trudeau said. After Trudeau’s announcement Monday, Trump touted the idea that many Canadians would 'LOVE' the idea of being the '51st State' of the U.S. He said the merger would be beneficial for the U.S., because it would 'no longer suffer' from 'massive Trade Deficits' and subsidies that it provides to Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces resignation 'Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,' Trump said. Trudeau has served as Canada’s prime minister for nine years and led the Liberal Party for 11. He has faced mounting crises, including the resignation of a top minister and a confrontation with Trump’s 25 percent tariff plan, among other issues.

What is HMPV, and should we fear another pandemic?	(NewsNation) — China has reported a surge in cases of human metapneumovirus, particularly among children, with some online claiming hospitals are overwhelmed. China has pushed back on those claims and said the increase in cases is due to an increased ability to detect and identify HMPV. What is it? HMPV is a virus that causes upper respiratory symptoms, with some cases also leading to lower respiratory symptoms like pneumonia. Woman warning others after accidentally gluing eye shut with nail glue It's part of the same genus of viruses as RSV and the symptoms of the two can be similar. Most people contract HMPV before the age of five, and although it is possible to be infected again, subsequent infections are usually milder. A first-time HMPV infection is more likely to cause severe illness, which is why worse cases are often seen in children. What are the symptoms? HMPV is similar to the common cold for most people. Symptoms include a stuffy or runny nose, coughing, shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, wheezing and a rash. For most people, the illness will be mild. Children are at most risk from HMPV, as well as those over 65 or those with weakened immune symptoms. 19 of 20 US counties with lowest health insurance coverage located in Texas HMPV can also aggravate existing conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How is the virus spread? Like most viruses, HMPV is spread by coming into contact with an infected person or from objects contaminated with the virus. Coughing, sneezing, shaking hands, kissing and touching easily contaminated objects like doorknobs and phones are all ways the virus can be spread. Proper handwashing, covering your mouth when you sneeze or cough, avoiding touching your face, staying home when sick and social distancing can help avoid spreading HMPV. Masking is also effective in curbing the spread, with China mandating masks in some regions hit hard by the virus. Where is the virus spreading? The majority of cases reported right now come from northern China. In light of the outbreak, some other countries have also stepped up monitoring. Intermittent fasting could slow down hair growth: Study The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does monitor HMPV so an uptick in the U.S. should be caught by scientists. However, it is not on the list of diseases that states are required to report to the CDC. Will this become another pandemic? Experts say there is no need to be concerned about another COVID-19 situation with HMPV. One major reason is that the disease has been circulating for decades and many adults have already been exposed, building up some immunity, something that wasn't the case with COVID. Experts also say there has been no evidence that HMPV has been mutating into a more serious illness, though it will require additional testing to confirm this is the case. What to do if you think you have HMPV? There are no treatments for HMPV, but there may be supportive care for severe cases, including oxygen therapy, IV infusions and corticosteroids. Recall issued for cold and flu medicine sold at some Costco locations In most cases, people can manage symptoms at home by drinking lots of fluids to stay hydrated and using over-the-counter medications. If you or your child experience symptoms lasting more than a few days, call your doctor. If you or your child is having trouble breathing, has blue lips or nails or has a fever above 103, go to the ER immediately.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/what-hmpv-chances-pandemic/	2025-01-06T10:29:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192249820.jpg?w=900

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces resignation	(NewsNation) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will resign as Liberal Party Leader and prime minister of Canada once the party selects a new leader. The prime minister also announced he had prorogued the current session of Parliament, which has been paralyzed, until March 24. He had served as the party's leader since 2013, having taken the reins when the Liberals were suffering difficulties in the House of Commons. Jan. 6: Security preparations in DC on anniversary of Capitol Riots The prime minister said he discussed his decision with his family last night. In a news conference, he said that it had become clear to him that he can't be the best option for Canada while fighting internal battles within the party. He also said a regret of his time in leadership was his failure to introduce electoral reform, specifically failing to allow Canadians to pick their second and third choices in elections, whe he said would reduce political division. Trudeau's resignation came ahead of a key national caucus meeting set to be held on Wednesday. His departure leaves the party without a permanent leader as polls show it is likely to lose badly to Conservatives in an election set for Late November.

Trudeau's decision to step aside is likely to incite calls for a quick election, as the country works to put a government in place to deal with demands from President-elect Donald Trump, who has already threatened tariffs on Canadian imports and has suggested the U.S. could annex Canada.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/justin-trudeau-resigns/	2025-01-06T08:01:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/671a74165b5020.50821515.jpeg?w=900
Biden to visit New Orleans after deadly Bourbon Street attack	NEW ORLEANS (NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' After signing the Social Security Fairness Act, Biden was asked Sunday by journalists what his message would be to the families he would meet. He responded, 'I’ve been there. There’s nothing you can really say to somebody that’s just had such a tragic loss, my message is going to be personal if I get to get them alone.' First Lady Jill Biden will accompany the president, according to the White House. All victims have been ID'd Investigation continues into what authorities are calling a New Year’s Day 'act of terrorism' in New Orleans’ bustling Canal and Bourbon Streets in which a car drove into a crowd, killing 14 people and injuring at least 35 more. Officials said Thursday that all victims have been identified, and their families have been notified by New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. New Orleans attack suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack. FBI Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil said Sunday that Jabbar traveled to New Orleans in late October and in November. During his first trip, Jabar stayed at a rental home for at least two days beginning on Oct. 30, Myrthil said. The second trip took place on Nov. 10 but FBI officials 'are still piecing together details of that trip.'

Congress gears up for snowy certification of Trump's election win	Congress is gearing up for a snowy certification of President-elect Trump’s election win on Monday, as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) vows to plow ahead with the vote despite a snowstorm set to hit Washington, D.C. The House and Senate are scheduled to convene in a joint session at 1 p.m. on Monday to certify Trump’s victory, a process that is mandated by the Constitution and federal law. On Monday, however, the nation’s capital is bracing for as many as 10 inches of snow, a weather event that could make it difficult for lawmakers to arrive at the Capitol. Johnson, however, has said the operation will go on 'whether we’re in a blizzard or not,' citing federal law and Trump’s 'landslide' win. It comes exactly four years after a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Biden's election win. Also this week, the debate over the best strategy to carry out Trump’s legislative wish list is expected to heat up, after the president-elect endorsed moving one reconciliation bill rather than two — a stance that directly contrasts with that of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and others. And some of Trump’s cabinet nominees will likely visit the Capitol this week to meet with senators, including Tulsi Gabbard — Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence — who is slated to speak with Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. For Johnson, the road gets rougher from here Additionally, the late-President Jimmy Carter will lie in state in the Capitol, as Washington begins a days-long commemoration of the 39th president’s life. Congress to certify Trump’s election win amid snowstorm The certification of Trump’s election win is set to take center stage in Washington on Monday, as lawmakers trudge through the snow to participate in the process that is taking place exactly four years after a violent mob descended on the Capitol and interrupted the procedure. Despite the inclement weather — which some forecasts say can include up to 10 inches of snow — Congress is still expected to meet to certify the election. 'The House intends to certify President Trump’s election tomorrow as scheduled in accordance with federal law,' Johnson spokesperson Taylor Haulsee wrote in a statement on Sunday. The House and Senate adopted a concurrent resolution last week that set Jan. 6 as the day Congress would certify the election, in accordance with the Electoral Count Act, which lawmakers passed and Biden enacted in 2022 following the Capitol riot. Both chambers are scheduled to convene in a joint session at 1 p.m. on Monday, kicking off the quadrennial procedure. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the House chamber. Trump asks for military aircraft protection amid Iran threat: Reports Because that timeline is laid out in federal law, lawmakers would have to pass another law rescheduling the procedure if needed because of the snow. There is some precedent for such a move: In 2013, Congress voted to certify former President Obama’s election victory on Jan. 4 because Jan. 6 fell on a Sunday. Johnson, however, has indicated that he does not plan to change the date. The Speaker told 'Fox News Sunday' 'I hope we have full attendance,' noting that GOP leaders encouraged their colleagues to remain in Washington over the weekend because of the forecasts. 'President Trump had a mandate, a landslide, you know, so many electoral votes. And we get to count them all. And we cannot delay that certification,' Johnson said. Some lawmakers are vowing to attend no matter the conditions. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), for example, wrote on X: 'I’m here and will walk to the Capitol if I have to.' Monday’s certification is taking place in the shadow of the 2021 riot, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and interrupted the counting of Biden’s electoral victory. In light of the events of four years ago, Democrats have said they do not plan to stage election protests that they have in the past. Reconciliation debate to heat up in the Senate The debate over how to execute Trump’s sprawling legislative agenda is poised to heat up in the Senate this week after the president-elect said he prefers moving one large reconciliation package rather than two — a stance that directly contrasts with that of Thune and conservative House Republicans. Trump officially announced on Sunday night that he prefers a single reconciliation bill, writing on X: 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before.' The package will include border and energy policy and extend the 2017 tax cuts, Trump said. Trump’s statement came one day after Johnson told House Republicans at a retreat that the president-elect preferred the one-track strategy. That stance, however, is not landing well in some Senate GOP circles, where a two-bill approach is preferred. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Budget Committee, said Sunday on Fox News that he was 'very worried' about moving a single bill. 'I'm very worried that, if we don't put border first and get it done, it's going to be a nightmare for our national security,' Graham said, later adding: 'I will try to be a team player here, but I want to tell the American people, from my point of view, the number one job is to secure the nation for the federal government.' Attention will be focused on Thune this week to see how he reacts to Trump’s statement, which runs counter to his strategy. The majority leader laid out a reconciliation plan last month that included two bills: The first would tackle border security and defense, and the other would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which include a number of provisions set to expire at the end of 2025. Additionally, the House Freedom Caucus is likely to take issue with Trump’s comments. Last month, the conservative group wrote a letter to Johnson endorsing the two-bill strategy. Johnson, for his part, laid out an ambitious timeline to tackle the reconciliation package during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. He said the House will look to pass a budget resolution in early February, then move the entire package the first week of April. 'Everything’s got to move in the right sequence. And along the way, I think we're going to keep those trains moving in the right direction and on time,' Johnson said. 'And if that happens, we will get it out of the House in early April, maybe as soon as April 3, and then move it over to the Senate. That would put that bill on the president's desk for signature by the end of April. That would be fantastic.' Soda manufacturers push to keep sugary drinks on SNAP list Notably, the first week of April is also when Florida is holding two special elections to replace former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and outgoing Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), who is becoming Trump’s national security adviser on Jan. 20 — two likely GOP holds that will give the conference an extra vote in the House. One person who is likely to celebrate Trump's preferred strategy is Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who had been publicly pushing for one reconciliation bill rather than two. Administration nominees back on Capitol Hill — including Gabbard Trump’s cabinet and administration nominees are expected to be back on Capitol Hill to meet with senators this week, as the picks gear up for their confirmation hearings and eventual votes. That group includes Gabbard, Trump’s selection to be director of national intelligence, who is slated to meet one-on-one this week with Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Gabbard is seen as one of the more controversial nominees Trump has put forward, with questions being raised about her 2017 meeting with Bashar al-Assad, and comments she has made about the Russia-Ukraine war that echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talking points. Aside from meetings with nominees, the Senate is expected to adopt an organizing resolution this week, as the 119th Congress gets underway. Senators were sworn into office last week, and Thune officially began his tenure as majority leader. President Carter to lie in state The late-President Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the Capitol this week, as Washington honors the life and legacy of the 39th president. An arrival ceremony for Carter’s remains is scheduled for Tuesday at 2:45 p.m., followed by a Congressional tribute for the late-president, which Johnson, Thune and other members of leadership are slated to take part in. Then, beginning Tuesday, a viewing period will begin in the Capitol Rotunda for members of the public to pay their respects to Carter.

This is just the beginning': Gov. Beshear urges Kentuckians to s...	Video note: Despite this article's time stamp, the above video is the latest forecast from The Weather Authority. FRANKFORT, Ky. (FOX 56) — Winter Storm Blair has brought what The Associated Press deemed the 'heaviest snowfall in a decade.' On Sunday evening, Gov. Andy Beshear issued an update regarding the storm's impact on the Commonwealth. First major winter storm of 2025 hits US, heavy snow moving east 'This next period of time where we're going to see ice across the Commonwealth is perhaps the most concerning,' Beshear said. Over 38,600 homes and businesses are without power as of 8 p.m., and this number is expected to rise as snow turns to ice across the bluegrass. 'This is just the beginning,' Beshear cautioned, noting that the most dangerous phase of the storm is still ahead. On Sunday, the governor's office stated Kentucky saw anywhere from six to eight inches of snow. Central Kentucky, including Louisville, Lexington, and Frankfort, faces the highest risk through Sunday evening, with ice accumulations potentially reaching dangerous levels, up to three-quarters of an inch. ‘Multiple traffic crashes’ close I-70 in Illinois Beshear emphasized that the storm is expected to persist through Monday night, piling a blanket of snow on top of a glaze of ice in central Kentucky that's expected to stick around due to an 'arctic blast' that's expected midweek. More than 2,300 state transportation workers and over 100 National Guard members have been deployed, with the Guard presence expected to grow up to 400 as the situation develops. 'Each one of those individuals has a family that they left to try to protect us,' Beshear said. 'So please stay home, let them clean the roads, and be really careful. Residents are advised to prepare for extended power outages, stock emergency supplies, and locate nearby warming centers if needed. 'Let's get through this latest thing Mother Nature's thrown at us, and let's get through it together,' Beshear signed off.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/kentucky-snow-storm-weather-warning/	2025-01-05T19:08:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-05-200537.jpg?w=900
