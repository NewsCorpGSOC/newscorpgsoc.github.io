VA Sec. Doug Collins defends veteran’s care, benefits amid layoff...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said Democrats are trying to 'scare' voters by claiming the agency is 'cutting veterans benefits.' 'No critical services cut. And they keep saying that to scare people because that's the only tool they have left, is to try and scare people,' said Collins. Top Republicans say they trust Collins to lead the department. Democrats, however, have not expressed faith that cutting $98 million through dismissals won’t harm veterans. 8 cartels designated as foreign terror organizations by State Department 'We're not cutting critical health care, we're not cutting health care benefits. We're not cutting benefits,' Collins said on NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Wednesday she is seeking answers about how the layoffs may have affected efforts to prevent suicide through the confidential Veterans Crisis Line. In a call with journalists, the Illinois Democrat said her staff heard from VA employees who worked for the crisis line or supported the VA claims process. She said two from Illinois may have been reinstated after she intervened, 'but they’re still locked out of their portal, so I don’t know if they actually have been rehired.' Mangione receives large donation after Trump death penalty order Collins vehemently denied that veteran care was impacted. 'We did not cut any veteran crisis line responders who actually pick up the phone and talk to those who need to talk to a veteran crisis line,' he said. 'They're trying to use that with some other things that were going on in the back offices that did not happen.'

Judge rules Trump administration can move ahead on mass governmen...	A federal judge Thursday refused a group of government employee unions’ request to block the Trump administration from moving ahead with plans to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper ruled that federal law mandates the unions bring their challenge before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), which adjudicates labor relations within the federal bureaucracy, rather than a federal district court. The decision notches another victory for Trump’s Justice Department, which is defending against dozens of lawsuits challenging a broad range of the president’s executive actions, including the administration’s efforts to slash spending and reshape government agencies. 'The first month of President Trump’s second administration has been defined by an onslaught of executive actions that have caused, some say by design, disruption and even chaos in widespread quarters of American society,' wrote Cooper, an appointee of former President Obama. 'Affected citizens and their advocates have challenged many of these actions on an emergency basis in this Court and others across the country,' he continued. 'Certain of the President’s actions have been temporarily halted; others have been permitted to proceed, at least for the time being. These mixed results should surprise no one.' The unions’ lawsuit challenged mass terminations of probationary employees, the administration’s plans for additional mass layoffs, known as a reduction in force (RIF), and its offer for most federal employees to accept a buyout. Another federal judge previously rejected an attempt to block the buyouts in a separate lawsuit, but litigation against the probationary employee firings remains ongoing after a coalition of unions filed yet another lawsuit Thursday. The case at hand was brought by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), the National Federation of Federal Employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers and United Auto Workers. The unions argued that the administration’s plans violates the separation of powers and regulations for how the federal government can carry out RIFs. Cooper took no position on those issues, instead ruling that the unions brought their challenge in the wrong forum. 'The Court acknowledges that district court review of these sweeping executive actions may be more expedient. But NTEU provides no reason why it could not seek relief from the FLRA on behalf of a class of plaintiffs and admits that it would ask other agencies to follow an administrative judge’s ruling in its favor,' Cooper wrote. Trump fired the FLRA’s Democratic-appointed chair, Susan Grundmann, earlier this month, but she is fighting her termination in court Updated 5:30 p.m.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/judge-rules-trump-administration-can-move-ahead-on-mass-government-layoffs/	2025-02-20T16:04:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/NEPA_022125_AP_Rebecca-Blackwell.jpg?w=900
CEO confidence hits highest point in 3 years: Survey	The confidence of CEOs has hit its highest point in three years, according to a new survey. The survey, from The Conference Board, found a 2025 first quarter 9 point rise in the confidence of CEOs, up to 60. The first quarter point marks a three-year high for CEO confidence, per the survey. 'The improvement in CEO Confidence in the first quarter of 2025 was significant and broad-based,' a senior economist at The Conference Board, Stephanie Guichard, said in a press release. Southwest cutting nearly 1,800 jobs, airline says 'All components of the Measure improved, as CEOs were substantially more optimistic about current economic conditions as well as about future economic conditions—both overall and in their own industries.' President Trump and big tech leaders have recently cozied up with each other, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attending his inauguration. Trump and Musk have been especially close in the last year, with the tech billionaire being heavily involved in the second Trump administration. Forty-four percent in The Conference Board survey said economic conditions have become more preferable 'than six months ago,' whereas in the previous quarter it was 20 percent. The Conference Board survey took place between Jan. 27 and Feb 10., featuring 134 CEOs and The Business Council’s partnership.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ceo-confidence-survey/	2025-02-20T16:02:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/trump-tariffs-market_AssociatedPress_f80725.jpg?w=900
Live: Elon Musk speaking at CPAC in Washington	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Elon Musk, who has become Trump’s close adviser, is set to meet with Argentine President Javier Milei, who is in Washington to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference. Musk was announced as a speaker for CPAC earlier Thursday by Mercedes Schlapp, a CPAC organizer. The scheduled meeting between Musk and Milei was confirmed by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss an event that hadn’t yet been announced publicly and said the meeting was private and had been planned for weeks. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won the election but before he took office. He was also invited to the inauguration.

Bird flu vaccine for chickens given conditional license from USDA	(NewsNation) — A New Jersey-based company announced last week that it received a conditional license from the United States Department of Agriculture for a bird flu vaccine that can be used for chickens. The company, Zoetis, said this license was granted on the 'demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on serology data.' It noted that the decision to vaccinate commercial poultry flocks rests with national regulatory authorities and the industry itself. Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president of global biologics research and development at Zoetis, said in a statement that scientists began updating their previous bird flu vaccine when a new strain was identified in the U.S. three years ago. Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion. What do we know? 'Our readiness with this most recent vaccine is another example of how we continue to live our purpose to nurture the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, ultimately providing solutions to global animal health challenges,' Kumar said. A USDA spokesperson told NBC News this conditional license doesn’t mean the vaccine has been approved for commercial use and that poultry farmers cannot yet purchase it. 'This is simply a normal step in the research and development phase, not in the implementation of a vaccine strategy,' the USDA spokesperson said. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is expected 'in the coming days' to announce a new strategy to fight the flu, a USDA spokesperson said to NBC, though they did not say whether vaccines were included in this. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Bird flu is currently widespread among wild birds worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, there have been outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows. Currently, there are 69 cases of bird flu in the U.S. and one reported death. There is no person-to-person spread, and the current public health risk is low, the CDC says. However, a recently released report by the CDC said the virus may be going undetected in humans. Specifically, the report suggests the spread of bird flu between dairy cattle and humans has gone unchecked. This news comes as the Trump Administration froze external communications from the agency, which interrupted the agency’s weekly report.

Senate confirms Kash Patel to lead FBI	The Senate on Thursday confirmed Kash Patel to serve as the head of the FBI, approving a pick with a string of controversial statements who has been accused by Democrats of directing a purge of bureau employees. Patel was confirmed in a 51-49 vote. Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Main) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), voted against confirmation. Patel has said he would 'shut down' FBI headquarters on his first day in office and turn it into a 'museum to the deep state.' He’s alarmed Democrats by including a list of 'government gangsters' in a book he wrote by the same name. And Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Patel 'likely committed perjury' when he denied having insight into FBI firings that came the very next day. Durbin in a lengthy floor speech at turns called Patel 'vindictive,' 'dangerously politically extreme,' and warned Republicans 'will come to regret this vote, probably sooner rather than later.' 'When I think of giving this man a 10-year tenure as director of the leading criminal investigative agency in the world, I cannot imagine a worse choice. You want the person has that job and that power to destroy people simply by investigation to show some temperament and some judgment,' Durbin said. 'Kash Patel shows just the opposite.' FBI directors are confirmed to a 10-year term, but Patel was nominated shortly after President Trump was re-elected, a sign the returning executive planned to fire former FBI Director Christopher Wray ahead of the end of his term in 2027. A former public defender, Patel got his start in the political realm as a staffer to then-House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Patel played a key role there in seeking to discredit the committee Democrats’ investigation of Trump’s ties to Russia. That included authoring a report analyzing FBI and Justice Department responses in their own investigations of Russian election interference. That experience also inspired him to write a series of children's books, with a synopsis referencing 'a sinister cabal' that 'plotted to overthrow a president,' while Patel 'reveals how we can defeat the Deep State, reassert self-government, and restore our democracy.' That has sparked accusations from Democrats that Patel was chosen not for his skills but for his loyalty. Durbin referred a whistleblower tip to the Justice Department inspector general he said demonstrates Patel has already taken steps to carry out retribution, pointing to the firing of senior career FBI leaders. The Justice Department has since asked for a detailed list of all FBI employees who had a hand in the more than 1,500 cases brought against those in connection with the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6. Collins cited a purge of FBI staff as part of her rationale for not backing Patel, saying that, as well as his history of politically charged statements, 'cast doubt on Mr. Patel’s ability to advance the FBI’s law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation.' Murkowski did the same. 'My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership. The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores,' she wrote on X amid the vote. 'I have been disappointed that when he had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.' Most Republicans, however, see Patel as the right figure to turn around an FBI they’ve accused of being politicized and weaponized against Republicans. 'At the heart of their opposition is a fear that he’ll act like Democrats did when Democrats were in power. These Democrats are afraid the FBI, under Mr. Patel’s leadership, will use lawfare against political opponents, like the FBI used lawfare against President Trump and others,' Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a Wednesday night speech in favor of Patel. 'After reviewing Mr. Patel’s record and listening to his testimony at his hearing, I’m convinced these fears that the Democrats have are unfounded. Mr. Patel’s leadership will not be business as usual at the FBI, as it has been in previous administrations when the FBI – the people on the seventh floor, not the local agents – were used for political weaponization.' Patel served in a number of national security positions under the first Trump administration, taking on roles at the Department of Defense, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Council. But he often butted heads with other members of Trump’s team, with Democrats repeatedly pointing to criticism of Patel from former Attorney General Bill Barr and national security adviser John Bolton, who have both since become frequent Trump critics. Since leaving the Trump administration, he’s appeared on a series of right-wing podcasts and started a foundation that did fundraising for charity alongside a group of jailed Jan. 6 defendants who sold a recording of them singing the national anthem to raise money. Patel denied involvement in the matter during his confirmation hearing, despite previously boasting of helping the group record and distribute the track, including in social media posts. It was one example of many cases in which Patel dodged or demurred when asked about past controversial statements. 'We gave Mr. Patel numerous opportunities to explain, to walk back his threats. He chose not to, nor did he try to explain his so-called Deep State list of former government officials,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Thursday. 'He repeatedly misled the committee, dodged questions and claimed ignorance, claimed he didn't remember things he'd said just a few months before. Why would you want someone in the FBI doesn't remember things they said only a few months before? This is irresponsible at best and deceitful at worst.'

Could Los Angeles become the rattiest city in the United States?	(NewsNation) — California is the only state to ban the most lethal type of rat poison, so more rodents are living large these days, especially in Los Angeles. According to pest control experts, the rat population is booming, and service calls are way up. NewsNation headed out with rodent expert Louis Rico, and it took just 30 seconds for him to spot a rat burrow in someone’s front yard. The rodent residents were not home. Michael Strahan leaving GMA by summer: NewsNation exclusive Proponents had pushed for the ban on 'anticoagulant rodenticides' to protect pets and wildlife that might feed off toxic dead rats. When Gov. Gavin Newsom first signed the law, J.P. Rose, Urban Wildlands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement that it was a 'relief to know the deadliest rat poisons will soon be off the market here.' 'This important legislation shows why California is an environmental leader. We’re willing to fight for wildlife protections,' Rose said in a statement. 'Birds, foxes and pumas shouldn’t be sacrificed every time there’s a pest problem.' However, according to exterminators, other types of extermination techniques just aren’t as effective as anticoagulant rodenticides. As a result, there has been a ballooning rodent population. Some say this could lead to a potential public health crisis. Chicago has claimed the top spot as the United States' rattiest city for 10 years straight, and Los Angeles is at No. 2. New York City is ranked third in cities with the most rats. San Francisco and Washington, D.C., round out the top five. The California rodenticide ban could mean a change is underway. 'My prediction is that probably by the end of the year, we will become the rattiest city in the United States, for sure,' Rico, owner of American Rat Control in Los Angeles, said. 'I’m wishing, hoping that we can get some of the old rodenticide back. That really worked.' The Southern California wildfires are another factor in the booming rat population. Social Security funds under Trump could run out in 6 years: Analysis Many people were displaced during the deadly blaze, and rodents have been as well, so many have made their way into surrounding communities. Rat sightings are up in San Francisco as well, prompting a column just yesterday in SFist on whether that city needs a rat czar like the one in New York City. In a single year, just two rats can produce thousands of offspring. Female rats can start reproducing five weeks after birth, and each can deliver litters of up to 12 every month. This is why many are pushing for more aggressive efforts in rat birth control, along with higher public awareness to combat habits that attract rats, like leaving out bird seed, pet food and garbage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/los-angeles-rat-population/	2025-02-20T11:18:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-525973077-e1729628605321.jpg?w=800
Trump's executive order on independent agencies: What does it mea...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s executive order shifting independent agencies to fall under his authority appears to be a strategic move to put the definition of the president's scope of power in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, legal experts say. Trump issued an order Tuesday requiring agencies that have long been congressionally authorized to be independent from the White House to now answer to him. This includes the Federal Communication Commission, the Postal Service and the Federal Trade Commission. The move follows a legal idea called the 'unitary executive' theory, which places executive authority on the president at the expense of Congress, according to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute. What has Trump accomplished during the first month of his second term? The Supreme Court has already shown a willingness to embrace the theory, and Trump’s presidency could be what tips the scale, Jeffrey Lubbers, a professor of administrative law at American University's Washington College of Law, told NewsNation. The nation's highest court has been trending towards this doctrine through several recent decisions, most notably its ruling to grant presidents absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts. The case stemmed from the Justice Department’s effort to prosecute Trump for allegedly trying to block the results of the 2020 election. 'It's all part of an overall strategy to take control of these 20 or 25 regulatory agencies that issue some important regulations,' he said. 'But Trump wants to do it sort of as a matter of constitutional law so that he, as president, has control over all of them.' The White House has described Trump’s directive as 'ensuring that all federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by the Constitution.'

(Alex Brandon, Associated Press) What will happen to independent agencies in the short term? Trump has already installed Republicans to head many of these agencies, but his order takes control further, Lubbers said. These agencies will likely pull back on regulations that are pending, not enforce laws that were put forth during the Biden administration and act with less regulatory oversight, he argued. 'It's all part of trying to bring these independent agencies under the same control as the Cabinet departments and agencies that fall under the president,' he said. Many of these agencies function as multimember commissions that vote on decisions with both Republican and Democratic-appointed members to ensure fair application of the law. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly Several presidents have maintained this boundary for decades. Trump's order aims to do away with that as part of a broader push to assert authority over the government by possibly limiting the spending of congressionally approved funds, which could set up lawsuits and lead courts to step in, Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, said. Under Trump’s order, the White House Office of Management and Budget would set performance standards and management objectives for the heads of independent agencies. The OMB could also change the funding apportioned to the agencies that might be in conflict with the president’s agenda. The heads of independent agencies would need to have special White House liaisons to coordinate with the president’s aides and advisers. Trump has already fired leaders serving terms at several independent agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Federal Labor Relations Authority. These firings have already been challenged in court.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) 'The long-term game [for Trump] is basically that eventually the court's going to start cutting back the powers of these independent agencies, and they signaled that already,' Lubbers said. 'But the short game for him is that he wants to get control right away, and that's why he's acting so fast.' Trump’s order is another road to the Supreme Court Trump’s executive order appears to be a path to the Supreme Court, which will be tasked with deciding how much power the president should have, Donahue said. 'It definitely seems like this is flowing into the unitary executive theory that says Congress really doesn't have that much of a role in setting up independent agencies. It's more up to the executive branch to have those things align with them,' he said. According to the unitary executive theory, the president possesses sole authority over the executive branch. The most controversial aspect of the theory is the president’s removal power, which allows them to remove any appointed subordinate officials of the executive branch. Advancing Trump agenda essential for American dream: Sen. Cassidy Trump likely believes he has a good shot with the Supreme Court ruling in his favor, and this appears to be one of his roads to get to them, Donahue said. The Supreme Court has been more open to expanding executive power, especially under the Trump administration, but also going after 'the administrative state,' Donahue said, referring to a court’s ruling last year that rejected a 40-year-old legal doctrine that effectively reduced the power of executive branch agencies. Some of these departments, like the FTC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, had been set up for almost 100 years to be independent, so this theory would turn that on its head, he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-order-independent-agencies/	2025-02-20T11:11:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a3f8319466e2.45436000.jpeg?w=900
State Dept. designates 8 cartels as foreign terror organizations	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration's immigration plans are shaping up, and this week, the State Department designated eight Latin American groups as foreign terrorist organizations. The groups include Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua, MS-13 from El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico, including the Sinaloa cartel. Billionaire Elon Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has also floated the idea of drone strikes against cartels. Congress would need to sign off on such an operation and give final approval. Democratic rep questions military medical deployment to Cuba The Trump administration may begin dismantling the groups inside the U.S. as they are believed to be active across the country. The Drug Enforcement Agency says the cartel is present in all 50 states. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said he believes Tren de Aragua is present across the U.S. as well. Now that these groups have been designated as foreign terror organizations, there are legal ramifications for anyone who tries to help them, including U.S. citizens. Family members or associates of FTOs living in the U.S. are also eligible for removal and deportation. The Treasury Department will also be able to block asset transactions from the FTOs. Yesterday, a suspected TDA gang member was arrested in the Denver area for possession of a firearm. With this new designation, retired Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila says individuals who are arrested in the U.S. with a connection to one of these groups are likely to wind up in Guantanamo Bay. Asylum-seekers: ‘The American dream is over’ 'This categorizes them, just like ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban,' Avila said. 'They're going to get picked up in places with different charges.' Avila said that he knows people will want them removed immediately, but he thinks the government should make an example of individuals found to be connected to an FTO. 'You're a terrorist or financing a terrorist organization. You get picked up under terrorist charges, maybe your next trip is to Gitmo, that's where we keep terrorists,' he said. Avila also said while people think military intervention is the first step in dealing with these groups, it's actually the final step. They have already done a lot of recon missions along the border and have already deployed troops, moving pieces in place to go after cartels. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has been given a month to come up with a plan to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and immigrants to the U.S. CIA expands drone flights over Mexico to locate cartels: Report Mexico has surged about 10,000 troops to the border, and the country is going after fentanyl labs, but Trump has said he wants Mexico to do more. Two generals from the U.S. and Mexico signed a joint statement of agreement to collaborate with each other, creating a pathway for open communication between the two nations. The CIA is also using Reaper drones to covertly hunt for cartels in their fentanyl labs, which Sheinbaum acknowledged was part of a coordinated effort between the U.S. and Mexico that has been going on for years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartels-designated-foreign-terrorist-organizations/	2025-02-20T11:03:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GiWjQD4XEAALF34.jpg?w=360
Mitch McConnell won't seek reelection in 2026	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell is announcing on Thursday that he won’t seek reelection next year, ending a decadeslong tenure as a power broker who championed conservative causes but ultimately ceded ground to the fierce GOP populism of President Donald Trump. McConnell, the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history, chose his 83rd birthday to share his decision not to run for another term in Kentucky and to retire when his current term ends. He informed The Associated Press of his decision before he was set to address colleagues in a speech on the Senate floor. His announcement begins the epilogue of a storied career as a master strategist, one in which he helped forge a conservative Supreme Court and steered the Senate through tax cuts, presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights. Trump Education pick Linda McMahon clears committee, heads to full Senate 'Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,' McConnell said in prepared remarks provided in advance to the AP. 'Every day in between I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.' McConnell, first elected in 1984, intends to serve the remainder of his term ending in January 2027. The Kentuckian has dealt with a series of medical episodes in recent years, including injuries sustained from falls and times when his face briefly froze while he was speaking. The senator plans to deliver his speech in a chamber the famously taciturn McConnell revered as a young intern long before joining its back benches as a freshman lawmaker in the mid-1980s. His dramatic announcement comes almost a year after his decision to relinquish his leadership post after the November 2024 election. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a top McConnell deputy, replaced him as majority leader. McConnell's looming departure reflects the changing dynamics of the Trump-led GOP. He's seen his power diminish on a parallel track with both his health and his relationship with Trump, who once praised him as an ally but has taken to criticizing him in caustic terms. In Kentucky, McConnell's departure will mark the loss of a powerful advocate and will set off a competitive GOP primary next year for what will now be an open Senate seat. Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, seen as a rising star in his party for winning statewide office in Republican territory, has said he has no interest in the Senate, though he is widely viewed as a contender for higher office. McConnell, a diehard adherent to Ronald Reagan’s brand of traditional conservatism and muscular foreign policy, increasingly found himself out of step with a GOP shifting toward the fiery, often isolationist populism espoused by Trump. McConnell still champions providing Ukraine with weapons and other aid to fend off Russia’s invasion, even as Trump ratchets up criticism of the country and its leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The senator plans to make it clear Thursday that national defense remains at the forefront of his agenda. 'Thanks to Ronald Reagan’s determination, the work of strengthening American hard power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate,' McConnell said in his prepared remarks. 'But since then, we’ve allowed that power to atrophy. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So, lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to.' McConnell and Trump were partners during Trump's first term, but the relationship was severed after McConnell blamed Trump for 'disgraceful' acts in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack by his supporters. A momentary thaw in 2024 when McConnell endorsed Trump didn't last. Last week, Trump referred to McConnell as a 'very bitter guy' after McConnell, who battled polio as a child, opposed vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation as the nation’s top health official. McConnell referred to Trump as a 'despicable human being' and a 'narcissist' in a biography of the senator by The Associated Press' deputy Washington bureau chief, Michael Tackett. Before their falling out, Trump and McConnell pushed through a tax overhaul largely focused on reductions for businesses and higher-earning taxpayers. They joined forces to reshape the Supreme Court when Trump nominated three justices and McConnell guided them to Senate confirmation, tilting the high court to the right. McConnell set a new precedent for hardball partisan tactics in 2016 by refusing to even give a hearing to Democratic President Barack Obama’s pick of Merrick Garland to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Putting the brakes on the Senate's 'advise and consent' role for judicial nominees, McConnell said the vacancy should be filled by the next president so voters could have their say. Trump filled the vacancy once he took office, and McConnell later called the stonewalling of Garland's nomination his 'most consequential' achievement. Later, when liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died weeks before the 2020 presidential election won by Democrat Joe Biden, McConnell rushed Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation through the Senate, waving off allegations of hypocrisy. What is the DOGE check being floated on X? McConnell also guided the Senate — and Trump — through two impeachment trials that ended in acquittals. In the second impeachment, weeks after the deadly Capitol attack by a mob hoping to overturn Trump’s 2020 reelection defeat, McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting to acquit. McConnell said he believed Trump couldn’t be convicted because he’d already left office, but the senator also condemned Trump as 'practically and morally responsible' for the insurrection. McConnell over the years swung back and forth from majority to minority leader, depending on which party held power. He defended President George W. Bush’s handling of the Iraq war and failed to block Obama’s health care overhaul. McConnell, the longest-serving senator ever from Kentucky, ensured that the Bluegrass State received plenty of federal funding. Back home he was a key architect in his party's rise to power in a state long dominated by Democrats. He is married to Elaine Chao, and they have long been a power couple in Washington. In his prepared remarks Thursday, the senator referred to her as his 'ultimate teammate and confidante.' Chao was labor secretary for Bush and transportation secretary during Trump's first term, though she resigned after the Capitol insurrection, saying it had 'deeply troubled' her.

What has Trump accomplished during the first month of his second ...	(NewsNation) — In the first month of his second term, President Donald Trump has signed dozens of executive orders targeting issues ranging from immigration to gender identity, while his administration has held near-daily impromptu news conferences and multiple meetings with foreign leaders. Sources told NewsNation it feels like it has been 100 days since Trump took office, instead of just over 30. They expect more action in the coming days from the president, including a push to work more closely with Congress. Trump has teased an upcoming meeting with Democrats at the White House. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? Executive orders On his first day in office, Trump signed 26 executive orders. Comparatively, he signed 33 during his first 100 days in 2017. Many of the executive orders Trump has signed so far are aimed at immigration, including one that declared a national emergency at the southern border and directed the Department of Defense to send 1,500 troops to the area, adding to the 2,500 already there. Military helicopters have been deployed to deport migrants, and Immigration and Communications Enforcement officers have been conducting large-scale operations in cities across the United States. 'I think they're doing a great job. You know, you have people that are hiding. We have professionals that hiding,' Trump said of the ICE raids. NTSB investigating midair collision in Arizona The moves come as Trump reportedly expands the CIA’s use of drone surveillance flights over Mexico. The White House recently designated drug cartels and other transnational criminal groups as terrorist organizations. Other executive orders have aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government and educational institutions. Some private companies have reversed their DEI-related programs as a result. Federal agencies have also been directed to use sex, not gender, in federal policies and documents. Another executive order banned transgender athletes from competing in girls and women’s sports. Efficiency within the government Trump also created the Department of Government Efficiency, which he said would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead DOGE after Trump’s reelection. However, Ramaswamy has since left the department, and the White House has said in legal documents that Musk is not actually in charge at DOGE but is instead an adviser to the president. Members of DOGE reportedly gained access to sensitive and classified data, which has sparked concern from lawmakers. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. Additionally, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s funding, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion. What do we know? A lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenged DOGE’s authority to access sensitive government data. The attorneys general argued Musk has power that can only be given to those elected or confirmed through the Senate. While U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are legitimate questions about Musk’s authority, she refused to issue a temporary restraining order blocking him from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. With federal cuts have come layoffs and firings. While no official number of those terminated has been made available, the Associated Press estimates that thousands of federal employees have been shown the door in the wake of Trump's directives. About 77,000 federal employees have accepted a deferred resignation offer spearheaded by the Trump administration. Despite court-ordered deadline extensions, U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole ultimately declined to further pause the program, allowing the government to proceed. Cabinet picks A number of Trump’s picks for his Cabinet have been confirmed by the Senate, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth; Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Hegseth is headed to Guantanamo Bay on Thursday as the U.S. ramps up migrant detention operations at the military outpost in Cuba. The visit comes one day after House Democrats sent Hegseth a letter asking why military resources such as aircraft and doctors are being diverted to the base.

Making fast money on vending machines: Is it that easy?	(NewsNation) — More Americans are picking up side hustles, and vending machines are being touted on social media as a simple way to generate 'passive' income. How-to videos on TikTok and YouTube show vending entrepreneurs unloading bricks of cash. The short, punchy clips have racked up millions of views and explain how others can turn 'snacks into stacks' with little effort. With roughly 3 million vending machines across the U.S., the sector is worth an estimated $18.2 billion, according to the NAMA Foundation’s 2022-2023 industry census report. Are millions of dead people receiving Social Security benefits? So, how hard is it to get in on the action? Claim: Vending machines are a simple, lucrative side hustle Vending how-tos on TikTok and YouTube have clicky, eye-catching titles that give the impression business is booming: 'He turned vending machines into a $500k business' (TikTok) '6 months in vending business and already made $10k' (TikTok) '2-Day Workweek Earns $700K - Vending Machine Business' (YouTube) One YouTube short with over 58 million views claims to show the start-up process from start to finish. The user says he bought five used vending machines for $4,000, loaded them up with inventory from Costco and then profited $750 per month for two hours of work. How the vending machine side hustle works Social media makes getting started look easy: buy a machine, put it somewhere with foot traffic, stock it with stuff people want and swing by occasionally to collect your cash. The videos follow a similar pattern. Vending entrepreneurs unlock their machines, pull out the cash and see which snacks or drinks are running low. From there, influencers head to big box stores like Costco or Sam’s Club to replenish their machines. Viewers get the sense that there’s little time and energy involved. What they’re not telling you about vending machines The location of the vending machines is everything 'The biggest difficulty is finding a good location and negotiating with the owner,' said Brandon Schlichter, who has two dozen vending machines across central Ohio. What are OASDI taxes? They help fund your retirement Schlichter estimates his machines bring in $3,000 to $3,500 a month — about $100 to $150 each. After factoring in costs like inventory and electricity, he said he makes around $2,000 in profit across all 24 units. 'It’s a nice little side piece of income. I’ve done well with it,' said Schlichter, a serial entrepreneur who shares business tips with nearly 2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel 'Investment Joy.' Schlichter’s machines are spread across laundromats, car washes and rental properties. Negotiating is also important Foot traffic is one factor to consider, but negotiating favorable terms with a building owner is just as important. There is no standard playbook. Some landlords charge rent to host a machine, while others may ask for a commission. 'If you're a good salesperson, you can get a location for free,' Schlichter said. 'It's a sales pitch to a business owner to get more foot traffic.' Manufacturing plants were the most popular location in 2023, making up 40% of the vending machine market, according to Automatic Merchandiser’s State of the Industry report. Offices were the second most common location at 21.5%, followed by colleges and universities at 9.2%. John Talbott, a senior lecturer focusing on retail at Indiana University, recommends scouting out locations and talking with potential landlords before buying a machine. 'Before I would invest, I'd walk around and I'd have 20 deals cut with somebody that said, ‘Yeah, you can bring one in,’' he said. Choose the right product for the vending machine Once you have a location, you’ll have to decide what to put in it. One common mistake is stocking your machine based on what you like, which can be a 'recipe for disaster,' Schlichter said. 'I've run into people that went and bought thousands of dollars worth of product for a vending machine, thinking that they could convert a factory to healthy foods, and then everything expired,' he said. Simple savings: Ways to save money when eating out Cold beverage machines are the most common and accounted for 27% of vending sales last year, the most of any category, according to Automatic Merchandiser’s report. Snacks were the second-largest product category (17%) by revenue, followed by candy (14%). As far as inventory, small operators often buy in bulk at stores like Costco and Sam’s Club. 'I know people that are in high volume, high traffic locations, and they're taking that 25-cent bag of chips, and they're reselling it for $1.50,' Schlichter said. A final point: scale matters. The more machines you have, the more money you’ll make. 'You're not going to really make a lot of money off one machine,' Talbott said. Big picture: How many people are buying vending machines? Vending machines have a relatively low barrier to entry, which makes them competitive. Schlichter said used machines can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000 on eBay and Facebook Marketplace. New machines are more expensive, costing about $3,500 to $6,800 at Sam’s Club. Small-time operators may be less common than social media makes it seem. The NAMA Foundation found that the 'typical' operator maintains 277 machines. NAMA estimates the typical operator generates around $6,000 in revenue per machine annually, about $500 a month. At the end of the day, Schlichter sees vending machines as a low-risk endeavor that, like any other business, requires hard work and practice. 'The only way that you learn is to go out and do it,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/vending-machines-get-rich-quick-is-it-that-easy/	2025-02-20T06:59:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/image-7.png?w=900

Multiple states pushing to ban or restrict mRNA vaccines	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's new 'Make America Healthy Again' commission is reviewing certain vaccines and possible links to chronic illnesses as some states push to restrict the use of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccines using messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology became widespread during the pandemic. With limited long-term studies available, the Trump administration is revisiting these vaccines. RFK Jr. eyes childhood vaccine schedule review, says ‘nothing off limits’ What are mRNA vaccines? Vaccines using mRNA are based on RNA technology that dates back to the 1960s. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Pfizer and Moderna used the technology, which teaches the immune system to fight the virus without containing the virus itself, for their COVID-19 vaccines. Essentially, mRNA vaccines aim to boost the immune system's ability to defend against various diseases. Three states are independently addressing safety concerns related to mRNA vaccines. States considering mRNA vaccine bans In Idaho, lawmakers are considering Senate Bill 1036, known as the Doug Cameron Act, which seeks a 10-year pause on 'gene therapy immunizations to ensure the safety and well-being of all Idahoans.' The bill, named after an Idaho rancher who claims he became paralyzed in 2021 after taking the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, also seeks to ban RNA-based immunizations. On Monday, Idaho's Senate Health and Welfare Committee heard arguments regarding the bill for two hours but did not vote on it. In Montana, lawmakers considered similar legislation, but House Bill 371 failed after 66 representatives voted against it, with 34 in favor. In Florida, State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo has urged doctors to stop recommending mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. What to know about measles outbreaks in the Southwest He raised concerns about 'nucleic acid contaminants' in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, suggesting these could introduce 'contaminant DNA' into human cells and increase cancer risks. In December, the FDA responded to a letter from Ladapo outlining the same concerns. Officials dismissed the claims as 'quite implausible' and 'misleading.' Doctor: 'You can't hold back science' Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases professor at Vanderbilt University, compared banning mRNA technology to banning artificial intelligence. 'The radio was fine, the telephone was good, the computer is better, but we're not going to do AI; we're going to ban it. So you can't hold back science. Science is constantly advancing and creating newer and better and more effective vaccines. mRNA vaccines are an example of that,' he said. A new experimental mRNA vaccine could help manage the outbreak of bird flu seen in birds and cattle, and also prevent human infections.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/mahas-multiple-states-push-mrna-vaccine-ban/	2025-02-20T05:24:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/651aef5172dc16.50093677.jpeg?w=900
Hamas returns bodies of 4 Israeli hostages said to include mother...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. The remains were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted. Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive. Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Netanyahu appoints an adviser with Trump ties to lead ceasefire talks The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire. Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed militants, looked on as the coffins were loaded onto Red Cross vehicles before being driven to Israeli forces. The military planned to hold a small funeral ceremony, at the request of the families, before transferring the bodies to a laboratory for formal identification using DNA, a process that could take up to two days. Only then will the families be given the final notification. Israeli channels did not broadcast the handover. In Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where Israelis have gathered to watch the release of living hostages, a large screen showed a compilation of photos and videos of Lifshitz and the Bibas family, including a chuckling baby Kfir and the family dressed up in Batman costumes. Israelis have celebrated the return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under a tenuous ceasefire that paused over 15 months of war. But the handover on Thursday was a grim reminder of those who died in captivity as the talks leading up to the truce dragged on for over a year. It could also provide impetus for negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire that have hardly begun. The first phase is set to end at the beginning of March. Infant was the youngest taken hostage Kfir Bibas was just 9 months old, a red-headed infant with a toothless smile, when militants stormed into the family’s home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother Ariel was 4. Video shot that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the two boys as militants led them into Gaza. Her husband, Yarden Bibas, was taken separately and released this month after 16 months in captivity. Relatives in Israel have clung to hope, marking Kfir’s first and second birthdays and his brother's fifth. The Bibas family said in a statement Wednesday that it would wait for 'identification procedures' before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead. Palestinians should be able to leave Gaza if they choose: Israel envoy Supporters throughout Israel have worn orange in solidarity with the family — a reference to two boys' red hair — and a popular children’s song was written in their honor. Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded was a journalist who campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews. Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including some 30 children, in the Oct. 7 attack, in which they also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. More than half the hostages, and most of the women and children, have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight and have recovered dozens of bodies of people killed in the initial attack or who died in captivity. It's not clear if the ceasefire will last Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the ceasefire's first phase. That will leave the militants with some 60 hostages, all men, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he is committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Trump Gaza plan may hurt national security: Counterterrorism expert Trump's proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it, which has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries, has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. Hamas could be reluctant to free more hostages if it believes the war will resume with the goal of annihilating the group or forcibly transferring Gaza's population. Israel's military offensive killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to fields of rubble and bombed-out buildings. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding. Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-to-return-4-israeli-bodies-including-a-mother-and-her-2-young-children/	2025-02-20T00:40:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b6e869596378.94194988.jpeg?w=825
IRS to lose thousands of jobs in small-business division: Reports	(NewsNation) — The Internal Revenue Service is expecting to terminate more than 3,500 employees who work in the small business/self-employed division. CBS News first reported the expected firings, which were announced to managers in the division Wednesday. The terminations are expected to affect probationary hires who are 'not deemed as critical to filing season.' The division helps small businesses and entrepreneurs comply with taxes and assists with debt relief, serving 57 million Americans. USDA proposes ban on buying junk food with SNAP benefits The IRS is experiencing some of the largest numbers of mass firings at an agency across departments even as the peak tax season, which goes from mid-March through mid-April, approaches. Another division, which handles large business and international issues, also received an email requesting managers come into the office Thursday to discuss firings but did not say how many people would lose their jobs. The IRS employs tens of thousands of people and the firings come as the Trump administration has worked to terminate probationary hires across federal agencies. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly In some cases, the firings have led agencies to scramble to try to get people back as people in critical roles, including those who safeguard the nation's nuclear weapons and those who play a role in preventing a bird flu pandemic, were fired in mass terminations. The Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, has been working to access information in federal agencies, including an internal data system at the IRS that has Americans' individual tax information.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/irs-lose-thousand-job/	2025-02-19T16:13:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b0ff7edd3ef6.53568435.jpeg?w=900
Flight simulator shows view of conditions during Toronto crash	(NewsNation) — A flight instructor gave NewsNation a glimpse of what pilots might have seen from the cockpit when a Delta flight flipped over on landing. The flight from Minneapolis to Toronto crashed and flipped upside down, injuring several people at Toronto's Pearson Airport. Pilot Robert Thomas put the weather conditions for that day into a flight simulator to show what the pilots could have experienced. NTSB investigating mid-air collision in Arizona The flight simulator was for a 737, which is larger than the CRJ-900 that flipped. But the view would be similar. As pilots approach, they would have disengaged autopilot, Thomas said, pointing out a view of a runway and lights that they would have seen as they were about five miles away. The pilots would have been landing on a runway more than 11,000 feet long in snowy and windy conditions. 'If I have a lot of wind blowing on my aircraft, it's going to change the amount of wind blowing over my wings, which affects lift,' Thomas said. 'So if I have a gust of wind that hits my aircraft and it dies off, that's going to affect how my aircraft flies.' Winds coming from any direction can also help push the plane's path. There was also a lot of snow on the ground, with Toronto having received 20 inches of snow prior to Monday's incident. Aviation firings a ‘concern’ amid increase in plane crashes The wind would be blowing snow across the runway, potentially creating optical illusions and visibility challenges for pilots. However, Thomas said airports usually do a good job of keeping runways clear. Thomas explained that when coming in for a landing, pilots would be focusing on keeping the wings level and the nose down, correcting for winds with the yoke and rudder pedals to make sure the plane doesn't get pushed off the runway. The investigation into Monday's crash is still underway and it's too soon to say if weather is the cause or what other factors could have come into play. 'The really special thing about the aviation industry is that everybody is working together to make things operate safely,' Thomas said. 'When things do get crazy, do get a little unsafe, everybody works together to make sure the best outcome is possible.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/flight-simulator-conditions-toronto-crash/	2025-02-19T14:29:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/DeltaThumb.jpg?w=900
Trump's plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be co...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wants to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits, but a new analysis shows that plan comes at a steep cost and would worsen the program's financial shortfall. Ending taxes on benefits would reduce government revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7% by 2054, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model. Nixing taxes would also move up the date when the Social Security trust fund is expected to run out. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? As it currently stands, retirees could see their benefits slashed by 21% in roughly a decade if Congress doesn't fix the program, which pays out more than it brings in. Trump's plan to end income taxes on benefits would accelerate the estimated depletion date of the Social Security Trust Fund by two years, from December 2034 to December 2032, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. 'I think it is a bad idea not to tax benefits for people receiving them,' said Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh pointed out that the Social Security Fairness Act, which Joe Biden recently signed into law, will also accelerate the program's financial woes. 'The government is not taking seriously the fiscal problems that Social Security has,' Nowrasteh warned. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports Experts previously told NewsNation that Trump's Social Security tax promise would be hard to keep but that hasn't stopped Republican lawmakers from trying. Representatives Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., recently reintroduced the Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act, which would end federal income taxes on Social Security benefits and boost the retirement income of older Americans. Who gets taxed on their Social Security benefits? About half of Social Security beneficiaries pay income tax on their benefits, according to the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The amount of tax owed varies depending on one's income. As of now, individuals who earn more than $25,000 may have to pay taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security retirement benefits. For those who earn more than $34,000, up to 85% of benefits could be taxable. One of the main critiques of the current system is that those thresholds don't go up with inflation, so over time, more retirees have been subject to taxes on their benefits. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits The counter-argument is that taxing benefits helps the government fund Social Security. Income from taxation makes up roughly 4% of what the program brings in, about $50 billion that Social Security would have to find elsewhere. The Penn Wharton Budget Model said 95% of retirees would benefit if Trump's campaign promise was implemented, but 'all future generations would be worse off.' And if taxes on Social Security benefits are eliminated, the biggest gains would go toward high-income retirees. Some high-income households, who currently pay the most in taxes on Social Security benefits, would gain more than $100,000 over their lifetimes, the analysis found. However, households in the lowest two income quintiles would see more modest gains, ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. Meanwhile, those younger than 30 would be worse off, with newborn households losing about $10,000 in lifetime welfare, the analysis said. The report concluded: 'The policy primarily benefits high-income households nearing or in retirement while harming households under thirty and all future generations across the entire income distribution.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-taxes-social-security-benefits/	2025-02-19T14:22:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67afdf41832241.40142539.jpeg?w=900
President Trump, Elon Musk sit for first TV interview	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk sat down for a joint interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday and defended the administration’s efforts to conduct an expansive overhaul of the federal government. The interview was the latest display of Trump sharing the spotlight with Musk, following an Oval Office appearance by the Tesla CEO last week in which he fielded several questions from reporters while the president sat at the Resolute Desk. The White House says billionaire Elon Musk is not technically part of the Department of Government Efficiency team sweeping through federal agencies, but is rather a senior adviser to the president. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? In the interview, Musk defended DOGE’s work and claimed the department is working to root out 'unelected' bureaucrats in the U.S. government. 'They wouldn't be complaining so much if we weren't doing something useful… What we're really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president. And what we're finding is that there's an unelected bureaucracy — speaking of unelected, there's a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the president and the cabinet.' He brushed aside Democratic criticisms of DOGE, insisting the try agency is trying 'to restore democracy and the will of the people.' Musk's exact role could be key in the legal fight over DOGE's access to government data as the Trump administration moves to lay off thousands of federal workers. Defining him as an adviser rather than the administrator in charge of day-to-day operations at DOGE could help the administration as it pushes back against a lawsuit arguing Musk has too much power for someone who isn't elected or Senate-confirmed.

Elon Musk responds to DOGE check suggestion: What do we know?	(NewsNation) — A suggestion by an X user to send a check to taxpayers using money saved by President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency gained traction online after Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to it. 'President Trump and @ElonMusk should announce a ‘DOGE Dividend' — a tax refund check sent to every taxpayer, funded exclusively with a portion of the total savings delivered by DOGE,' James Fishback, CEO of InvestAzoria, said on X. Should DOGE save $2 trillion it's said it aims to cut, and with 78 million tax-paying households in the United States, Fishback said this would amount to a $5,000 refund per household, 'with the remaining used to pay down the national debt.' Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? 'Will check with the President,' Musk said on X, later writing, 'Obviously, the President is the Commander-in-Chief, so this is entirely up to him.' Could we get a DOGE dividend check? It still remains to be seen whether these checks will come to fruition. The idea got mixed reactions online, with Dilbert creator Scott Adams saying, 'The worst case scenario or DOGE is our government treating DOGE 'savings' as their new piggy bank, which I fear Congress is already doing.' 'This particular idea — the $5K tax refund — has utility if it gets the public on the side of DOGE,' Adams said. 'But it also sets a precedent that can't be ignored.' In response, Musk said, 'We need to balance the budget as first priority.' NewsNation has reached out to the Trump administration for comment. What is DOGE? DOGE was created by Trump under an executive order. The president said at the time it would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Members of DOGE have been going into federal agencies, looking at their budgets and tapping into computer systems. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE got access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. In addition, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s money, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. Education Department warns schools to cut DEI programs or lose funding DOGE cuts With the new federal cuts have come layoffs and firings, with the Associated Press estimating that thousands of federal employees have been shown the door, though no official figure is available. Last Thursday, Office of Personnel Management officials met with agency leaders Thursday and directed them to start firing probationary employees. A lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenged DOGE’s authority to access sensitive government data. Attorneys general argued that Musk has power that can only be given to those elected or confirmed through the Senate. While U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are legitimate questions about Musk’s authority, she refused Tuesday to issue a temporary restraining order blocking him from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. The White House, meanwhile, says Musk is not technically a part of DOGE but a senior adviser to Trump. Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, said in court papers that Musk has 'no actual authority to make government decisions himself.' Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports How much has DOGE said it’s saved? DOGE claims that it has saved the government $55 billion — however, Bloomberg notes that its website only accounts for $16.6 billion of that, even without factoring in a previous error that mislabeled one contract as $8 billion. (It was actually $8 million, the New York Times reported.) Currently listed online are a 'subset' of DOGE’s contract and lease cancellations. 'We are working to upload all of this data in a digestible and fully transparent manner with clear assumptions, consistent with applicable rules and regulations,' the DOGE website says. Contracts it has cut from include USAID, the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management, Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Homeland Security, the General Services Administration, the Department of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency and Housing and Urban Development. Experts, including two Republicans who spoke to Reuters, say that most of these 'savings' are driven more by ideological views than economic ones. 'They are not going to go into agencies that are doing things they like. They are going into agencies they disagree with,' Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Republican director of the Congressional Budget Office, told Reuters. Another criticism of DOGE includes a conflict of interest with Musk as his company SpaceX has received money from federal contracts.

DOGE affiliate may access IRS taxpayer records: Report	(NewsNation) — An IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency is expected to seek access to a system that holds sensitive taxpayer information, according to NBC News. DOGE is specifically looking to get into the Integrated Data Retrieval System, which allows IRS employees to see taxpayer accounts. A DOGE staffer visited the agency Thursday to meet with executives, according to Reuters. Elon Musk’s DOGE has access to these federal agencies According to the IRS website, the IDRS is used to 'research account information and request returns' and to 'automatically generate notices, collection documents and other outputs.' It contains information such as taxpayer identification numbers and retirement account information. The move comes as DOGE is expanding its efforts to access sensitive information that the federal government holds. An X account with the name DOGE IRS made a post Monday, reading, 'DOGE is seeking help from the public! Please DM this account with insights on finding and fixing waste, fraud and abuse relating to the Internal Revenue Service.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-access-irs-taxpayer-records/	2025-02-19T11:35:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b0ff7edd3ef6.53568435.jpeg?w=900
Trump: Zelensky 'has done a terrible job'	President Trump on Wednesday ratcheted up his criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of taking advantage of the United States and saying he has done a 'terrible job' leading his war-torn country. Trump went after Zelensky and questioned U.S. support for Ukraine in its war against Russia a day after he appeared to blame the Ukrainian leader for starting the conflict. Zelensky responded to those earlier comments by saying Trump 'lives in this disinformation space.' 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle,' Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. He questioned why the United States has spent billions of dollars in support of Ukraine and why the Biden administration did not demand Europe put in an equal amount, given its proximity to the conflict. 'He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle,'' Trump wrote of Zelensky. 'A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. 'In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going,' Trump continued. 'I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..' Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after amassing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine postponed its 2024 presidential elections because of martial law being in place amid the Russian invasion. Top Trump administration officials met Tuesday in Saudi Arabia with Russian officials in the first step toward negotiating a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. The meeting did not include Ukrainian officials, which irked Zelensky. Trump vowed to end the war during his presidential campaign. He has shrugged off questions about which party is at fault or whether Ukraine is an equal member of peace talks, saying he wants the killing to stop. His rhetoric about ending the war, and the fact that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week before talking to Zelensky, has marked a shift in posture from the Biden administration, which championed the concept of 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.' Trump on Tuesday was sharply critical of Zelensky when asked by reporters about the meeting in Saudi Arabia. 'Today I heard, ‘Oh, well we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' he said of Ukraine. 'You should’ve ended it in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.' Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week called it 'unrealistic' for Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders as part of a ceasefire agreement with Russia, or to gain NATO membership. Those comments sparked criticism, as some saw it as giving away negotiating leverage for Ukraine before peace talks began in earnest. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, Congress had approved nearly $183 billion in Ukraine aid, according to a federal government oversight office. A Jan. 20 release from the State Department said the U.S. had provided roughly $66 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022, as well as billions of dollars in other forms of support.

NTSB investigating mid-air collision in Arizona	(NewsNation) — The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating a mid-air collision between two small planes in Marana, Arizona. Two people have been confirmed dead following the accident, Marana police confirmed. The collision took place just before 8:30 a.m. local time near the Marana Regional Airport and involved a Cessna 172S and a Lancair 360 MK II. Trump says ‘inflation is back’: ‘I had nothing to do with it’ Preliminary information shows the planes collided upwind of runway 12. The Cessna was able to land and the Lancair crashed nearby and a fire broke out after impact. According to the FAA, the airport is an 'uncontrolled field' that does not have an air traffic control tower in use. Pilots use a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency to communicate with other planes in the vicinity of the airport. An NTSB investigator is on the way and anyone who witnessed the accident or who has surveillance video, including doorbell camera video, of the area is encouraged to contact the agency. Aviation firings a ‘concern’ amid increase in plane crashes The accident is one in a string of several plane crashes since the start of 2025, the largest of which was a mid-air collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people. Other aviation accidents include a medical jet that crashed in Philadelphia; a plane that crashed in Alaska; a military jet that crashed into the San Diego Bay and a Delta flight that flipped over upon landing in Toronto.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/mid-air-collision-arizona/	2025-02-19T10:38:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/ArizonaPlaneThumb.jpg?w=552
USDA proposes ban on buying junk food with SNAP benefits	(NewsNation) — U.S. Department of Agriculture Chief Tom Vilsack has proposed that the 'Make America Healthy Again' commission consider banning junk food and sugary drink purchases using food stamps. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program should prioritize healthy food choices. However, many of those options are costly compared to cheap, ultraprocessed foods, and accessibility is an issue for low-income communities. The proposal follows Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s vow to remove soda from items eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. Over 40M Americans receive SNAP benefits Last year, 41.7 million Americans received SNAP benefits, according to the USDA, which cost taxpayers nearly $94 billion. Each recipient received about $188 per month. Congress is currently considering two bills addressing SNAP benefits. One seeks to ban SNAP purchases of junk foods like cookies, cakes, pies and sodas, while the other aims to improve the nutrition and diet quality of food available to recipients. Republicans consider cuts and work requirements for Medicaid, jeopardizing care for millions Another economic argument favoring the ban is that taxpayers are indirectly paying twice: once to fund the purchase of junk food and again to fund medical costs resulting from chronic diseases linked to poor diets. Doctor: Incentives need to support farmers, fresh produce Dr. Joel Warsh, a pediatrician, supports the idea of banning junk food purchases with food stamps but also believes the government needs a plan for incentives to support local farmers and fresh produce. He notes that the American diet, 70% of which is made up of ultraprocessed foods, is a key cause of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. He also highlighted a disturbing rise in type 2 diabetes in children. 'It's called adult-onset diabetes. It wasn't even something that you would have seen when I was a kid, in a child, but now we're seeing it in teenagers and even younger children,' Warsh said. 'Going back to diabetes, like one-third of kids are diabetic or pre-diabetic, that is not okay. We have to do something about that. It's not the same all over the world.' It's unclear when or how these proposed changes to the SNAP program will be implemented and whether they'll come through Congress or the 'Make America Healthy Again' commission.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/usda-proposes-junk-food-ban-snap-benefits/	2025-02-19T06:41:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1205050194-e1727116913367.jpg?w=800
Trump 'lives' in Russian 'disinformation space': Zelenskyy	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to President Donald Trump's latest rebuke, calling out Trump for living in a Russian 'disinformation space.' 'Unfortunately, President Trump, I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us, unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,' Zelenskyy told reporters early Wednesday. His claim follows Trump's news conference from his Mar-a-Lago resort Tuesday evening, where he criticized the Ukrainian leader and claimed his approval ratings were low. Trump says he’s ordered firing of all remaining ‘Biden-era’ US attorneys Zelenskyy also pressed Trump and U.S. officials to 'be more truthful.' The request follows a high-stakes meeting in Saudi Arabia between Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian officials, who kicked off discussions about how to end the nearly three-year war and renew ties between the two countries. Ukraine was notably not invited to the negotiation table — a move Zelenskyy has denounced. He's urged European officials to muscle their way into the discussions and argued that no peace agreement should be accomplished without his country in the mix. Trump on Tuesday repeated his previous claims that he could end the Eastern European conflict and seemed to blame Ukraine’s leadership for the war, claiming that Zelenskyy 'should have never started it.' 'But today I heard, ‘Oh, well we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump said from his Florida resort. 'You should’ve ended it in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,' he continued. 'I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.' ‘Zizian’ cult suspect’s friend says group was preparing for violence Zelenskyy's reply came ahead of his meeting with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Gen. Keith Kellogg, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday. The Ukrainian leader said he was 'ready to go to the front line' with Kellogg so that he could 'see for himself' what was unfolding on the ground. Russia started the full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, after repeatedly warning Kyiv could not join the NATO alliance and stationing troops near Ukraine’s borders. The invasion came eight years after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/trump-zelenskyy-russian-disinformation-space/	2025-02-19T05:48:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25050391177279-e1739967405836.jpg?w=900
Trump to attend Saudi-backed conference in Miami	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting in Miami on Wednesday with global financiers and tech executives hosted by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The conference will focus on U.S. investments and business, according to a White House official. Trump is expected to deliver an in-person address at the event following his call in January for Riyadh to invest $1 trillion in the United States. The meeting also comes after Saudi Arabia slammed Trump's plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza as part of a U.S.-led rebuilding plan. Trump blasts Zelenskyy after Russia talks On Tuesday, Trump also appeared to blame Ukraine's leaders for starting the three-year war with Russia, arguing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'should have never started it.' Trump says Zelenskyy ‘should have never started’ war with Russia 'You could have made a deal,' Trump said to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate. 'I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.' Despite his criticism, he expressed a personal liking for Zelenskyy and emphasized his focus on achieving results. Zelenksyy protests Russian attacks Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior officials met Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia and agreed to stay in close communication to work to end the war. Zelenskyy has accused Russia of continued attacks, particularly on the city of Odesa, and of launching 150 suicide drones overnight. Zelenskyy delayed his planned trip to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday in protest and criticized Trump for living in a 'disinformation space,' as new intelligence suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin remains determined to control all of Ukraine and has no interest in peace talks. PGA seeks Trump's help with LIV Golf merger Golf legend Tiger Woods said merger talks between the U.S.-based PGA Tour and Saudi-backed rival LIV Golf are in a 'very positive place.' Are millions of dead people receiving Social Security benefits? Woods said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and player director Adam Scott had a productive meeting with Trump this month, seeking his involvement in talks with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. PGA and Saudi officials said they hope Trump can help ease antitrust concerns about the merger and expect regulators to be more receptive under Trump than under the Biden administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-saudi-conference-miami/	2025-02-19T05:06:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2199787693.jpg?w=900
Trump says Zelensky 'should have never started' war with Russia	President Trump on Tuesday appeared to blame Ukraine's leaders for the three-year war with Russia, arguing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'should have never started it.' Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after massing troops on the border and demanding a ban on Ukraine ever joining the NATO alliance. The invasion took place nearly a decade after Russia took over Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Trump vowed to end the war during his presidential campaign and on Tuesday repeated his claim that the war would never have started if he had been president. He spoke after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia without Ukraine officials. 'I think I have the power to end this war. And I think it’s going very well,' Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago on the heels of the meeting between U.S. and Russian officials. 'But today I heard, ‘Oh, well we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump continued. 'You should’ve ended it in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal. I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.' Trump went on to rail against former President Biden as 'so pathetic' before again criticizing Zelensky. 'Look, you have leadership — and I like him personally. He’s fine. But I don’t care about personally. I care about getting the job done. You have leadership now that’s allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened, even without the United States.' Trump’s comments came after three of his senior administration officials met with their Russian counterparts earlier Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to discuss mending relations between the two powers and ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting marked a dramatic shift in U.S.-Russia relations. Zelensky expressed frustration that Ukrainian representatives were not part of the talks. 'Decisions on how to end the war in Ukraine cannot be made without Ukraine, nor can any conditions be imposed,' Zelensky said during a visit to Turkey on Tuesday. 'We were not invited to this Russian-American meeting in Saudi Arabia. It was a surprise for us, I think for many others as well.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in Saudi Arabia that any final agreement would have to be acceptable to Ukraine and Europe, as well as Russia. Trump has over the past week moved forward with his desire to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, which began three years ago when Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of its neighbor. Trump last week spoke first with Russian President Vladimir Putin about starting peace negotiations, then with Zelensky. Trump has talked bout holding a face-to-face meeting with Putin in the near future. While Trump has stressed he wants an end to the killing, he and some administration officials have made comments in the past week that have alarmed allies and some lawmakers. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called it 'unrealistic' for Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders as part of a ceasefire agreement with Russia or to gain NATO membership. Trump called it an 'interesting question' when asked if he viewed Ukraine as an equal member of the peace negotiations without answering directly. 'I think they have to make peace,' Trump said last week. 'Their people are being killed, and I think they have to make peace. I said that was not a good war to go into, and I think they have to make peace. That’s what I think.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-zelensky-should-have-never-started-war-with-russia/	2025-02-19T03:02:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump_MAL_Presser_022025.jpg?w=900
Zizian' cult suspect's friend says group was preparing for viole...	(NewsNation) — Just one day after alleged 'Zizian' leader Jack LaSota was arrested, investigators say radical veganism, artificial intelligence and transgender identity connected members to the so-called 'death cult.' Authorities say the group is connected to the shooting death of Border Patrol agent David Maland and five others. The alleged crimes occurred in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California over the last three years. NewsNation reviewed court records in the recent arrest of the cult leader that tells the story of how the group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists met online and shared anarchist beliefs. Alleged Zizian ‘death cult’ leader arrested: Police Their violent rampage started in 2022 when police say 82-year-old Curtis Lind was stabbed with a sword by three members of the Zizian cult, local news media site Open Vallejo reported. Lind lost an eye in the attack and was later allegedly killed by the cult members who were squatting on his Solano County, Calif., property. 'Zizian' victim's friend says members killed to avoid rent NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin spoke with one of Lind's closest friends anonymously about the tragedy. 'Basically, what led to it was the idea, I think, that these transgender, homicidal, computer scientist vegans thought that they could get away with not paying him any rent,' Lind's friend told NewsNation in a phone call. The friend said he took multiple computers from box trucks on the property containing what he believes to be instruments for surgery owned by the members, including scalpels. Border agent’s slaying could be tied to ‘death cult’: Police 'Zizian' members prepared for 'violence of some form': Acquaintance After Maland's death, investigators found pistols, ammunition, night vision goggles, face respirators, a ballistic helmet, shooting range targets and radios in the suspect's car. Jessica Taylor, who knew a member of the Zizian group, tells NewsNation her friend dropped off the radar before joining the cult. 'It seems like, based on what was in the car, they might have been preparing for some sort of operation or violence of some form,' Taylor said. 'In terms of having bullets and walkie-talkies and wanting not to be observed.' What is the 'Zizian' group? The group is reportedly comprised of students who studied artificial intelligence and computer science. The Zizians are named for LaSota, a computer engineer, who goes by the nickname 'Ziz.' Federal investigators are looking into whether Maland's killing is part of a series of deaths linked to the Zizians. Who is ‘Zizian’ member Jack LaSota? The Associated Press reported that LaSota uses she/her pronouns and says in her writings that she is a transgender woman. LaSota reportedly railed against perceived enemies in writings, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Police believe that LaSota faked her death in 2022 and is now wanted in two states, according to the media site Open Vallejo. The site reported LaSota was detained by police after a stabbing death in Northern California. LaSota’s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, declined to comment when asked whether LaSota is connected to any of the deaths. Before LaSota’s weekend arrest, LaSota missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants were issued. LaSota was ordered held without bail after appearing in court Tuesday. NewsNation's Jeff Arnold and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/zizian-cult-leader-lasota-suspect-violence/	2025-02-18T18:03:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/FS_CUSTOM_IMAGE_CRAZY-CULT-KILLINGS-FS1.png?w=900
Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud?	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk said he might have uncovered 'the biggest fraud in history' when he found millions of people over age 100 listed in a Social Security database, but that's not what's going on. On Sunday, Musk posted a chart on X allegedly showing more than 20 million people over 100 years old listed in 'the Social Security database.' 'These are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!,' Musk said, joking that 'a lot of vampires' are collecting Social Security. He added, 'There are FAR more 'eligible' social security numbers than there are citizens,' and said it might be 'the biggest fraud in history.' Elon Musk’s DOGE could break Social Security: Martin O’Malley While it's true that there are only 90,000 people over 100 living in the U.S., that doesn't mean millions of dead beneficiaries are receiving Social Security checks. Records with incomplete death info are a well-known, long-standing challenge for the Social Security Administration, but a 2023 agency inspector general report found 'almost none' of the 18.9 million people listed as 100 or older were receiving benefits. 'What Musk has tweeted is not primarily an example of fraud but more like the messy databases kept by Social Security,' said Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh said when someone turns 100, the government manually checks to make sure they are still alive and not receiving extra benefits. He pointed out that Social Security fraud is a 'very small issue' compared to the program's other challenges. Martin O'Malley, the former Social Security commissioner under Joe Biden, laughed when asked about Musk's fraud claims Monday. 'He doesn't know what he's talking about,' O'Malley told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. Here's what's going on with Social Security's death data and why it's not necessarily an example of rampant fraud. Are millions of dead people still receiving Social Security benefits? A Social Security list known as the 'Numident' — which is what Musk is believed to be referring to — shows far more centenarians than are actually alive, but that doesn't mean they're being sent checks. The inspector general's 2023 audit found that Social Security's Numident included approximately 18.9 million people listed as 100 or older but not dead — far more than the 86,000 centenarians living in the U.S. at the time of the review. However, 'almost none' of the 18.9 million were receiving Social Security payments, the report concluded. Instead, only 44,000 people over 100 were getting benefits — closer to the actual centenarian population. 'This hardly feels like big potatoes,' economist Justin Wolfers wrote in response to Musk's findings on X. The inaccurate death information likely stems from the fact that individuals died decades before the use of electronic death reporting, according to the inspector general report. Incomplete or inaccurate info can cause discrepancies across the various databases Social Security relies on, but it doesn't mean there's rampant fraud. With that said, leaving the problem unsolved could allow 'for a wider range of potential abuse,' the 2023 audit noted. Correcting the errors would come at a cost, anywhere from $5.5 to $9.7 million, according to the Social Security Administration. President Trump speaks as he is joined by Elon Musk, and his son X Æ A-Xii, in the Oval Office at the White House on Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. Does Social Security mistakenly pay people after they die? While the scale of the overpayment problem is almost certainly smaller than Musk has implied, improperly paying dead beneficiaries does happen. An inspector general report from Nov. 2021 found that Social Security issued approximately $298 million in payments after death to about 24,000 beneficiaries. The agency recovered about $84 million of that, meaning it had not recovered about $214 million of the payments. That doesn't mean fraud is the reason those payments went out. Instead, the report found that it was mostly because Social Security technicians did not follow policy. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports A separate 2015 audit of Social Security found just 3 confirmed instances of employment fraud in a sample of 6.5 million deceased individuals. O'Malley said the main fraud concern is when people call in and try to switch accounts, hijacking benefits from the living, not the dead. 'That's where most of the fraud comes from,' O'Malley told Cuomo. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury announced in January that it had recouped more than $31 million in federal payments that improperly went to dead people. That result came as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's 'Full Master Death File.' 'These results are just the tip of the iceberg,' the Treasury’s Fiscal Assistant Secretary David Lebryk said in a news release. 'Congress granting permanent access to the Full Death Master File will significantly reduce fraud, improve program integrity, and better safeguard taxpayer dollars.' The Treasury said it expects to recover over $215 million during the three-year access period, which runs from Dec. 2023 through 2026. How big of a problem are overpayments? The Social Security Administration issues over $1 trillion in benefit payments annually, which means even slight errors can cost taxpayers billions. A July 2024 report from the agency's inspector general called improper payments a 'long-standing challenge' and said more needs to be done to fix the problem. The audit found that the Social Security Administration sent about $71.8 billion in improper payments between fiscal years 2015 and 2022 — most of which were overpayments. Still, the nearly $72 billion total represents 0.84% of the roughly $8.6 trillion paid out over the period. Here's why Donald Trump's Social Security promise could be hard to keep While that is a lot of money, Social Security's improper payment rate is considered relatively low compared to other large-scale programs. 'If you had to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,' said Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who specializes in Social Security. By comparison, the Medicaid improper payment rate was over 5% in fiscal year 2024, according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. CMS noted that improper payments are typically related to administrative mistakes and don't necessarily indicate fraud or abuse. What's the major problem with Social Security? Social Security is facing a financial shortfall, and federal lawmakers are running out of time to fix it. Without reform, the program's trust fund could be depleted in roughly a decade. At that point, retirees could see their monthly benefits slashed by roughly 20% percent. Cracking down on Social Security mistakes is a good thing, but it won't necessarily solve the larger financial issue, Blahous pointed out. 'Social Security’s financial problems aren’t being caused by the improper payments but by legal ones exceeding what workers’ tax contributions can fund,' Blahous said. Nowrasteh agreed. 'We definitely cannot lose sight of the fact that Social Security is facing very serious fiscal problems, and reductions in fraud are not going to make a meaningful difference,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-social-security-fraud/	2025-02-18T15:52:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67af2047d18f94.20394458.jpeg?w=900
Trump signals 25 percent tariffs coming on cars, semiconductors a...	President Trump on Tuesday indicated he would unveil tariffs on imports of automobiles, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals in early April, starting at 25 percent. Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that he would likely announce the tariffs on April 2, and he indicated the duty on auto imports would be 'in the neighborhood of 25 percent.' Asked about tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, Trump said it would be '25 percent and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over the course of a year.' 'But we want to give them time to come in,' Trump added. 'Because as you know when they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. So we want to give them a little bit of a chance.' Trump has been ramping up his use of tariffs since taking office, despite warnings from many economists that imposing tariffs on imports could lead to higher prices for American consumers. The president signed off on 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports earlier this month, but ultimately delayed them for a month after those two countries took actions to address the flow of drugs at the border. Trump has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, along with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Last week, Trump signed a memorandum proposing reciprocal tariffs on other countries to match tariffs and duties they place on American goods. Those tariffs will go into effect in the coming weeks, giving other nations a chance to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-signals-25-percent-tariffs-coming-on-cars-semiconductors-and-pharmaceuticals/	2025-02-18T15:07:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump_MAL_Presser.jpg?w=900
Chutkan refuses to block Musk, DOGE from 7 federal agencies	U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Tuesday refused the request of 14 Democratic state attorneys general to immediately impose wide-ranging restrictions on Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The coalition of states, led by New Mexico, claims Musk’s far-reaching role heading DOGE is unconstitutional since he was not confirmed by the Senate, and the states sought to block DOGE from accessing seven federal agencies. Chutkan refused their demand to do so at the current stage of the case, saying they had not made the necessary showing of irreparable harm. 'Plaintiffs legitimately call into question what appears to be the unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight,' Chutkan wrote in her ruling. 'In these circumstances, it must be indisputable that this court acts within the bounds of its authority,' she continued. 'Accordingly, it cannot issue a TRO [temporary restraining order], especially one as wide-ranging as Plaintiffs request, without clear evidence of imminent, irreparable harm to these Plaintiffs. The current record does not meet that standard.' However, in a footnote, the judge suggested that the Justice Department may have stretched the truth in court filings regarding the breadth of DOGE’s power over personnel issues. 'Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court,' Chutkan wrote. Musk’s DOGE has moved rapidly since Trump’s inauguration to install employees at federal agencies with an aim of cutting trillions of dollars in government spending, quickly drawing legal challenges. It has put Chutkan, an appointee of former President Obama, at the center of another battle implicating President Trump. The judge previously oversaw the now-dismissed Jan. 6 criminal case against the president. The Democratic-led states have sought to block Musk and DOGE personnel from accessing confidential data at the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Commerce. Chutkan issued Tuesday’s order after pressing the plaintiffs about the broad scope of their request at two hearings, including one held on Monday despite the federal holiday. 'I don’t mean to be dismissive, but it's sort of like a prophylactic TRO, and that's not allowed,' Chutkan said during Monday’s hearing. The Democratic-led states raised alarm about the barrage of reports of Musk’s work to dismantle parts of the federal bureaucracy, calling it a 'one-of-a-kind situation' that demanded immediate relief. 'They're stepping well beyond the authority and the four corners of the executive order, to the extent that it said they're charged with rooting out waste and fraud,' said Anjana Samant, a lawyer representing New Mexico. Harry Graver, a lawyer for the Justice Department, said there are 'very clear paper trails' for all the actions taken by DOGE and there’s 'not a single instance' of Musk commanding the actions in his own name. 'Nowhere have my friends offered a shroud to show that Elon Musk has any formal or actual authority to make any government decision,' Graver said. 'I think you stretch too far,' Chutkan interjected. 'I disagree with you there.' After the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a sworn declaration indicating that Musk is not a DOGE employee and is instead a senior adviser to the president at the White House. The judge also questioned the government over thousands of federal employees apparently fired across several agencies on Friday, which a DOJ lawyer said he had not confirmed. The case before Chutkan is one of more than a dozen pending lawsuits that challenge DOGE’s structure or its access to systems at various federal departments. A separate judge late Monday declined to block DOGE from accessing student borrower data at the Education Department. On Friday night, a judge refused a group of unions' request to block DOGE from accessing two federal departments and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which the administration has looked to gut.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/chutkan-refuses-to-block-musk-doge-from-7-federal-agencies/	2025-02-18T14:10:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/muskelon_021325upi01_w_426006.jpg?w=900
Courts to rule over DOGE accessing Americans' personal informatio...	(NewsNation) — Several key court rulings on whether the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency can access the personal information of tens of millions of Americans could come to pass as early as Tuesday evening. Democratic attorneys general from 14 states are seeking a temporary restraining order to stop Elon Musk and his DOGE team from accessing sensitive data and firing employees at half a dozen federal agencies. DOGE is also seeking access to IRS systems that contain the private financial data of just about every American who's ever paid taxes or received a refund. That data includes banking details, Social Security numbers and employment information. Because DOGE is so new and so different in its operation, a lot of the questions about what it is and is not legally allowed to do are going to be decided in the courts. Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports The legal complaints are attempting to stop or limit the mass firing of workers in federal agencies and to limit DOGE's access to American taxpayers' data from the IRS and Treasury databases. Musk has defended DOGE's authority and says DOGE must access the data to continue its mission. District court judge for the District of Columbia, Tanya Chutkan, is expected to make a ruling Tuesday. DOGE posted on its website that it has saved $55 billion in waste or fraud. Some of what is listed is still being held up in court. It lists some half a billion dollars of savings within the Department of Education that are proposed cuts that have not been carried out. It lists another $144 million related to real estate leases it says will eventually be brought back.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/courts-doge-americans-personal-information/	2025-02-18T11:50:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67aab3f76f1bf4.15685446.jpeg?w=900
Border Patrol agents told to resume using body cameras	(NewsNation) — An order Border Patrol agents were sent telling them to stop using body cameras has now been lifted. Border Patrol sources tell NewsNation agents are now being directed to resume normal operations. Last week, Customs and Border Protection sent out a memo saying there was a 'potential security risk' associated with the cameras being used and that they should not use them 'pending completion of investigation and risk mitigation.' Which federal agencies are firing new hires? Sources said some social media posts had been circulating showing how the cameras can be tracked from 100 yards away. Bomb squad sources told NewsNation there is also concern that the radio frequencies transmitted by the cameras could be used to set off an improvised explosive device, depending on what type of switch the bomb builder uses. NewsNation has reached out to CBP for comment on the outcome of their investigation into the cameras and how they're mitigating potential risks. CBP was initially one of the first federal agencies to wear body cameras following an order from former President Joe Biden. It has publicly released many of its recordings over the past four years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-patrol-agents-resume-body-cameras/	2025-02-18T11:01:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/CBP_050219_AP_Eric-Gay.jpeg?w=900
Social Security head resigns following DOGE data request: Reports	(NewsNation) — The acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration has stepped down from her role after the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to private information, according to reports. Acting Commissioner Michelle King left the agency after more than 30 years, allegedly refusing to give DOGE staffers sensitive information, according to the Associated Press. Former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley told NewsNation, 'I think she should hold her head high... I think she's a patriot if the reports I'm hearing are true.' But why does DOGE want access to Social Security information? And what would they do with that access? What is DOGE? The Department of Government Efficiency was created by President Donald Trump through an executive order. Previously, the organization was called the Office of Digital Services. Trump also moved DOGE to be under the Executive Office of the President from the Office of Management and Budget. Does DOGE have your personal information? DOGE has made many changes to some agencies, like USAID, which is responsible for offering humanitarian aid overseas. There have been leadership shakeups for DOGE and lawsuits they have had to face. After accessing USAID's systems, DOGE put most of the staff on administrative leave, recalled those who were overseas and prevented staff from accessing the USAID office in Washington, D.C. A person protesting Elon Musk's actions in the Trump administration holds a sign outside a Tesla showroom in Seattle on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Manuel Valdes) DOGE is not an agency or a Cabinet-level position, but it has been treated nearly the same. Because of this, Elon Musk, head of DOGE, has not had to go through a Senate confirmation hearing, which would typically be required for someone at that level of power. Musk claimed in an Oval Office press conference in February that a 'cursory examination of Social Security, and we got people in there that are 150 years old. Now, do you know anyone that's 150? I don't know. They should be in the Guinness Book of World Records... So, that's a case where I think they're probably dead.' O'Malley told NewsNation that isn't the case, and there are bigger problems with the Social Security Administration. 'He doesn't know what he's talking about... you know what the biggest problem is of Social Security? They're serving more people than ever, every single day, with staffing that House Republicans have reduced to a 50-year low.' What would DOGE do with Social Security information? It is not known what DOGE wants to do with any Social Security information it is given access to. At the beginning of February, Trump said that DOGE would not 'touch' Social Security. How will DOGE impact Social Security? Panelists debate program’s future 'Social Security will not be touched, it will only be strengthened,' Trump said during a news conference when asked if there are any limits placed on what Musk can examine. DOGE employees do have access to the Social Security numbers of many Americans, along with sensitive tax information and banking accounts for direct deposit. Demonstrators rally in support of federal workers outside of the Department of Health and Human Services, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Trump and Musk have continuously stated that DOGE is only conducting a financial audit. However, audits do not typically require direct access to the Treasury Department's payment system. The Trump administration has said that Musk has read-only access to the system, but some critics have raised the alarm about what Musk could do. Could DOGE, Trump administration close the IRS? Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss from Massachusetts told NewsNation, 'I think Americans are wondering right now why the heck Elon Musk has access to their Social Security numbers, why he knows who's paying child support, why he sees people's tax refunds. I think they're wondering why this unelected billionaire knows information about them that he has no business knowing.' With access to the payment system, DOGE could cut off any payments it or Trump decides should be cut. This could include: Cutting funding for school lunch programs Deciding who should or should not receive Social Security payments Who will be the new head of the Social Security Administration? According to Harrison Fields, the special assistant to the president, Trump has nominated Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration. The administration is expecting Bisignano to 'be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks.' Until then, Social Security will be led by 'a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner,' according to Fields' X post. 74 lawsuits filed against Trump to stop his executive actions 'President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long,' Fields said. Bisignano is currently the president and CEO of Fiserv, a global financial technology company. What is on the horizon for Social Security? Trump said that he wants to 'weed out' undocumented individuals whom he claimed were using the Social Security program. 'We have illegal immigrants on Social Security and we’re going to find out who they are and take them off… we’re not going to stand for that.' Who will never receive Social Security? However, O'Malley said that illegal immigrants pay about $22 billion per year into Social Security and never get to use the benefits of the program. Trump also said he won't 'cut one cent' from the program or raise the retirement age. But some think that this could be what breaks the Social Security program. 'This program that so many people depend on as a lifeline could very well be broken by these nitwit 19-year-olds and the co-presidents,' O'Malley told NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-social-security-head-data-steps-down/	2025-02-18T09:54:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24354582238749-e1736086679342.jpg?w=800
Judge refuses to block DOGE’s access to student borrower data	(The Hill) - A federal judge Monday evening declined to block Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from gaining access to Education Department data on student borrowers. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the University of California Student Association (USCA), which brought the lawsuit, had not shown sufficient irreparable harm to receive such immediate relief. 'Because the Court concludes that UCSA has failed to clear that essential hurdle, the Court’s analysis also ends there,' wrote Moss, who was appointed by former President Obama. DOGE creates X accounts to crowdsource info on government ‘waste’ 'The Court leaves for another day consideration of whether USCA’s has standing to sue and has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. Those questions are less clear cut and are better answered on a more complete record,' Moss continued. Musk’s DOGE has moved rapidly since President Trump’s inauguration to install employees at federal agencies with an aim of cutting trillions of dollars in government spending, quickly drawing legal challenges. The student government raised alarm that Musk’s team would be able to access students’ personal data, including tax information, submitted to the Education Department as part of federal financial aid applications. The lawsuit claims the access violated federal privacy laws. 'ED and DOGE staffers are obligated to use UCSA members’ information for lawful purposes within the mission of the Department of Education and to keep it confidential, in accordance with the Privacy Act, tax laws, and other federal law,' Moss noted in his ruling. The Hill has reached out to Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy group that represents the plaintiffs, for comment. Moss’s decision comes days after another judge declined to immediately block DOGE from accessing systems at the Labor Department, Department of Health and Human Services and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But under yet another judge’s ruling, DOGE personnel are blocked from accessing critical Treasury Department payment systems that are used to dole out trillions of dollars per year. Congress closing in on shutdown deadline with no clear plan A judge is also set to rule soon on whether to block DOGE from accessing systems at seven federal agencies. In that case, Joshua Fisher, the director of the White House administration office, submitted a sworn declaration earlier Monday that Musk is a senior adviser to the president. 'He is not an employee of the U.S. DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization. Mr. Musk is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,' Fisher wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-student-borrower-data/	2025-02-18T08:28:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/department_of_education_021725gn02_w-e1739876500197.jpg?w=900
Alleged 'death cult' leader arrested: Police	(NewsNation) — The person believed to be the leader of a cultlike group called the 'Zizians' has been arrested and faces multiple criminal charges along with another member of the group, police have announced. Jack LaSota, 34, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 33, of Pennsylvania, the Maryland State Police announced Monday. The pair face charges of trespassing, obstructing and hindering along with possession of a handgun. LaSota is said to be the leader of the Zizians, who authorities say are connected to the shooting death of David Maland, a Border Patrol agent who was killed in a shootout near the Canadian border in January. The Zizians have also been connected to five other homicides in California, Vermont and Pennsylvania. Immigrants could be in US a decade before their case is resolved, lawyers say Tracy Walder, a NewsNation national security contributor, told NewsNation the group is not necessarily a cult but rather a domestic terrorism group. Walder, a former CIA agent, said the group shares political ideology that springs from rationalism but radicalized that and became anarchists. Federal investigators are looking into whether Maland's killing is part of a series of deaths linked to the Zizians, a fringe online community. In addition to Maland’s death in Vermont, police are investigating whether the cult is behind a California landlord being stabbed with a Samurai sword and other crimes. Authorities described the Zizians as a 'death cult.' The group is reportedly made up of students who studied artificial intelligence and computer science. The Zizians are named for LaSota, a computer engineer, who goes by the nickname 'Ziz.' Teresa Youngblut, 21, was charged in Maland’s death on Jan. 20 in Coventry, Vermont, which is about 20 miles from the Canadian border. Police said the gun used in Maland’s death has been linked to a 2022 double homicide in Pennsylvania. 36 migrants found in tractor-trailer at remote Border Patrol checkpoint The Associated Press reported that LaSota uses she/her pronouns and says in her writings that she is a transgender woman. LaSota reportedly railed against perceived enemies in writings, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Police believe that LaSota faked their death in 2022 and is now wanted in two states, according to the media site Open Vallejo. The site reported LaSota was detained by police after a stabbing death in Northern California. LaSota’s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants were issued. LaSota was ordered held without bail after appearing in court on Tuesday.

Education Department warns schools to cut DEI or lose funding	(NewsNation) — Schools from kindergarten to college across the U.S. are beginning to adjust their programming websites in response to President Donald Trump's policies against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Trump signed executive orders banning diversity practices across the federal government and educational institutions, with many private companies also reversing their DEI-related programs. Schools scramble to meet DEI change orders Following a Friday night letter from the Department of Education, schools and colleges are now under pressure to eliminate DEI programs or risk losing federal funding. The department's civil rights division stated it would no longer tolerate the 'overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this nation's institutions.' 74 lawsuits filed against Trump to stop his executive actions The letter cited white and Asian students as victims of discrimination, though some leaders in higher education have argued this is not the intent of DEI programs. 'This is a serious misunderstanding of DEI. Many people presume it to be about giving unearned, unfair advantages to particular groups. For the record, white women have been the single largest beneficiary of the nation's longest-standing DEI policy, and that was affirmative action,' said Shaun Harper, a University of Southern California professor. State-level DEI legislation Twelve states have already passed laws to end DEI efforts, while another 12 are considering similar measures. Other states without laws on the books are working to comply with the new policy. The University of St. Thomas in Minnesota lost a $6.8 million federal grant after the Trump administration deemed it was DEI-related. Rob Vischer, a professor at the university, said the grant, which provided scholarships for graduate students pursuing a teaching license, was predominantly awarded to white students. 'It was not a DEI initiative in terms of anyone getting a preference. The components that were going to further diversity were really making sure that our students were prepared to be effective teachers no matter what cultural background their students came from,' he said. Judge firings 'insane' as immigration backlog grows Vischer said the university is exploring options to reinstate the funding, as many believe the policy change undermines educational priorities due to a teacher shortage. Impact on funding While universities rely partly on student tuition, they also receive billions from the Education Department for scholarships, research and loans. In K-12 education, public schools rely on state and local tax funding, with the federal government providing about 11%. Title 1 schools, which serve low-income families, stand to lose the most if DEI initiatives are discontinued. After Trump's executive order, higher education groups filed a lawsuit arguing the directive violates the Constitution, suggesting the push to eliminate DEI efforts will likely face further legal challenges.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/education-department-schools-cut-dei-lose-funding/	2025-02-18T07:57:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b4168c10dac6.83474389.jpeg?w=900
Ukraine not included in peace talks as Rubio meets with Russian o...	(NewsNation) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine and normalizing relations with the United States. After the meeting, Rubio said Russia and the United States agreed to appoint 'high-level' teams dedicated to stopping the conflict, and that they will lay the groundwork for future cooperation. 'Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one,' Rubio said at a press gaggle. '(United States President Donald Trump) wants (the war) to end in a way that's fair, he wants it to end in a way that's sustainable and enduring, not that leads to another conflict in another three years.' US presented Ukraine with a document to access its minerals but offered almost nothing in return Ukrainian officials did not participate in the discussion in Riyadh, which included Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country will not recognize any agreements made without its input. 'We cannot acknowledge anything, any arrangements about us that were made without us,' Zelenskyy said. Rubio acknowledged that 'in order for a conflict to end, everyone involved in that conflict has to be OK with it.' He added, though, that it's been 'three and half years since any sort of regularized contact between Russia and the United States — and in some cases between any of the participants in this conflict and Russia.' Which federal agencies are firing new hires? While Putin had previously refused to negotiate with Zelenskyy, the Russian president's press secretary says he is now willing to. Trump insists Putin wants peace — but hours before officials from Washington and Moscow met, Russia launched a drone attack on Ukraine. Zelenskyy said Trump's Ukraine envoy is set to visit the country next week and that he wants to take him to the front lines.

Upside down and burning': All passengers escape Delta plane cras...	(NewsNation) — All 80 passengers and crew members on board a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to Toronto that crashed and overturned while landing are expected to survive. Air traffic control audio was released Monday, capturing the moment officials realized Delta Flight 4819, operated by Endeavor Air, was burning on the tarmac of Toronto's Pearson Airport. 'This airplane just crashed. We just have a crash on Runway 23 here,' someone can be heard saying at around 2:15 p.m. ET. Now is an ‘opportune’ time to fix FAA: Former official Billy Nolen 'Just so you are aware, there's people outside walking around the aircraft there,' someone says moments later. 'Yeah, we've got it,' someone responds. 'The aircraft there's upside down and burning.' The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is assisting Canada’s Transportation Safety Board to investigate how the CRJ-900 overturned as it arrived from Minneapolis and touched down in Toronto. Two runways will remain closed for the investigation. It is possible the plane bounced, causing pilots to lose control, said Greg Feith, former senior air safety investigator for the NTSB. 'I'm upside down still strapped in': Delta passenger Peter Carlson, a passenger traveling to Toronto for a paramedics conference, said the landing was 'very forceful.' 'All the sudden everything just kind of went sideways, and then next thing I know it’s kind of a blink and I’m upside down still strapped in,' he told CBC News. 'Everyone on that plane suddenly became very close in terms of how to help one another, how to console one another.' SpaceX employees visiting FAA amid reported firings Carlson said when he took off his seat belt, he crashed onto the ceiling of the plane. He smelled gas and saw aviation fuel cascading down the cabin windows and knew he needed to get out, but he said his fatherly intuition and paramedic skills kicked in. He looked for those he could help. Carlson and another man assisted a mother and her young son out of the plane, and then Carlson dropped onto the tarmac. Snow was blowing, and it 'felt like I was stepping onto tundra.' 'I didn’t care how cold it was, didn’t care how far I had to walk, how long I had to stand — all of us just wanted to be out of the aircraft,' he said. How many people were injured in the crash? The airport said all passengers and crew members were accounted for. Eighteen people were injured in the crash, and three are in critical condition, according to Deborah Flint, Greater Toronto Airports Authority president and CEO. Two people were taken by separate air ambulances to a trauma center in Toronto: a man in his 60s and a woman in her 40s. A pediatric patient was taken to a children’s hospital. Other injured passengers were transported to local area hospitals. Delta plane flipping not a pattern of plane crashes: Travel expert There were no fatalities. The fact that all 80 people aboard the plane survived is amazing, retired commercial pilots Michael Coffield and Richard Levy agreed. Both nodded their heads vigorously and said, 'Miracle.' What was the weather at the time of the crash? At the time of the crash, weather reports showed Toronto experienced 31-mph winds with gusts upward of 40 mph and a temperature of 18 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -5. On Monday, the airport said on social media it expected around 1,000 flights to be delayed as airlines worked to catch up from delays caused by snow over the weekend. Toronto Pearson Fire Chief Todd Aitken confirmed the runway was dry and there were no crosswind conditions.

Gabby Petito's van was destroyed by her parents	(NewsNation) — The parents of Gabby Petito say they destroyed their daughter’s white van to prevent someone from turning it into a ghoulish trophy, but they have retained at least a couple of mementos. Gabby’s Ford Transit Connect was a regular feature in the travel reports she posted online before she disappeared in 2021. Authorities believe she was murdered by her travel companion, Brian Laundrie, in Wyoming before he took his own life in Florida. Gabby’s family felt uneasy about the vehicle, which they did not wish to keep. Gabby Petito Netflix documentary premieres in February 'We crushed the van,' Gabby’s father, Joe, told NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin. 'We didn’t want the van to be out there and someone owning the van and then saying, ‘Here’s the van that Gabby was …’ So, we had it crushed.' Joe Petito, left, and his wife, Tara Petito, talk with NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin. Joe and Gabby’s stepmother, Tara Petito, kept some items from the vehicle, including a gasoline cap from the van’s exterior and a sticker commemorating a stop at the Great Smoky Mountains. The mementos are displayed at home in a curio case. Entin was checking in with the family as a Netflix docuseries about Gabby began streaming. The program includes new information about the case, including claims by a former boyfriend that the 22-year-old New York woman was planning to leave Laundrie shortly before her death. Entin also talked with Gabby’s mother, Nichole Schmidt, and her husband, Jim Schmidt.

Toronto plane crash outcome a ‘miracle’: experts	(NewsNation) — Several things went right when a passenger jet landing at a wintry Toronto airport lost its wings and flipped over with no loss of life, according to aviation experts reviewing preliminary information. Investigators will try to sort out what happened to the Delta Airlines CRJ-900 as it arrived from Minneapolis and touched down at Toronto Pearson International Airport at 2:15 p.m. It’s possible the plane bounced and pilots lost control, said Greg Feith, former senior air safety investigator for the NTSB. 'The good thing is ... both the wings were shed,' he said. 'That usually takes up a lot of the major impact forces. And because the tube, the fuselage tube, stayed intact, that’s what enhanced the survivability for all these people, even though there was a small fire that did break out.' What we know about CRJ-900, aircraft that flipped over in Toronto The integrity of the fuselage is a testament to advances in airplane engineering, Feith added. 'We’ve learned a lot of lessons from history,' he said. Also probably helping the outcome was that jet fuel was dispersed when the wings detached, Feith said. He praised passengers and the flight crew for the orderly evacuation of the upside-down aircraft. The fact that all 80 people aboard the plane survived is amazing, retired commercial pilots Michael Coffield and Richard Levy agreed. Both nodded their heads vigorously and said, 'Miracle.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/vargasreports/toronto-plane-crash-miracle/	2025-02-17T19:02:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/plane.jpg?w=900
Now is an 'opportune' time to fix FAA: Former official Billy Nole...	(NewsNation) — Former Federal Aviation Administration official Billy Nolen said that while there's plenty unknown about Monday's crash in Toronto, 'this is something that pilots do indeed train for.' Nolen served as acting administrator of the FAA from April 2022 to June 2023. He joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' just hours after Delta Flight 4819, operated by Endeavor Air, crashed and flipped on the tarmac at Toronto Pearson Airport. All 76 passengers and four crew members were evacuated, with 18 reported injured as of Monday night. Live: Delta flight flips over in Toronto, injuring 18 people Nolen didn't speculate on what he believes happened, but he told NewsNation political editor Chris Stirewalt that weather could have played a role in the incident. 'You know, they'll think about what's the crosswind here? Were they beyond the limits?' Nolen said. 'And that's just information we don't have.' At the time of the crash, weather reports showed Toronto experiencing 31 mph hour winds with gusts upwards of 40 mph and a temperature of 18 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of minus 5 F. What we know about CRJ-900, aircraft that flipped over in Toronto Trump orders firing of new FAA employees President Donald Trump has ordered the firing of probationary federal employees, including at the FAA, following a string of aviation crashes. An anonymous source from the agency told The Associated Press that impacted workers include radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance workers. 'My understanding for the folks who were let go in this round [is] that these were not folks who are the critical pieces of air traffic control,' Nolen told NewsNation. He implored the administration to keep in mind the 'unintended consequences' of the firings, though he supports the overhaul of the FAA if it helps in the long run. 'I've testified, both before the House and before the Senate, that the FAA oversees systems of systems and facilities that are between 40 and 60 years old,' Nolen explained. 'So, I think it's an opportune time for Elon, for others, to come in.' FAA firings begin weeks after deadly crash near DC An American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided in midair in Washington, D.C., killing all 67 people on board; a military plane crashed into the San Diego Bay; a plane crashed in Alaska and a medical jet crashed in Philadelphia all in the first few weeks of 2025. Nolen believes this spate of accidents is just that, pointing to the tens of thousands of successful, safe flights that aren't reported on every day. 'That being said, we can never rest on our record, and we certainly can never rest on our laurels when it comes to keeping the flying public safe,' Nolen added.

What we know about CRJ-900, aircraft that flipped over in Toronto	(NewsNation) — More than seven dozen people were evacuated Monday after a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Toronto crashed and flipped over while landing. Flight 4819, operated by Endeavor Air, was involved in a 'single-aircraft accident' around 3:30 p.m. ET, Toronto Pearson Airport confirmed on X. At the time of the crash, weather reports show Toronto experiencing 31 mph hour winds with gusts upwards of 40 mph and a temperature of 18 Fahrenheit with a wind chill of minus 5 F. But what do we know about the Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-900 involved? Toronto accident: CRJ-900 specs The aircraft has a length of 36 meters (roughly 119 feet) with a wingspan of 24.9 meters (81 feet). The craft has a range of 1,784 miles and a cruising speed of 515 mph, according to Delta's official website for the aircraft. Delta flight flips over in Toronto How is the aircraft laid out? The CRJ-900 can seat either 70 or 76 people, but the layout and basic dimensions of the craft are nearly identical, no matter the capacity. There were 76 passengers on board Monday. The craft has restrooms at the very front and back of the plane. In first class, one side of the aisle seats one person, and the other has two — totaling 12. The remaining passengers in Delta+ Comfort and main cabin seats are in pairs of two on either side of the aisle. The 70-seater has four exits in total, while the 76-seater has six.

The CRJ-900 launched in 2001, but its design roots can be found in the Canadair Challenger business jet, the first iteration of which took to the skies in the 1970s, according to Simple Flying. After Bombardier bought Canadair in 1987, the company decided to revamp earlier designs and create the Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ-100) in 1991. Several more iterations of the craft came about over the decades. The CRJ-900 is newer — and bigger — than the CRJ-200, CRJ-550 or CRJ-700. It's equipped with a powerful engine and strengthened wings, Who makes the CRJ-900? Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft company, manufactures the aircraft. Delta plane flipping not a pattern of plane crashes: Travel expert Delta Air Lines' regional subsidiary Endeavor Air is the largest operator of CRJ-900s, per Simple Flying.

(NewsNation) — A travel journalist says the Delta Airlines plane flipping in Canada on Monday is not a pattern of plane crashes following a string of crashes and accidents involving planes in the first month and a half of 2025. Peter Greenberg told 'NewsNation Now' that this was 'an isolated incident' and 'nobody should jump to any conclusion that we have a bigger problem with air safety.' The Delta Airlines plane flipped upon arrival at Toronto’s Pearson Airport and paramedics said 15 people were injured in the crash and none of the injuries were life-threatening. FAA firings begin weeks after deadly crash near DC Other airline crashes in 2025 Two weeks ago, an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided in midair in Washington, D.C., killing all 67 people on board; a military plane crashed into San Diego Bay; a plane crashed in Alaska and a medical jet crashed in Philadelphia all in the first few weeks of 2025. There were also multiple smaller incidents, including runway collisions in the U.S. and abroad. Greenberg said the bigger issue is a 'chronic problem of staffing at the Federal Aviation Authority.'

Energy secretary blasts 'sinister' zero carbon emissions goal	Energy Secretary Chris Wright denounced efforts to achieve net zero carbon emissions by midcentury as a 'sinister goal' in remarks at a conservative policy conference Monday. 'Net zero 2050 is a sinister goal, it’s a terrible goal,' Wright said to applause at the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship forum in London, where he spoke through a video link. 'It’s both unachievable by any practical means [and] the aggressive pursuit of it — and you’re sitting in a country that has aggressively pursued this goal — has not delivered any benefits, but it’s delivered tremendous costs.' Top Democrats question IRS on DOGE access to taxpayer data Wright, a former fracking executive, claimed that countries that set net zero goals simply 'export your industry.' 'This is not energy transition, this is lunacy,' he said, echoing remarks he made in 2023 that 'there is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either.' The Biden administration set a goal of net zero by 2050 in 2021, but Wright and Trump have worked to roll back much of their predecessors’ promotion of renewable energy to shift back to promotion of fossil fuel development since taking office. Carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of climate change. Trump suggests no laws violated if he ‘saves’ country Wright’s fellow Trump Cabinet secretary, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, also set a goal of net zero for his state by 2030 when he served as governor of North Dakota. Burgum, whose state is the No. 3 oil producer in the nation, vocally backed the notion that net zero was achievable without decreasing fossil fuel production through the use of largely untested carbon capture technology. Wright’s remarks came days after he granted the first approval of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project of the Trump administration, another reversal after the Biden administration froze new LNG export approvals to research its impacts on climate change and consumer energy prices.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/energy-secretary-zero-carbon-emissions/	2025-02-17T13:44:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/chris-wright-energy-dept-pick_franzin_getty.jpg?w=900
FAA firings begin weeks after deadly crash near DC	(The Hill) -- The Trump administration has begun firing hundreds of employees at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) just weeks after a deadly crash outside of Washington, D.C., put a spotlight on the agency. In a late-night email Friday, probationary workers were notified that they had been fired, David Spero, the president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. Delta flight flips over in Toronto One air traffic controller told the outlet that impacted workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance. The firings come just weeks after an American Airlines flight collided mid-air with a military Black Hawk helicopter shortly before landing at Reagan National Airport. More than 60 people were killed in the crash and the FAA faced tough scrutiny in the fallout, as it was the deadliest air crash in the U.S. in two decades. Coast Guard seizes 37K lbs. of cocaine worth $275M The firings also come just weeks after the Trump administration took office and promised to revamp the federal workforce. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has agreed to work with Elon Musk’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) and the Trump administration to scale back federal spending, but he’s also expressed the need for the FAA to fix its 'antiquated' systems and hire more air traffic controllers. The firings began arriving in employees’ inboxes around 7 p.m. Friday, and Spero said more could be notified over the weekend. Some people could even be banned from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday after the long President’s Day weekend.

'How many FAA personnel were fired? What positions? And why?' In the aftermath of the deadly crash, officials have raised concerns about the staffing shortages at the FAA. Duffy said Sunday that he plans to visit the FAA Academy later this week to examine the education and training of air traffic controllers.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/faa-firings-dc-plane-crash/	2025-02-17T12:38:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP080630041525-e1734008075432.jpg?w=900

74 lawsuits filed against Trump to stop his executive actions	(NewsNation) — In nearly one month since President Donald Trump's return to the White House, at least 74 lawsuits have been filed in federal courts against his administration's wave of executive actions. As of Monday, judges have temporarily paused 18 of these measures. Trump’s only victory so far was the approval of his deferred resignation buyout for government employees, a move to reduce the federal workforce. On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. Additionally, a federal judge Friday denied immediate reinstatement for eight former inspectors general fired by Trump, though the case will continue on a less urgent timeline. White House seeks to rehire nuclear weapons workers fired by DOGE Of the lawsuits, 33 are Department of Government Efficiency-related and deal with government structure and personnel, with 19 focused on immigration and citizenship. Attorneys general from 14 states filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE's ability to access sensitive government data and exercise 'virtually unchecked power.' Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford argues the government can become more efficient lawfully and with compassion. Trump's 1987 bestselling book parallels presidential strategy One case, Hampton Dellinger's, is already headed to the U.S. Supreme Court, with the government petitioning to vacate the district court's decision to temporarily reinstate him to lead the Office of Special Counsel. Dellinger was nominated for the role by former President Joe Biden. Trump fired him earlier this month. By signing 26 executive orders during his first day in office alone, Trump put himself on pace to rank among the fastest-acting presidents during his first 100 days in office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/lawsuits-trump-executive-actions/	2025-02-17T11:32:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25044679717736-e1739578095359.jpg?w=800
Bird flu likely spreading undetected in humans	(NewsNation) — Bird flu may be spreading undetected in humans, according to a recently released report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Data posted last week in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report suggests the spread of bird flu between dairy cattle and humans has gone unchecked, including in states where cattle have not tested positive. This comes after the Trump Administration froze external communications from the agency, which interrupted the agency's weekly report. Ohio reports first probable human case of bird flu Researchers analyzed blood samples from 150 veterinarians who worked with dairy and nondairy cattle across the country and found that three of them had antibodies to bird flu, which suggested a recent infection. None of them reported any flu-like symptoms and did not work with any cattle that were infected, and one reported working with infected poultry. Bird flu: Human-to-human transmission? There have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission so far, but there is concern about variants developing if infections in humans spread. ‘Mad honey’ poisoning blamed in Michigan family’s 2022 disappearance Nearly 70 people have been infected with bird flu across the country, with one person in Louisiana dead.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/bird-flu-likely-spreading-undetected/	2025-02-17T08:57:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25044543772294_7e848d.jpg?w=900
White House seeks to rehire nuclear weapons workers fired by DOGE	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The White House is reportedly working to reinstate hundreds of workers tasked with overseeing the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. Last week, more than 300 staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration were fired as part of wider layoffs at the Department of Energy. However, the cuts may have overlooked critical roles, leading to the reveal of some terminations. While the Energy Department insists there's no need for concern, lawmakers are demanding answers. Lawmakers want answers on NNSA layoffs Washington Sen. Patty Murray and Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur, both Democrats, are calling for an immediate briefing from new Energy Secretary Chris Wright. They warn that until they are briefed on these 'haphazard and thoughtless firings,' they 'will not know the damage to our country and the world.' Here are the agencies purging federal workers The NNSA, responsible for protecting and managing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, reportedly planned to cut 325 to 350 employees Thursday. But by Friday, managers received an email telling them to stop all actions with terminations. The Energy Department now claims less than 50 layoffs occurred, affecting staff in administrative or clerical roles in their probationary period. The department insists these job cuts will not impact the security of the weapons. FEMA staff laid off ahead of Kentucky floods Meanwhile, other federal agencies have announced mass layoffs, including 20 immigration judges the Justice Department fired over the weekend. The firings occurred despite the massive backlog of more than 3.5 million cases, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Department of Health and Human Services cut 5,200 jobs, impacting agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. The Department of Homeland Security let go 400 workers, including FEMA staff, just days before devastating flooding hit Kentucky. The Department of Interior laid off 2,300 workers, while 1,000 positions were eliminated at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Federal job cuts hurt Americans: Rep. Raskin Democrats accuse the White House of trying to hurt Americans. 'They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends,' Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin. Some of those affected include Chelsea Milburn, a Navy veteran, who became disabled and moved to the public affairs office at the Department of Education in November. She told NewsNation the U.S. claims to support veterans but that about 30% of federal workers are veterans, many of whom were laid off this week. 'I think that all of us who were impacted by this deserve to be treated better. I especially think that people who serve their country deserve better,' Milburn said. 'Considering that about 30% of the federal workforce are veterans. This has a huge impact on the veteran community.' US leaders in Saudi Arabia for Russia-Ukraine peace talks Republicans argue the country's debt is becoming a national security risk and these decisions are necessary. More job cuts are expected as the Department of Government Efficiency continues to analyze where to downsize next. 'We hate that anybody's losing their job, but at the same time, we know that the debt that we have in this country is not manageable, and it's becoming a national security risk,' said Republican Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-rehire-nuclear-weapons-workers-doge/	2025-02-17T06:51:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abd7fbe34323.91974328.jpeg?w=900
What Trump's 1987 book 'The Art of the Deal' shows about his stra...	(NewsNation) — It is no secret that in addition to being the leader of the free world, President Donald Trump is also a businessman, TV personality and real estate mogul. But one accolade some may forget is bestselling author. There are more than a dozen books in which Trump is listed as an author or co-author, but looking back at the very first one, 'Trump: The Art of the Deal,' may give a glimpse into how his leadership style in the boardroom shaped his leadership style in the Oval Office. Thinking big and being no-nonsense are some things Trump cited as reasons for the success of his 1987 New York Times bestseller. 'Trump: The Art of the Deal' is a mix of personal anecdotes and business how-to, and in many cases, there's a parallel between what he wrote nearly 40 years ago and his presidency. Democratic governors diverge on how to handle Trump Chapter 2 starts: 'My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I'm after.' Compare that to what he said about the conflict in the Middle East just weeks before taking office: 'If those hostages aren't back, I don't want to hurt your negotiation. If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out,' Trump said at a Jan. 7 news conference. When it comes to beating competition for a business venture, Trump wrote in his book, 'Sometimes part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.' On the campaign trail in September last year, the president notoriously said of Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, 'She's a stupid person, stupid person.' Trump says 14th Amendment is for former slaves, not migrants Some are drawing a comparison between Trump's handling of the southern border, the war in Ukraine and the economy to what he wrote about making deals and his early days in business. 'In the end, we won by wearing everyone else down,' he wrote. 'We never gave up, and the opposition slowly began to melt away.' Failing to reach a deal may have given Trump insight into what to do when losing an election. 'Sometimes by losing a battle, you find a new way to win the war. What you need, generally, is enough time and a little luck,' Trump wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-book-art-of-the-deal-strategy/	2025-02-17T06:20:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b003b5d81ed3.80637785.jpeg?w=900
US leaders in Saudi Arabia for peace talks on Russia-Ukraine war	(NewsNation) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday for peace talks aimed at ending the nearly three-year-long war in Ukraine. The talks come as European nations consider stepping up to defend Ukraine. While the U.S. has stated Ukraine will be included in the discussions this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country had not been invited to the table, raising concerns about the effectiveness of an agreement without Ukraine's direct involvement. A drone pierced the outer shell of Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear plant. Radiation levels are normal Is Ukraine involved in peace talks? Rubio, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and special envoy Steve Witkoff are set to meet with Russian officials in Riyadh on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Monday. It is unclear whether any Ukrainian representatives will participate in the talks. Witkoff, however, insists Ukraine has been included in discussions, citing a recent meeting in Munich and a call with President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy emphasized any deal made without Ukraine's input is unacceptable. US presented Ukraine with a document to access its minerals but offered almost nothing in return 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. And our people, never. And our adults, children and everybody, it can't be so. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses,' Zelsenkyy said. Trump to meet with Putin 'soon' Witkoff spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin for hours, and Trump teased a future meeting with Putin. 'Well, it'll be soon. We'll see what happens. But they're meeting right now. And that's more. I mean, this should have been done four years ago, three years ago, before it started. But it should have been done immediately after it started, as opposed to now, three years later,' Trump told reporters on Sunday. During an NBC interview Sunday, Zelenskkyy compared the need to defend Ukraine to that of helping Israel against Iran, saying Ukraine needs similar security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he's 'ready and willing' to deploy troops in Ukraine to enforce a peace deal.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/saudi-arabia-peace-talks-russia-ukraine/	2025-02-17T05:04:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25047026097412_e29b34.jpg?w=900
Pope to remain hospitalized as doctors treat a complex respirator...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis’ respiratory tract infection is presenting a 'complex clinical picture' that will require further hospitalization, the Vatican said Monday as concerns grew about the increasingly frail health of the 88-year-old pontiff. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the results of tests conducted in recent days and Monday indicate the pope is suffering from a 'polymicrobial respiratory tract infection' that has necessitated a further change in his drug therapy. Scientists say polymicrobial diseases are caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. There was no timeframe given for his hospitalization, which has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. Bruni said the complexity of his symptoms 'will require an appropriate hospital stay.' Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a 'fair' condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors confirmed a respiratory tract infection and prescribed 'absolute rest' alongside unspecified drug therapies. Subsequent updates said his slight fever had gone away and that he was in 'stable' condition. Bruni said Francis, ate breakfast and read the newspapers Monday morning after a third peaceful night. The Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man, is a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his increasingly precarious health. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane because of bad knees and suffers from sciatica nerve pain. In 2021 he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed because of a narrowing, and then had a further surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia. When he had a bad case of pneumonia in 2023, he left the hospital after three days and only acknowledged after the fact that he had been admitted urgently after feeling faint and having a sharp pain in his chest. This time around, Francis insisted on finishing his morning audiences Friday before leaving the Vatican, even though he was having trouble speaking at length because he was short of breath. Francis' continued hospitalization has already forced the cancellation of some events connected to the Vatican's Holy Year and put others in question. The Holy See has only confirmed canceled appointments through Monday. Francis was supposed to have gone to Rome’s Cinecitta film studios to meet with artists as part of the Catholic Church’s Holy Year celebrations. The pope's next scheduled appointment is his weekly general audience Wednesday.

USAID mission is worthy, but agency needs reform: Whistleblower	(NewsNation) — An employee laid off from USAID last week defends the mission of the embattled agency but says it has become a bureaucracy riddled with inefficiencies. Rob Cohen, a physician and U.S. Army veteran, said he agrees Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency can find waste within the United States Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration has targeted for steep cuts. Ex-administrators of USAID defend agency targeted by Trump 'Reform is needed, and Elon Musk and his team are not totally wrong about that,' Cohen told 'NewsNation Prime' on Saturday. 'But in the process, they’re throwing the baby out with the bath water, firing lots of good employees — I would add, such as myself.' Cohen worked at USAID from 2016 as a contractor and civil servant. He said he stands behind the agency’s humanitarian work, including its successful effort to ensure millions of HIV-positive mothers gave birth to healthy babies through drug therapy. But the agency is encumbered by regulations that can lead to delays in assistance, he said. 'A lot of the dollars were targeted at a good place. It was the delay. It was the inefficiency. A lot of time the procurements would take longer than a year.' Musk calls USAID a ‘criminal organization’ that should ‘die’ Cohen said he was elevated to become USAID's deputy chief of staff but faced pushback after identifying problems.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/usaid-reform-whistleblower/	2025-02-16T18:15:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038664521392-e1739447564581.jpg?w=900
8 dead in torrential Kentucky storm, Gov. Beshear confirms	FRANKFORT, Ky. (FOX 56) — On Sunday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear addressed the state after a day and night of heavy rainfall that caused deadly flooding from the east end of the Bluegrass to the west. The floods, along with crashes due to weather-related hazards on Saturday, took the lives of at least eight people, Beshear said during the press conference. East braces for flooding while fire-damaged California city faces mudslides 'The fatalities include motor vehicle-related deaths of men in Hart and Nelson counties; and floodwater-related deaths of a man in Clay County, a woman and a child in Hart County, two men in Pike County and a woman in Washington County,' Beshear said in a news release on Sunday. Since Saturday morning, emergency crews have reportedly carried out 1,000 rescues across Kentucky. Cars sit in floodwaters at a railroad underpass in Louisville, Ky., Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025.

Trump says 14th Amendment is for former slaves, not migrants	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that the Founding Fathers 'are spinning in their graves' after his bid to abolish birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally hit another snag. On Thursday, a fourth federal judge blocked the executive order issued by the president on his first day in the Oval Office. Trump argued he is abiding by the 14th Amendment, which his opposers argue he is violating the essence of it. 'The 14th Amendment Right of American Citizenship never had anything to do with modern day 'gate crashers,' illegal immigrants who break the Law by being in our Country, it had everything to do with giving Citizenship to former slaves,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Sarah Palin ‘would love to’ join Trump administration 'Our Founding Fathers are 'spinning in their graves' at the idea that our Country can be taken away from us. No Nation in the World has anything like this. Our lawyers and Judges have to be tough, and protect America! The 14th Amendment states: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' The Trump administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-14th-amendment-slaves-not-migrants/	2025-02-16T11:04:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25044679717736-e1739578095359.jpg?w=800
8 people die in Kentucky storm that flooded roads, governor says	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — At least eight people have died in Kentucky as creeks swelled from heavy storms and water covered roads, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday. Hundreds of people stranded by flooding had to be rescued. Beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. 'So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,' he said. 'This is the search and rescue phase, and I am very proud of all the Kentuckians that are out there responding, putting their lives on the line.' Beshear said the storms have knocked out power to about 39,000 homes, but he warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase outages. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Much of the U.S. faced another round of biting winter weather Sunday, with torrential rains causing intense flooding in Kentucky and resulting in at least four deaths in the Southeast. The Northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. A mother and her 7-year-old child were killed in Kentucky when the car they were in was swept away by flood waters in Hart County near Interstate 65, a county official told WBKO-TV. Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said the two were swept away Saturday night in the Bonnieville community. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that President Trump had approved his request for disaster relief funding. Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain during the weekend storms, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. 'The effects will continue for awhile, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,' Oravec said Sunday. 'Any time there’s flooding, the flooding can last a lot longer than the rain lasts.' Severe storms also swept through parts of Florida and Georgia, where tornado watches were in effect early Sunday, the National Weather Service said. In Atlanta, a person was killed when an 'extremely large tree' fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell. He told reporters that firefighters were dispatched just before 5 a.m. after a 911 call. Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains with low temperatures into the minus 30s F near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius) to minus 50 F (minus 45.6 C) are expected. Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach 60 mph (about 97 kph) and create 'hazardous whiteout conditions,' the NWS said. Kentucky faces severe flooding Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia late Saturday into Sunday. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. Chilly temperatures replaced the heavy rains with snow early Sunday morning in parts of Kentucky. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky ahead of the storms, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. 'Widespread flooding is continuing,' Beshear said in a social media post Sunday morning. He said evacuations of people in flooded areas were continuing on Sunday. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said closed its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 14 feet (4.3 meters) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service said. Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. New England faces snow, then sleet Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet. Oravec said Sunday that snowfall in the region was relatively light, due to the freezing rain and sleet mix. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains on Saturday, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 4 inches (10.6 centimeters) of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as 14 degrees (minus 10 degrees Celsius) over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. __ Sophia Tareen contributed to this report from Chicago.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-eastern-u-s-braces-for-flooding-while-snow-will-hit-northeast-cold-temperatures-across-plains/	2025-02-16T10:17:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b22cb3223de1.34900508.jpeg?w=900
Vance scolds Europe over censorship, criticizes ‘mass migration’	Vice President Vance on Friday used his first major speech on the international stage to accuse European leaders of stifling opposing viewpoints and of retreating from 'fundamental values.' Vance delivered remarks at the Munich Security Conference, where he argued the biggest threats facing Europe were not China or Russia, but the issue of mass migration and laws that restrict free speech. 'While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine … the threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,' Vance said. 'And what I worry about is the threat from within,' he continued. 'The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' Vance’s remarks did not delve into the conflict in Ukraine, where the Trump administration is pushing for a ceasefire negotiation, nor did he discuss at length President Trump’s desire for Europe to commit more to defense spending. Instead, Vance accused European officials of using laws meant to minimize misinformation and disinformation to marginalize populist voices and voters. 'To many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind Soviet-era words like ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way or, even worse, win an election,' Vance said. 'If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,' Vance added. 'Nor, for that matter, is there anything you can do for the American people who elected me and elected President Trump.' Vance attacked European Union 'commissars' for censoring 'hateful content.' He called out the United Kingdom for a 'backslide away from conscience rights.' And he more broadly shrugged off the idea that outsiders weighing in on elections amounts to election meddling. Vance took issue with Romania’s decision in December to wipe out the results from the first round of presidential elections after declassified security documents alleged Russian interference that promoted a far-right outsider candidate. He also defended the conduct of Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and Trump ally who has waded into European politics and appeared virtually at a rally for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. 'Speaking up and expressing opinions isn’t election interference. Even when people express views outside your own country and even when those people are very influential,' Vance said. 'And trust me I say this with all humor: If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg’s scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk.' Vance also described mass migration as the most urgent issue facing the continent. He pointed to an incident in Munich a day earlier when a migrant drove a car into a crowd as an example of the consequences of mass migration. 'No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants,' Vance said. 'More and more all over Europe, they’re voting for political leaders who promise to put an end to out of control migration. I happen to agree with a lot of these concerns. You don’t have to agree with me, I just think that people care.' Vance’s speech garnered a tepid reception in the room, but it was likely to be well received by Trump back in the United States. Trump campaigned on similar culture war issues, including restrictions on migration and on claims of censorship and free speech infringement in the United States. In a nod to the change in administration, Vance told European leaders there was a 'new sheriff in town.' 'Under Donald Trump’s leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight for your right to offer it in the public square, agree or disagree,' Vance said. The vice president’s remarks came as the Trump team has sparked controversy with its decision to bar The Associated Press from covering events at the White House, citing disagreements with the news outlets decision to continue referring to the body of water off the Southeastern coast as the Gulf of Mexico. Trump signed an order last month declaring the body of water would be called the Gulf of America.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/vance-scolds-europe-over-censorship-criticizes-mass-migration/	2025-02-16T04:38:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25045497888527-e1739541290914_55f23a.jpg?w=900
House GOP budget resolution in jeopardy amid concerns from modera...	The House GOP’s budget resolution could be in jeopardy of not clearing the full chamber amid concerns from moderates over likely cuts to social safety net programs — particularly Medicaid — with a handful undecided on whether they will support the key measure. Reps. David Valadao (R-Calif.) and Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) — both of whom represent districts with a significant percentage of Medicaid recipients — told The Hill that they are withholding support from the budget resolution as they seek more information on the severity of the cuts and how they could impact their constituents. And they are not alone. 'There’s at least double digits of people who are severely concerned,' Valadao said. 'And I think as people start to understand the specifics of how it’s going tos affect their districts, I imagine that number grows.' Those worries are sure to raise alarm bells for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his leadership team — including Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) — who are looking to push the resolution through the chamber and kick-start the process to pass President Trump’s domestic policy agenda as early as the week of Feb. 24, when the House returns. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote if all members are present and the entire Democratic caucus opposes the measure, which is expected. At the current moment, key lawmakers say the resolution could be doomed to fail. 'As of right now I think it’s in jeopardy of failing,' Valadao said. 'I don’t know that the resolution passes,' Malliotakis echoed. 'I think that there are enough of us who are concerned about the arbitrary number that was thrown out there for Medicaid, that the resolution may not pass the floor.' While the worries appear to be more pronounced among moderates, some conservatives have also raised concerns about the trajectory of the reconciliation process. One House Republican who is on the whip team told The Hill that two conservatives reported Friday that they were undecided on the measure. 'I know a bunch of people are whipping undecided because they want to let leadership know that if these cuts hurt people they aren't doing them,' the lawmaker said. That narrative jives with the sentiment described by Valadao, who said, 'I think there’s a lot of people in pretty conservative districts that this has a really negative impact on their districts and their states.' 'I think there’s a lot more people concerned than just moderates,' he added. The pessimistic outlook surrounding the budget resolution became apparent less than 24 hours after the House Budget Committee advanced the measure in a party-line, 21-16 vote, sending it to the full chamber for consideration. Republicans are looking to advance Trump’s legislative agenda using the budget reconciliation process, which would allow the party to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate. The first step in the reconciliation process is approving a budget resolution. The budget resolution unveiled by House Republicans this week outlines a $1.5 trillion floor for spending cuts across committees with a target of $2 trillion, a $4.5 trillion cap on the deficit impact of the Republicans’ plan to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, and $300 billion in additional spending for the border and defense. It also increases the debt limit by $4 trillion. On the spending cuts front, the measure sets an $880 billion floor for the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid. That figure — the largest of any panel — signaled that Republicans would likely go after Medicaid to reach the threshold, a plan that lawmakers are openly acknowledging. 'There’s only one place you can go, and that’s Medicaid. That’s where the money is,' Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-Idaho), who sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 'There's others, don’t get me wrong, but if you’re gonna get to $900 billion, something has to be reformed on the Medicaid front.' Malliotakis said she is worried about the committee potentially lowering the the portion of Medicaid the federal government covers for the traditional population, which could generate up to $387 billion, or capping Medicaid spending on a per capita basis, which could generate $900 billion in savings per year. She did, however, note that she would be on board with instituting work requirements for the program and removing non-U.S. citizens as beneficiaries. In 2023, 26.8 percent of Malliotakis’s constituents in New York’s 11th Congressional District had Medicaid coverage, according to Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. 'To make up $880 billion, I need more clarity on how they’re going to make up that entire number and how that could potentially affect beneficiaries before I move forward in this process,' the New York Republican said. 'And I’ve expressed that with the Speaker, with the whip, and we’ll see if we get more answers.' Additionally, Malliotakis raised concerns about the $4.5 trillion cap on deficit increases that the Ways and Means Committee will have to abide by to enact Trump’s tax agenda. Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), the chair of the panel, has noted that just implementing a 10-year extension of the expiring provisions in the 2017 tax cuts would cost more than $4.7 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a number that exceeds the budget resolution instructions — and does not include Trump’s other tax demands, including no taxes on tips or Social Security. Included in the tax portion of the package will be an effort by Republicans to increase the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, which is a key ask of Trump and several GOP lawmakers who represent high-tax blue states. Many of those members have said they will not support the final package if there is not substantial SALT relief. Asked if the $4.5 trillion figure provides enough room for reasonable SALT relief, Malliotakis, a member of the SALT Caucus, responded: 'There better be.' Adding to the concerns, Republicans on the Budget Committee adopted an amendment to the budget resolution Thursday night that would require the committee chair to lower deficit increase allowances for the tax portion if the $2 trillion in cuts to mandatory spending is not reached, meaning the allowance for tax cuts and other priorities would be curtailed. The language, crafted by hard-line conservatives and GOP leadership, was key to securing support for the resolution among House Freedom Caucus members who sit on the panel. Malliotakis called the provision 'ridiculous.' 'It boxes us in and I think it limits our ability to deliver on President Trump’s agenda and the tax relief for the middle class,' she said. Other lawmakers, meanwhile, are firing off warning shots about being pushed into complicated corners. 'I ran for Congress under a promise of always doing what is best for the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania. If a bill is put in front of me that guts the benefits my neighbors rely on, I will not vote for it,' Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-Pa.), a first-term lawmaker who flipped a blue district in November, wrote on the social platform X. 'Pennsylvania’s Eighth District chose me to advocate for them in Congress. These benefits are promises that were made to the people of NEPA and where I come from, people keep their word.' It is not, however, all bad news for Johnson and GOP leadership. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), who represents a purple district on Long Island, told The Hill on Friday that he will support the budget resolution, calling it an 'easy vote' while signaling that the hard part will come when lawmakers have to craft the measure. 'This document doesn’t change anything, it merely allows for a second step, and there’s no reason right now to get worked up over the first step,' he said. 'When we see substance on step two, that’s when there’ll be a real time to fight and to haggle. Just now is, now’s not the time.' Johnson and leadership, to be sure, have been clear-eyed about the lengthy effort it will take to clear the reconciliation bill, which has historically been a heavy lift, while remaining optimistic that the party will get the job done. 'The Budget Committee will mark up the resolution that will kick-start the reconciliation process and it will go on in earnest for the next several weeks,' Johnson told NewsNation’s Leland Vittert in an interview earlier this week. 'You’ll hear a lot of debate and discussion and deliberation about how to deliver that, but we’ll get it done. We will find the equilibrium point that makes it all work.' The path to that point, however, is sure to get messy, with Republicans making it clear that they have no plans to rubber-stamp any legislation. 'Right now I’m in a, we’ll see,' Malliotakis said. 'I need some assurances and some clarity to move forward.'

What Elon Musk did before DOGE	(NewsNation) — Long before he became the face of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk always carried lofty aspirations in both business and beyond. Musk elevated himself to the world’s richest man with a net worth of just more than $400 billion, according to Forbes, after successful business forays with Tesla, SpaceX and other endeavors built around his love of technology. But for the 53-year-old South African-born businessman and father of 12 children who moved to Canada at the age of 17 in 2008, dreaming big was always part of his life plan. Your student loans won’t be forgiven if DOGE violated FERPA 'I was definitely inspired by science fiction with books and movies,' Musk said during a panel discussion on advancing technology in 2012. 'It creates this sense of possibility that you want to make real. Making it real is a very difficult process but over time, we’ve been able to do that.' Elon Musk is seen in the U.S. Capitol after a meeting with Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., while on the Hill to talk about President-elect Donald Trump's 'Department of Government Efficiency,' on Thursday, December 5, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Musk’s move to North America as a teenager was made against his wishes, but it allowed him to attend college in Canada and avoid mandatory service in the South African military, according to 'Biography.' Musk also saw coming to Canada as an easier path to American citizenship, which became official in 2002. The move also opened up doors. 'I came to North America because I felt this was where there was an opportunity to do great things in technology,' Musk said in an interview with Queens University, where he attended college and met his first wife. Elon Musk co-founds Tesla Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 with the mission of accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, according to his company bio. The company’s first vehicle, the Roadster, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S sedan (2012) and Model X SUV (2015). Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk stands in front of the newly unveiled all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck at Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, Calif., Nov. 21, 2019. By helping to launch the electric vehicle brand, Musk said his goal for the company was to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation and use Tesla as the catalyst for that transition. Tesla also contributed technology to other automotive manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, long before the concept of electric vehicles took hold across the country as a viable means for sustainable automobiles. Musk and PayPal Before he entered the automotive world, Musk co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading internet payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and directions services. Does DOGE have your personal information? But regardless of what direction his business took him, Musk remained focused on creating a better world and keeping an eye on the past rather than dwelling too much on the past, 'In general, there’s a lot of discussion about his problem or that problem, and a lot of people are sad about the future, and they’re pessimistic,' Musk told TED in 2022. 'This is not great. We want to wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited about what’s going to happen.' Musk and SpaceX Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with a vision of decreasing the cost of space launches and travel but ultimately with the plan of the colonization of Mars. Who is part of DOGE leader Elon Musk’s family? Musk serves as the lead engineer at SpaceX and oversees the development of rockets and spaceships for missions to Earth and, ultimately, to other planets, including Mars.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) The company’s first rocket, Falcon 1, was the first privately developed liquid-fuel rocket to reach orbit. Musk said the United States’ advancement in space travel has not matched other technologies, including communications and computing. Elon Musk’s DOGE has access to these federal agencies He said in 2012 he saw developing interplanetary space travel and landing someone on Mars as the ultimate adventure that the human race could achieve. 'We need a spaceship that can do interplanetary travel,' Musk said. 'It’s about time.' Musk's Mars Colonization Goals SpaceX developed the Starship spacecraft, which the company describes as a fully reusable transportation system that is designed to carry crew and cargo to orbit the Earth, Mars and beyond. The rocket’s heat shield is designed to withstand several entries to Mars. In addition to living out the adventure of establishing a sustainable interplanetary life system on Mars, Musk wrote on the SpaceX website that spacefaring civilization is 'about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past.' Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE? 'I think people should generally have more of a positive attitude because that’s the underlying reality,' Musk said in 2012. 'I think in the 21st century, we’ll see lots of exciting things happen. I think we’ll see the transformation and transportation and energy production. We’ll hopefully see a base on Mars and if SpaceX can help us make that transformation happen, I think it will enable enormous possibilities for who is able to go over there and create things on another planet.' DOGE Musk was designated to oversee DOGE by President Donald Trump after Musk campaigned for Trump throughout his campaign for a second term in the White House. Elon Musk’s net worth drops as Trump threatens tariffs The office was established to cut government spending, with Musk saying at the outset of DOGE’s formation that his goal was to cut as much as $2 trillion in annual federal spending.

Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration has led to criticism from some who maintain that he has too much influence and too much access to sensitive financial information. 'Elon is doing a great job, he's finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste,' Trump told reporters this month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/what-elon-musk-did-before-doge/	2025-02-15T16:59:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2194353767.jpg?w=900

Her body would be found weeks later in mid-September, days after Laundrie went missing in the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in Florida. Laundrie’s remains were found in the nature preserve in October 2021. Investigators said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and left a notebook confession saying he killed Gabby. Gabby’s family will share their story in 'American Murder: Gabby Petito,' a three-part documentary set to premiere on Feb. 17. 'American Murder: Gabby Petito, a new three-part documentary series, goes beyond the media frenzy to let Petito’s family and friends share her story,' a news release from Netflix read in part. 'Illustrated with real text messages, video footage, and excerpts from Petito’s personal journals, the series captures the reality of a young woman enmeshed in an abusive relationship behind closed doors — even as she put on a happy, 'Insta-perfect' face for social media.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/gabby-petito-missing-case/gabby-petitos-family-speaks-with-newsnation-netflix-doc/	2025-02-15T09:33:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/59a04525-8749-4156-a91e-0e929592c3ee-large16x9_Gabby1-4-1-1-1.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Border Patrol agents will stop using body cameras in the field effective immediately, multiple sources have confirmed to NewsNation. The move, according to sources, would extend to all operational activities and was purportedly prompted by a Reddit post that showed users a way to detect Border Patrol or ICE agents. According to the post by user 'rowingalt86' under r/immigration, agents could be seen by using BLE Radar by F-Droid. BLE Radar is a mobile application that analyzes Bluetooth low-energy devices, including smartphones, smartwatches, speakers and smartphones. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts ICE continues to ramp up efforts to deport individuals illegally residing in the United States, accessing databases, including commercial databases, motor vehicle and driver’s records as well as utility records to locate 'removable non-citizens,' according to ICE’s website. According to NewsNation sources, President Donald Trump is unhappy with the number of arrests made by ICE. A source with knowledge of the matter told NewsNation that the president recently remarked to aides 'the numbers are too f—— low.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-patrol-agents-body-cameras/	2025-02-15T08:41:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/IMG_2238-1.jpg?w=900
Historian who discovered Jack The Ripper's real identity says '10...	(NewsNation) — A historian and true crime sleuth may have cracked a case for the ages, sharing his bombshell findings with NewsNation’s 'Banfield' Friday night. Russell Edwards identified a 100% DNA match to locate the real identity of serial killer 'Jack The Ripper.' The infamous killer who terrorized London women may have been 23-year-old Aaron Kosminski, who had long been considered a suspect at the time. 'Oh, without a doubt, 100% it’s him,' said Edwards, who in 2007 bought a shawl that was found at the scene of the murder of Catherine Eddowes. Jack the Ripper’s identity revealed after DNA match, historian says Who is the real Jack The Ripper? He tested the shawl using DNA provided by Kosminski’s oldest brother’s great-great-granddaughter. Kosminski, a Polish immigrant, became a barber in Whitechapel, England, and was in a mental health facility with schizophrenia at the time of his death in 1919. A composite drawing was done to recreate Kosminksi’s image. A historian began researching Jack The Ripper's real identity, linking DNA evidence to a man named Aaron Kosminski. This is a composite drawing the historian, Russell Edwards, commissioned of Kosminski. 'This face is a facial reconstruction by an expert from the family photos that were given to me by one of the family members, by one of the descendants,' he said. 'That's actually what he looked like.' Edwards turned his discovery into a book, 'Naming Jack the Ripper: The Definitive Reveal.' Jack The Ripper victim’s descendant wears her brooch to this day 'With the evidence that we have, we can actually place Aaron Kosminski at the murder scene,' he said. What evidence helped identify Jack The Ripper? Russell Edwards, a historian, holds a shawl he bought in 2007 that was found at the murder scene of one of Jack The Ripper's victims. Edwards used the shawl to test for DNA evidence, leading him to discover the real identity of the serial killer, he claims. The most interesting piece of evidence, he said, is the 9-foot long and 2.5-foot wide shawl that helped bridge history’s mystery with forensic DNA. It was in a police filing cabinet for over a decade, according to Edwards. Now, it’s in a bank vault, likely to go untested by police. 'They've never knocked on the door. And when we originally did this, they certainly weren't interested. It's curious that they sort of just not bothered,' Edwards said. The curious case of 'Jack The Ripper' became not a British fascination, not an American fascination, but a global one. Edwards said, 'It's the eternal ‘who done it.’'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jack-the-ripper-real-identity-discovered-historian-claims/	2025-02-15T06:01:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-71901552.jpg?w=900
East braces for flooding while fire-damaged California city faces...	SIERRA MADRE, Calif. (AP) — Much of the Eastern U.S. braced for a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather on Saturday, with thunderstorms and melting snow combining to pound the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The lower Mississippi valley was facing the threat of strong tornadoes. Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and residents were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to 8 inches of rain. 'This may be a major, potentially historic, flash flood event,' the NWS said. Heavy snow, meanwhile, was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible, the NWS said. In northern New York, heavy mixed precipitation is expected throughout the weekend. Weather forecasters said residents should expect snow, sleet and ice accumulations of six to 13 inches and wind gusts as high as 45 mph (72 kph) late Saturday and Sunday. 'Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and strong winds. Travel could be very difficult to nearly impossible, the NWS said. California struggles with mudslides In Southern California on Friday, a mountain community near the Eaton Fire burn scar dug out of roads submerged in sludge after the strongest storm of the year swept through the area, unleashing debris flows and muddy messes in several neighborhoods recently torched by wildfires. Dry weather returned to the region but the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued Friday since dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers on Friday were cleaning up the mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. 'It happened very quickly but it was very loud and you could even hear the ground or feel the ground shaking,' Bull Duvall, who has lived in Sierra Madre for 28 years, said of the debris flows. Sierra Madre officials issued evacuation orders for areas affected by the Eaton Fire, warning that fire, police and public works personnel would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to enter. Residents of the city also had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire, which destroyed 15 homes in the community. In Pacific Palisades on Friday, some residents washed their mud-covered driveways and bulldozers worked to clear mud-coated roads not far from where, just weeks ago, officials moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month's wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot. The vehicle of a member of the Los Angeles Fire Department was pulled out of the water in Malibu after it was pushed into the ocean on Thursday. A fire department employee was able to exit with minor injuries, department spokesperson Erik Scott said. Southern California reported 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7 centimeters) of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) across the coastal slopes on Thursday, said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the weather service. The precipitation was badly needed, as much of Southern California remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation. A storm in the Sierra Nevada mountains dumped 6 feet (1.8 meters) of snow over 36 hours. Two ski patrol staff from Mammoth Mountain were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. More winter weather is descending on the U.S. Meteorologists warn that the U.S. is about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday and then stick around all next week. In Denver, where temperatures are expected to dip as low as 14 degrees (minus 10 degrees Celsius) over the weekend, the city has extended its cold weather shelters for those living on the streets. The Denver Coliseum — an arena with some 10,000 seats — will be opened Saturday for additional space, while a free bus will loop between the shelters across the city. In the Rocky Mountains, skiers eager for the long Presidents' Day weekend are already facing a closure on a section of Interstate 70 due to snow as officials warn of hazardous conditions on the mountain roads over the weekend. ___ Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

Black Hawk pilots may have flown on 'bad' altitude data before cr...	(The Hill) — The Black Hawk pilots who collided with an American Airlines plane last month may not have heard vital information given by air traffic control to fly behind the passenger jet seconds before the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed Friday. Seventeen seconds before impact, a radio transmission from the control tower directed the Black Hawk to pass behind the jet. But data from the Army helicopter indicated that 'the portion of the transmission that stated ‘pass behind the’ may not have been received by the Black Hawk crew,' NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at a Friday news conference. It is likely the Black Hawk pilots 'stepped on' the communication for less than a second by pressing the microphone key to communicate back to the control tower, she said. Furthermore, the Black Hawk pilots may have had 'bad data' on the altitude they were flying at outside Washington D.C. at the time of the Jan. 29 collision, which killed all 67 people aboard both flights, according to the agency. The Black Hawk crashed into Flight 5342 just before 9 p.m. as the jet was en route to Reagan National Airport from Wichita, Kan. The collision sent both aircraft plunging into the Potomac River, the deadliest such accident since 2001. 'We are seeing conflicting information in the data,' Homendy said, noting that the helicopter was flying at 278 feet when it crashed — far above the 200-foot limit for that location. But 'that does not mean that’s what the Black Hawk crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit,' she cautioned. At one point, the pilot indicated they were flying at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot said they were at 400 feet, according to recordings. 'We are looking at the possibility that there may be bad data,' she said. Investigators also believe the helicopter pilots were wearing night vision goggles and had been the whole flight. She said that the on-scene phase of the investigation into the disaster had been finished, but because of the conflicting data with the Black Hawk’s altitude, the NTSB is not yet releasing information for the helicopter’s entire route. Earlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration ruled that helicopters and airplanes would no longer be able to share the airspace above the Potomac River, a decision made after speculation the Black Hawk had been flying too high. The accident has also prompted widespread concern over the staffing shortages at the FAA with President Trump vowing to overhaul the agency and air traffic control.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/black-hawk-pilots-may-have-flown-on-bad-altitude-data-before-crash/	2025-02-15T04:18:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25045729678068-e1739582653613.jpg?w=800
Hamas parades 3 Israeli hostages before crowd in handoff to Red C...	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Saturday paraded three Israeli hostages before a large crowd in the Gaza Strip ahead of their handover to the Red Cross as part of a shaky ceasefire deal that requires Israel to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange. The three hostages are Iair Horn, 46, a dual citizen of Israel and Argentina; Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, who is American-Israeli; and Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, who holds Israeli and Russian citizenship. All were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. The truce that began nearly four weeks ago had been jeopardized in recent days by a tense dispute that threatened to renew the fighting. U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to remove more than 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has cast even more doubt on the future of the ceasefire. But Hamas said Thursday it would move ahead with the release of more hostages after talks with Egyptian and Qatari officials. The group said the mediators had pledged to 'remove all hurdles' to assure Israel would allow more tents, medical supplies and other essentials into Gaza. It will be the sixth swap since the ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19. So far, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed during the first phase of the truce. Red Cross vehicles arrived at the location where Hamas was set to release the hostages Saturday morning. As with previous exchanges, dozens of masked, armed Hamas fighters lined up near a stage festooned with Palestinian flags and the banners of militant factions while music blared from loudspeakers. The militants are will hand the hostages over to the Red Cross, which will then transport them to Israeli forces Who are the hostages and prisoners being released? The three hostages were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities in southern Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the devastating war. Horn was abducted along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who had been staying with him at the time. Eitan remains in captivity. Dekel Chen had been working outside when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife hid in a safe room with their two daughters. She gave birth to their third daughter two months later. Troufanov was taken hostage along with his grandmother, mother and girlfriend. The three women were released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Troufanov’s father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack. The Hamas-linked Prisoners’ Information Office said Friday that 369 Palestinians were set to be released from Israeli prisons on Saturday. It said 36 of those were serving life sentences. Among the most prominent Palestinian prisoners set to be released is Ahmed Barghouti, 48, a close aide of Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure. Israel sentenced Ahmed Barghouti to life on charges that he dispatched suicide bombers during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s to carry out attacks that killed Israeli civilians. He was arrested alongside Marwan Barghouti in 2002. Concerns are high about the remaining hostages’ condition Of the 251 people abducted, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers. Concern has been growing about the remaining hostages’ condition, particularly after the release of three last Saturday, who emerged looking emaciated and frail. One of them, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said Friday in a video message addressed to Trump that his captors treated him worse as the 15-month war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him without water or light. The truce remains very fragile The ceasefire appeared dangerously close to collapse in recent days. Hamas had said it would delay the release of the hostages after accusing Israel of not adhering to their agreement by not allowing in enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble. Israel said it would resume fighting Saturday unless hostages were freed. While the immediate crisis may have been averted, the truce faces a much bigger challenge with the deal’s first phase set to conclude in early March. There have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war. At its height, the fighting displaced 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have since returned to their homes as the ceasefire took hold, though many found only rubble, buried human remains and unexploded ordnance. The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Trump’s plan increases uncertainty Trump’s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has thrown the truce’s future into further doubt. The idea has been welcomed by Israel’s government. But it has been strongly rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries. Human rights groups say it could amount to a war crime under international law. Trump has proposed that once the fighting ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would then redevelop it as the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right allies are already calling for a resumption of the war after the first phase with the goal of destroying Hamas and implementing Trump’s plan. The militant group remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. Hamas may be unwilling to release any more hostages if it believes the war will resume. The captives are among the only bargaining chips it has left. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-is-set-to-free-3-more-israeli-hostages-after-dispute-threatened-to-reignite-war-in-gaza/	2025-02-15T00:19:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67b04d74b5b1f8.60498139.jpeg?w=900
Jack The Ripper victim's descendant wears her brooch to this day	(NewsNation) — Sharon Dutton, descendant of 'Jack The Ripper' victim Catherine Eddowes, is seeking justice for her great-great-great aunt. 'We want justice for Catherine and all the other victims,' Dutton said during an exclusive appearance Friday on NewsNation's 'Banfield.' 'It was absolutely devastating for the family.' Area 51 veterans getting cancer as DOD denies they were there Dutton showed Ashleigh Banfield a brooch that was left by Eddowes, which she still wears in her honor, 137 years later. 'It's been treasured from generation to generation,' Dutton said. Who was Jack the Ripper? Jack the Ripper has lived in infamy and lore for more than a century after he committed the murders of at least five women in Whitechapel between August and November of 1888. Police never found the suspect, who was also referred to as the 'Whitechapel Murderer' and the 'Leather Apron.' He was infamous for slitting the throat of his victims before removing the internal organs of at least three people. According to Dutton, Jack the Ripper ripped Eddowes' bladder and kidney out from her body. Possible abduction attempt under investigation in Wichita, Kansas Is it a confirmed match to Jack the Ripper? Historian Russell Edwards says he identified Jack the Ripper as Aaron Kosminski through a DNA match of a shawl found at the scene of one of his murders. According to the Daily Mail, Edwards has hired a legal team to help gain an inquest after he found a 100% DNA match. Descendants of both Eddowes and Kosminski have backed this move. As he told 'Today,' Edwards and his team have sent a letter to the attorney general requesting permission to go to Britain's High Court for a further inquest. The hope is that Kosminski can be legally tied to the murder.

Sarah Palin ‘would love to’ join Trump administration	(NewsNation) — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin tells 'On Balance with Leland Vittert' she’d be honored to serve in President Donald Trump’s second administration but hasn’t been contacted. 'I thought that there’d be a position in energy, in that department, because that's my baby ... but that hasn’t happened,' Palin said on Friday. She pointed to 'gatekeepers' within the administration, telling NewsNation: 'It gets frustrating for those with a heart to serve.' Trump’s framed mug shot hangs outside Oval Office 'I didn’t even get credentials to attend the GOP convention if you can believe it,' she added. 'They’re tight, they’re tight.' The former governor told NewsNation that she's the only living Republican to have run for vice president or president — and support Trump — who was not at the event.

Lawsuit against Jay-Z, Diddy dismissed by accuser's attorney	(NewsNation) — The lawsuit accusing Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, and Sean 'Diddy' Combs of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000 has been dismissed by the accuser’s attorney, according to new court filings. The voluntary dismissal filing, obtained by Variety, said the accuser 'hereby gives notice that the above-captioned Action is voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice.' Prejudice prevents the accuser, identified only as 'Jane Doe,' or her lawyers from refiling the lawsuit as it was first written. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline Roc Nation, Jay-Z's entertainment company, issued a statement calling the dismissal 'a victory.' 'The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit waswithout merit and never going anywhere. The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims,' reads the statement, which was signed by Jay-Z. The statement mentioned that his wife, Beyonce, and their three children have endured trauma as a result of the accusations. 'The court must protect victims, OF COURSE, while with the same ethical responsibility, the courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence. May the truth prevail for all victims and those falsely accused equally,' the statement continued. Lawsuit accuses Jay-Z and Diddy of rape Originally filed in October 2024, the suit named only Diddy. An amended complaint in December identified Jay-Z as 'Celebrity A,' who was accused of raping the 13-year-old while 'Celebrity B,' a female, watched. Following the filing, Jay-Z released a lengthy response accusing the lawyer behind the accuser’s suit of attempting to blackmail him. What we know about the Diddy investigation 'What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle,' Jay-Z’s statement reads in part. 'No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!' Diddy indictment Diddy has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after his bond request was denied for a third time in late November. Combs’ indictment came after months of speculation about a possible federal investigation tied to civil lawsuits alleging abuse and sexual assault spanning more than 30 years. Diddy’s ‘inner circle’ breaks silence in new documentary The indictment alleges Combs lured in women with promises of a romantic relationship before using intimidation and threats to have them engage in prostitution at reported so-called 'freak offs.' There, victims were allegedly drugged and told to engage in sex acts with male sex workers for an extended period while someone filmed them. Combs allegedly kept some of the videos, sometimes without the victims’ knowledge. The indictment states that Combs and the victims often required IV fluids afterward due to physical exertion.

US Army bans transgender people from enlisting	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Army has banned transgender people from joining its ranks and ended gender-affirming care for service members, the military branch announced Friday. In a post on X, the official U.S. Army account said that 'all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused, and all unscheduled, scheduled, or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for Service members are paused.' The new policies are effective immediately, the Army's post confirmed. Judge extends order blocking DOGE from treasury systems The change comes just weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for a revision of gender policy in the military. The president said that transgender service members' identities conflict 'with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.' The president's order points to those diagnosed with gender dysphoria, or distress felt when assigned sex and gender don't match. The U.S. Army's thread of posts point to this term as well, concluding: 'Individuals with gender dysphoria have volunteered to serve our country and will be treated with dignity and respect.' In the wake of the order, six active duty service members filed a lawsuit challenging the ban. 'I’ve spent more than half my life in the Army, including combat in Afghanistan,' Army Sgt. 1st Class Kate Cole told The Associated Press. 'Removing qualified transgender soldiers like me means an exodus of experienced personnel.' Foreign aid freeze temporarily lifted but damage may already be done The lawsuit is being filed by the same legal team that spent years during Trump’s first administration fighting the Republican ban on transgender troops, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect even as the legal fight against it continued in the courts. Joe Biden scrapped the ban when he took office. One of the plaintiffs, Army Capt. Gordon Herrero, said in a statement: 'There’s nothing about being transgender that makes me better or worse than any other soldier I serve alongside. We are all here because we are committed to our country, and we are passionate, willing, and able to serve effectively.' According to the Associated Press, estimates place the number of transgender troops at 9,000 to 12,000, though it's hard to know for certain due to medical privacy laws. Just last week, the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Board of Governors voted to change its policy on transgender athletes.

Cartels trade 'cocaine of the sea' for fentanyl chemicals	(NewsNation) — A cartel made up of Chinese and Mexican nationals is taking a new route to smuggle drugs and trade on parts from an endangered species. A new memo from Canada's border service revealed a group known as the Dragon Cartel, where members are trading the endangered totoaba fish for the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl. The fish is an endangered species that swims in the Gulf of California. Mexican cartels discovered there is a demand for the totoaba fish on the black market in Asia for its swim bladder. Could DOGE, Trump administration close the IRS? One kilogram of totoaba swim bladder is worth $80,000 on the black market, which has led to the fish becoming known as the 'cocaine of the sea.' The swim bladders are used in traditional cuisine, traditional Chinese medicine and even in cosmetics. According to the memo, west coast ports are used to exchange the goods, with the port of Vancouver particularly vulnerable to the trade. Officials are fighting an uphill battle when it comes to cracking down on the totoaba trade. One reason for that is the volume of trade through Vancouver; another is it is extremely difficult to identify illegally traded bladders among other legal fish products.

Could DOGE, Trump administration close the IRS?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency might be considering making changes to the Internal Revenue Service, as a staffer at DOGE visited IRS headquarters Thursday, according to Reuters. DOGE investigating IRS Sources told Reuters that staffer Gavin Kliger was meeting with senior executives, marking the first time that Elon Musk's DOGE has visited the IRS. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts Reuters reported that IRS senior executives received an email Thursday that told them to find all 'non-essential' contracts that could be terminated. The email said, 'Consistent with the goals and directives of the Trump administration to eliminate waste, reduce spending, and increase efficiency, GSA has taken the first steps in a government-wide initiative to eliminate non-essential consulting contracts.' Trump also responded to DOGE being at the IRS on Thursday, stating, 'I think that the Internal Revenue Service will be looked at like everybody else, just about everybody is going to be looked at. They're [DOGE] doing a hell of a job, it's an amazing job they're doing,' according to The Hill. DOGE has been heavily criticized by many Democrats, with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden posting on X on Thursday, 'My office is hearing that DOGE is now at the IRS. That means Musk's henchmen are in a position to dig through a trove of data about every taxpayer in America.' Elon Musk’s DOGE has access to these federal agencies Can Elon Musk's DOGE close the IRS? Since the IRS was created by Congress, it would require an act from Congress to shut the organization down. It is not clear how Trump's administration or DOGE would clear any legal hurdles that might come with using an executive order to close the IRS. In January, Georgia Republican Earl L. 'Buddy' Carter introduced the Fair Tax Act, which would replace the current tax code and 'eliminate the need for the Internal Revenue Service.' As of February, this bill has only been introduced. However, if it passes the House and Senate and is signed by Trump, it would become law. George W. Connelly, senior counsel at Chamberlain Hrdlicka Attorney at Law, talked about the importance of the IRS in 2020, saying, 'Those of us in the tax profession who deal with the IRS frankly prefer dealing with IRS personnel and the administrative system in place over what we encountered in the state regimes.' Connelly also said that changing the name of the IRS wouldn't remove 'the tax man.' 'No matter what we call him, his job will never change. Meanwhile, calls for abolishing the IRS simply distract the attention that needs to be placed on making the IRS more effective, starting with adequately funding it and reviewing the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights,' he said. What would happen with our taxes if the IRS closed? According to the Tax Policy Center, the IRS is anticipating 140 million tax returns this year. Potential staffing cuts and the IRS having a temporary acting commissioner could make it harder for taxpayers to reach a representative to get assistance with filing. With Trump's administration encouraging federal employees to resign or retire and about 77,000 workers accepting that offer, the IRS could be short-staffed. This could lead to a delay in filing your return or distributing your refund. Filing taxes late will cost you, but how much? These cuts could also potentially affect the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs, which offer free tax prep for those who make $67,000 or less, have a disability or don't speak English as their first language. According to the IRS, these programs helped prepare and file more than 2.7 million tax returns. Remember, there are penalties for not filing your tax return on time, not paying taxes you owe on time and not providing accurate information on your return.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/what-happens-irs-abolished-doge-taxes/	2025-02-14T11:59:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675b1d4b88e754.35435350.jpeg?w=900
Diddy accused of threatening, assaulting woman in 2016: Lawsuit	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs has been sued by a woman who claims the embattled music producer threatened then sexually assaulted her at a Los Angeles club in 2016 in a new lawsuit which follows a growing pile of complaints against the rapper. The woman claims Combs and his entourage approached her when she was at Club Playhouse in Los Angeles, according to a complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court, reported People. Combs allegedly offered her a drink, but when she refused, he allegedly responded, 'B----, I’m not asking you. Drink that s--- and shut the f--- up,' the complaint states. The plaintiff claims she 'felt compelled to drink the beverage after he forcefully slid the glass towards her.' Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline He then allegedly placed his arm around her and 'shoved his left hand up her skirt, forcefully penetrating her with his fingers while telling her, 'B---, I do what I want, take that s---.'' The woman alleges that she tried to push Combs away but that he laughed 'appearing amused by her distress.' She claimed in her suit that Combs eventually allowed her to leave, but she was already feeling disoriented when she hailed a cab back to her hotel saying she 'felt dizzy, light-headed, and unable to stand without support.' The plaintiff claimed that hotel staff had to help her get to her hotel room. The following morning, the complaint claims that she found tearing and bruising around her genital area, 'likely resulting from the assault.' Her complaint did not allege that the drink was spiked. Combs’ attorneys denied the accusations in a statement to People: 'No matter how many lawsuits are filed—especially by individuals who refuse to put their own names behind their claims—it won’t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor,' The musician already faces a mounting list of civil lawsuits that allege abuse and sexual assault by multiple victims spanning over 30 years. Combs was charged with federal racketeering and sex trafficking last year after two of his homes in Miami and New York were raided by federal investigators. His trial is set for May. The indictment says Combs often lured victims by promising a romantic relationship before using threats, intimidation and abuse to get them to engage in various sexual activities. Those included so-called 'Freak Offs' where victims were directed to engage in extended sex acts with male sex workers on film. Prosecutors allege Combs drugged victims during those sessions and sometimes kept the footage without the victim being aware he was doing so.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-threatening-assaulting-woman-2016/	2025-02-14T10:20:52-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-459349060.jpg?w=900
These are the 10 cities where renters pay the highest 'singles ta...	(NewsNation) — The cost of living alone is rising, and the so-called 'singles tax' is now at an all-time high, according to a new Zillow analysis. Nationwide, solo renters pay an extra $7,562 per year for a one-bedroom unit compared to couples who split rent with their partners. That premium, known as the singles tax, is up by more than $450 from a year ago. In high cost-of-living areas like New York City and San Francisco, the singles tax is much higher. Rents for single-family homes 41% higher than prepandemic Singles in the Big Apple pay an average of $20,100 more per year to live alone, the highest premium of any U.S. city. 'As anyone on the dating scene in NYC will tell you, it’s not easy to be single here, and the lack of affordable rentals just adds another layer to that struggle,' Casey Roberts, home trends expert at Zillow's New York City brand StreetEasy, said in a statement. California's Bay Area also comes at a steep price for singles; San Francisco ($14,793) and San Jose ($14,254) had the second and third highest singles tax in the country. Boston ($12,289) came in fourth followed by Washington, D.C. ($12,019). What does January’s inflation report mean for me? The sky-high singles tax won't come as a surprise to most. Rents have been steadily increasing and are up in 47 of the 50 largest metro areas from a year ago, according to Zillow. The typical U.S. asking rent hit $1,968 in January, up 3.5% from a year earlier and up more than 33% since the beginning of the pandemic. The latest inflation report further underscored the nation's housing affordability challenge. Shelter accounted for roughly 30% of the overall increase in the consumer price index last month. But it's not all bad news for renters. Zillow's data shows landlords are increasingly offering concessions to attract renters. Last month, more than 41% of the real estate company's rental listings featured incentives — a record high in Zillow data. Those freebies are expected to slow down in the months ahead when competition in the rental market picks up. A lot of that will depend on what happens with mortgage rates, which have kept potential buyers on the sidelines. Zillow determined each city's singles tax based on the median-priced one-bedroom rental in December 2024. That number was multiplied by 12 to get the typical annual rent and then halved to figure out how much more it costs to live alone versus with a partner splitting the cost. Top ten U.S. cities with the highest singles tax, according to Zillow: New York City, NY: $20,100 San Francisco, CA: $14,793 San Jose, CA: $14,254 Boston, MA: $12,829 Washington, D.C.: $12,019 San Diego, CA: $11,897 Seattle, WA: $11,556 Los Angeles, CA: $10,470 Long Beach, CA: $10,228 Denver, CO: $9,676	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/10-cities-renters-singles-tax/	2025-02-14T10:16:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2179858600.jpg?w=900
Live: DC plane crash investigation update	(NewsNation) — New details were revealed Friday during a National Transport Safety Board briefing into the Jan. 29 crash between an American Airlines passenger jet and a Black Hawk military helicopter that killed 67 people in Washington, D.C. In the weeks since the crash, the NTSB has been analyzing flight data and damage to determine the cause of the crash. In what was the deadliest aircraft collision in nearly two decades, the helicopter was performing a 'check ride,' otherwise known as a practical test to become a pilot. Egg prices are surging, so why are chicken prices stable? All 67 victims have been identified, and debris from the two aircraft has been recovered from the Potomac River. There is a chance during the news conference that investigators reveal what was said in the final moments from the cockpit of the plane and the cockpit of the helicopter. That audio was contained in the black boxes of the aircraft. Should those details emerge, we would not hear the exact audio from those black boxes; instead, transcripts would be made public. Investigators have interviewed air traffic controllers working at the time of the collision, and information about their experiences may also be revealed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/dc-plane-crash-updates-today/	2025-02-14T09:08:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196164305.jpg?w=900
Pope Francis hospitalized for bronchitis treatment, Vatican says	(NewsNation) — Pope Francis was hospitalized Friday to continue treatment for bronchitis and undergo tests, the Vatican said. The 88-year-old pontiff is being treated at Rome's Gemelli Hospital. The Vatican canceled his events through Monday. Since being diagnosed with bronchitis last Thursday, Francis has continued his activities and audiences indoors at Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican residence where he lives, with a public appearance on Sunday. Francis has long battled health problems, including long bouts of bronchitis. He uses a walker or cane when moving around his apartment and recently fell twice, hurting his arm and chin.

Adams letting ICE operate at Rikers after meeting with Tom Homan	(NewsNation) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement will soon be allowed to operate in Rikers Island, New York City's largest jail, Mayor Eric Adams announced after a meeting with President Donald Trump's 'border czar' Tom Homan. In a statement, he called the meeting with Homan productive, adding that he doesn't want to go to war with the Trump administration. Part of the plan discussed with Homan includes reopening ICE's office on Rikers Island. Also discussed were ways to embed more New York Police detectives into federal task forces focused on violent gangs and criminal activity. Area 51 veterans getting cancer as DOD denies they were there The alliance comes a day after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a lawsuit against the state of New York, accusing officials of impeding ICE's work — and two days after the Department of Justice issued a memo directing bribery charges be dropped against Adams. Charges against Adams are to be dropped without prejudice, which means they can be refiled. Critics point to the DOJ's move as a possible motive for Adams' willingness to work with Trump administration officials. When asked directly, Adams said the Biden administration, which implemented sanctuary city laws that limit how much local law enforcement can work with ICE, went too far. 'I thought the intention was there, but the application was wrong,' Adams said. 'I asked the city council, 'Can we modify when it comes down to dangerous individuals?' They refused to do so, so we need to operate in the parameters that we have.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/adams-letting-ice-operate-rikers-meeting-tom-homan/	2025-02-14T06:26:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2189641961.jpg?w=900
OPM directs agencies to fire government workers still on probatio...	Office of Personnel Management (OPM) officials met with agency leaders across government Thursday and directed them to begin firing employees still in their probationary period a year or more after being hired. Federal employees remain on probation anywhere from one to two years after being hired, depending on their agency, a status that still comes with workplace protections but makes them easier to remove. The move could impact as many as 200,000 federal employees. A source familiar with OPM said agency leaders have directed agencies to fire all probationary employees 'with some exceptions.' It was not immediately clear what those exceptions were or the extent of discretion given to agencies. 'The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment. Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the President's broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard,' an OPM spokesperson said in a statement. The move is a reversal from an OPM directive just days earlier, when agencies were told to remove probationary employees only if they were poor performers. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest federal employee union, pledged to fight the layoffs, saying they would hinder government performance. 'This administration has abused the probationary period to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office,' AFGE president Everett Kelley said in a statement. 'These firings are not about poor performance -- there is no evidence these employees were anything but dedicated public servants. They are about power. They are about gutting the federal government, silencing workers, and forcing agencies into submission to a radical agenda that prioritizes cronyism over competence. The Trump administration has also used two other methods to cull the workforce: an executive order from President Trump directing agencies to undertake a reduction in force and the 'Fork in the Road' program offering federal workers a buyout. Agencies across government have already begun carrying out their layoffs of probationary employees. That was even true at OPM, where the agency fired its probationary staff, cutting them off from systems at 3 p.m. EST, according to Gov Exec. The move appears to have affected 70 employees there. Employees were asked to join a remote meeting where their cameras, mics and chat features were turned off, a now former employee told The Hill. The employees were then sent a link to a presentation from OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell informing them they were fired, the employee said. They lost access to systems within 15 minutes of the 3 p.m. firing. Reports from numerous outlets spelled out plans to fire probationary workers at the Department of Energy, the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration. It’s not clear whether such widespread firings of employees still on probation is legal. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) last week asked congressional leaders to investigate the plans, warning that such mass layoffs would violate laws saying workers can only be fired for cause. 'Mass layoffs of federal employees of the sort that have been reported to be under consideration are presumptively and inherently illegal,' the ACLU wrote. The ACLU argues the law requires reviewing each employee’s performance on a case-by-case basis, while any large-scale firings would have to follow existing law for shrinking the workforce. Despite their probationary status, the employees are still afforded much of the same protections as the broader federal workforce, meaning they must be informed of 'inadequacies' in their performance before being fired. 'While the law allows for the termination of probationary employees for performance or conduct reasons, a mass firing on this scale without any sort of individualized assessment or following of Reduction in Force (RIF) procedures raises serious legal concerns,' the ACLU wrote.

Area 51 veterans getting cancer as DOD denies they were there	NewsNation Anchor Natasha Zouves has much more on the Area 51 veterans fighting for benefits. To watch her full report, tune into 'NewsNation Prime' this Saturday at 7p/6C. (NewsNation) — Dave Crete adds another name to a growing memorial list, now more than 400 in total — men and women he says he served with on a secretive range in the Nevada desert that encompasses Area 51. Crete and his fellow veterans were hand-picked and tasked with top-secret work. They couldn’t even tell their wives what they did every day. 'We couldn’t even tell them the weather,' said Crete. Now, Crete says he is discovering this group has more in common than their years of service those decades ago. Many are developing serious health issues, multiple tumors and, in too many cases, deadly cancers. A group of these veterans are telling NewsNation’s Natasha Zouves that they are unable to get the care and benefits they need because the Department of Defense refuses to acknowledge they were ever stationed in the desert. The DOD records sent to Veterans Affairs lists the same two words between asterisks in black and white: 'DATA MASKED.' 'They keep us classified to protect themselves,' said Crete. Crete says the average age on the memorial list is 65. Backyard barbecue leads to shocking discovery A 2016 reunion barbecue at Crete’s Las Vegas home was supposed to be a chance for Air Force buddies to reminisce after almost three decades apart, serving together in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. It was veteran Randy Groves who suddenly brought up the subject of tumors — a comment that stopped Dave Crete in his tracks. Live: Trump announces reciprocal tariffs 'We're just sitting around drinking beers,' recounted Groves. 'I said, ‘You guys, I got this this lump on my back. Does anybody else got that?’ And Dave goes, ‘Yeah, I had a big one cut out.’' Randy Groves Dave Crete says he had, in fact, developed more than 20 lipomas on his body, ranging from his forehead to his arms to his torso; one of them grew so large that it had to be excised from his back. 'I said, ‘Yeah, I had one of those. I had it removed. It was the size of a grapefruit,’' he recalls. The veterans discovered that out of the eight men sitting around that circle, six of them had developed tumors. The seventh man said, 'I don’t have any, but my son was born with one.' 'It just kind of confirmed it. There was an issue where we were. That's the one common denominator. We were all there,' said Groves. 'There' was the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), an area encompassing the infamous Area 51. This remote site, known for its nuclear testing since the 1950s, both underground and atmospheric, hosted highly classified military operations. The veterans still can’t talk about most of their work on the range, but the one declassified mission they can now disclose involves guarding the F-117 Nighthawk, America’s first stealth bomber. The full scope of their work will likely never be known by the public, but Crete says he takes refuge in a conversation he had with the late Sen. John McCain. 'We never talked about what I had done, but I knew he knew. He was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so he knew. And he came up to me and he says, ‘Your unit ended the Cold War.’ If you ever wanted a validation what you did was important, that’s just about it,' said Crete. 'It’s a matter of betrayal' Veteran Mike Nemcic had the same tumors as his crewmates at the barbecue, starting around his eye, followed by multiple cancers. 'I was to the point where I felt forsaken. I thought, 'My God has forsaken me,'' said Nemcic. Nemcic endured four bouts with cancer — throat, salivary gland, bladder and colon — starting at just 38 years old. He says his biggest fear was leaving his young family behind without a father or provider. FBI group investigating UFOs: Former Navy pilot There is also a persistent guilt that won’t leave Nemcic: watching the young men he selected for his team go on to develop serious health issues. This includes Bob Morton, who passed away in 2021 from lung cancer. He was 58 years old. 'I would repeat my military service over again without hesitation because I know it was important to our country. The only regret I have is, once I was there, I got to choose who my team was going to be. I selected Bob to be part of my team. And he’s on my mind. If I wouldn’t have done that, he would still be here,' Nemcic said, holding back tears. Nemcic is far from alone. Robert Krouse is a former DOD contractor who worked alongside these vets. He endured two cancers, having 80% of his tongue removed along with his vocal cords and all of his teeth. He can’t speak and can’t eat. Despite this, he says he feels blessed to be alive. 'I have a feeding tube, but I saw friends who passed away or are paralyzed and can’t walk,' said Krouse. 'I’m just blessed I’m functional but not as handy. I feel blessed. I’m much better off than some.' Krouse says he 'assumed it was safe,' as did all of these men and women. Documentation has been unearthed since their service showing what the government knew before deciding to send these Air Force members into the desert. 'It’s like a kick in the gut. It’s just a matter of betrayal,' said Nemcic. 'These folks knew, and they purposefully kept it quiet because it was more beneficial to them not to tell us.' What the government knew: An unearthed 1975 report Before Pomp Braswell became a pro golfer and a Harlem Globetrotter, he served. 'You’re hand-picked, you know, you’re the top of the top,' said Braswell. 'It felt very special, especially at a young age. My mom knew absolutely zero about what I was doing. She knew there was a phone number if she needed to get ahold of me, that’s it.' NJ residents in disbelief over White House answer on drones The Air Force vet is now fighting thyroid cancer. 'Our government knew that the area was contaminated. So knowing that, and they willfully put us there, that’s giving somebody a death sentence,' said Braswell. Pomp Braswell Hundreds of nuclear weapons tests were conducted in the area of the range from the 1950s to the early 1990s. In the 1970s, the government began exploring the idea of building a military installation there to house classified projects. A 1975 Environmental Report from the U.S. Energy Research &amp; Development Administration acknowledges nuclear contamination — depleted uranium, beryllium and plutonium — present before these men and women were sent by the government to the range. But the report adds, 'Discontinuing the work done … would be against the national interest.' Environmental Assessment TTR September 1977 (002) by mhobenexstar on Scribd 'It's one thing to be ignorant or to be naive to not know,' said Dave Crete. 'But they've understood for a long time.' The issue is that now, these veterans are telling NewsNation their claims are being denied by Veterans Affairs, their work so top secret that their records from the DOD are what’s called 'Data Masked,' as if they were never there. Many reported drone sightings were not drones: Ex-Navy pilot 'I feel pushed aside,' said Braswell. 'That our government has chosen to use national security as their excuse to not take care of the people who took care of them.' Crete has decided to go public despite risks he believes could be involved. He now runs The Invisible Enemy, a nonprofit fighting for government transparency, pushing for legislation that would provide medical treatment and compensation for military personnel and their families who were exposed to contamination at the Nevada Test and Training Range. Ripple effects: Sickened families Along with worries about their own health, many of these veterans carry something else: guilt. They fear they have also exposed their families, both through the genetic material they contributed and the contamination brought home on their boots and uniforms. They were routinely covered in dust from the range. ‘We were in the dirt all the time. I can recall the times where when we perspire, that our uniforms would turn kind of a yellowish orange,' said Nemcic. Mike Nemcic Nemcic says he and his fellow veterans would serve for days at a time on the base and then return home, handing their uniforms caked in dirt to their wives to launder. 'We would fly home with this stuff on us,' said Nemcic. 'The part that’s the most difficult is that there was someone who knew, or a group of people who knew that this could happen, and withheld that information — and then allowed us to basically poison our families and ourselves. That hurts. That hurts.' 'Everybody’s wives were having miscarriages,' said Dave Crete. 'And then you get the birth defects.' Dave’s wife, Aylin Crete, suffered three miscarriages. The couple says three of their four children have serious health issues. Their oldest son was born with a brain tumor and was later diagnosed with neurofibromatosis. 'It’s the worst. Those are the most innocent victims,' said Crete through tears. 'They have nothing to do with nothing. I went to work every day. And I did my job. And my kids suffer.' Jack the Ripper’s identity revealed after DNA match, historian says Nemcic believes he’s seen the ripple effects of his service in the health issues of his two children: a son who has a thickening of the walls of the heart and a daughter with breast cancer. Randy Groves, the USAF veteran who initially brought up his tumor at the reunion barbecue, says his wife miscarried twice while they were stationed there. 'Many wives were having miscarriages while there. We had two sons born with health issues. My youngest was born with a heart defect,' said Groves. 'I’m proud of my service to my country, but I feel we should’ve been told. Our country knew.' Randy Groves A mother’s dying act Jennifer Callahan Page says the contamination on the range 'took out my whole family.' Her father and grandfather both served for 10 and 20 years, respectively, and her mother worked on the range for 30 years as a civilian who was tasked with hiring guards for the test site. Page says she watched all three of them die. 'They're all gone. And that's my entire family. So I don't have anybody left,' said Page. She says her father died at 56 years old, with lungs that came back on imaging tests as 'infiltrated with white.' 'All of the stuff they were exposed to, the plutonium and uranium. It was ruining the pockets of their lungs,' said Page. 'Eighty percent of his lungs were filled. My father was my best friend. We talked daily. He called me sometimes several times a day just to say, ‘Hey, I got a great joke.’ And he’d laugh and say, ‘Love you,’ and hang up.' She moved her mother in with her in Las Vegas, with plans to travel the world and spend time with her grandkids. Then, her mother also got sick. 'About a month after she got here, we had to put her into the hospital. They found tumors and said her entire body cavity was filled,' said Page. 'She had Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She had already had a hysterectomy from cervical cancer and a mastectomy from breast cancer. They said there's no hope, and you just need to make your peace and say your goodbyes.' Audio from Titan submersible implosion released by NOAA Page says it was in hospice where she asked her mother how this happened — what occurred on the range? 'I sat at her bedside every day just holding her hand. She just said, ‘I knew I was exposed. And I knew someday I might need to prove where I was at and what I had done and what I was exposed to in order to get treatment.’ So she started collecting documents,' said Page. Her mother gave Page a cache of photographs that she had worked to get declassified before she retired. Page has given the cache to NewsNation so they can be seen by the public for the first time. 'There are pictures at the test site. There's pictures of the control rooms, and the range and what the entire map looks like, pictures of the vent holes and the main craters,' said Page. '[My mom] apologized to me, crying, saying, ‘I’m sorry I ever worked there. I know that’s what's killing me.’' Page recalls there was a sense of pride and fond memories growing up in a home where her family members did such important work. There was also a deep understanding of the secrecy, of the highly classified nature of their day-to-day activities on the range. 'When I was a little kid, I’d say, ‘Gosh, you know, everybody’s talking bout this spaceship,’ and [my grandfather] would go, ‘Oh yeah, we don’t talk about that.’ I learned very quickly not to ask questions,' said Page. Ohio reports first probable human case of bird flu Page describes the situation now, of the DOD continuing to refuse to acknowledge the veterans’ service on the range, as 'maddening.' 'They were there. They have badges. They have IDs that show where they were. How do you not cover that and just go nope, they weren’t there. No, they weren't exposed. That doesn't make it go away. It makes the suffering worse. That's compounding the issue,' said Page. 'The guy who cooked the cheeseburger in the chow hall is covered' The veterans say they are further confused by who the government has chosen to cover. The Department of Energy workers who worked alongside these veterans on the very same base, but often for fewer hours, are currently provided for. Under the 2000 EEOICPA Act signed by President Bill Clinton, DOE workers who had presumptive nuclear exposure at the exact same site were provided medical benefits, but the act does not cover veterans or DOD workers. 'The guy who cooked the cheeseburger in the chow hall for me is covered. If they've had problems, they have lifetime medical, and they've received financial compensation of up to $400,000. The guys that would go out and build the hangers that I had to guard have been compensated, and we can't be,' said Crete. 'The folks that work for the Department of Energy out there have been taken care of. You put us in a place that you knew would harm us. All we're asking for is the benefits that anybody exposed to the same things anywhere else would be entitled to.' NewsNation reached out to the Department of Defense for answers. We asked them about the 1975 Environmental Report and the veterans’ claims that their diseases are linked to contamination on the range. We also asked why DOE workers received coverage and compensation, but these veterans have not. What are Ukraine’s critical minerals and why does Trump want them? The DOD said they would not comment and referred us to the Air Force. The Air Force said, 'We don’t have any information available from that time frame.' NewsNation went to Veterans Affairs. The VA told us there is no presumptive exposure for these veterans who served at the range, and these veterans will need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to prove their illnesses are related to their service. The vets tell us this is difficult, if not impossible, when their data is masked. Their new fight: A path forward Dave Crete and the other veterans say their hope lies in legislation. His nonprofit, The Invisible Enemy, has been working with Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, hoping to pass a bill that would guarantee medical treatment and financial compensation to all military personnel who were sickened as a result of exposure to radiation and toxins on the NTTR. Moves toward legislation have been slow and have suffered several setbacks. Crete and the other veterans hope that by coming forward with their stories, the public will support their mission. Crete says time is of the essence. 'Yesterday, I added the 446th name to the memorial list. And we suspect that we probably know of about a third of the people that are dead who served up there,' said Crete. 'We did something important. We did good work. We changed things. … We don't deserve being ignored by saying we don't exist.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/area-51-veterans-cancer-dod-denies-they-were-there/	2025-02-13T16:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/cache006_8e7588.png?w=666
Egg prices are surging, so why are chicken prices stable?	(NewsNation) — A widespread bird flu outbreak has sent egg prices skyrocketing, but that doesn't mean chicken nuggets are about to get more expensive. That's because chickens that are raised for meat, known as 'broilers,' haven't been hit nearly as hard as egg-laying hens, and there's little overlap between the two. 'These are really two different paths and two different industries,' said David Anderson, a professor and extension economist at Texas A&amp;M University. Americans have surely noticed that difference at the grocery store. Egg prices soared more than 15% in January alone and are now up 53% from last year, according to the latest Labor Department data. Meanwhile, the price of chicken meat has hardly budged, up less than 1% from a year ago. Here's why egg-laying chickens have been more affected and where prices could go from here. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? Why aren't chicken prices surging? 'The simple answer is that it's a numbers game,' said Tom Super with the National Chicken Council, which represents the country's chicken producers. Of the more than 147 million birds affected by the outbreak over the past three years, less than 9% have been broilers, roughly 13 million, according to data from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Those 13 million broiler chickens represent just .0005% of broiler production over the same period, Super said. In other words: Chicken prices have remained stable because broiler producers have had an easier time keeping up with demand. Egg-laying chickens have fared much worse, accounting for more than 75% of all the birds affected by the outbreak between Feb. 8, 2022, and Jan. 29, 2025. Costco limits egg purchases: What are other stores doing? Why have egg-laying chickens been hit harder? Broiler chickens aren't immune to bird flu, but their shorter life cycle could leave flocks less susceptible to major outbreaks. Broilers are typically slaughtered within two months, whereas egg-layers take longer to mature and only start producing after four to five months. Once those hens start laying eggs, the cycle can last over a year. Less time on the farm means broilers have less of an opportunity to be exposed to the virus. 'I tend to think that's a pretty good explanation,' Anderson said. 'I don't know that anybody knows for sure.' The shorter life cycle also means that when a broiler flock is lost, it can be replaced faster. Is raising chickens the best way to combat egg prices? Geography matters, too. Broilers are primarily produced in the Southeast, which hasn't been as affected by the recent outbreak compared to major egg-producing states like Iowa and Ohio. Super said different housing styles could also be a factor. When a test comes back positive for bird flu, the whole flock gets culled to help prevent the spread of the virus, and egg-laying chickens are typically housed in larger flocks. For commercial operations, egg-laying barns can contain hundreds of thousands of chickens on multiple layers, whereas broiler houses, on average, hold about 25,000 birds on one level, Super said. Where will prices go from here? The bad news for consumers is that egg prices are expected to rise by 20% in 2025, according to the USDA. On the other hand, Anderson said the volatility of the egg market means prices could drop quickly if the bird flu outbreak subsides. In fact, that's exactly what happened a couple of years ago. In Jan. 2023, U.S. consumers were paying an average of $4.82 for a dozen eggs, but just six months later, in June, the average price had fallen to $2.22 per dozen. 'For lower prices, all we need is some time and the disease to quit happening,' Anderson said. In the meantime, businesses are taking steps to combat 'egg-flation.' Budget-friendly chain Waffle House has added a $0.50 per egg surcharge to all of its menus. Grocers like Costco and Trader Joe’s have also taken action, limiting the number of cartons customers can buy. As for chicken meat, the USDA predicts wholesale poultry prices will decrease by about 1% this year.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/egg-prices-chicken-prices/	2025-02-13T14:59:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-480207837-e1723408795963.jpg?w=800
How ICE tracks down criminal migrants	(NewsNation) — More than 1.4 million migrants who have previously been ordered to leave the country are among those being targeted for apprehension by federal immigration officials as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation mission. As federal officials seek to ramp arrests, increased collaboration between Immigration Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement agencies, including criminal investigators within the Internal Revenue Service, is changing how migrants with criminal backgrounds are found and taken into federal custody. Border czar Tom Homan in NYC to meet with Mayor Eric Adams Former Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila said devoting more bodies to the nationwide search moves agencies closer to achieving higher levels of national security. 'It’s becoming a well-oiled machine,' he told NewsNation. What areas are ICE targeting? The biggest hotbeds for the 1.46 million targeted migrants include Miami (156,559), Los Angeles (143,672) and New York (134,645), according to data obtained exclusively by NewsNation from the Department of Homeland Security. Atlanta was the only other region where more than 100,000 migrants who had been previously ordered to leave the U.S. were found to be living. Although federal agencies know where these migrants are located, making arrests requires complicated investigations by ICE’s 25 regional field offices. Avila told NewsNation that the operations are 'methodical' and that contrary to public opinion, agents are not looking to apprehend innocent people, which has been among the complaints lodged by officials in sanctuary cities and within migrant advocacy groups. 'They’re not randomly looking (and saying), ‘You look Hispanic – I’m going to come get you,’' the former HSI special agent said. How ICE makes arrests The agency accesses numerous databases, including commercial databases, motor vehicle and driver’s records as well as utility records to locate 'removable non-citizens,' according to ICE's website. Each of ICE’s field offices works from informational packets that are generated by officers working within that agency’s 'criminal alien program.' Agents assigned to that team use databases and information from state or local law enforcement and court dockets to compile target lists for that region. Data is also collected by statewide offices of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which provide information for informational packets. The order in which migrants are sought after can be determined by a variety of factors, including the age of a migrant’s case, that person’s criminal history or the type of crimes that particular office may be targeting, such as sex offenses or other violent crimes.

(Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Data compiled by the Migration Policy Institute shows that the majority of migrant arrests are custodial, meaning that ICE takes migrants who were already in the pipeline after being arrested or identified by state or local law enforcement. In 2024, custodial cases resulted in the majority of the 113,431 arrests that were made by ICE, the agency’s annual report states. Jury hands Megan Boswell life sentence after guilty verdict Comparatively, 33,243 arrests fell into the 'at-large' category, meaning that migrants were located while living in communities around the country. That job falls to local ICE agents who are now partnering with organizations such as the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies who are tasked with taking criminal migrants into custody. 'This is a good thing,' Avila said of the collaboration. 'It reminds everyone in federal law enforcement that you all actually play on the same team. You may happen to have different insignias and different letters in front of your names, but we’re all on the same team combating the same thing.' Surveillance operations can often last days and sometimes weeks, John Fabbricatore, the former director of ICE’s Denver Field Office, told NewsNation. He said agents use residential and automobile information to help agents locate targeted migrants. How ICE works in ‘sanctuary cities’ Because sanctuary cities like Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles prohibit their police departments from cooperating with immigration enforcement, federal agents must often work on their own to make arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson touted the creation of the Reparations Task Force to develop a Black Reparations Agenda at a city ceremony to raise the Juneteenth flag on June 17, 2024. Some lawmakers working within sanctuary cities fear that resistance to working with ICE can lead to bigger problems. 'It’s outrageous that we allow and give cover to those kind of individuals,' Chicago Alderperson Raymond Lopez told NewsNation. Lopez was one of two Chicago alderpersons who tried to change the city's sanctuary city law, which was soundly defeated by the city council. He said that a city’s sanctuary laws also allow communities to protect those ICE is searching for, making tracking migrants on the dockets even more difficult. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has repeatedly said that although migrant criminals are the target of the mass deportation efforts, other immigrants who entered the country illegally may be swept up if they are found in the company of those being sought. Once Trump took office, restrictions on sensitive locations such as schools, houses of worship and hospitals were lifted, giving federal agents more room to work. Opponents of the ICE raids maintain that the agent’s mere presence in local communities has struck fear among local residents. 'What this administration is attempting to do is to get us to surrender our humanity,' Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told reporters after Homan visited the city when ICE conducted raids. 'We're not going to do that in Chicago.' Despite the marching orders ICE receives, Fabbricatore argued there are still rules that need to be followed. 'It’s all about safety and about being humane. We’re not stacking these people in warehouses,' he told NewsNation, adding, 'The American public doesn’t understand that. They think you arrest an illegal alien, and you’re just giving them the boot across the border. It doesn’t happen that way.'

Trump meeting with India PM Modi, expected to talk tariffs	(NewsNation) — India Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with Donald Trump at the White House on the same day the president signed a memorandum proposing reciprocal tariffs. Modi and Trump have had a good relationship and have been allies to a certain extent. However, India is a country that the United States operates at a trade deficit with. That issue, as well as tariffs, could come up during their discussions Thursday. Before speaking with Trump, Modi met separately with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a Trump administration official, and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Trump’s buyout offer accepted by about 77,000 federal workers Trump has already imposed tariffs on China and threatened them against Canada and Mexico. On Monday, he expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum initially imposed during his first term. The president has repeatedly dubbed India a 'tariff king.' In response, New Delhi has shown a willingness to buy more American oil while lowering its own tariffs on U.S. goods, including on some Harley-Davidson motorcycles, from 50% to 40%. India also dropped retaliatory tariffs on United States almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts in 2023. According to the Associated Press, the Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totaled around $190.1 billion in 2023. U.S. exports to India were worth nearly $70 billion and imports $120 billion.

Live: Trump announces reciprocal tariffs	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is planning to announce new tariffs Thursday, according to a post on Truth Social. The president did not specify what he meant by reciprocal tariffs. He has already made tariffs a major element of his economic policy despite warnings from economists that tariffs will increase inflation and harm American consumers. Trump has already levied a 10% tariff on China and put a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel, with some exemptions for trading partners. China, in response, put tariffs on an array of American goods, with impacts disproportionately targeted toward areas that voted for Trump in the election. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? He also proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico but paused both tariffs after the countries agreed to take action toward controlling the borders. The pause is set to end in March, raising the possibility the tariffs will go into effect then. Canada has already threatened to take action in response to tariffs, with sellers previously pulling American alcohol from shelves and catalogs in response to the initial announcement. While Trump has described tariffs as a tax on foreign companies, the tariffs are paid by the importing company and economists say the cost is usually passed on to the consumer. Ohio reports first probable human case of bird flu The move is likely to raise the price of goods when Americans are already struggling. Trump has admitted there will be economic pain associated with the policies. Already inflation, which had been trending downward, has increased since Trump took office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-announce-reciprocal-tariffs/	2025-02-13T09:37:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771_734cd3.jpg?w=900
Senate panel advances nomination of Kash Patel, Trump's pick to l...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to advance the nomination of Kash Patel, Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, pushing past Democratic concerns that he would operate as a loyalist for the president and target perceived adversaries of the White House. The committee voted 12-10 to send the nomination to the Republican-controlled Senate for full consideration. It was not immediately clear when the final confirmation vote will occur, but so far even nominees once seen as having uncertain prospects — including new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence — have been able to marshal sufficient support from Republicans eager to fall in line with Trump's agenda. Patel has raised alarm for his lack of management experience compared to other FBI directors and because of a vast catalog of incendiary past statements, which include calling investigators who scrutinized Trump 'government gangsters' and describing at least some defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S Capitol as 'political prisoners.' At his confirmation hearing last month, Patel said Democrats were taking some of his comments out of context or misunderstanding the broader point that he was trying to make, such as when he proposed shutting down the FBI headquarters in Washington and turning it into a museum for the so-called 'deep state.' And Patel denied the idea that a list in his book of government officials, who he said were part of a 'deep state,' amounted to an 'enemies list,' calling that a 'total mischaracterization.' Patel, who was selected by Trump in November to replace Christopher Wray as FBI director, would inherit an agency riven by turmoil amid the recent forced departures of a group of senior executives and by a highly unusual Justice Department demand for the names of all agents who participated in investigations related to Jan. 6. A letter this week from Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the committee, cited undisclosed sources in saying that Patel was covertly involved in that process despite telling the panel at his confirmation hearing that he was unaware of any plans to fire agents. A Patel spokeswoman called the allegations 'gossip' aimed at pushing what she said was a 'false narrative.' Democrats portrayed Patel as a dangerous and inexperienced loyalist who would abuse the FBI's law enforcement powers at a time when the country is facing an escalated threat including from China and international terrorism. 'This is a guy whose judgment is beyond questionable. It’s appallingly bad,' said Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He added: 'Mark my words: this Patel guy will come back to haunt you.' Durbin told his colleagues 'we are inviting a political disaster if we put Kash Patel into this job.' Addressing Republicans on the committee, Durbin said, 'I know you want to vote for all these nominations. I know none of you want a call from Elon Musk reminding you what he might do to somebody who votes the wrong way, but this really gets down to the heart of the future of an agency that is critical to the security of this nation.' Republicans, by contrast, praised Patel as the right person for the job, insisting he was needed to fix an FBI that they claim has been tainted by bias amid criminal investigations into Trump. 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, tiers of treatment and two tiers of justice. And during the Biden years, this was writ large in the acts of the DOJ and the FBI,' said GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. GOP Sen. Ashley Moody of Florida said that Patel 'might not have served in the upper echelons of the FBI, but aren’t we asking this agency to set a new course? Don’t we want a nontraditional candidate at this moment in time, with extensive federal experience?' A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel attracted Trump's attention during his first term when, as a staffer on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, he helped author a memo with pointed criticism of the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Patel later joined Trump's administration, both as a counterterrorism official at the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the Defense Department.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-senate-panel-advances-nomination-of-kash-patel-trumps-pick-to-lead-the-fbi/	2025-02-13T08:39:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67ae20ca032186.84028760.jpeg?w=900
Linda McMahon faces confirmation hearing before Senate committee	(NewsNation) — Linda McMahon will go in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to seek approval to lead the Department of Education — which President Donald Trump has said he wants to abolish. Closing the Department of Education is an issue Trump campaigned on in the 2024 election, and he has said it was infiltrated by 'radicals, zealots and Marxists.' 'I told Linda, ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,’' Trump previously said, adding he would like to end the department through executive order, NewsNation partner The Hill writes. Trump’s buyout offer accepted by about 77,000 federal workers The Department of Education sends billions of dollars a year to schools, manages a $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and enforces civil rights in education. It would also require an act of Congress to shut down the department. In their statements introducing McMahon, Republican Senators Tim Scott and Katie Britt criticized the department. 'For far too long, the department of education has catered to far left bureaucrats at the expense of moms and dads,' Britt said. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim said in a letter to McMahon this week that she'll be asked if she supports Trump's plans, and what she will do to carry them out, The Associated Press reported. According to the AP, this letter asks McMahon to commit to preserving the department’s student loan operations and civil rights office, among other programs. It also mentions her lack of experience in the education sphere. Formerly the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon is also likely to face questions over a lawsuit stating that she and her husband, Vince, ignored rampant abuse of so-called 'ring boys' by ringside announcer Melvin Phillips Jr. in the 1980s and 1990s. The alleged assaults were sexual in nature, the suit alleges. McMahon previously was the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is holding a hearing Thursday morning looking into what GOP leadership has called the 'betrayal' of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The panel comes as President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by billionaire Elon Musk, has set its sights on overhauling the federal agency amid its crackdown of government spending. The administration's perceived efforts to dismantle USAID have sparked criticism across the board, with a group of House Democrats earlier this week unveiling legislation to stop the move. Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, seemingly gave a thumbs up to placing USAID under the State Department's purview, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio was named the acting leader. 'After receiving formal consultation about the State Department’s potential reorganization of USAID, I’m excited to work with President Trump and Secretary Rubio to fix our broken foreign assistance system,' he wrote last week in a statement. William Steiger, former chief of staff at USAID under Trump's first term, is among the witness list. Thursday's hearing is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. EST.

Leavitt defends Trump's federal worker buyout program	(NewsNation) — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the Trump administration’s federal buyout program Thursday and said more than 77,000 federal workers have accepted an offer that will save taxpayers money. 'We are saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars with this buyout,' Leavitt told NewsNation's 'Morning in America' on Thursday. 'We are saving taxpayers money at the end of the day. This is going to make our government more efficient.' The deferred resignation offer deadline was reached at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday, after U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. The buyout offer gives those who choose to resign eight months of pay and benefits. IRS workers involved in 2025 tax season can’t take buyout until after the taxpayer filing deadline Leavitt previously called the program the 'first of many legal wins' for President Donald Trump. Time for US government to run as a business: Leavitt on DOGE Trump will reveal some of the Department of Government Efficiency's findings in a Thursday news conference, Leavitt said. 'This is long overdue. It's about time that our federal government runs like a business, just like every other small business and large business in our country has to look at money in, money out. It's a common-sense solution,' she said. The remarks come amid DOGE's launch of 'a war on waste' and plans to reshape the federal government. Trump claimed Tuesday that DOGE has uncovered tens of billions of dollars in fraud and abuse, blaming bad government contracts. Leavitt highlighted federal agencies likely to be eradicated, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Education, after DOGE has completed its investigations. Trump administration working to drive down inflation Leavitt also said the Trump administration is working to put more money in Americans' pockets and drive down prices, adding that Trump has already taken significant steps to do so. What does January’s inflation report mean for me? 'Number one, he signed an executive order to launch a massive deregulatory campaign. We know more regulation leads to higher inflation,' she said. 'The president is also committed to historic tax cuts, which will ultimately put more money back into the pockets of the American people.' Leavitt's remarks follow new data from the Labor Department, which shows the consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago. It is the fourth consecutive increase in the annual inflation rate since September, when it fell to 2.4%. Leavitt said Thursday’s inflation report was 'not a surprise' and is proof the 'Biden administration left us with a mess.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/leavitt-defends-trumps-federal-worker-buyout/	2025-02-13T05:19:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/snapshot-2025-02-13T071116.662.jpg?w=884

Pope Francis encourages South Texas nun to help the unfortunate	SAN JUAN, Texas (Border Report) -- Fresh off her trip to the Vatican, Sister Norma Pimentel says she is heartened by a recent letter from Pope Francis condemning the deportation of immigrants. 2 top ICE officials reassigned amid White House’s frustrations over immigration arrests In his letter to U.S. bishops, the pope called the mass deportations a 'major crisis that is taking place in the United States.' President Donald Trump has promised his administration will deport millions of immigrants who he says have no right to remain in the country. 'The rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality,' the pope wrote. Pope Francis did say countries have a right 'to defend itself and keep communities safe from those who have committed violent or serious crimes while in the country or prior to arrival.' But he added 'the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness.' Pimentel, who is executive director of Catholic Charities Rio Grande Valley, told Border Report that she recently traveled to the Vatican and was among a group who met with the pope. She said he encouraged them to help the unfortunate. Gangs not only ones preying on migrant women, boys 'We cannot criminalize, as our Holy Father says, an immigrant for coming to our country fearing for the lives of their children and wanting to be in a space where they're safe. You know that’s not a crime,' Pimentel told Border Report on Wednesday from her offices in San Juan, Texas. 'We should be able to create pathways where people can actually be welcome.'

It is a migrant shelter where over half a million immigrants have gone for food, shelter, toiletries and travel help after being legally released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 10th anniversary of Humanitarian Respite Center coincides with new asylum rules 'Every single person that we help at the Respite Center has been processed by Border Patrol actually has permission to be in the United States. They have a document that gives them permission temporarily, but until they can resolve their legal status. And so people that we receive are actually those that are in the system,' she said. However, she says lately there have been days when the Border Patrol doesn't send anybody. 'If nobody's brought to us, our numbers are basically almost zero,' she said. 'We do have one, three families that maybe one day arrive, and the next day nobody, and then the next day maybe one family. So it's very uncertain right now as to who we're receiving, you know, and and how many.' She says the Rio Grande Valley border community also is fearful of deportations and raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. She also told Border Report an immigrant woman was arrested as she tried to pick up her child from school on this week in the Rio Grande Valley. She said on Wednesday she was called by a local priest who said his parishioner was arrested while picking her child up from school. 'I just got a call from a priest from here, from the Valley, and he said, ‘Norma, help me. There's a family from our parish that went to pick up her child at the elementary school, and she was arrested,'' Pimentel told Border Report. Pimentel would not specify the priest or where this happened but she said she wants to help community leaders to prepare legal documents to pass on custody of children in the cases of parents being deported from the South Texas border. Pimentel said the child's mother asked that her child be handed over to school staff but was told they couldn't because they didn't have a legal documents to authorize that. 'So, I said, 'Father, I'm going to try to see what I can do to help your families.' If there's anyone that needs some kind of a legal document to give somebody, you know, we have to be there for our families.' Pimentel was heading to New York on Wednesday to participate in a meeting on immigration.

Stars flee Kennedy Center groups after Trump seizes chair	President Donald Trump’s ascension to chair of the Kennedy Center on Wednesday led to multiple departures from the Washington, D.C., institution. Trump last week announced he was replacing several members of the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and would name himself chair. On Wednesday, the new board elected Trump as chair of the board. At approximately the same time that Trump announced his chairmanship, musician Ben Folds said he would resign as artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra, 'given developments at the Kennedy Center.' 'It’s been a wonderful 8 years' the former Ben Folds Five singer wrote on Instagram on Wednesday, saying he and the Kennedy Center’s staff encouraged 'thousands of fresh new audiences to appreciate symphonic music.' Trump made millions on meme coin, over 800K people lost money: Report The award-winning opera singer and actress Renée Fleming said she would depart from her role as artistic adviser at large to the Kennedy Center. She praised David Rubenstein, whom Trump replaced as chair, saying his leadership is 'just one of the many ways he has contributed to America’s cultural and historic heritage. He is the greatest patriot I know.' Fleming also praised Deborah Rutter, whom the board fired Wednesday as president of the Kennedy Center, saying she 'has been a tireless, creative leader, successfully expanding our National Center for the Arts in visionary ways.' 'They have both been an inspiration to me; and out of respect, I think it right to depart as well,' Fleming continued. 'I’ve treasured the bi-partisan support for this institution as a beacon of America at our best. I hope the Kennedy Center continues to flourish and serve the passionate and diverse audience in our nation’s capital and across the country.' Shonda Rhimes, the renowned television writer and producer, also reportedly resigned from the board after serving as the Kennedy Center’s treasurer. Ted Nugent praises Trump’s deportations: ‘This is war’ 'Please be advised that as of today, Shonda Rhimes has resigned from the board of the Kennedy Center,' a spokesperson for Rhimes told Deadline. The Hill has reached out to her representation for comment. Trump said Wednesday it is a 'Great Honor' to serve as chair of the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees, saying on social media, 'We will make The Kennedy Center a very special and exciting place!' A White House official told The Hill the president participated in the board meeting on Wednesday to elect him. The Kennedy Center confirmed Trump as its board chair in a Wednesday news release, saying that and other leadership changes were 'effectively immediately.' 'The Board also terminated Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter’s contract and announced Richard Grenell as interim Kennedy Center President,' it said in its statement. Some of the board’s new members include 'God Bless the USA' singer and ardent Trump supporter Lee Greenwood, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, second lady Usha Vance and senior adviser Dan Scavino, among others. —Judy Kurtz contributed	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/stars-flee-kennedy-center-trump-chair/	2025-02-13T03:45:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/MixCollage-12-Feb-2025-07-29-PM-8152.jpg?w=900
Trump’s buyout offer accepted by about 75,000 federal workers	(NewsNation) — Approximately 75,000 federal employees have accepted a 'deferred resignation' offer spearheaded by the Trump administration as it looks to reduce the federal workforce. The Office of Personnel Management confirmed the final buyout tally to NewsNation after the offer's deadline was reached at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday. The tally, which includes less than 4% of the federal workforce, is short of the 5 to 10% goal laid out by the White House. McLaurine Pinover, a spokesperson for the OPM, told NewsNation they're pleased the court rejected the effort to strike down the program. 'There is no longer any doubt: the Deferred Resignation Program was both legal and a valuable option for federal employees. This program was carefully designed, thoroughly vetted, and provides generous benefits so federal workers can plan for their futures,' Pinover said. While White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calls this the 'first of many legal wins' for Trump, another group of unions looking to stall the buyout effort filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C. late Wednesday. Judge clears way for federal worker buyouts On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. O'Toole had extended the deadline for federal employees to decide whether to accept the buyout, which gives employees eight months of pay and benefits if they resign. Attorney general: US sues New York officials over immigration enforcement In his ruling, O’Toole found unions that had sued over the directive did not have standing. The decision allows the Trump administration to enforce the deadline, which was originally planned for Feb. 6. That deadline was extended as O’Toole weighed a bid by unions to temporarily block the OPM from carrying out the offer entirely. Union workers cautioned against buyout Unions had warned employees against taking the deal and Democrats warned the government would fail to uphold its commitment. They cautioned that with government funding set to expire in March, their pay and benefits could be at risk. The move has sparked protests in Washington and across the nation. The buyout is part of President Donald Trump’s aim to reduce the federal workforce and aligns with plans to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of the administration’s efforts to dismantle USAID.

Hamas says it will release more Israeli hostages as planned	CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Thursday it would release the next group of Israeli hostages as planned, apparently resolving a major dispute that threatened the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The militant group said Egyptian and Qatari mediators have affirmed that they will work to 'remove all hurdles,' and that it would implement the ceasefire deal. The statement indicated three more Israeli hostages would be freed Saturday. There was no immediate comment from Israel after Hamas’ announcement. A look at the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, by the numbers Hamas' move would allow the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to continue for now, but its future remains in doubt. Hamas had threatened to delay the next release of Israeli hostages, accusing Israel of failing to meet its obligations to allow in tents and shelters, among other alleged violations of the truce. Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, had threatened to renew its offensive if hostages were not freed. Hamas said its delegation held talks in Cairo with Egyptian officials and was in contact with Qatar’s prime minister about increasing the entry of shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble into Gaza. Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV, which is close to the country’s security services, reported that Egypt and Qatar had succeeded in resolving the dispute. The two Arab countries have served as key mediators with Hamas and helped broker the ceasefire, which took effect in January, 15 months into the war.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-says-it-will-release-hostages-as-planned-apparently-resolving-ceasefire-dispute/	2025-02-13T02:35:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67adca0df21324.78523278.jpeg?w=900
Sununu laughs off on-air jab from Anderson Cooper	(NewsNation) — Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu is laughing off a jab from CNN anchor Anderson Cooper after a debate got heated on air. The two were discussing the controversial Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire Elon Musk and a team of young programmers. President Donald Trump has tasked DOGE with auditing federal agencies and the amount of access afforded to the team has led to lawsuits and injunctions. During the conversation, Cooper said 'Don't be a d---' under his breath. The host apologized for the comment later. Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE? Sununu told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo he doesn't take offense at the remark. 'I had six, I thought, really funny comebacks, but I thought it would get out of hand,' Sununu said. The former governor told NewsNation he saw the conversation as similar to a political argument between friends having a beer. 'I think he almost just forgot the camera was on because the conversation was just getting a little bit casual,' Sununu said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/sununu-laughs-off-jab-anderson-cooper/	2025-02-12T18:55:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/06/Sununu_111523_AP_Phelan-M-Ebenhack.jpg?w=900
Attorney general: US sues New York officials over immigration enf...	WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has sued New York state officials over alleged failures to enforce federal immigration law, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters on Wednesday. Bondi said the lawsuit, which also names New York Governor Kathy Hochul, Attorney General Letitia James and the state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) head Mark Schroeder, takes aim at a 'green light law' that allows people who are living in the country illegally to obtain driver's licenses in New York. The department did not immediately release a copy of the lawsuit or any other documents providing details, and Reuters could not immediately locate a copy of the lawsuit in any of the federal courts in New York or Washington. Trump reverses Biden-era restrictions on appliances Bondi said the law limits the state's ability to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement because it contains a 'tip-off provision' that requires the state's DMV to inform someone when federal immigration officials request his or her information. 'This is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans,' Bondi told reporters. 'New York has chosen to prioritize illegal aliens over American citizens.' The lawsuit comes just days after the Justice Department sued Illinois over immigration enforcement. Judge won’t halt Trump, Musk federal worker buyout program In the Illinois case, the department targeted a so-called sanctuary law known as the TRUST Act, saying the law interferes with federal immigration enforcement and violates the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. That clause states that federal law preempts state and local laws that may conflict with it. 'We did it to Illinois. Strike one. Strike two is New York, and if you're a state not complying with federal law? You're next,' Bondi said. The lawsuits are the latest actions by the administration of President Donald Trump to step up immigration enforcement. Prior to Bondi's confirmation, the department issued a memo to all federal prosecutors ordering them to prioritize immigration cases and to even criminally probe state and local officials who resist such efforts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/attorney-general-sues-new-york-officials-immigration/	2025-02-12T16:19:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/gettyimages-2198561415-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Judge won't halt Trump, Musk federal worker buyout program	A federal judge declined to further pause a federal government buyout program, enabling the government to forge ahead with its 'Fork in the Road' program. U.S. District Court Judge George O’Toole had extended the time frame for federal employees to decide whether to take the unusual offer, which gives employees eight months of pay and benefits if they wish to depart government. Democrats target Musk in first DOGE hearing on ‘war on waste’ In a Wednesday ruling, O’Toole found that the unions who had sued over the directive did not have standing to do so. 'The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork Directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees. This is not sufficient,' O’Toole wrote. The decision allows the Trump administration to close a window to accept the deal that the government originally planned to end on Feb. 6. That deadline was extended while O’Toole weighed a bid by unions to temporarily block the Office of Personnel Management from carrying out the program entirely. The White House previously said at least 40,000 federal employees had taken the deal, roughly 2 percent of the 2 million federal workers. While O’Toole’s ruling spells trouble for the broader challenge from unions to the buyout program, he did not otherwise delve deeply into the legal arguments presented by them in determining they did not have standing. Unions have cautioned employees against taking the offer. Numerous provisions in the accompanying contract contradict promises made by OPM, leaving unclear whether employees will not have to report to work and will be free to seek outside employment as the agency has claimed. Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE? The offer also comes with legal and logistical challenges. The government is currently only funded through March, raising concerns over whether funding needed to back commitments to employees will materialize. That dynamic could violate the Antideficiency Act, which bars the government from spending beyond what is dictated in its budget and requires it to use federal funding as intended. OPM and the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions suing over the deal, did not immediately respond to request for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-worker-buyout-program/	2025-02-12T15:26:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25034695240560_27d640.jpg?w=900
Nonviolent, low risk migrants being sent to Guantanamo Bay	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration is not just detaining violent gang members and high-threat migrants in Guantanamo Bay, they are also holding nonviolent migrants in the high-security facility, NewsNation has learned. A senior Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to NewsNation that 'low risk' migrants are being held at the facility and that all have a final deportation order. 'All these individuals committed a crime by entering the United States illegally,' the official said. Federal prisons being used to detain people arrested in Trump’s immigration crackdown High risk detainees, including criminals, are being detained in the base's maximum-security prison, while other migrants with final removal orders are being held in the Migrant Operations Center. The president in late January signed a memo directing the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to prepare a 30,000-person migrant facility at Guantánamo Bay, a facility in Cuba that has been used to house military prisoners, including several al Qaeda operatives linked to the 9/11 attacks. Trump initially said it would house only the 'worst' migrants and 'provide additional detention space for high priority criminal aliens.' Since announcing the move, the Pentagon has transported less than 100 detainees to Guantanamo Bay and there have been eight flights in eight days, according to the official. While Defense Department and Homeland Security officials have worked to put the infrastructure in place to meet the demands of Trump’s order, officials have been less clear about the long-term prospects of using Guantánamo Bay as a migrant facility.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/nonviolent-low-risk-migrants-guantanamo-bay/	2025-02-12T11:56:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6762eee7404f61.88475748.jpeg?w=900

Alexander Vinnik, a convicted Russian criminal, is being freed as part of a swap that saw Moscow’s release of American Marc Fogel, two U.S. officials confirmed Wednesday.

MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin said Wednesday that a Russian citizen was freed in the United States in exchange for Moscow’s release of American Marc Fogel, but refused to identify him until he arrives in Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the unidentified individual would return to Russia 'in the coming days,' and his name would be revealed when he returns home — unlike during past prisoner exchanges between Moscow and Washington, when Russians and Americans were released simultaneously and their identities were revealed right away. 'Recently, work has been intensified through the relevant agencies, there have been contacts,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'And these contacts have led to the release of Fogel, as well as one of the citizens of the Russian Federation, who is currently being held in custody in the United States. This citizen of the Russian Federation will also be returned to Russia in the coming days.' US defense chief Hegseth calls NATO membership for Ukraine unrealistic Asked by reporters if the Russian released as part of the deal could be Alexander Vinnik, Peskov said that the name of the man being freed would be announced upon his return. Vinnik, arrested in 2017 in Greece at the request of the U.S. on cryptocurrency fraud charges. was later extradited to the United States where he pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov demurred when asked to elaborate on the deal that led to Fogel's release, saying that such contacts 'love silence' and deploring that Washington rushed to announce Fogel's release. 'Our American colleagues have chosen to announce the results, we have a different approach to the agreements reached,' he said. 'For efficient diplomacy, we prefer to observe confidentiality agreements.' Fogel, an American history teacher who was deemed wrongfully detained by Russia, has been released and was returned to the U.S. on Tuesday in what the White House described as a diplomatic thaw that could advance negotiations to end the fighting in Ukraine. Fogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for U.S. President Donald Trump, left Russia with Fogel and brought him to the White House, where Trump greeted him. Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was expected to be reunited with his family. Trump declined to say if he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Fogel and didn't say what the United States provided in exchange for Fogel’s release. Russia releases imprisoned American Marc Fogel in what US calls a step toward the end of Ukraine war Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump suggested that Fogel's release could help anchor a peace deal on Ukraine, saying: 'We were treated very nicely by Russia, actually. I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war.' The Kremlin was more cautious, but it also noted that the deal could help strengthen mutual trust. 'Such agreements can hardly serve as a turning point, but they are little steps toward building mutual confidence, which is at its lowest level,' Peskov said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-russian-citizen-freed-in-us-in-exchange-for-moscows-release-of-american-marc-fogel/	2025-02-12T09:08:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66d0d9924ff640.92504182.jpeg?w=900
Senate confirms Gabbard to serve as nation’s top intelligence chi...	The Senate voted largely along party lines Wednesday to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to serve as the director of national intelligence, the nation’s top intelligence official, despite strong objections from Democrats and initial misgivings from Republicans who questioned her experience and judgment. The 52-48 vote caps two months of deliberations in the Senate over whether Gabbard, a former House Democrat from Hawaii, is qualified to lead the nation’s 18 intelligence agencies and prepare President Trump’s daily intelligence brief. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was the only GOP 'no' vote. Republican senators had raised concerns about her views of the expanded surveillance authority granted by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which Gabbard sought to repeal when she served in the House, and her past statements about deposed Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Democratic and Republican senators, including Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), grilled Gabbard about whether she viewed former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden as a traitor. She refused to call him that, despite his theft of 1.5 million classified documents, which left Republican senators frustrated. Republican senators also said Gabbard struggled to answer their questions in their private meetings, and some GOP lawmakers, notably Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), initially questioned whether she had really come to accept and support the powers authorized by FISA’s Section 702, which provides about 60 percent of the intelligence in the president’s daily brief. Yet, Republicans rallied behind Gabbard in recent weeks thanks to the intervention of Vice President Vance, who helped reassure Young about her nomination, and the steadfast support of Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Gabbard is seen as a 'disruptor' in the mold of other Trump nominees, such as Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed last month to lead the Pentagon. Trump allies say she will shake up the nation’s intelligence community, which they claim has become 'weaponized' against Trump. Trump allies have repeatedly pointed to the open letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials who claimed that a report about incriminating information found on Hunter Biden’s laptop during the 2020 presidential campaign was likely the product of a 'Russian influence operation.' Vance held multiple conversations with Young, a former Marine intelligence officer, between Gabbard’s rocky confirmation hearing and her vote in committee. Every Republican on the Intelligence panel voted to send her nomination to the floor, giving it strong momentum. That set up a 52-46 vote Monday to tee up a final confirmation vote, with all Republicans present voting to advance her. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) hailed Gabbard as a 'patriot, motivated by service' who has served her country and community since age 21 when she was elected to the Hawaii state Legislature. 'Tulsi Gabbard has worn the uniform of our country for the last 22 years, leading American soldiers in some of the most dangerous parts of the world,' he said, also noting her eight years of service in Congress as a member of the House Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees. Democrats argued that Gabbard is not qualified to serve as the nation’s top intelligence boss and has shown tremendous lapses in judgment by disputing a finding by the U.S. intelligence community that Assad, the former Syrian president, had used chemical weapons against his own people and by echoing Putin’s rationale for invading Ukraine. 'By any objective measure and by every objective measure as well, she is not qualified. From the moment she was nominated, both Democrats and Republicans were puzzled by the choice,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) said on the floor before her vote. 'Of all people Donald Trump could have picked to oversee national intelligence, he picked someone known for repeating Russian propaganda and getting duped by conspiracy theories,' he said. Schumer said Gabbard would likely only get 10 votes in the Senate if her confirmation vote was held by secret ballot. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, said Gabbard had 'demonstrated she’s not up to the task' of representing tens of thousands of intelligence officials around the world, pointing to her support of Assad’s claim that he didn’t use chemical weapons despite U.S. intelligence findings to the contrary. He argued that she 'knowingly met with the Syrian cleric who threatened to conduct serial bomb attacks against the United States' and 'sought to blame the United States and NATO' for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, by asserting the Biden administration failed to take seriously Putin’s concern about Ukraine joining NATO. Republican senators have come under tremendous pressure to support Trump’s most controversial nominees, such as Gabbard, Hegseth, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom the Senate will vote on this week to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday called Gabbard’s nomination 'part of a pattern of unilateral disarmament by the Trump administration against Russia.' He cited a Washington Post article from November that reported Gabbard’s appointment as head of national intelligence had 'elicited the most excitement in Russia because she has long been regarded as a darling of the propagandist Russian R.T. network.' 'Russian TV has called Ms. Gabbard ‘our friend Tulsi.’ [A] Russian newspaper published an op-ed, and it was titled the CIA and FBI are trembling [that] Trump protégé Tulsi Gabbard will support Russia,' he said on the floor. But Cotton, one of the most respected voices on national security in the Senate GOP conference, pushed back on criticism and warned colleagues at her confirmation hearing not to question her patriotism or integrity. 'Let me remind everyone that Ms. Gabbard has served in our Army for more than two decades, she has multiple combat tours, and she still wears the uniform today. She has undergone five FBI background checks,' he said at the start of her hearing. One of the biggest obstacles to Gabbard’s nomination was her sponsorship of legislation during her final year in the House to repeal FISA’s Section 702, which grants intelligence agencies broad powers to eavesdrop on foreign targets. Gabbard in past called the expanded authority an 'overreach.' But she changed her characterization of the law in private meetings with GOP senators, explaining that her position had changed because of reforms made to the program. Lankford, a member of the Intelligence panel, told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' last month that he decided to support Gabbard after she clarified to him that she would now support Section 702 authority in light of recent changes. She pledged to maintain the program, calling it a 'vital' national security tool.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-confirms-gabbard-to-serve-as-nations-top-intelligence-chief/	2025-02-12T08:54:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Leadding-Gabbard_013025_AP_John-McDonnell.jpg?w=900
US defense chief Hegseth calls NATO membership for Ukraine unreal...	BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and in sweeping remarks suggested that the way forward for Ukraine was for the country to abandon hopes of a return to its pre-2014 borders and prepare for a negotiated settlement with Russia — one that should be backed up with an international force of troops. Hegseth made the comments Wednesday during the first trip to NATO and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group by a member of the new Trump administration. Allies have been waiting to hear how much continued military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine’s government. What they heard was that President Donald Trump is intent on getting Europe to assume the majority of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine — to include a possible peacekeeping force that would not include U.S. troops — and that Hegseth said should not have Article Five protections if those troops end up in contact with Russian forces.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine’s government. Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth’s predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022. Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States. No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called. Hegseth wasn’t expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine. His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won’t stop at Ukraine’s borders if he wins, and that Europe’s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He’s complained that it’s costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.

On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine’s security going forward. Washington’s 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump’s new administration has in store for the world’s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn’t meet NATO guidelines for military spending. NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it’s one that Ukraine is trying to secure. Ukraine’s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product. However, a third of members still haven’t reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far — not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year. Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn’t commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and 'should not go lower than 3 percent.' Audio from Titan submersible implosion released by NOAA He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that 'we live in fiscally constrained times' and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense. NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26. ___ Lolita C.

Fogel release a sign of Trump, Putin's 'great friendship': Witkof...	(NewsNation) — Special envoy Steve Witkoff said the return of American Marc Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since 2021, could be a sign of the future working relationship between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump and Putin had a 'great friendship, and I think now it's going to continue,' Witkoff told NewsNation on Wednesday. 'I think that getting Marc Fogel out was critical, and the Russians were very, very helpful in that effort and very accommodating,' Witkoff said. In a live interview on NewsNation's 'Morning in America,' Witkoff said Fogel was 'exultant' to be back in the United States. Once Vogel was told he was on American soil, he was so excited he did a 'scissor kick,' Witkoff said. DOGE subcommittee to hold first hearing focused on ‘war on waste’ 'He was kissing people and hugging people he had never met before in his life,' Witkoff said. Fogel, a teacher, was arrested for bringing medical marijuana into the country in 2021 and sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2022. The Trump administration announced it had secured Fogel's release on Tuesday, and Trump greeted Fogel at the White House that night. Fogel thanked Trump and members of the administration for his safe return and said the 'superorganism of people' supporting him helped sustain him during his time in Russian prison. As for whose release the administration is working on next, Witkoff said Trump will 'use his strength to bring everybody home that we can.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/fogel-release-trump-putin-friendship-witkoff/	2025-02-12T06:10:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/B2638F5AF1EC6970636BF206815F6027.jpg?w=900
DOGE subcommittee to hold first hearing focused on 'war on waste'	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Delivering on Government Efficiency subcommittee, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., will hold its first hearing Wednesday as Congress begins working with the White House on President Donald Trump's plan to reshape the federal government. The new House subcommittee, a partner to billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, could be a crucial legislative tool for Trump's agenda. Greene, who met with Musk and Trump on Monday, said Wednesday's hearing will launch 'a war on waste.' The hearing, fully titled 'The War on Waste: Stamping Out the Scourge of Improper Payments and Fraud,' will feature testimony from a former FBI agent and the director of the United Council on Welfare Fraud. It comes as Democrats and some government workers are protesting massive cuts to the federal workforce and Musk's influence in the White House. Who is running DOGE with Elon Musk? 'DOGE subcommittee members will work with expert witnesses to examine how Congress can assist the president in the effort to stamp out improper payments and fraud,' Greene said in a news release. Trump: DOGE has found 'tremendous' fraud The hearing follows Trump's claims that DOGE has uncovered tens of billions of dollars in fraud and abuse, blaming bad government contracts. 'We're finding tremendous fraud and tremendous abuse. If I need a vote of Congress to find fraud and abuse, it's fine by me. I think we'll get the vote,' Trump said while speaking to reporters Tuesday alongside Musk in the Oval Office. Musk added, 'The people voted for major government reform, and that's what the people are going to get. They're going to get what they voted for.' Trump's executive order limits new hires As the White House looks to buy out nearly 2 million federal government employees, Trump is limiting federal agencies to hiring one worker for every four who leave. The deadline for federal employees to accept a buyout offer was extended indefinitely Monday as a lawsuit to block the plan continues in court. House Oversight Committee announces ‘disclosure’ task force The Office of Personnel Management has offered federal workers who resign pay and benefits through September. The White House has called the offer 'generous' and reported that more than 65,000 workers, about 2.5% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout. The buyout is part of Trump’s aim to reduce the federal workforce and aligns with plans to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of the administration’s efforts to dismantle USAID. Democrats question legality of DOGE actions Democrats have continued to question the legality of DOGE's actions, including spending cuts and the downsizing of the federal workforce. The moves have sparked protests in Washington, D.C., where thousands of American Federation of Government Workers union members and supporters rallied outside the Capitol, with some holding signs and chanting against Trump and Musk.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-subcommittee-hearing-war-on-waste/	2025-02-12T04:38:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
Ted Nugent praises Trump's deportations: 'This is war'	(NewsNation) — Conservative rock musician Ted Nugent endorses the Trump administration’s early push to round up illegal immigrants and deport them. 'Everybody I know — all my ranching buddies, private landowners — we’ve got our borders secure,' Nugent, a Texas resident, said during Tuesday's 'On Balance.' 'The least that we could expect is that our government would do what we the people do and what we the people demand: Secure my effing country.' ‘Too f—— low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source says So far, arrests have focused on what authorities say are the most dangerous migrants, but federal officials concede the end game is to deport anyone who is in the United States illegally. Nugent says the government can’t be concerned about otherwise law-abiding migrants who aren’t authorized to be here when agents face danger in the field. 'We don’t have the responsibility or the time or the effort to decide who might be dangerous or who might not be. Once you’ve invaded our country, you’re a bad guy,' he said. He added: 'This is war.' Ted Nugent: From rocker to shocker The 76-year-old Nugent enjoyed commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s as a solo recording artist and concert act and probably is best known for his 1977 album 'Cat Scratch Fever,' with its hit single of the same name. He later joined the supergroup Damn Yankees. In recent years, the Michigan native and hunting and gun-rights advocate has courted controversy for his outspoken views. In 2014, he wrote a column suggesting that illegal immigrants should become 'indentured servants' until they earn citizenship. He also drew the scrutiny of the U.S. Secret Service in 2012 after telling an NRA audience he would be 'dead or in jail' if Democratic President Barack Obama was reelected. The matter was dropped after Nugent met with agents. He later referred to Obama as a 'subhuman mongrel,' for which he apologized.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ted-nugent-trumps-deportations-war/	2025-02-11T20:14:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/nuge.jpg?w=900
What agencies do Elon Musk, DOGE have access to?	(NewsNation) — Despite its name, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency group is not a formal part of the federal government — it’s an outside commission set up to advise President Trump on areas where money can be saved. Under an executive order, Trump created DOGE, which he said would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. Does DOGE have your personal information? Trump originally tapped Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead DOGE after his reelection last year. Since then, Ramaswamy left DOGE. Here's an updated list of all the federal agencies DOGE has gained access to. What does DOGE have access to? Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services DOGE agents have gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency confirmed in February. It's unclear which systems DOGE had access to and whether any sensitive medical information was part of the efforts. The Wall Street Journal reported that DOGE aides had been granted access to key payment and contract systems. CMS says DOGE doesn’t have full access and is just hunting for fraud, Politico reported. Commerce Department At least one DOGE agent has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT systems, including accessing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, New York Magazine reported. Democratic lawmakers accused DOGE of improperly inserting itself into the NOAA. In a joint statement, California Democratic Reps Zoe Lofgren and Jared Huffman said Musk’s cost-cutting group isaccessing NOAA’s computer systems. NOAA is charged with forecasting weather, monitoring atmospheric conditions and mapping the seas, among other things. No, DOGE did not find Pentagon spent $600 million on sushi Education Department DOGE cut $900 million from a federal research agency that tracks American students’ academic progress after claiming there's no need for much of its work. It’s unclear to what degree the Education Department’s Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk’s team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute’s work. Additionally, Senate Democrats are concerned DOGE may have illegally accessed federal student loan data, but that doesn’t mean borrowers will see their loans forgiven, as some on TikTok have claimed. The Washington Post reported that DOGE is using AI software to target cuts within the Department of Education, as well, indicating that sensitive information including internal financial information has been fed into a software system to analyze spending. Federal Aviation Administration Musk said DOGE will make 'rapid safety upgrades' to the air traffic control systems with the Federal Aviation Administration. 'With the support of President @realDonaldTrump, the @DOGE team will aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,' Musk wrote on the social platform X. 'The FAA’s primary aircraft safety notification system failed for several hours!' he added, likely referring to an outage of the FAA’s Notice to Air Mission system in February. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy then said on X that he 'talked to the DOGE team' and 'they are going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.' It remains unclear if Musk and DOGE have actually gained access to FAA systems. Elon Musk’s DOGE sued as Trump takes office: Report Treasury Department DOGE got access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems, The Associated Press reported. The news came after Treasury acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk resigned his position after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data. Musk on Saturday responded to a post on his social media platform X about the departure of Lebryk: 'The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.' He did not provide proof of this claim. US Agency for International Development The future of the U.S. Agency for International Development continues to remain uncertain as DOGE has taken control of the agency’s money, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. On Friday, a federal judge dealt Trump and Musk their first big setback in their dismantling of USAID, ordering a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of agency staffers off the job. Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE? U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, also agreed to block an order that would have given the thousands of overseas USAID workers the administration wanted to place on abrupt administrative leave just 30 days to move families and households back to the U.S. at government expense. According to current and former USAID officials, all USAID humanitarian work around the world had been stopped, ABC News reported. Veterans Affairs Veterans Affairs leaders confirmed they are working with DOGE but say veterans’ personal info remains secure, Military Times reported. They're reportedly working on ways to reform agency operations. Labor unions sue to block DOGE access to sensitive information On Monday, a coalition of labor unions filed a lawsuit asking a federal court to stop Musk’s team from accessing private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management. Judge adjusts ruling blocking Musk, DOGE from Treasury Department payment systems The suit, led by the American Federation of Teachers, alleges the Trump administration violated federal privacy laws when it gave DOGE access to systems with personal information on tens of millions of Americans without their consent. It was filed in federal court in Maryland. It’s the latest in a flurry of legal challenges to Musk’s growing influence over federal agencies he has promised to slash or dismantle. A federal judge in New York blocked Musk’s team from a Treasury Department system Saturday after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued over privacy concerns.

Marco Rubio: Marc Fogel’s release from Russia cause for ‘celebrat...	(NewsNation) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NewsNation that American teacher Marc Fogel's Tuesday release from Russia is cause for 'celebration.' 'Anytime an American comes home who's being held overseas like this situation is, it's a time for celebration,' Rubio said. 'We're happy for him and for his family. It's a case we've followed very closely for a number of years.' Teacher Marc Fogel released from Russia Rubio and hostage affairs envoy Adam Boehler joined 'CUOMO' via phone on their way to pick up American teacher Marc Fogel, whose release from Russian detainment was secured by the Trump administration Tuesday. The pair pointed out that Russia asked for nothing in return when releasing Fogel, which Rubio said shows 'President Trump's commitment to bringing home Americans.'

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough, File) Fogel was arrested for bringing medical marijuana into Russia in 2021. In 2022, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. On Tuesday, the Trump administration secured his return home. The U.S. government did not initially label Fogel as unlawfully detained, despite doing so in a similar case involving WNBA star Brittney Griner. In 2024, the Biden administration negotiated the release of Americans, including journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva as well as Whelan. Paul Whelan: No way Russia wanted nothing for Marc Fogel Though Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Donald Trump maintain that the country wanted nothing in return, retired U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who was held as a Russian prisoner for more than five years, tells 'CUOMO' he doesn’t buy it. 'The whole reason they hold Americans, the whole reason they hold the Tajiks and Uzbeks, is so that they can exact some sort of price.' Whelan said, adding that these arrests are more like 'kidnapping.' ‘He loves being a father’: Dad of Hamas hostage hopeful He clarified that he doesn't believe politicians are necessarily lying about Russia's wants, but rather that there are 'things that are done under the table.' No stranger to Russian prison conditions and thought processes, Whelan told NewsNation: 'They want some sort of exchange. They want sanctions relief. They want some sort of, you know, détente with the Ukraine situation.'

Musk defends DOGE alongside Trump in striking Oval Office moment	Elon Musk on Tuesday defended the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside President Trump, who invited Musk to speak and sat at the resolute desk as the tech mogul gave a lengthy address. 'The people voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get,' Musk said in response to pushback his work at DOGE has received. 'That’s what democracy is all about.' Musk also said he wants to add 'commonsense controls' to government, arguing that his ideas are not 'draconian.' And, when asked about personal conflicts of interest with his work overhauling the government, Musk replied, 'transparency is what builds trust.' In the first few weeks of Trump’s presidency, Musk has led an effort to dismantle federal agencies, buy out hundreds of thousands of federal workers from their jobs and take over payment systems within the Treasury Department and other agencies. The work has sparked numerous lawsuits and pushback from Democratic lawmakers, state office holders and unions representing federal works. Tuesday’s striking moment at the Oval Office featured the leader of the free world inviting the richest man in the world to give a defense of his goals in front of press brought in for the occasion. One of Musk’s young children pulled at his coat at times as the billionaire, wearing a black 'Make America Great Again' baseball cap, argued the federal bureaucracy can’t have more power than any elected representative. 'If money is spent badly, if your taxpayer dollars are not spent in a sensible or critical manner, then that’s not okay. Your tax dollars need to be spent wisely, on things that matter,' Musk said, defending the goal of DOGE. As examples of waste, Musk mentioned that people who are 150 years old, so are 'probably dead,' are receiving Social Security checks and that bureaucrats with a salary of 'a few $100,000' have 'somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth.' He said that happened with U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) employees, suggesting they 'got wealthy at the taxpayers’ expense.' Musk offered no specific evidence to back up these allegations. The president said on Tuesday that he thought it was 'crazy' that DOGE has been able to find so much fraud and waste in the federal government, arguing 'we had no idea we were going to find this much.' Trump also said the White House is watching for if there’s a conflict of interest or lack of transparency on anything Musk is working on, noting that he is 'a big businessman' doing this work. A federal judge issued a Saturday ruling that prevents DOGE from accessing the Treasury Department’s payment systems by blocking political appointees and special government employees, like Musk and DOGE personnel. On Tuesday, the court clarified the ruling, saying that it does not extend to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Meanwhile, Trump and his allies have denounced the original, sweeping ruling. Trump, in the Oval Office, said the judge has 'certain leanings' and that he hopes the courts would allow him to do what he was elected to do. 'It seems hard to believe that judges want to stop us,' Trump said. 'It seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don’t want you to do that. Then we have to look at the judges because I think it’s a very serious violation.' Musk doubled down on defending DOGE’s work at the Treasury Department in particular. 'The stuff we’re doing with the Treasury Department is so basic that you can’t believe it doesn’t exist already,' he said, adding that the U.S. currently pays some 'terrorists organizations, known fraudsters' that belong on a 'do not pay list.' Musk did not offer specifics on this declaration, but later said that if he is wrong, especially in making statements about what the federal government spends money on, he will accept corrections. 'Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. So, nobody is going to bat a thousand. We will make mistakes and we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes,' the Tesla CEO said. DOGE has targeted various parts of the federal government, including the USAID and is now looking to similarly gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Why are some calling for a Coca-Cola boycott?	(NewsNation) — A newly established Latino group is speaking out against Coca-Cola as part of its campaign against companies that do not support diversity, equity and inclusion, aka DEI. Others on social media are also boycotting the popular soda company, but the reasons for this are unclear. Who is leading the Coca-Cola boycott? 'The Latino Freeze Movement' was created in 2025 and calls itself a grassroots movement, saying it is 'committed to showing the value that Latinos, other minorities and allies have in the United States.' According to NewsNation affiliate Border Report, videos are circulating on social media of Latinos rejecting Coca-Cola. Cuomo: Department of Education isn’t a ‘DEI boogeyman,’ it’s necessary 'Latinos and Latinas stop spending money. Hold the line. We can all collectively make a big impact by simply holding and not spending our money,' the Latino Freeze Movement said on its website. Why are they calling for the boycott? The group urges its followers not to buy Coca-Cola or shop at Amazon, Target, Walmart and other companies that have scaled back DEI efforts. Coca-Cola has a webpage dedicated to DEI and has not announced any reduction of its initiatives. Others on TikTok have floated claims Coca-Cola called ICE on its employees at a plant and are using the hashtag '#Latinofreeze.' None of these rumors have been confirmed. Newsweek reviewed company records and public filings and did not find any evidence of mass layoffs. Meanwhile, a conservative research group has issued a 'woke alert' for Coca-Cola's support of transgender women participating in women's sports. Consumer Research also criticized Coca-Cola for saying, 'DEI is at the heart of our values.' Coca-Cola, according to its website, has approximately 530 million consumers in Latin America.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/coca-cola-boycott-explained/	2025-02-11T13:54:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/02/65cb8a2461e984.87465429.jpeg?w=900
Besides Elon Musk, who else is running DOGE?	(NewsNation) —Tech billionaire Elon Musk may be in charge of the Trump administration’s new Department of Government Efficiency, but he’s also got a group of helpers to who are running the controversial agency. While Musk has been the face of DOGE, several others are working behind the scenes to keep on with the agency’s stated mission of cutting costs in the federal government by rapidly burrowing deep into federal agencies including The United States Agency for International Development and the Department of Education. While DOGE does not have an official roster because it’s not not technically a government agency, Musk appears to have tapped into several people within his sphere, including a group of young engineers with minimal work experience. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? Here’s who is running DOGE with Musk: Steve Davis Musk has installed Steve Davis, an engineer who has been with the tech billionaire for 20 years and over several of his companies including SpaceX and X as his deputy, reported the Los Angeles Times. Davis is currently also the president of Boring, Musk’s tunneling company. Musk's deputy has had a reputation for being a shrewd cost-cutter and running fast-paced operations, which have at times resulted with him at odds with safety regulators, the Guardian reported. UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 5: Elon Musk is seen in the U.S. Capitol after a meeting with Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., while on the Hill to talk about President-elect Donald Trump's 'Department of Government Efficiency,' on Thursday, December 5, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Boring’s former safety manager told Fortune that Davis had isolated him in ways that stopped him from doing his job when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that several Boring employees had been burned with chemical accelerants due to hazardous working conditions at the site. Does DOGE have your personal information? Davis undertook much of the hiring for DOGE prior to Trump taking office and was at the United States Agency for International Development when Doge staffers and agency security officials clashed over Musk’s demands for access to restricted areas, the Guardian reported. Marko Elez Musk brought Marko Elez, a 25-year-old Rutgers University graduate who worked at Musk’s SpaceX and X. Elez was a temporary appointee at Treasury who was given access to sensitive account data with administrator-level privileges, reported Wired. He resigned last week after racist social media posts of his came to light by the Wall Street Journal. 'Normalize Indian hate,' the account associated with Elez posted in September, regarding people of Indian ethnicity who work in the U.S. tech sector, the outlet reported. Elez was reinstated one day later. Vice President Vance on Friday said he disagrees with Elez’s posts but that 'stupid social media activity' should not 'ruin a kid’s life,' he wrote on X. 'So I say bring him back,' which President Trump said he would support. Musk replied with: 'He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.' Musk says he’ll bring back DOGE staffer under fire for racist posts Edward Coristine 19-year-old Edward Coristine was also tapped by Musk for DOGE. Coristine briefly worked for Musk’s brain chip start-up Neuralink. Coristine has gone by the username 'Big Balls' online and founded a company called 'Tesla.Sexy LLC', according to Wired. Coristine is a high school graduate with a history of launching startups and has founded at least five companies; many of these were erased from his now-deleted LinkedIn profile. Coristine has been given access to sensitive data and has been on calls with government employees as they are asked to defend their jobs, Wired reported. The Washington Post reported Coristine has taken on new roles as a senior adviser at the State Department and at the Department of Homeland Security. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 03: Protestors gather outside of USAID headquarters on February 03, 2025 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Some U.S. officials expressed alarm about Coristine’s being given the role. 'This is dangerous,' a U.S. officials told The Post, noting Coristine’s age and a report by Bloomberg News that he was fired for leaking a data security firm’s information to a competitor. Akash Bobba Another young engineer, Akash Bobba, 22, is also a part of DOGE. According to a copy of his now-deleted LinkedIn obtained by Wired, Bobba was an investment engineering intern at the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund as of last spring and was previously an intern at both Meta and Palantir. Luke Farritor Farritor, 23, is a former intern at SpaceX, Musk’s space company, and currently a Thiel Fellow, Wired reported. He dropped out of the University of Nebraska, but was part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll while he was enrolled, according to the outlet. 5 questions about DOGE’s access to federal payment systems Gavin Kliger Kliger is listed as 'special advisor to the director' at the Office of Personnel Management on his LinkedIn page and is listed as being in internal records as a special adviser to the director for information technology, reported Wired.

House Oversight Committee announces 'disclosure' task force	(NewsNation) — The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform announced the formation of a tasks force for the declassification of federal secrets. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., will lead the bipartisan task force that will take on a number of issues, including topics that have spawned conspiracies. Luna has been involved in investigations into unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) or, as they are more commonly known, UFOs. Tom Homan: ‘I’m not satisfied’ with number of ICE arrests The task force is building on an executive order issued by President Donald Trump calling for the declassification of all files related to the John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations. Other topics will include UAPs, the Epstein list, 9/11 files and the origins of COVID-19. While all of those have sparked long-standing conspiracy theories, Luna maintained the group was not a conspiracy investigation committee but one intending to present information for Americans to determine the truth. 'We stand at the dawn of a new era,' she said. Luna stressed that the committee is a bipartisan effort that includes Democratic lawmakers. She also said the committee has already begun the process of communicating with several federal agencies to request information. If those agencies do not comply, Luna said the group would take action and do more than write letters protesting the lack of transparency. Previously, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had discussed forming a UFO caucus or task force to investigate recent whistleblower claims of secret UAP programs.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/oversight-new-task-force/	2025-02-11T11:26:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2184674649-e1734712571301.jpg?w=800
Teacher Marc Fogel released from Russia	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday it had secured the release of American Marc Fogel, who had been detained by Russia. Special envoy Steve Witkoff was involved in negotiating an exchange that would bring Fogel back to the U.S. National security adviser Mike Waltz said in a statement the exchange 'serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.' Fogel, a teacher, was arrested for bringing medical marijuana into the country in 2021 and sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2022. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts The U.S. government did not initially label Fogel as unlawfully detained, despite doing so in a similar case involving WNBA star Brittney Griner. Griner was released in a prisoner swap in 2022, and Fogel's family called on her to advocate for his release from the penal colony where he was serving his sentence. In 2024, the Biden administration negotiated the release of Americans, including journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva as well as former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. ‘We’re about to get annihilated’: Musk, DOGE descend on consumer bureau Fogel's name was reportedly brought up in those negotiations, but he was not included in the deal. The White House has not said what the U.S. has offered in exchange for Fogel. Waltz said Fogel will be on American soil by Tuesday night.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia/	2025-02-11T10:42:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/MicrosoftTeams-image-25-2.png?w=774
Over a dozen religious groups file immigration lawsuit	(NewsNation) — More than 25 religious groups have filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging a Trump administration order that allows immigration agents to make arrests at houses of worship. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington and says the new policy is spreading fear and lowering attendance at services and other church programs, which the groups say infringes their religious freedom. That freedom, the groups say, includes their ability to minister to immigrants, including those who don't have documents. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts 'We have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,' said the Most Rev. Sean W. Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church. 'We cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,' he said 'By joining this lawsuit, we’re seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus’ command to love our neighbors as ourselves.' Plaintiffs note that programs held by churches, including food banks, meal programs, homeless shelters and support programs for immigrants could be affected because people may be fearful of participating. The lawsuit represents several denominations, including those with a large presence in the U.S. Groups included in the lawsuit include Reform Judaism, with more than one million followers, the Episcopal Church with 1.5 million members, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) with nearly 1.1 million members and the African Methodist Episcopal Church with 1.5 million active members. ‘Too f—— low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source says Other denominations include the Christian Chruch (Disciples of Christ), the Church of the Brethren, the Convención Bautista Hispana de Texas, the Friends General Conference, the Mennonite Church U.S.a, the Unitarian Universalist Association, the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ. An earlier lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Maryland by Quaker congregations who objected to the change, which the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple later joined. Prior to the change, immigration agents needed special authorization to conduct operations at sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals. In one recent incident, a Honduran man was arrested outside his church in the Atlanta area while a service was being held inside. The Trump administration has not responded to the newest lawsuit though an earlier memo filed in opposition to the Quaker lawsuit outlined arguments including that the suit is based on hypothetical future harm and isn't sufficient for an injunction to be issued. Trump: Palestinians will have no right of return to Gaza under US proposal One group that did not join the lawsuit is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, though it has criticized the immigration crackdown with Pope Francis issuing a rebuke to President Donald Trump's deportation plan, saying forceful removal of people just because of their immigration status deprives them of their inherent dignity. Many conservative Christian faith leaders and congregations have not shared these concerns and have expressed support for the harsh immigration policies being put in place.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/religious-groups-immigration-lawsuit/	2025-02-11T08:15:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25021616279146.jpg?w=900
Tom Homan: 'I'm not satisfied' with number of ICE arrests	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's 'border czar' Tom Homan said Tuesday that he is 'not satisfied' with the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests. When asked by NewsNation's Kellie Meyer if Trump is unhappy with immigration crackdown efforts since returning to office, Homan responded, 'I'm not.' If you look at the rest of interior enforcement three times higher than it was a year ago today. Three times higher is good, but I'm not satisfied. There are more criminal aliens that need to be arrested, hundreds of thousands,' he added. 'Sanctuary cities are putting roadblocks up. We've got leaks. So we need to increase the arrests of illegal aliens, especially those with criminal convictions. So we're going to continue.' His remarks followed NewsNation's confirmation that Trump is frustrated with the number of arrests made by immigration officials in the U.S. DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts Trump: Immigration numbers are too low When asked about the pace of deportations Sunday, President Trump took the opportunity to say his border officials are doing an 'incredible job' and acknowledged it is difficult to find migrants who know they are being sought. However, a source with knowledge of the matter told NewsNation that the president told aides 'the numbers are too f—— low,' adding that Trump wants more. Asked last week if ICE needs to do more, Homan said, 'They’re doing a great job, but they’ve got to do more.' ICE averaged 787 arrests per day between Jan. 23-31, and about 11,000 arrests have been made in the last 18 days. The White House has reported 461 undocumented migrants were released from custody due to health concerns, insufficient detention space and other factors. Homan said NewsNation that he spoke with ICE Acting Director Caleb Vitello and that no one should be released back into the community 'without the clearance of headquarters.' He added that he understands there will be some, but the number of releases was 'unacceptable and that’s been fixed.' IRS could help with immigration crackdown Trump has requested the Department of Homeland Security send Internal Revenue Service agents to assist with immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday requesting criminal investigators agents assist with investigating human trafficking networks and finding businesses hiring illegal migrants. The request is part of Trump’s efforts to ramp up mass deportations. This is a developing story.

Eric Adams to address media as DOJ orders charges to be dropped	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams will hold a news conference this morning, hours after corruption charges against him were ordered to be dropped. The order came from the Justice Department on Monday night. A lack of evidence was not the reason, but rather the charges causing challenges to Adams's reelection campaign and ability to carry out efforts against illegal immigration and crime. In a two-page memo obtained by the Associated Press, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote: 'The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.' Top Justice Department official orders prosecutors to drop charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams Charges were ordered to be dropped immediately. The memo follows months of speculation that President Donald Trump would take steps to end the case against Adams, who was charged in September with accepting bribes of free or discounted travel and illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals seeking to buy his influence. Adams, a Democrat elected on a centrist platform, has moved noticeably right following his indictment, rankling some within his party.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/eric-adams-address-media-charges-dropped/	2025-02-11T06:58:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2186832418.jpg?w=900
King Abdullah says Jordan will bring in 2,000 'very ill' Palestin...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is speaking with Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday in private meetings over the future of Gaza. When asked if Trump is confident he can get the king on board with his plan for the Palestinian people, he answered, 'He's a great man.' Trump is pressuring Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries to take in Palestinians, and he's said he wants the United States to take over Gaza. Arab leaders have strongly rejected Trump's proposal, saying any plan to transfer Palestinians to their land would destabilize the region. Jordan already has taken in more than 2 million Palestinian refugees — making up almost half the total number of Palestinian refugees as registered or recognized by U.N. agencies. 'I believe we will have a parcel of land in Jordan... a parcel of land in Egypt,' Trump said Tuesday. Arab, Muslim Americans blast Trump’s ‘grotesque’ Gaza proposal The United Nations, human rights groups and some Democrats say Trump's proposal amounts to ethnic cleansing. After the first discussion of the day, though, the president addressed the press, saying the relationship with Jordan 'has been very strong.' On the topic of taking in Palestinians, King Abdullah said they have to look at the best interests of the United States and people of Jordan. 'One of the things we can do right away' is to bring 2,000 children who are in a 'very ill state' to Jordan as quickly as possible, King Abdullah said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Egypt’s foreign minister on Monday and 'reiterated the importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. A group of 11 people protested outside the White House on Tuesday before the meeting. Asked by a reporter how the United States will buy Gaza, Trump answered, 'we’re not going to buy anything.' 'We’re going to have it, and we’re going to keep it, and we’re going to make sure there’s going to be peace and there’s not going to be any problem and nobody’s going to question it and we’re going to run it very properly,' he said. Fragile ceasefire deal Trump on Monday said a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas should be canceled if the latter does not release all the remaining hostages it is holding in Gaza by Saturday. However, he also said such a decision would be up to Israel. 'If they’re not here, all hell is going to break out,' Trump said. He said 'yes' when a reporter on Tuesday asked if Saturday was still his deadline. Later, he said Hamas must have all hostages out by Saturday or 'all bets are off.' Your student loans won’t be forgiven if DOGE violated FERPA Hamas has said it would delay the next release of three Israeli hostages set for Saturday, claiming Israel violated the ceasefire agreement by not allowing a surge of tents and shelters into Gaza. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Tuesday that the dozens of hostages would only be returned if all parties remain committed to the ceasefire. In a televised address, the leader of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they are ready to resume attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden if the ceasefire in Gaza halts. After a four-hour discussion with his security Cabinet Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement he 'welcomed' Trump's demand for the release of hostages by Saturday at noon. 'In light of Hamas’ announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, I instructed the IDF last night to amass forces inside and around the Gaza Strip. This operation is currently underway and will be completed as soon as possible,' Netanyahu said in the statement. 'The decision I passed in the Cabinet unanimously is as follows: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end, and the IDF will resume intense combat until Hamas is decisively defeated.'

DHS seeks to deputize IRS agents to help with deportation efforts	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has requested the Department of Homeland Security send Internal Revenue Service agents to assist with immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday requesting criminal investigators to help tackle human trafficking networks and find businesses hiring workers in the U.S. illegally, as well as other immigration-related tasks. The request is part of Trump's efforts to ramp up mass deportations. Despite 'border czar' Tom Homan and Noem receiving his vote of confidence over the weekend, sources tell NewsNation that Trump is unhappy with the early results of his immigration crackdown and wants to see more enforcement. Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers: Source On Sunday, Trump was asked about immigration arrests and denied being bothered by the way immigration enforcement efforts have gone so far. 'They're doing an amazing job, I think. Tom Homan is doing an amazing job. Kristi Noem is doing an amazing job. But it's not easy finding murderers who know they're being looked for,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. However, a source with knowledge of the matter tells NewsNation that the president told aides 'the numbers are too f—— low.' ICE averaged 787 arrests per day between Jan. 23-31, and about 11,000 arrests have been made in the last 18 days. The White House has reported 461 undocumented migrants were released from custody due to health concerns, insufficient detention space and other factors. IRS asked to help with immigration crackdown Noem suggested IRS agents assist with investigating human trafficking networks and finding businesses hiring illegal migrants. 'It is DHS.'s understanding that the Department of the Treasury has qualified law enforcement personnel available to assist with immigration enforcement, especially in light of recent increases to the Internal Revenue Service's work force and budget,' she said in the letter to Bessent. The push by DHS could pull resources away from tax enforcement efforts. Of roughly 100,000 employees, the IRS has approximately 2,100 criminal investigators who look into drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption, according to the New York Times. Noem's proposal comes as Republicans grow increasingly frustrated with the IRS, with one lawmaker filing a proposal to abolish the agency and rewrite the current tax code.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/dhs-deputize-irs-agents-deportation/	2025-02-11T04:39:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24357601334356-e1734888330412.jpg?w=800
EU vows tough countermeasures to US tariffs	BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum 'will not go unanswered,' adding that they will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc. 'The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,' von der Leyen said in a statement in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum the previous day. 'Tariffs are taxes — bad for business, worse for consumers,' von der Leyen said. 'Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.' In Germany, home to the EU's largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that 'if the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united,' adding that 'ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.' A timeline of US-China tit-for-tat tariffs since Trump’s first term Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax in the hope that they will give local producers relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. He imposed similar tariffs during his first presidency, but the move damaged relations with key U.S. allies and drove up costs for 'downstream’’ manufacturers that buy steel and aluminum. It is not clear what countermeasures would seek to apply, but officials and observers have said they would target Republican states and traditionally strong U.S. exports. After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, the EU imposed counter-tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. EU Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said Tuesday that the tariffs are 'economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains established through our extensive transatlantic trade and investment ties.' What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them? 'We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,' Šefčovič said, but added that 'it is not our preferred scenario. We remain committed to constructive dialog. We stand ready for negotiations and to find mutually beneficial solutions where possible.' The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing some 30% of global trade. 'There is a lot at stake for both sides,' he told the EU legislature. While the EU has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth €688 billion ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros (107 billion) for the EU.

Trump tariffs 'potentially very harmful' to US: John Bolton	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s threat to use tariffs against other countries is causing confusion and uncertainty in the market that will come back and haunt the United States, according to the president’s former national security adviser. John Bolton, who served in the role during Trump’s first presidency, told NewsNation that the threat of tariffs directed at countries like Canada and Mexico is the wrong approach to reaching his goal for economic supremacy. 'China is the problem,' Bolton told NewsNation. 'China is dumping steel and aluminum, and so if that’s the problem and they’re not playing by pretrade rules, which is clearly the case, then I think the United States is entirely justified in retaliating.' Trump enacts steel and aluminum tariffs, pardons Blagojevich But rather than getting countries that have been harmed by China together to fight back, Trump has, Bolton said, chosen to 'slap Canada in the face' with threats of tariffs. He said rather than addressing the enemy, Bolton said the president has directed his anger in the wrong direction. Trump’s bigger agenda could be potentially 'very damaging' to the American economy, Bolton said. China imposed duties on U.S. imports on Monday, just hours after Trump announced he wanted to place 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum coming into the country. Even before being elected, Trump was not shy about his love of tariffs, calling them 'the greatest thing invented.' The president will eventually need to put his plan in writing, Bolton said, rather than 'making numbers up to bargain (with) and scare people.' Trump has announced that he plans to generate lost revenue through tariffs, which Bolton said will ultimately result in higher taxes for Americans. An analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost a typical U.S. household more than $2,600 a year. 'I think it’s economic self-harm to the United States,' Bolton said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-harmful-us-bolton/	2025-02-10T15:57:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2198045416.jpg?w=900

‘Too f------ low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source sa...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is frustrated with the number of arrests made by immigration officials in the U.S., NewsNation has confirmed. 'The numbers are too f------ low,' the president told aides, as recounted to a source with knowledge of the matter. 'He wants more,' the source described the president’s demand. Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged 787 arrests per day between Jan. 23-31. Asked last week if ICE needs to do more, border czar Tom Homan said, 'They’re doing a great job, but they’ve got to do more.' Memo warns border agents of escalating threats from Mexican cartels Administration officials confirmed some detainees were released back into the country after being arrested. 'I was made aware of that this morning, and I will address that today, but I've been told that some were released because of some health concerns that we could not handle within ICE detention,' Homan said last week, adding 'the president made it clear we're ending 'catch-and-release.'' There were 461 released from custody out of more than 8,000 arrested since President Trump took office, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week. 'It’s less than 6%. There are reasons for their release; some factors include lack of significant likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future, lack of detention availability, and some have serious medical conditions,' Leavitt said. Meanwhile, immigration agents are continuing enforcement actions across the country. 'We're going after those that have been the violent criminals, perpetuating crimes in our communities, also those with final removal orders, and then we will continue down the priority list,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CNN’s 'State of the Union' Sunday. Migrants stopped trying to cross Canadian border in subzero temps Noem also confirmed previous reports ICE is over capacity. 'Remember, we're continuously busing people back to Mexico, continuously flying people out of the country and repatriating them back … there's still room, absolutely,' she said. One part of the problem has been the lack of facilities to house detained migrants. Noem said besides ICE detention facilities, some local law enforcement and different governments have offered their facilities. Also, to combat the shortage, the administration is now constructing new detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Flights to Guantanamo carrying migrants began last week. Work is now underway by military forces at Guantanamo to dramatically increase the capacity to hold detained persons. Eventually, the base is expected to hold up to 30,000 people.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/trump-anger-ice-arrests-source/	2025-02-10T14:50:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771_734cd3.jpg?w=900
Trump enacts steel and aluminum tariffs, pardons Blagojevich	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday memorializing his plan to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, including from Canada and Mexico. 'This is beginning of making America rich again,' Trump told reporters as he signed the document. 'Our allies and enemies expected this,' he said, regarding the tariffs. 'We don't want it to hurt other countries.' What could get more expensive under Trump’s tariffs? Trump previously said that the steel and aluminum tariffs would impact 'everybody' when asked what countries would be affected. Trump also reaffirmed that he would announce 'reciprocal tariffs' later this week, which would mean the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases in which another country has levied duties on U.S. goods. Trump pardons former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich 'It's my honor to do it. I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people,' Trump told reporters. The ex-Illinois governor was convicted in 2011 for public corruption charges. When asked whether he's considered appointing Blogolevich to ambassador of Serbia, Trump said: 'No, but I would.' Will mortgage interest deduction expire if Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does? Blagojevich was released from federal prison in Colorado in Feb. 2020 after then-President Trump commuted his sentence halfway through its 14 years. He spoke to NewsNation local affiliate WGN the night he was released at the airport, telling reporters: 'I'm profoundly grateful to Trump. It's a profound and everlasting gratitude.' Trump signs plastic straw, international business orders Other Oval Office actions included the 47th president signing an executive order related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it 'unlawful for a U.S. person or company to offer, pay, or promise to pay money or anything of value to any foreign official' for business purposes. Trump told media his order is 'going to mean a lot more business for America.' ‘Too f—— low’: Trump angry over ICE arrest numbers, source says The president also tackled bringing back plastic straws, saying that paper straws 'don't work.'

Trump orders would-be assassins reports unsealed by Secret Servic...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump says he feels he is not getting enough details about the attempts on his life from last year — and is now telling the Secret Service to give him 'every bit of information' they have, according to the New York Post. In particular, Trump wants to know why one of the suspects and six cell phones, and the other had foreign apps. 'No more excuses,' Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying. 'No more holding back because of Biden... I’m entitled to know. And they held it back long enough.' In a statement to NewsNation, the Secret Service said, 'As it relates to a request by the president, any information held by the Secret Service will be provided to the president, without exception.' Elon Musk calls to impeach ‘corrupt’ judge after DOGE access blocked Trump assassination attempts On July 13, 2024, authorities say Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, shot at Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks was killed by the Secret Service. Butler County Fire Chief Corey Comperatore died and two other people were injured. Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire. The Secret Service's response was heavily criticized in the wake of the attempt, with Ronald Rowe, the agency’s acting director, previously calling it a 'failure.' According to a Congressional task force investigating the shooting, Crooks had encrypted messaging accounts. Then, in September, at Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, investigators say a man named Ryan Routh shot at him. A Secret Service agent checking the perimeter says he saw Routh pointing a rifle through a fence. Six cell phones were found in his car — which is what Trump was referencing as information to be unsealed. More information about Routh is expected to come out in September when he goes to trial.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-orders-assassins-reports-unsealed-secret-service/	2025-02-10T12:38:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66cf9289ac73f5.84300666.jpeg?w=900
How much does it cost to make pennies and nickels?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump says he has directed the U.S. Treasury to stop making new pennies, which are worth less than they cost to produce. 'For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!' Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday. 'I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.' He added: 'Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time.' Trump directs Treasury to stop making pennies The U.S. Mint reported losing over $85 million on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced in fiscal year 2024. Trump's announcement comes shortly after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team highlighted the cost of making pennies. Here's how much pennies are costing taxpayers and what eliminating the one-cent coin would take. How much do pennies and nickels cost? The main argument for getting rid of pennies is about saving the U.S. some money. Every penny cost $0.0369 in 2024, up 20% from the year before, according to U.S. Mint's annual report. That means the unit cost of producing and distributing a penny is more than triple its face value. Nickels also cost more to produce than they're worth. Each of the $0.05 coins cost almost $0.14 to make. As recently as 2022, the nickel cost about $0.10, but rising raw materials costs have made them more expensive to produce. The Mint lost $17.7 million on nickels in 2024, meaning the two coins together cost taxpayers over $100 million last year. In fiscal year 2023, the losses were even higher, nearly $180 million between pennies and nickels. Pennies were made of copper before 1962 but are now mostly made of zinc with a thin copper plating. Can Trump discontinue the penny? It's not entirely clear if Trump can retire the penny on his own. 'Congress authorizes every coin and most medals that the U.S. Mint manufactures and oversees the Mint’s operations under its Public Enterprise Fund (PEF),' according to the U.S. Mint's website. Still, the president may be able to stop the production of new pennies. 'The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,' Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, said last month. Back in 1857, it was Congress that discontinued the unpopular half-cent coin and made the cent smaller to cut back on the amount of copper needed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has yet to comment publicly on the president's directive. DOGE actions ‘long overdue, much welcomed’: House speaker Why does the U.S. still make pennies? Countries like Brazil, Canada, Norway and New Zealand have all stopped producing low-denomination coins, so why is the U.S. still making pennies? 'The Mint’s official reason for minting pennies is that the Federal Reserve orders them,' The New York Times Magazine's Caity Weaver wrote in a 2024 story calling for the end of the penny. Weaver added: 'Specifically, the Federal Reserve 'buys' coins from the Mint at face value and stores them in bags all over the United States for distribution to banks.' If that doesn't sound like a very good reason, you're not alone. Surveys suggest most Americans on both sides of the aisle think the government should stop producing pennies. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama called the penny a 'good metaphor' for some of the larger problems facing the U.S. government but acknowledged that nostalgia may explain the penny's lasting power. 'It's one of those things where I think people get attached emotionally to the way things have been,' Obama said. 'We remember our piggy banks and counting up all our pennies and then taking them in and getting a dollar bill or a couple of dollars from them, and maybe that's the reason people haven't gotten around to it.' Is there a downside to getting rid of pennies? Proponents of the penny warn that ending production could drive up demand for nickels, which are even more expensive to produce. 'If penny production were eliminated, nickel production would likely double, compounding the Mint’s losses,' according to Americans for Common Cents, an advocacy group. Instead, the group argues the Mint should reexamine its overhead costs and focus on reducing the cost of producing nickels. Decommissioning the penny could also change the way commodities are priced since prices ending in 99 cents are so common. That could be good or bad for consumers. 'The item that once cost $2.99 might then cost $2.95,' said William Dickens, who taught economic and public policy at Northeastern University. On the other hand: 'Businesses might round up more often than down, leading to a slight inflationary effect,' David Smith, an economics professor at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio Business School, told CNBC. When Canada eliminated the penny, cash transactions were rounded to the nearest five cents based on the total amount of the transaction, not on each item. A 2017 paper found that penny-rounding in Canada imposed a tax of approximately $3.27 million on Canadian consumers at grocery stores. For a typical store, the additional rounding revenue amounted to an estimated $157 extra each year — suggesting a fairly minimal impact on shoppers. Others in favor of keeping the penny point out that a so-called 'rounding tax' would disproportionately affect the poor since they're more likely to use cash than the rich. Would pennies become worthless? If you've been hoarding pennies, don't worry — they're unlikely to become worthless overnight. Halting the production of new pennies and removing them from the system are not the same thing. Ajay Patel, a finance professor at Wake Forest University School of Business, told CNBC the actual elimination of pennies is decades into the future. According to Patel, people would be able to continue using pennies until they are slowly reabsorbed into the banking system and eventually melted down to recycle their zinc and copper. In fact, pennies could become more valuable over time. 'Pennies would become more scarce over time and eventually increase in value. In the near term, they might become useless, depending on how the Treasury treats them. I would think that would have to be in phases so people could convert them to other denominations, thus removing them from the system,' Gates Little, the CEO of Alabama-based Southern Bank, told CNBC. As of right now, there are an estimated 240 billion pennies lying around the U.S., according to The New York Times Magazine. That's over 700 pennies for every man, woman and child in the country.

Rod Blagojevich expected to receive pardon from Trump: Report	WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to pardon former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, according to Axios. Axios cited a source familiar with the plans. Blagojevich was released from federal prison in Colorado in Feb. 2020 after then-President Trump commuted his sentence after seven of 14 years. He spoke to WGN News the night he was released at the airport ahead of a media frenzy on the way to and at his North Side home. DOJ sues Illinois, Chicago over ‘sanctuary city’ laws In 2018, the former Illinois governor filed paperwork to formally request clemency from Trump. Blagojevich was impeached and removed from office after being convicted in 2011. He had been found guilty of crimes that included seeking to sell an appointment to Barack Obama’s old Senate seat and trying to shake down a children’s hospital. On Friday, Politico reported that Trump is considering nominating Blagojevich to become U.S. ambassador to Serbia. Blagojevich's parents immigrated from Serbia in the 1940s. The former governor went to a federal judge last March in an effort to overturn his ineligibility to hold office. Man pardoned in Jan. 6 case arrested on 2016 solicitation charge 'The case started with a megaphone, but it ends with a whimper. Sometimes cases in the federal courthouse attract publicity. But the courthouse is no place for a publicity stunt,' the judge wrote before closing the case with three sentences: 'He wants back. But he’s already gone. Case dismissed.' In an interview with NesNation affiliate WGN a year after his prison release, Blagojevich stated no remorse. 'I didn’t break a single law or cross a single line,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/rod-blagojevich-pardon/	2025-02-10T11:28:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/gettyimages-1207208052.jpg?w=900
Trump: Palestinians wouldn't have right to return to developed Ga...	President Trump in a new interview said Palestinians would not have the right to return to the Gaza Strip if it is taken over and developed by the United States, as he has proposed. 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. Much better,' Trump told Fox News's Bret Baier in an interview conducted Saturday and aired Monday. Schumer warns of ‘Trump shutdown,’ lays out 4-pronged plan for Democrats 'In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them, because if they have to return now, it’ll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,' Trump continued. 'It would be years before it could happen.' Trump asserted he could 'make a deal' with Jordan and Egypt to have them take in Palestinians displaced out of Gaza, though leaders of those countries and other Arab nations have rejected the idea. Trump is set to welcome King Abdullah II of Jordan on Tuesday to the White House, where the Gaza proposal is expected to be a major point of discussion. The president last week during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu first proposed the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and develop it. He has since said U.S. troops would not be involved in securing the area. Trump on Sunday called Gaza 'a demolition site.' The president’s controversial proposal stands to upend decades of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Arab leaders in the region, including some allies, have dismissed Trump's proposal. Judge directs Trump administration to comply with order to unfreeze federal grants Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian National Authority, said Trump’s comments 'represent a serious violation of international law.' Saudi Arabia reiterated its 'absolute rejection of infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to displace the Palestinian people from their land.' Republicans appeared skeptical of the proposal, even as some welcomed it as an unorthodox solution to a long-standing problem.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-palestinians-gaza-strip/	2025-02-10T11:15:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038623143183-e1738953650210.jpg?w=900
Kanye West's X account shut down after 12-hour antisemitic rant	(NewsNation) — An X account for musician Kanye West has been deactivated following a multiday antisemitic tirade on the social media platform that ended in the rapper selling Nazi swastika T-shirts on his website. The account went offline Sunday night, though it’s unclear if it was deleted by X or by West, who in 2021 legally changed his name to 'Ye.' His X profile page now reads, 'This account doesn’t exist.' West’s antisemitic posts were condemned by several Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, who called his rant an 'egregious display of antisemitism, racism and misogyny.' Kanye West and wife raise eyebrows during Disneyland trip 'We know this game all too well. Let's call Ye's hate-filled public rant for what it really is: a sad attempt for attention that uses Jews as a scapegoat. But unfortunately, it does get attention because Kanye has a far-reaching platform on which to spread his antisemitism and hate. Words matter. And as we’ve seen too many times before, hateful rhetoric can prompt real-world consequences,' the group said in a statement. Antisemitic tirade on X Over the course of 12 hours starting Saturday evening, West started posting hateful comments. Some of the most egregious stated, 'I AM A NAZI' and ''I LOVE HITLER.' He also posted, 'Some of my best friends are Jewish, and I don’t trust any of them,' and added that he is 'never' apologizing for his antisemitic comments. 'I’m racist stereo types (sic) exist for a reason and they all be true,' he wrote in another post. 'I don’t even know what the f--- anti Semitic means. It’s just some bull---- Jewish people made up to protect their bull----,' the rapper said in a separate post. At the end of his tirade, West posted, 'I won...I tweeted pretty much everything I felt like for 12 hours and I still have my Twitter. And most importantly my billions.' 'Thank you everyone for participating in this social experiment.' UN announces new plan to counter the surge in antisemitism The comments sparked condemnation from several celebrities, including actor David Schwimmer, who called on X owner Elon Musk to shut down West’s tirade. 'We can’t stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk,' Schwimmer posted on Instagram. 'Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence. His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,' he wrote. Piers Morgan also called out West, saying, 'So disappointed that Kanye West has deleted his X account… said nobody. From genius rap superstar to demented, vile, racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist, violence-inducing troll. What a sad, pathetic downfall.' In a statement, the American Jewish Committee said West 'continues to purposefully use his platform to spew anti-Jewish hatred. While some may dismiss his hateful rants, we cannot overlook the dangerous influence they can have on his millions of followers, particularly on social media, where a significant portion of today’s antisemitism thrives. Hate, left unchecked, only multiplies.' West sells swastika T-shirts Shortly after unleashing the hateful comments on X, West appeared in a Super Bowl commercial Sunday night directing to his website, which was selling T-shirts with Nazi swastikas. The white T-shirts with a black swastika on the front were the only items for sale on the front page of yeezy.com as of Monday afternoon. He also posted about the shirts on X, saying he's wanted to make the T-shirt 'for years' and calling them his 'greatest performance art piece thus far.' Trump is targeting antisemitism in schools. Experts fear other civil rights will be ignored West’s history of antisemitic and hateful comments West has had a history of offensive and antisemitic comments, including repeated praise of Hitler and the Nazis. His X and Instagram accounts were briefly suspended in 2022 after he posted that he was going to go 'death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,' an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale, aka 'DEFCON.' West doubled down on the controversial comments during an interview with NewsNation's Chris Cuomo at the time, saying he doesn’t 'believe in' the term 'antisemitic' and that the music industry today is 'modern-day slavery.' Cuomo questioned West if it was possible that his words violated the app’s guidelines. West responded, 'I don’t believe in that term … I classify as Jew also, so I actually can’t be an anti-Semite.' West has also suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine 'the mark of the beast.' In October 2022, he was criticized for wearing a 'White Lives Matter' T-shirt at his Paris Fashion Week show.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/kanye-west-antisemitic-rant-twitter-shutdown/	2025-02-10T11:11:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/b2da71ae010a4b09ac498ccb207c9d05.jpg?w=900
Musk calls to impeach 'corrupt' judge after DOGE access blocked	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk is calling for the impeachment of judges blocking the Department of Government Efficiency after a federal judge stopped the department from accessing Treasury Department files. Musk claimed his team needs the data to prevent fraud, accusing the judge of protecting corruption. Over the weekend, Musk criticized the judge on his social media platform X, asserting his team is working to identify waste and abuse in government systems at the direction of President Donald Trump. On Monday, Musk doubled down on his attacks, replying to a user who noted federal judges can be impeached by Congress. 'It’s time,' he said.

A hearing is set for Feb. 14. On Sunday, Musk called for the annual firing of federal judges. 'I'd like to propose that the worst 1% of appointed judges, as determined by elected bodies, be fired every year,' he wrote in a social media post. 'This will weed out the most corrupt and least competent.' In another post, he wrote, 'A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached now!'

Why was Taylor Swift booed at the Super Bowl?	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — There was no on-field celebration for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce after this Super Bowl. Only consolation far away from the prying TV cameras. The pop superstar turned up at the big game for the second consecutive year as her boyfriend and the Kansas City Chiefs tried to make history by winning a third consecutive Lombardi Trophy. Instead, Swift found herself booed by a pro-Eagles crowd and then had to endure their countless cheers as Philadelphia rolled to a 40-22 victory at the Superdome. Super Bowl halftime performer detained after ‘Gaza’ flag display Last year, Swift and Kelce locked lips on the field at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas as red and gold confetti fell like rain after the Chiefs won their second straight Super Bowl — the duo's first since becoming a sports-and-music power couple. That was a celebratory affair for Swift all night: She won a beer-chugging contest to raucous cheers from the pro-Chiefs crowd, and she spent the game partying with celebrity friends including Blake Lively and Lana Del Rey. Yet much has changed over the past 12 months. Many sports fans have turned against Swift, whom they believe gets far too much television time during NFL games. And even more fans have turned against the Chiefs, who have replaced the Patriots of Tom Brady as the juggernaut that NFL fans love to hate. So it wasn't surprising that Swift was booed when shown on the videoboards alongside rapper Ice Spice during a break in the first quarter Sunday night. She gave a bit of a side-eye look and wrinkled her nose when she realized the boos were for her. By the second half, and with the Eagles in control, the cameras were staying away from her entirely, and after the game, President Donald Trump took a dig at Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in last year's election. 'The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,' Trump posted on social media. 'She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!' Super Bowl losers get this ring instead Swift and Kelce became a couple early last season, when the four-time All-Pro tight end invited the songstress to watch him play in a game against the Bears. Kelce had famously tried and failed to deliver a friendship bracelet to Swift when she had played at Arrowhead Stadium, but she took him up on the offer to attend a game and their relationship blossomed. Perhaps being shut out at the Grammy Awards last week was a harbinger of a long, difficult night. In 2024, she had won album of the year for her 14th career Grammy a week before joining Kelce for their on-field Super Bowl celebration. That week was arguably peak Taylor and Travis, not that their stardom has dimmed since. In 2024, after the Grammys, she was in the midst of her Eras Tour and had played a concert in Tokyo before making a mad dash to Las Vegas for the game. Jalen Hurts quiets any doubters with a Super Bowl MVP This year she eased into the Big Easy, arriving in time to join Kelce on a double date with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, on Friday night. The couples dined at Lilette, a French restaurant near the Garden District. On the eve of the big game, Swift was spotted with musicians Danielle and Alana Haim at Gianna Restaurant. The big question swirling early Sunday was what might happen if Kelce won a third straight Super Bowl ring and fourth overall. Would he pick such a festive moment to propose? BetMGM Sportsbook gave 8/1 odds for those willing to wager on it. That possibility was snuffed out well before the game was over. The Chiefs fell to 19-4 with Swift in the crowd, and Sunday was the first time she saw them lose in the playoffs. 'We haven’t played that bad all year. You don’t lose like that without everything going bad,' Kelce said. Now, the question is whether the 35-year-old Kelce — who made himself scarce in the postgame locker room — will be back for another Super Bowl run. He has been noncommittal about playing next year, and some within the Chiefs organization are bracing for a potential retirement after a record-setting career that will almost certainly land him in the Hall of Fame. Should the Monday after the Super Bowl be a national holiday? Kelce has been laying the groundwork for his post-playing career for years. He has a lucrative podcast with his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, and has hosted game shows and even tried his hand at acting this past offseason. 'I’ll let Travis make that decision on his own,' said Mahomes, his closest buddy on the team. 'He knows he still has a lot of football left in him. I mean, you can see it. He always makes plays in the biggest moment, but it’s if he wants to put in that grind, because it takes it takes it to go out there and play 20 games, whatever it is, and get to the Super Bowl. 'He’s done enough to be a gold-jacket guy and first-ballot Hall of Famer,' Mahomes added, 'but I know he still has love for the game, and he’ll get to spend some time with his family and make that decision on his own.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/ap-taylor-swift-makes-her-super-bowl-return-to-watch-travis-kelce-and-his-chiefs-face-the-eagles/	2025-02-10T08:00:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67aa23dd888a17.43634509.jpeg?w=900
High levels of microplastics in human brains are increasing: Stud...	(NewsNation) — The level of microplastics in human brains has increased by 50% over the past eight years, a study released this month found. Microplastics are tiny plastic pieces less than five millimeters long, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They are harmful to the ocean and aquatic life. In recent years, microplastics have been appearing more in human brains, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers discovered, publishing their findings in the Nature Medicine research journal. Considering a juice cleanse? It may harm your health, study finds People with dementia had up to 10 times more plastic in their brains, according to the study. 'These results highlight a critical need to better understand the routes of exposure, uptake and clearance pathways and potential health consequences of plastics in human tissues, particularly in the brain,' the study said. The researchers noted they have not determined whether microplastics are causing dementia but there is an association between the two. They analyzed liver, kidney and brain tissue from autopsies conducted between 2016 and 2024 with approval from the University of New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator. It's unclear how microplastics end up in the brain. Still, lead researcher and toxicologist Matthew Campen said in a news release that most microplastics are ingested through food, especially meat bought at grocery stores. 'The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,' Campen said. 'We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/high-levels-microplastics-human-brains-study/	2025-02-10T06:23:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66b0f039131cc7.62048926.jpeg?w=900
Trump agenda faces hearings over federal buyout, citizenship rule...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump and top administration officials are openly criticizing the judiciary's authority as their sweeping agenda faces growing court challenges. Some officials, including billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have criticized a federal judge's decision blocking Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records, questioning the legitimacy of judicial oversight. Trump called the ruling 'crazy.' The administration's efforts to dismantle government agencies and the federal workforce are being held up in the courts. Judges have issued rulings temporarily blocking a deadline for mass buyouts for federal employees, an effort to place U.S. Agency for International Development workers on leave, and an executive order targeting birthright citizenship. Two judges will review cases on these issues Monday. Federal buyout deadline A federal judge will hear arguments Monday over the legality of the Trump administration's buyout offer to nearly 2 million United States federal employees. The American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees filed a lawsuit arguing the buyout is unconstitutional, asserting that only Congress has the authority to approve such measures. This buyout plan is part of Trump's broader effort to reduce the federal workforce by offering workers up to eight months of pay and benefits to leave their government jobs. It also aligns with Trump's efforts to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of the administration’s efforts to dismantle USAID. So far, more than 65,000 workers, about 2.5% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout. Federal workers have until 11:59 p.m. Monday to decide whether to accept the offer. Trump says 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum coming Monday Musk estimates the reductions could save $100 billion based on the average government salary, which is around six figures. Trump criticized the judge's decision to restrict DOGE's access, calling it 'a disgrace' late Sunday. 'We're very disappointed with the judges that would make such a ruling, but we have a long way to go,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. 'No judge should frankly be allowed to make that kind of a decision. It's a disgrace,' he said. Musk reiterates attack on judges Early Saturday, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued a preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration allowed Musk’s team access to the Treasury Department’s central payment system in violation of federal law. The payment system handles tax refunds, Social Security benefits, veterans’ benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars annually while containing an expansive network of Americans’ personal and financial data. A hearing is set for Feb. 14. Musk and his team said they are simply working to identify waste and abuse in government systems at the direction of the president. Early Monday, Musk reiterated his calls from over the weekend, writing in a social media post that 'it's time' to impeach federal judges. He also accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency of sending $59 million to luxury hotels housing illegal migrants last week and said the DOGE team will work to recoup those funds, which he said were illegally spent. Judges block birthright citizenship changes A fourth federal judge will hear arguments Monday against Trump's executive order to ban birthright citizenship. Trump Gaza plan may hurt national security: Counterterrorism expert The ACLU of New Hampshire filed a lawsuit calling for a judge to block the order, arguing it violates the 14th Amendment, endangers newborn babies, and essentially goes against core American values. Twenty-two states and several organizations have banded together to challenge the order in cases nationwide. Monday's hearing follows similar cases in Maryland, Seattle and Boston. The judges in the Maryland and Washington state cases issued indefinite injunctions against the policy change, calling it unconstitutional. The judge in Boston said Friday he would take the request from 18 state attorneys general to block the order under advisement.

(NewsNation) — President Trump’s controversial proposal to displace Palestinians from Gaza could end up undermining national security, a counterterrorism expert says. The Republican president last week suggested the U.S. could 'take over' the war-torn enclave for redevelopment. Stephen A. Smith: Trump ‘like a Realtor’ on Gaza ownership Trump said 2 million Palestinians would have to be relocated, maybe permanently, as the territory is rebuilt. The idea has been panned by Democrats and even some GOP members and notably lacks support from Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. NewsNation national security contributor Tracy Walder tells 'NewsNation Prime' that Trump’s idea could derail the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, not to mention aggravate anti-U.S. sentiment abroad. ‘No basis’ for Netanyahu arrest warrant: Ex-Netanyahu staffer Walder, a former CIA officer and FBI agent, said people living in unstable circumstances sometimes turn to 'nefarious actors, such as terrorist organizations.' Asked if U.S. ownership of Gaza helps or hurts the chances for stability there, Walder said: 'I personally believe that it hurts the matter.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-gaza-national-security/	2025-02-09T18:20:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/trumpisrael.jpg?w=900
Eagles first to score after Chiefs defer to start Super Bowl LIX	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs are vying for a historic three-peat in the NFL's title game on Sunday in New Orleans, while the Philadelphia Eagles are the only remaining team that can stop them. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are back in the Super Bowl after beating the Buffalo Bills 32-29 in a thrilling AFC championship game. They'll face Philadelphia and star running back Saquon Barkley, who ran for three touchdowns as the Eagles beat the Washington Commanders 55-23 in the NFC title game. This Super Bowl is a rematch of two years ago, when the Chiefs edged the Eagles 38-35 in Glendale, Arizona. Last year, Kansas City beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime in Las Vegas. No team has ever won three straight Super Bowls. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce won’t even be on the field at the same time as Philadelphia’s offensive front during Sunday’s Super Bowl, but it’s personal for Kelce, whose brother, Jason, was the Eagles’ center for 13 years before retiring after last season. It was the younger Kelce that gave the Eagles the first bad omen: he called tails during the coin flip, a move that, again, did not fail. The Chiefs won the coin toss and opted to defer, marking the 15th straight Super Bowl that the team who won the coin toss deferred. The Eagles were going for it on fourth-and-2 from midfield and appeared to convert a 30-yard completion. But a flag came out for Brown putting his hand on cornerback Trent McDuffie’s face, leading to the questionable penalty. A big topic heading into the game was perceived bias for officials in favor of the Chiefs. Commissioner Roger Goodell called it 'ridiculous' but those complaints will only grow louder after that first penalty. About halfway through the first quarter, it was the Eagles that scored first, going up 7-0. If you're already tired of the game, have no fear. Kendrick Lamar will be the headliner for the halftime show. The rap megastar, who has won 17 Grammys, said he’s looking forward to bringing hip-hop to the NFL’s championship game, where he performed as a guest artist with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem in 2022. Lamar will be joined on stage by Grammy winner SZA — his former Top Dawg Entertainment labelmate. The singer appeared on Lamar's recent album 'GNX' and was featured on a couple of songs including 'Gloria' and 'Luther,' which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn. The duo’s previous hits include the Oscar-nominated 'All the Stars' and 'Doves in the Wind.' Jay-Z’s Roc Nation company and Emmy-winning producer Jesse Collins will serve as co-executive producers of the halftime show. Taylor Swift will be at the Super Bowl rooting for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the Chiefs, but she’s far from the only star with a rooting interest. The Chiefs' famous fans include Paul Rudd, Rob Riggle, Heidi Gardner, Jason Sudeikis, Henry Cavill, Henry Winkler and David Koechner. Musicians Melissa Etheridge and Tech N9ne have each created songs for their team. Meanwhile, the Eagles boast a starry roster of superfans such as Bradley Cooper, Will Smith, Kevin Hart, Miles Teller, Pink, Questlove and Meek Mill. Donald Trump is making history as the first president to attend the Super Bowl while in office. Trump has said that he thinks Kansas City will win, with quarterback Patrick Mahomes the difference-maker. Trump says in a pregame interview with Fox News Channel's Brett Baier that 'I guess you have to say that when a quarterback wins as much as he’s won, I have to go with Kansas City.' Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/chiefs-take-on-the-eagles-in-super-bowl-lix/	2025-02-09T15:18:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038753963760-e1739142584466.jpg?w=800
Trump says 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum coming Monday	President Trump said he will announce 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum on Monday, adding that he would also kick off reciprocal tariffs in the days after. Trump said that the steel and aluminum tariffs would impact 'everybody' when asked what countries would be effected. 'Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25 percent tariff— aluminum too,' Trump told reporters. '25 percent… for both.' Richard Gere calls Trump a ‘bully and a thug’ at awards show He added that details of the reciprocal tariffs will be announced on Tuesday or Wednesday in a news conference. 'Very simply, if they charge us, we charge them,' he said, adding that the tariffs would go into effect 'almost immediately' and impact 'every country.' Trump has signaled that he would impose sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as tariffs on semiconductor chips, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas. On Friday, he warned that reciprocal tariffs would also be announced early next week, adding that he thinks reciprocal as opposed to a flat fee tariff is the fair approach. Trump starts term with positive approval rating in CBS poll 'In terms of tariffs, I mean we’re going to have tariffs, mostly reciprocal tariffs,' he said. 'But probably a reciprocal tariff where a country pays so much or charges us so much and we do the same, so very reciprocal. Because I think that’s the only fair way to do it, that way nobody’s hurt— they charge us we charge them… as opposed to a flat fee tariff,' he added. Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on China on Feb. 1, following through on a longstanding pledge to target Chinese goods. He delayed the 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month after speaking with both nation’s leaders last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-aluminimum-steel/	2025-02-09T14:35:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196127740.jpg?w=900
Delaware governor on Trump's threats: 'Let's govern with compassi...	Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer (D) encouraged Republicans in Washington to 'govern with compassion' amid threats to slash funding from the Department of Education. In an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt, Meyer said he is in favor of looking at ways to balance the budget and reduce wasteful government spending. But he said there's a lot of 'uncertainty' about whether programs that support poor children in his state will last. Rep. Hern defends delay on House budget proposal 'I believe in efficient spending of federal money,' Meyer said, noting that he cut property taxes as a county executive. 'The challenge that we're seeing now, I'm trying to balance the budget. I'm trying to invest in Delaware. I'm trying to make historic investments in our schools, so those NAEP scores, those assessments of the progress of our children, can both go up and that equity can increase,' he said. 'So everyone's getting an equal shot.' Meyer said it’s 'a lot harder' for families who can't rely on the status of certain federal programs, like Title I, which supplements state and local funding for 'low-achieving children, especially in high-poverty schools,' according to the Department of Education. Meyer said Title I is 'really giving kids and families, working families, a shot at making it, of ending cycles of poverty.' Similarly, Meyer stressed the importance of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which he said provides more than $30 billion to ensure children with disabilities get appropriate public education suited to their needs. 'Right now, there's uncertainty, based on the president's statement about that, those resources may be going away,' Meyer said. 'We're hoping it's replaced with other money.' 'Quite frankly, if the rules change, I'm fine with that. If it increases the efficiency of our federal, of my federal tax dollars, as a taxpayer, I like that,' he continued. 'But let's not leave anybody behind.' 'Let's govern with compassion while we're making these changes,' he added. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Rep. Hern defends delay on House budget proposal	Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, on Sunday defended Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) for the delay in unveiling a budget resolution. In an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt, Hern said Johnson’s task is especially difficult, noting the GOP can lose virtually no votes in the House, but said he is optimistic that the conference will be able to move forward with a resolution this week. Trump accelerates Guantánamo Bay migrant directive: What to know 'When you have the smallest margin in the last 150 years in Congress, we can't lose a single vote. You think about that for a second, when you have, you know, the people that represent all corners of the country, Speaker Johnson has been working very hard through the weekend to get us where we can notice a budget markup this week so we can move forward with one big, beautiful bill, as President Trump would like,' Hern told Stirewalt. Johnson, members of his leadership team and an ideological cross-section of lawmakers huddled for hours on Thursday with President Trump and Vice President Vance to discuss a framework for advancing the president's legislative wish list. These include border funding, immigration policy and an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The marathon meeting came days after Johnson was forced to scrap plans to mark up an initial budget resolution amid a conservative revolt over the level of spending cuts. The impasse in the House led top Senate Republicans to announce they would move their effort to enact Trump's agenda, threatening to steamroll the House. How GOP skeptics in the Senate got to ‘yes’ on RFK Jr., Gabbard Johnson reported 'very positive developments' after the White House meeting Thursday and sought to push back on the Senate GOP plans, insisting House Republicans were nearing the finish line — even though several thorny issues remained. Hern echoed that sentiment in the Sunday interview. 'We know how difficult it's going to be. We understand what the Senate is trying to do, in doing two bills so they move quickly. I believe we're going to get the budget resolution done so we can start working on the policy,' Hern added.

TV reporter found dead in Louisiana hotel room, woman arrested	NEW ORLEANS (NewsNation) — Police are investigating the death of a television reporter who was in New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl and on Friday announced the arrest of a woman they say used his credit card. Adan Manzano, 27, an anchor and reporter for Telemundo in Kansas City, Missouri, was found dead Wednesday in his hotel room in Kenner, a suburb just outside New Orleans, police said. Police on Thursday evening arrested Louisiana resident Danette Colbert, 48. She is facing four felony charges, as well as a misdemeanor fraud and theft charge, Kenner Police Deputy Chief Mark McCormick said. Missing Alaska flight found with no survivors: What to know She also faces a state felony charge of possession of a stolen firearm, but Kenner Police do not believe it's related to Manzano's case, St. Tammany Sheriff’s Office Lt. Suzanne Carboni said. Colbert was seen on security video footage arriving with Manzano at his hotel room around 5 a.m. the day of his death and then leaving without him about an hour later, police said. She used Manzano's credit card at several stores in the area and authorities later located Manzano's credit card and cellphone at Colbert's residence in Slidell, northeast of New Orleans they said. Police also uncovered narcotics at Colbert's residence, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said Friday during a press conference. Investigators believe Colbert acted alone, he said. A phone number affiliated with Colbert’s residence was disconnected and no one responded to a message sent to an email associated with her. Conley described Colbert as a 'career criminal' known to New Orleans police for 'fraud schemes.' 'Everybody should be aware of their surroundings,' Conley said. 'This brings to light that there are people out there that prey on other people and bring them into their confidence and victimize them.' PHOTOS: Investigators examine, document aircraft wreckage following deadly plane crash near DCA Colbert was twice arrested in 2022 in Las Vegas on felony charges of grand larceny and administering a drug to aid in a felony crime, court records show. In both cases, Colbert was accused of drugging men in their hotel rooms on the Las Vegas Strip and stealing from them, according to Daniel Lippmann, the attorney who represented her. Lippmann told The Associated Press that both cases were later dismissed because the victims did not want to testify in court. Lippmann said he had no comment on the new allegations against Colbert. One of the victims told police he woke up alone and with a bloody nose after going up to his hotel room with Colbert, who he met at a bar, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in 2022. He said missing from his room was $50,000 in cash, a Rolex watch, $11,000 in poker chips, his phone and a designer luggage bag. And last year, a Louisiana jury found Colbert guilty of theft and fraud charges. She was ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution, according to Orleans Parish court records. Telemundo Kansas City General Manager Steve Downing said Manzano was a 'rising star' and 'true professional' — a bilingual television anchor and reporter who loved sports, and had covered the Kansas City Chiefs ′ past two Super Bowl victories. He hoped to see a record third straight win Sunday. New law punishing ‘sextortion’ a good start, grieving father says 'You would always see him with a smile on his face, he enjoyed the work that he did,' Downing said. 'He was very committed to serving the local community by providing them the best in sports news.' Kenner police are awaiting the results of the coroner’s full autopsy, which will determine whether Manzano's death was a homicide, Conley said. The coroner's office is conducting toxicology tests, and results are expected to take three to four weeks, Jefferson Parish Director of Forensic Operations Tim Genevay said. There was no obvious physical trauma found on Manzano's body, he added. Manzano was born in Mexico City and later moved to Kansas, NBC affiliate KSNT reported. He leaves behind a 2-year-old daughter. He had been raising her on his own with help from family after his wife died last year in a car accident, Downing said.

Millions in US under winter storm alerts	(NewsNation) — Large areas of the nation are digging out after a strong storm brought moderate to heavy snowfall across parts of the Upper Great Lakes on Saturday before intensifying overnight across the Northeast. The National Weather Service said a storm over the central and southern plains will move northeastward, producing a swath of 4 to 8 inches of snow across parts of Minnesota and the Great Lakes. How to get free Starbucks after the Super Bowl Saturday night into Sunday, upstate New York and New England could see up to a foot of accumulation. Hazardous travel conditions were likely due to low visibility and snow-covered roads. In the meantime, a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley into the northern Mid-Atlantic region could result in significant icing in the Central Appalachians, forecasters said. Freezing rain on roadways was expected to make travel dangerous, and power outages were possible. The snow snarled air traffic across the Northwest on Sunday with Boston Logan International Airport reporting 100 cancellations. All New York-area airports report delays as well. 'One good thing with this storm, it is moving pretty quickly, so it’s not gonna be a prolonged winter weather event,' said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland. 'It looks like the snow will definitely be coming to an end earlier in the day on Sunday, after which the weather will be fairly tranquil for a few days.'

How GOP skeptics in the Senate got to 'yes' on RFK Jr., Gabbard	WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican skepticism in the Senate of President Donald Trump’sCabinet nominees has been worn down, putting his unconventional choices for some of the most powerful positions in the federal government on the verge of confirmation. Floor votes are expected this week on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in line to be the nation's health secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, the choice for director of national intelligence. Both are from outside traditional Republican circles and espoused views in the confirmation process that alarmed GOP senators at times. Still, their nominations have advanced to the full Senate after crucial committee votes. One by one, Republicans have acquiesced to Trump's picks, even those whose personal history, lack of experience and unorthodox views would have once made them hardly imaginable for a Cabinet. It's a striking demonstration of how GOP lawmakers are standing by as Trump, in a show of force, disrupts the federal government and installs loyalists to lead key departments. Republican leaders in the Senate, eager to show Trump their worth, have chalked up confirmations at a rapid clip. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, just a month into the role, has lined up a vote on Gabbard as the first order of business, followed by Kennedy later in the week. Already on the job is Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who faced allegations over drinking and aggressive behavior toward women. And Republicans appear ready to soon install Kash Patel as FBI director. Those four nominees were long seen on Capitol Hill as the most vulnerable to losing support from Republicans, who hold a Senate majority by three seats. 'There’s never any guarantees, but we’re trending in the right direction,' Thune, R-S.D., said as the Senate wrapped up its work Thursday night and dozens of Republicans headed to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort to meet with the president over the weekend. Thune's cautious optimism followed a week where the prospect of opposition from Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Todd Young of Indiana — both of whom have tried to maintain some independence from Trump — threatened to derail Kennedy and Gabbard. But after a series of intense phone calls and negotiations led by Vice President JD Vance, even in the moments leading up to committee votes Tuesday, the new leadership team persuaded the key holdouts to come around. Both walked away from the talks speaking of assurances the nominees would restrain some of their more worrisome views. The collapse of resistance has set a new tone in the Republican-controlled government and shown how even the most independent-minded lawmaker would rather work with Trump than risk crossing him. Trump himself has refrained from the threats to GOP skeptics that defined his first term and relied on Vance, a former Ohio senator, to quietly walk some of his former colleagues through their concerns. 'You can’t think of this just as a normal president coming into office for the first time,' said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who was involved in the effort to get Trump's nominees across the finish line. 'Everybody I was dealing with was truly undecided trying to get to yes, and so it was just a process.' It didn't always look that easy. Cassidy, a liver doctor, told Kennedy during a committee hearing that he was 'struggling' to support the nomination because Kennedy had built a following as a vaccine skeptic and refused to denounce a discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. Cassidy cited his ethics as a doctor — 'dedicating my life to saving lives' — as a chief cause for his concern. Young, a former intelligence officer in the Marine Corps, questioned past statements that Gabbard has made, including support for government leaker Edward Snowden and expressions of sympathy for Russia. Young said he sought written assurances from Gabbard that she would punish those who disclose sensitive government intelligence. Vance played a crucial role, brokering a letter from Gabbard that spelled out those assurances. 'I got them at the 11th hour,' Young said after his committee vote for Gabbard. Young said Vance approached him with a 'respectful' tone and 'listened a lot more than he talked.' It's a change from Vance's Senate tenure, when he often defied the GOP leadership under Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell. Now Vance is working closely with the new team. A similar process played out with Cassidy. He said he voted to advance Kennedy after 'intense conversations' and reassurances on how health agencies would handle vaccine recommendations. The senator thanked Vance for his 'honest counsel.' Cassidy and Young insisted that the political fallout from blocking Trump's Cabinet picks did not factor into their negotiations, but the stakes were clear. Cassidy, who is up for reelection in two years, already has a primary challenger after voting to convict Trump on an impeachment charge in 2021 stemming from Trump's role in the Capitol riot. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said that regardless whether Trump offers senators such as Cassidy or Young a campaign endorsement, no Republican wants to openly defy the president. 'I think that Donald Trump at his heart is ultimately a transactional guy,' Cramer said, adding, 'Whether you ever get an endorsement out of it, not having an active enemy. He can be pretty effective as you know and he's proven, so nobody wants to be in that spot.' That leaves Democrats almost powerless to stand in the way of Trump's Cabinet selections. With Republican support in line, Democrats had little recourse but to draw out the process through every procedural move possible. They are also trying to hold the Senate floor for maximum debate time to slow the pace of votes. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he hoped the tactic would call attention to Trump's expansion of presidential power and help 'persuade the American people to express outrage to their members of Congress, particularly from the red states, where so far their senators have been unwilling or unable to listen.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-how-republican-skeptics-in-the-senate-got-to-yes-on-rfk-jr-and-gabbard/	2025-02-09T04:47:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a8a4ad4354e5.77916511.jpeg?w=900
Trump accelerates Guantánamo Bay migrant directive: What to know	Trump administration officials are rapidly moving forward with President Trump’s directive to turn Guantánamo Bay into a facility that could hold up to 30,000 migrants who are being deported from the United States. Since announcing the move Jan. 29, the Pentagon flew 10 migrants described as 'high-threat individuals' to the facility in Cuba less than a week later, while Defense Department and Homeland Security officials work to put the infrastructure in place to meet the demands of Trump’s order. Officials have been less clear about the long-term prospects of using Guantánamo Bay as a migrant facility. Here’s what to know so far about the effort. Trump ordered a 30,000-person facility The president in late January signed a memo directing the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to prepare a 30,000-person migrant facility at Guantánamo Bay, a facility in Cuba that has been used to house military prisoners, including several Al Qaeda operatives linked to the 9/11 attacks. The order did not outline any specific timeline for establishing the facility, but U.S. troops arrived at the base in recent days to provide support with construction of tents near an existing migration detention facility. 'Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold them because we don’t want them coming back, so we’re going to send them out to Guantánamo,' Trump said of plans for the expanded migrant facility. 'This will double our capacity immediately. And tough, it’s a tough place to get out of.' Semafor reported that the Trump administration is in discussions with Willscot, a company that specializes in mobile offices and shipping containers, about providing temporary space to hold migrants at Guantánamo. The order is the latest step in a government-wide effort enacted by the Trump administration to remove certain immigrants from the United States. The White House has touted agreements with Colombia, El Salvador and Venezuela where those countries would accept deportees. Migrants already flown to Guantanamo The first flight of migrants to Guantánamo Bay took place this week, with a small number of individuals arriving on Wednesday. The Pentagon announced 10 'high-threat illegal aliens' were sent to the facility. Those individuals are being held in vacant detention facilities, the Pentagon said, until they can be transported to their home country or another destination. 'The detention of these high-threat illegal aliens at Guantánamo Bay is a temporary measure, and the Department of Defense will continue to support the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies in their efforts to facilitate the removal of the aliens as soon as possible,' the Pentagon said in a statement. While other flights to Guantánamo are expected in the coming weeks, the Pentagon has been using military aircraft to deport immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally back to their country of origin. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested Guantánamo Bay could be used as an interim holding space for migrants while the U.S. reaches agreements with other countries to process deportees. Officials won't rule out sending women, children Trump administration officials have signaled that the migrants who will be kept at Guantánamo are violent criminals and single men. But as facilities to hold thousands of migrants are erected, officials have not ruled out the possibility that women and children might end up there at some point. 'So remember that Guantánamo Bay clearly, by this president, has said that it will hold the worst of the worst, that we are going after those bad actors,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on NBC. 'These are the types of individuals that we are targeting, we're removing from communities, and that could end up having a stay at Guantanamo Bay before they are returned home to their countries to deal with.' Pressed multiple times on 'Meet the Press' whether women, children and families could be held at Guantánamo, Noem would not directly answer. Instead, she reiterated the administration was focused on targeting 'the worst of the worst.' Scrutiny of conditions Trump critics and watchdog groups are expected to keep a close watch on the treatment of migrants and the conditions they’re kept in at Guantánamo Bay, given the facility’s reputation. Guantánamo Bay is best known as a military base where terror suspects are held. It became infamous for accusations of torture and abuse as the U.S. carried out the war on terrorism. The Biden administration sought to wind down operations at the facility, and there are 15 prisoners still there. Noem has said the administration intends to follow due process with migrants at Guantánamo so that those being held there would have the same rights they would if detained in the United States. The secretary also said the administration does not plan on holding migrants at Guantánamo long-term. 'The plan is to have a process that we follow that's laid out in law and make sure that we're dealing with these individuals appropriately according to what the state and the national…law directs,' Noem said. 'So we will work with Congress to make sure that we're addressing our legal immigration laws and using Guantanamo Bay appropriately. But it is an asset that we have that we fully intend to utilize.' Some Democratic lawmakers have argued the use of such a notorious facility to house migrants is intended as a scare tactic as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration. 'It's all about scaring and intimidating people,' Sen. Mark Kelly (R-Ariz.) said. 'It's the same thing for Guantanamo Bay. Building a facility there is because it just sounds very frightening to a lot of folks.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-accelerates-guantanamo-bay-migrant-directive-what-to-know/	2025-02-09T04:16:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Guantanamo_020825_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=900
7 competitive primaries to watch in 2026	Primary battles are already underway in key Senate and gubernatorial races ahead of the 2026 midterms, an election that will determine not only control of Congress but also the governorships in several states. Retirements and term limits have triggered wide-open contests that are poised to become packed with candidates, while a few potentially vulnerable incumbents seem like they could face a serious primary challenge for another term. Here’s seven primaries to watch as the 2026 elections approach: California gubernatorial primary The race to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has already been underway for more than a year and a half, and no candidate has emerged as a clear frontrunner. The Democratic field is already loaded with several prominent current and former California politicians, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former state Senate pro tempore Toni Atkins, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. But no candidate has pulled away, leaving the door open for others with a larger national profile. The most prominent rumored candidate is former Vice President Harris, coming off a narrow loss to President Trump in November. Others have speculated she would instead plan another presidential run in 2028 instead. Harris brushed aside questions about her future on Friday, saying she will be in touch with her community and leaders to 'figure out what I can do to support them.' If Harris doesn’t run, a favorite could be former Rep. Katie Porter (D), who has appeared to express interest in the role. Some hypothetical polling has found her as the leader if she enters the race. California’s electoral system features a top-two primary in which all candidates appear on the same ballot and the two highest finishers advance to the general election. Republicans will also take part in the primary, but a Democrat will be the favorite to win the race in the blue stronghold. Florida GOP gubernatorial primary Along with Newsom, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is one of the most prominent governors in the country, and the race to succeed him will likely be fierce. No one has officially announced their candidacy yet, but a few possible candidates have expressed interest. Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) could be an early favorite as a close ally of Trump and someone who has increasingly taken on a national profile. Sources have said Donalds has approached Florida donors about running and brought on several staffers, including Trump 2016 and 2024 pollster Tony Fabrizio. One poll from last month showed Donalds clearly ahead of other potential candidates, but most voters were undecided. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) told The Tampa Bay Times last month that he was thinking about running, saying he has a 'compelling vision' for Florida. The controversial former House member was Trump’s first choice for attorney general before he withdrew amid an Ethics Committee probe into him and accusations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he denies. State Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez are other possible candidates, but the biggest wildcard may be Florida first lady Casey DeSantis. NBC News reported Thursday that the governor’s wife is considering a run, which would be her first for political office. Louisiana GOP Senate primary Sen. Bill Cassidy (R) has been a possible target for a primary challenge since his condemnation of Trump’s role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and for voting to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial on incitement of insurrection. Trump has repeatedly criticized Cassidy, who has already picked up at least one primary challenge. Louisiana state Treasurer John Fleming announced in December that he would challenge Cassidy for the GOP nomination, saying the state needed a 'true conservative voice.' Cassidy’s campaign has projected confidence at his prospects, noting his large amount of cash on hand and voting record overwhelmingly supporting Trump initiatives. But others could join the race too, including Rep. Clay Higgins (R). One additional obstacle for Cassidy may be the repeal of Louisiana’s 'jungle' primary in which all candidates appeared on the same ballot and the top two advanced to the general election. Starting in 2026, candidates for Senate will take part in partisan primaries, leaving Cassidy to campaign just for Republicans and unaffiliated voters. Michigan Senate primaries The race for Michigan’s Senate seat in 2026 suddenly came to life at the end of last month when Sen. Gary Peters (D) announced he wouldn’t seek a third term in office. Possible candidates on both sides of the aisle quickly indicated they were considering a bid, and the primaries for both could get crowded. On the Democratic side, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg seems to be inching toward announcing his candidacy after moving to Michigan in 2022. Polling shows, and analysts said, he would likely be an early frontrunner, but he could be joined in the race by candidates like Reps. Haley Stevens and Hillary Scholten and state Attorney General Dana Nessel. For the GOP, the 2024 Republican nominee for Senate, former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), has said he’s thinking of trying again after losing by less than 20,000 votes in November. But he could face opponents like 2022 GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon and Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), among others. New York Democratic gubernatorial primary Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) is seeking her second full term in office after becoming governor in the aftermath of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) resignation from office and her own successful election. But her favorability rating has been poor for months, and she seems likely to face significant obstacles to reelection, potentially both in the primary and general election if she wins the Democratic nomination. A poll this month from Siena College found only one in three New York voters would reelect her, while 57 percent said they would prefer someone else. Among Democrats, only 55 percent view her favorably. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) has been a sharp critic of Hochul and seems most likely to challenge her in the primary. He called Hochul the 'new Joe Biden' in not understanding their vulnerabilities and that they should drop out of their election. He also argued that Trump’s improvement in the Democratic stronghold in November shows a 'vote of no confidence' in the state’s leadership. If he goes forward, Torres could give Hochul an intense challenge. Ohio GOP gubernatorial primary Vivek Ramaswamy is widely expected to join the race to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine (R) this month and will be a quick favorite for the nomination. Ramaswamy’s profile rose significantly in the GOP presidential primaries and as a close ally to Trump, and he’s already received significant support before even launching his bid. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) have all declared their support for him, and some of Vice President Vance’s top political advisers are expected to be part of his campaign team. He won’t be alone in the primary, as state Attorney General Dave Yost has already declared his candidacy. Yost has had extensive experience in Ohio politics. But Ramaswamy seems to be in a strong position. A poll from Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates showed Ramaswamy with 52 percent in a hypothetical GOP primary to Yost’s 18 percent. State Treasurer Robert Sprague was expected to run but declined and endorsed Ramaswamy. Texas GOP Senate primary Texas Sen. John Cornyn (R) is set to run for his fifth term in the Senate, but he may face the biggest challenge of his career from state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R). Cornyn and Paxton have sparred for years over various issues. Paxton has accused Cornyn of being insufficiently conservative and attacked him for his support for additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and the gun safety bill. Cornyn has slammed Paxton over the attorney general’s legal issues and 2023 impeachment. Paxton has said he would decide whether to run in the next few months and an aide told The Hill he’s meeting with donors and voters across the state. The potential matchup could become the latest proxy battle between two wings of the state party, the establishment and the staunch conservatives. The battle has taken place recently in the state House and in Paxton’s impeachment trial, in which he was acquitted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/7-competitive-primaries-to-watch-in-2026/	2025-02-09T04:14:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Competitive-Primaries_020825_Illustration_CJGNAP.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are examining the wreckage after an American Airlines plane and Black Hawk helicopter collided midair near Reagan National Airport (DCA), killing 67 people. The crash happened on the evening of Jan. 29, sending both aircraft into the Potomac River below. Since the collision, crews have recovered and identified the remains of all 67 victims. Congress eyes probe, reforms in response to aircraft tragedy In an update on Thursday, Feb. 6, authorities said crews had removed all large, major wreckage components from the plane and jet and that the pieces would be taken to a secure location to be examined by investigators.

DOGE siege of USAID dominated week in politics	(NewsNation) — By now, the average American may be more familiar with two acronyms that are grabbing headlines in Washington and beyond: DOGE and USAID. The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is headed by 'special government employee' Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. With President Trump’s blessing, DOGE is scrutinizing spending at federal agencies, including the United States Agency for International Development. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? USAID operations have effectively been put on hold, less than three weeks after Trump began his second term in office. Proponents of the agency say it pays dividends by promoting democracy when it assists struggling foreign nations. But people in Trump’s corner say USAID has funded several questionable programs, such as efforts to promote 'Diversity, Equity and Inclusion' across the globe. NewsNation’s Mills Hayes reports that not all of the information cited by Trump representatives bear out, although USAID did offer Serbia a $1.5 million grant to advance DEI in the workplace. Other examples offered by the White House — such as $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia and $32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru — were efforts funded by a different federal entity, the U.S. State Department. Ex-administrators of USAID defend agency targeted by Trump On the flipside, USAID has disbursed millions to fight AIDS in Africa; conserve the Amazon Rainforest in South America and support a United Nations food program. USAID has also distributed U.S. agricultural products, and $34 million in rice, soybean and wheat purchases are on hold, the Washington Post reports. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration’s attempts to place 2,200 USAID employees on paid leave. Meantime, Musk’s DOGE has also set its sights on the U.S. Department of Education. Concerned about the ramifications, Democratic members of Congress sought to enter the agency’s Washington headquarters last week but were locked out. DOGE actions ‘long overdue, much welcomed’: House speaker 'The Democrats have lost their minds,' Trump said in response. 'They tried to break into the Department of Education just because we want to go and check the books.' Musk also is facing scrutiny over the young DOGE team he’s hired as reports surface about their prior businesses and online activity. A 19-year-old DOGE member started a company that hired convicted hackers, and WIRED reports that company has at least two Russian-registered domains. Another DOGE staffer reposted comments from white nationalists and misogynists on social media, and a third staffer resigned after past racist posts were made public.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-usaid-trump-musk/	2025-02-08T18:01:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/aid_f85fd1.jpg?w=900
Trump says he won't deport Prince Harry: 'He’s got enough problem...	(The Hill) — President Trump said on Friday that he is 'not interested' in deporting Harry, who currently resides in Montecito, Calif., with his wife, Meghan Markle. 'I don’t want to do that,' Trump told the New York Post. 'I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.' In February last year, Trump accused former President Biden's administration of 'protecting Harry,' adding that he wouldn't do the same if he wins the White House. Will Casey DeSantis run for governor of Florida? 'He betrayed the queen. That’s unforgivable,' Trump told the U.K.’s Daily Express in an interview, adding that Harry 'would be on his own' if reelected. Trump, in his Friday interview with the New York Post, went on to state he thinks 'poor Harry' is 'whipped' by Markle. Trump has previously criticized Prince Harry and Markle over their reported differences with the royal family. In 2023, he told radio host Hugh Hevitt, 'I didn’t like the idea that they [Harry and Markle] were getting U.S. security when they came over here.' The royal couple has also voiced disapproval of Trump over the years, with Markle calling the president 'divisive' and 'misogynistic' during the 2016 presidential race. Trump later called Markle's comments about him 'nasty.' Democrats call stop work order at CFPB ‘illegal’ On Friday, Trump praised Prince Harry's brother, Prince William, calling him a 'great young man.' The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has probed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for information about Prince Harry's immigration status. The think tank alleged the department 'may have improperly granted' his visa after the royal family member disclosed personal drug use in his memoir 'Spare.' In 2023, the DHS request was declined, but a judge is still considering the case, per the Associated Press.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-says-he-wont-deport-prince-harry-hes-got-enough-problems-with-his-wife/	2025-02-08T13:53:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP24246656702909-e1739049032116.jpg?w=800
Missing Alaska flight found with no survivors: What to know	(The Hill) — A small commuter aircraft that crashed in western Alaska Thursday was found on sea ice on Friday, with officials announcing that all 10 individuals aboard died. This incident marks one of the most lethal accidents in the state over the past quarter-century. The plane, operated by Bering Air, had been traveling from Unalakleet to Nome when it vanished on Thursday, only to be found the next day. This accident comes just weeks after two other aviation incidents took place last month. A deadly midair collision near Reagan Washington National Airport killed 67 people, and a fatal crash in Philadelphia claimed seven lives. Following these incidents, President Trump pledged to overhaul the Federal Aviation Administration, including by naming a new acting leader and updating the nation’s air traffic control system. 'My heart is broken over the news out of Nome. Alaska is a big small town,' Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.) wrote on the social platform X about Thursday's crash. 'When tragedy strikes, we’re never far removed from the Alaskans directly impacted. But that also means we come together as a community to grieve and heal.' Rescue teams used helicopters to search for the plane's last known position when they discovered the wreckage on Friday, according to Mike Salerno, a representative from the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were deployed to assess the situation. The Coast Guard reported that the aircraft vanished approximately 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. According to radar forensic data from the U.S. Civil Air Patrol, at around 3:18 p.m., the plane experienced some sort of incident that led to a rapid decrease in altitude and speed. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said he could not 'speculate on what that incident was.' McIntyre-Coble also mentioned that there were no distress signals received from the aircraft, which is equipped with an emergency locating transmitter. This device, when submerged in seawater, sends a signal to a satellite that subsequently alerts the Coast Guard if an aircraft is in trouble. He claimed the Coast Guard had not received any such messages. According to Lt. Ben Endres from the Alaska State Troopers, there were ten adults on board, and the flight was a standard commuter service. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/missing-alaska-flight-found-with-no-survivors-what-to-know/	2025-02-08T13:40:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25039047289471-e1739050400295.jpg?w=800
What we know about the commuter plane crash in Alaska	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Authorities are working to recover the wreckage of a plane crash in western Alaska that killed 10 people while investigators are trying to determine what caused the small commuter aircraft to go down in the icy Bering Sea. The single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet to the hub community of Nome when it disappeared Thursday afternoon. The Bering Airplane was found the next day after an extensive search. Nine passengers and the pilot were killed. Crews on Saturday were racing to recover the wreckage and the remains of those killed in the crash before expected high winds and snow. Here are things to know about the plane crash, which is one of the deadliest plane crashes in the state in 25 years. Bryan Kohberger case: Expert explains how a firing squad works The plane was reported missing near Nome Officials said contact with the Cessna Caravan was lost less than an hour after it left Unalakleet on Thursday. Authorities said the flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, and the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. The wreckage was found Friday by rescuers who were searching by helicopter. Local, state and federal agencies scoured large stretches of icy waters and miles of frozen tundra before finding the plane. A Black Hawk helicopter will be used to move the aircraft once the bodies are removed, officials said. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the world’s most famous sled dog race. Nome is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. Who are the Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for Israeli hostages? The cause of the crash is under investigation The National Transportation Safety Board is sending people from various states to investigate the crash. Radar data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed, but it is not clear why that happened, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. If a plane is exposed to seawater, an emergency locating transmitter sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message to the Coast Guard. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard. Flying is an important mode of transportation in the largest U.S. state Alaska's vast landscape and limited infrastructure makes traveling by plane a common thing. Most communities are not connected to the developed road system that serves the state’s most populous region. Some high school teams fly to sporting events against rival high schools, and goods are brought to many communities by barge or by air. Mother, son die from food poisoning at Dominican Republic resort Who was on the plane? Authorities said all 10 people on board the plane were adults. Among those killed were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson. They had traveled to Unalakleet to service a heat-recovery system vital to the community’s water plant, according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. The identities of the others killed in the crash have not been released. 'At this time, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy,' the flight operator Bering Air wrote in a statement on its website. 'We recognize the profound loss this has caused, and we want to extend our sincerest condolences to everyone impacted.' The flight company said it had set up telephone hotlines staffed with specialists to provide emotional support and updates to people who had loved ones on the flight. Other recent U.S. plane crashes are also under investigation The Alaska plane’s crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/ap-heres-what-we-know-about-a-commuter-plane-crash-in-alaska-that-killed-10-people/	2025-02-08T12:38:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a7c157a3f282.46489531.jpeg?w=900
Spending bill talks bog down after Trump's efforts to slash gover...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they have to deal with some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year's spending bills. It's a task that by all accounts is not going well. The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills in Washington. But Trump's first weeks in office have escalated tensions between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional approval. A look at where the talks stand: Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January; aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But optimism has faded in recent days. 'Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they walked away from talks. But it’ll have to resume,' House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said Thursday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave a similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as though they are 'trying to set up some sort of government shutdown, which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they’ve been sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So I hope we can get back to it.' Rep. Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as Thursday so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. 'But, we're not making the progress I would hope,' said Cole, R-Okla. Democrats dispute GOP leadership's characterization Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said 'that is false' in response to the assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. 'The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from the table,' DeLauro said. Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro 'has been trying to get Republicans to respond to her for weeks.' 'I’m hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at the table and reach a spending agreement, in the best interest of the American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors,' Jeffries said. Tensions over topline spending levels Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., worked out with then-President Joe Biden, spending for defense and nondefense would increase by 1% for the current budget year, which began Oct. 1. That would bring the tallies to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for nondefense. Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of an inflation, at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. 'That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people,' Jeffries said. Republicans don't see it that way. Cole said Democrats are having a hard time adjusting to the reality of Trump being in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress. 'We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don't have those anymore,' Cole said. 'And in particular, the president doesn't feel bound by an agreement made by another president that didn't go down on his watch.' Cole said that 'there's only one signature that matters right now and it's not Joe Biden's anymore.' Democrats wary as Trump and Musk revamp federal government Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to Trump's first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to resign, entire agencies are dismantled and Elon Musk's team from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive information of countless Americans. They are worried about how current government services are being affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending bill negotiations. 'The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in Congress,' said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 'It is up to our Republican colleagues to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real.' DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. 'You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And that's got to be it. Those assurances have to be made,' DeLauro said. Plan B If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure, then it's possible that they could also pass another temporary measure to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they try to work out their differences. Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions or CRs in Washington parlance, generally fund government programs and agencies at current levels. 'I don't want a CR,' Cole said. 'But I certainly prefer a CR to a shutdown.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-spending-bill-talks-bog-down-after-trumps-efforts-to-slash-government/	2025-02-08T06:58:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a771af631da7.21811593.jpeg?w=900
Dem AGs sue over DOGE access to Treasury payment systems	(The Hill) — A coalition of 19 Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Friday night over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury Department payment systems that dole out trillions of dollars in payments annually. The lawsuit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and announced earlier in the week, is the latest legal resistance against billionaire Elon Musk’s sweeping moves to reshape and dismantle parts of the federal bureaucracy. 'As the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is not used to being told ‘no,’ but in our country, no one is above the law,' James said in a statement. The states that sued alongside New York are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. In a separate lawsuit, the Justice Department earlier this week agreed to temporarily limit DOGE’s access to Treasury Department systems. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., let two special government employees with ties to DOGE maintain 'read-only' access to the systems while litigation continues — but one of those two employees tendered his resignation after several racist social media posts were exposed by the Wall Street Journal. An account associated with the employee, 25-year-old Marko Elez, posted to 'Normalize Indian hate' and that 'you could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity,' according to the Journal. But later Friday, after launching a poll on X, Musk said he would rehire the staffer. The attorneys general mentioned the posts in their complaint. In statements announcing the lawsuit, the attorneys generals took sharp aim at DOGE and its leadership as the group implants itself in the executive branch, agency by agency. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called DOGE’s access to the Treasury systems a 'coup, plain and simple,' deriding Musk as an 'unelected weirdo billionaire' and his team as a 'group of teenage hackers.' Aaron Ford, Nevada’s attorney general, said Trump has the right to 'lawfully' enact his policies but claimed the Treasury access was 'illegally provided' to Musk and DOGE. And Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul accused Trump of putting 'the whims of Elon Musk' ahead of Americans’ privacy and security. 'We’ve gone to court to address this outrageous situation and to protect the American people,' Kaul said. Earlier in the week, the Justice Department in a separate lawsuit agreed to temporarily limit DOGE’s access to Treasury Department systems, which dole out trillions of dollars of payments annually, until the next stage of the case. The lawsuit is just one emerging battle over Musk’s plans to slash trillions of dollars in federal spending, which has led his team to seize access to agencies across the government. Legal efforts have also been waged against the DOGE team’s efforts in the Education and Labor departments. One group of plaintiffs has vowed to expand their lawsuit over the weekend to cover the Department of Health and Human Services and the Consumer Protection Financial Protection Bureau.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dem-ags-sue-over-doge-access-to-treasury-payment-systems/	2025-02-08T04:21:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25038705847158-e1738980938543.jpg?w=800
Who are the Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for Israel...	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Israel on Saturday is releasing 183 Palestinian prisoners in the latest exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, part of a ceasefire that has paused the war but whose future is uncertain. Israel views the security prisoners as terrorists, while Palestinians see them as freedom fighters resisting a decades-long military occupation. Nearly every Palestinian has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel at some point, for militant attacks or lesser offenses like rock-throwing, protesting or membership in a banned political group. Some are held for months or years without trial in what is known as administrative detention, which Israel says is needed to prevent attacks and avoid sharing sensitive intelligence. Eighteen of those released Saturday had been sentenced to life and 54 were serving long sentences for their involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. Seven of those convicted of the most serious crimes will be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation. Among those being released are 111 Palestinians who were rounded up after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which triggered the war. They have been detained without trial. Here’s a look at some prominent Palestinian prisoners released since the truce went into effect on Jan. 19. Iyad Abu Shakhdam Abu Shakhdam, 49, was sentenced to the equivalent of 18 life sentences over his involvement in Hamas attacks that killed dozens of Israelis during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, between 2000 and 2005. Among the most infamous of those attacks was a double suicide bombing that blew up two buses in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba in 2004, killing 16 Israelis, including a 4-year-old, and wounding over 100 others. In interviews with Arabic media, he described his militancy as a desire for revenge stemming from his brother’s killing by Israeli security forces in 2000. Abu Shakhdam was on the run for weeks before his arrest in his hometown of Hebron in the West Bank in November 2004, following a gunfight with Israeli security forces in which he was shot 10 times. During 21 years in prison, his family said, he finished high school and earned a certificate for courses in psychology. Jamal al-Tawil Al-Tawil, 61, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank, has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prison, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings. Most recently, the Israeli military arrested al-Tawil 2021, saying that he had participated in violent riots and mobilized Hamas political activists in Ramallah, the seat of the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority and Hamas' main rival. He had been held without charge or trial since then. After his arrest, he went on hunger strike for more than three weeks to protest his administrative detention. During one of al-Tawil's stints in Israeli prison in the early 2000s, he ran a successful electoral campaign from custody to become mayor of Al-Bireh, a West Bank town abutting Ramallah. U.S. court documents from 2007, filed by the families of Israelis killed during the second intifada, show that al-Tawil had served for years as chairman of Al-Islah Charitable Society, a front organization to raise money for Hamas. The case accused al-Tawil of recruiting a Hamas militant to carry out a 2001 suicide bombing that targeted a crowded pedestrian mall in Jerusalem, killing 11 people. His daughter, 32-year-old journalist Bushra al-Tawil, was among the dozens of women and teenagers released in the first round of prisoner-for-hostage exchanges on Jan. 19. He and another prisoner were immediately taken to a hospital for medical treatment after their release on Saturday. Mohammed el-Halabi The Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization, was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas in a high-profile case that drew criticism from rights groups. He was freed on Feb. 1. Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. One independent audit found that el-Halabi had enforced internal controls and ordered employees to avoid anyone suspected of Hamas ties. Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them. U.N. experts say el-Halabi was questioned for 50 days without access to a lawyer. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Israel has attributed the closed hearings to sensitive security information being relayed. Shadi Amouri Amouri, 44, from the northern West Bank city of Jenin, was arrested for his alleged role in manufacturing the powerful car bomb that detonated beside an Israeli bus packed with passengers on June 5, 2002, killing 17 Israelis in what became known as the Megiddo Junction suicide bombing. The attack during the second intifada took place in northern Israel. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. Amouri was sentenced to life in prison, plus 20 years. He was among those transferred to Egypt on Feb. 1 and released into exile. Zakaria Zubeidi Zakaria Zubeidi is a prominent former militant leader and theater director whose dramatic jailbreak in 2021 thrilled Palestinians across the Middle East and stunned the Israeli security establishment. Zubeidi was a senior militant in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade in the urban Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. After the second intifada in 2006, he co-founded a theater in Jenin to promote what he described as cultural resistance to Israel. The Freedom Theater has put on everything from Shakespeare to stand-up comedy to plays written by residents. In 2019, after Zubeidi had already served years in prison for attacks in the early 2000s, Israel arrested him again over his alleged involvement in shooting attacks that targeted buses of Israeli settlers but caused no injuries. Zubeidi, who was released on Jan. 30 into the West Bank, had been awaiting trial in prison. He denies the charges, saying that he gave up militancy to focus on his political activism after the intifada. In 2021, he and five other prisoners tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel. All six were recaptured days later. Mohammed Abu Warda A Hamas militant during the second intifada, Abu Warda helped organize a series of suicide bombings that killed over 40 people and wounded more than a hundred others. Israel arrested him in 2002, and sentenced him to 48 terms of lifetime imprisonment, among the longest sentences it ever issued. As a young student, Abu Warda joined Hamas at the start of the intifada following Israel’s killing of Yahya Ayyash, the militant group’s leading bomb maker, in 1996. Palestinian authorities said at the time that Abu Warda had helped to recruit suicide bombers, whose attacks targeting crowded civilian areas in Israeli cities killed scores of people in the early 2000s. Abu Warda was released and deported on Jan. 30. Mohammed Aradeh, 42 An activist in Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Aradeh was sentenced to life in prison for a range of offenses going back to the second intifada. Some of the charges, according to the Israeli Prison Service, included planting an explosive device and attempted murder. He was credited with plotting the extraordinary prison escape in 2021, when he and five other detainees, including Zubeidi, used spoons to tunnel out one of Israel’s most secure prisons. They remained at large for days before being caught. From an impoverished and politically active family in Jenin, in the northern occupied West Bank, Aradeh has three brothers and a sister who have all spent years in Israeli prisons. He was welcomed as a sort of cult hero in Ramallah on Jan. 25 as family, friends and fans swarmed him, some chanting 'The freedom tunnel!' in reference to his jailbreak. Mohammed Odeh, 52, Wael Qassim, 54, and Wissam Abbasi, 48 All three men hail from the neighborhood of Silwan, in east Jerusalem, and rose within the ranks of Hamas. Held responsible for a string of deadly attacks during the second intifada, the men were handed multiple life sentences in 2002. They were accused of plotting a suicide bombing at a crowded pool hall near Tel Aviv in 2002 that killed 15 people. Later that year, they were found to have orchestrated a bombing at Hebrew University that killed nine people, including five American students. Israel had described Odeh, who was working as a painter at the university at the time, as the architect of the attack. All three were transferred to Egypt on Jan. 25. Their families live in Jerusalem and said they will join them in exile. Mohammad al-Tous, 67 The 67-year-old al-Tous had held the title of longest continuous Israeli imprisonment until his release last Saturday, Palestinian authorities said. First arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces along the Jordanian border, the activist in the Fatah party spent a total of 39 years behind bars. Originally from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, he was among the prisoners exiled on Jan. 25. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-who-are-the-palestinian-prisoners-released-in-exchange-for-israeli-hostages-3/	2025-02-08T03:40:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a7478912ce66.62820906.jpeg?w=900
Hamas releases 3 more Israeli hostages for dozens of Palestinian ...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas-led militants released three gaunt, frail-looking Israeli civilian men they held for the past 16 months on Saturday, and Israel was freeing dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile agreement that has paused the war in the Gaza Strip. Before a crowd of hundreds, armed Hamas fighters led Eli Sharabi, 52, Ohad Ben Ami, 56, and Or Levy, 34, onto a stage, where they were forced to make a public statement before being handed over to the Red Cross. The three were among about 250 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. They appeared to be in much poorer physical condition than any of the 18 other hostages released so far during the ceasefire that began Jan. 19. Hostages' condition sparks concern The hostages' emaciated condition and the stage-managed ceremony — a departure from previous hostage releases where the captives were not made to speak — sparked outrage in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said 'we will not accept the shocking scenes' that played out. The statement did not lay out punitive measures. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the 'difficult scenes' were reason to extend the truce with Hamas and bring home the dozens of remaining hostages. In an apparent response to concerns over the released hostages’ health, Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, claimed it had 'made efforts to preserve their lives despite the (Israeli) bombardment.' Many Palestinians released from Israeli jails during the ceasefire have also appeared gaunt and pale, and have alleged abuses and mistreatment in Israeli custody. The current phase of the truce, which runs until early March, does not appear to have been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza, welcomed by Israel but vehemently rejected by the Palestinians and most of the international community. But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult phase, when Hamas is to release dozens more hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire. Hamas may be reluctant to free more captives — and lose its main bargaining chip — if it believes the U.S. and Israel are serious about depopulating the territory, which rights groups say would violate international law. This was the fifth swap of hostages for prisoners during the ceasefire. Before Saturday, 18 hostages and more than 550 Palestinian prisoners had been freed. The gaunt appearance of the three hostages 'evoke the horrifying pictures from the liberation of the camps in 1945, the darkest chapter of our history,' said the Hostages Families Forum, a group representing relatives of most of the captives. 'We have to get all of the hostages out of hell. There can be no more delays.' The first phase of the ceasefire calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Last week, wounded Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt for the first time since May. Who was released on Saturday? Sharabi and Ben Ami were both captured from Kibbutz Beeri, one of the hardest-hit farming communities, during the Hamas-led attack. Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where he was taking shelter in a safe room when the militants arrived. Sharabi’s wife and two teenage daughters were killed in the attack. His brother Yossi was also abducted and died in captivity. Levy’s wife was killed during the attack and his now 3-year-old son has been cared for by relatives. It is unclear whether either man knows about what happened to their families. Ben Ami, a father of three, was kidnapped with his wife, Raz, who was released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Relatives of the hostages cheered, clapped and cried as they watched live footage of their loved ones being released. Levy's brother, Michael, said his brother’s young son, Almog, was already told his father was on his way. 'Mogi, we found daddy,' Michael Levy said he told the boy, using his nickname, in an interview with Israeli Channel 12. 'We haven’t seen happiness like that in him for a long time.' The 183 Palestinian prisoners being released by Israel on Saturday include 18 people serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis, 54 serving long-term sentences and 111 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained after the Oct. 7 attack but not tried for any crime. All are men are aged between 20 and 61. Virtually every Palestinian has a friend, relative or acquaintance who has been imprisoned. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. More than 70 are still in Gaza, and Israel has said 34 of those are believed to be dead. Israel says Hamas has confirmed eight of the 33 to be released during the first phase of the truce are dead. Ceasefire's next phase is uncertain It is not clear whether Israel and Hamas have begun negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu’s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won’t release remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. In the Oct. 7 attack, some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground war, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods. Senior militants among Palestinian prisoners set for release Of the 72 prisoners being released Saturday, five are from east Jerusalem, 14 from the Gaza Strip and the remaining 53 from the occupied West Bank. Seven are to be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation. A total of 47 prisoners were being freed Saturday from Ofer prison in the West Bank, and transferred to Palestinian custody near Ramallah where scores of relatives, friends and supporters welcomed some of them cheering and clapping. One extremely frail-looking prisoner was loaded directly from a bus into an ambulance for emergency treatment. The Palestinian security prisoners were detained over offenses ranging from bomb attacks to involvement in militant organizations, in some cases dating back decades. They include Iyad Abu Shakhdam, 49, who has been locked up for nearly 21 years over his involvement in Hamas attacks in crowded civilian areas that killed dozens of Israelis during the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. That included a notorious 2004 suicide bus bombing in Israel’s southern desert city of Beersheba that killed 16 people, including a 4-year-old. Another is Jamal al-Tawil, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of al-Bireh, abutting Ramallah. He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli jail, with the military reporting his last arrest in 2021 over his alleged participation in violent riots and efforts to entrench Hamas' leadership in the West Bank. He was transferred to administrative detention, a repeatedly renewable six-month period in which suspects are held without charge or trial. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. ___ Goldenberg contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-to-free-3-more-israeli-hostages-for-dozens-of-palestinian-prisoners-under-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-02-08T03:26:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a7407e4998d0.20425490.jpeg?w=900
No, DOGE did not find Pentagon spent $600 million on sushi	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency did not find the Pentagon spent $600 million on sushi and it never claimed to, despite social media posts online. A Facebook post earlier this week showed a statement wrongly attributed to Musk. It claimed to detail federal spending uncovered by DOGE. 'My experience with DOGE has been totally wild so far. I told you yesterday about the $600 million per year the Pentagon was spending on Sushi,' the text of the statement reads. DOGE staffer resigns after racist posts exposed It goes on to say: 'Well, I just found another wild one! The Air Force was spending $1,280 per paper coffee cup! Like literally those ones you find at the office. $1280!!! We also found that $230k per month was being spent by the IRS on Starbucks Cinnamon Roast K Cups, but everyone was working from home!' The claims about the Pentagon and the Air Force were attributed to Musk but they appear to have originated from a parody account on X. The tech billionaire never said them. An X account named @iamnot_Elon, which is labeled as a parody, posted the statement Jan. 26. Several days later, a Facebook post Feb. 3 matched the statement essentially word-for-word but attributed it to Musk himself. Does DOGE have your personal information? The Facebook post was shared more than 3,000 times in three days, according to USA Today. Similar versions circulated on other social media platforms like Instagram and Threads. Several users on X appeared to be confused by the satirical post. One account replied: 'This is ridiculous, they just trash taxpayers money.' Another wrote: 'Stop, no way. We really need to out the party that approved those expenses.' The official DOGE account on X has been sharing the new transparency unit's work but there are no posts about pricey Pentagon sushi. PolitiFact has also debunked the claim in the Facebook post.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-pentagon-sushi/	2025-02-07T14:56:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/GettyImages-470826623.jpg?w=900
Trump says Social Security ‘won't be touched’ by DOGE	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said Friday that his new Department of Government Efficiency will not 'touch' social security, as the non-government task force continues to be criticized for its attacks on different federal agencies and programs. 'Social Security will not be touched, it will only be strengthened,' Trump said during a news conference when asked if there are any limits placed on what Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, can examine. But Trump added that he would 'weed out' undocumented people whom he claimed were utilizing the program. 'We have illegal immigrants on Social Security and we're going to find out who they are and take them off... we're not going to stand for that.' Does DOGE have your personal information? Undocumented immigrants are not eligible and cannot collect Social Security benefits, though they often pay taxes that help fund the program. The president’s statement has been in line with campaign promises he made about social security. Trump had said he won’t 'cut one cent' from Social Security or raise the retirement age. The official Republican Party platform adopted at the Republican National Convention echoed those promises but it has been less clear how Trump plans to shore up the program’s finances. Since becoming the head of DOGE, Musk has targeted the United States Agency for International Development and the Education Department leading many to fear social security could be next on its hit list. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? Trump, under Musk’s recommendation, ordered USAID funding to be paused for 90 days, and many of the agency’s staff were fired or put on administrative leave, which largely halted the agency’s work. Musk’s DOGE has also turned on the Education Department, with lawmakers raising concerns about DOGE’s access to internal systems containing personal information on tens of millions of Americans.

Lawmakers denied entry into Department of Education	(NewsNation) — Democratic members of Congress were denied entry into the Department of Education on Friday morning. The doors were locked and a security guard could be seen having a tense conversation with a lawmaker. 'They are blocking members of Congress from entering the Department of Education! Elon is allowed in and not the people? ILLEGAL,' Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., wrote on X. In another post, he said armed federal officers were called to the scene. 'We aren't dangerous,' Frost wrote. 'We are here to represent our people. To defend public education. This is an authoritarian regime.' Does DOGE have your personal information? The incident happened as Trump reportedly considered using an executive order to abolish the department, an issue he campaigned on during the 2024 election. 'We’re ranked number one in cost per pupil, so we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we’re ranked at the bottom of the list,' Trump has previously said. 'We’re ranked very badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools.' Shutting down the Department of Education would require an act of Congress. The department administers funding for K-12 schools that is appropriated by Congress; provides oversight for schools; administers student loans and grants; and can also create federal rules. Along with the Education Department, Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk moved to eradicate the U.S. Agency for International Development. Democrats tried Monday to enter USAID headquarters, but were blocked from this building as well by officers. This story is developing. Refresh for updates.

Illinois, Chicago sued by DOJ over sanctuary city status	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit Thursday against Chicago, Cook County and the state of Illinois, accusing officials of interfering with immigration enforcement efforts. The suit comes on the heels of a federal judge blocking President Donald Trump's executive order preventing the children of migrants without legal status from receiving birthright citizenship for the second time this week. Chicago and Illinois leaders vow to fight DOJ Local leaders are pushing back against the Trump administration, asserting the city maintains its welcoming status despite federal pressure. The DOJ's lawsuit argues Chicago's state and local laws — such as the Illinois Way Forward Act, the Illinois Trust Act and Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance, which limit local police cooperation with ICE agents — interfere with the federal government's immigration enforcement. Federal buyout deadline extended as Trump plans USAID cuts Additionally, it argues the supremacy clause of the Constitution gives the federal government the right to create and enforce laws without interference from states. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker defended the laws. 'Unlike Donald Trump, Illinois follows the law,' he said, adding that the Trust Act was signed into law by a Republican governor and 'has always been compliant with federal law and still is today.' 'We look forward to seeing them in court,' Pritzker said. Sheriff: Illinois Trust Act ties our hands Some local law enforcement officials, such as Winnebago County Sheriff Gary Caruana, argue the current legislation prevents their ability to do their jobs effectively. 'The Trust Act does not allow us to call immigration and say this person has an issue and could be dangerous — and this is where I'm concerned about public safety — this person could be dangerous, you might want to take a look at this. We can't do that,' he said. Senate installs Russell Vought as Trump’s next budget chief In a social media post, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit is under review by the city's law department and reaffirmed the city's commitment to protecting residents. Earlier this week, Johnson accused the Trump administration of trying to undermine Chicago's humanity and called for Congress to pass immigration reform.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/doj-sues-illinois-chicago-sanctuary-city/	2025-02-07T06:17:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25027710663013.jpg?w=900
Trump's birthright citizenship order going in front of third judg...	(NewsNation) — A third federal judge is weighing President Donald Trump's push to end birthright citizenship Friday after a second judge ordered a nationwide pause earlier this week. At issue is whether birthright citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution. So far, judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents have said the 14th Amendment grants birthright citizenship. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland put an injunction on Trump's executive order. In Seattle on Thursday, U.S. District John Coughenour issued his own injunction, accusing Trump of trying to change the Constitution 'under the guise of an executive order.' What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown praised the judge's decision, saying that 'time and time again, (Trump) has shown a disdain for the United States Constitution.' Meanwhile, the Trump administration is focusing on a four-word phrase in the 14th Amendment: 'subject to the jurisdiction.' Per the 14th Amendment, 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.' Trump administration officials say this means people in the U.S. illegally, visiting or on a visa are not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. — and, therefore, their children are not citizens. Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship would overturn more than a century of precedent It may be an uphill fight, with precedent set at a Supreme Court case more than a century ago. Back then, the high court ruled children born in the U.S. to Chinese parents — who were prohibited from becoming citizens at that time — could be citizens under the 14th Amendment. Trump's executive order was set to go into effect on Feb. 19 but now will remain blocked unless both courts are overruled. More than two dozen states and organizations are part of at least nine different lawsuits challenging the order. Friday's hearing in Boston is set to start at 10 a.m. ET, and a fourth case will be heard Monday in New Hampshire.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-third-judge/	2025-02-07T05:51:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771.jpg?w=900
Federal buyout deadline extended as Trump slashes USAID staffing	(NewsNation) — Nearly 2 million U.S. federal employees now have until the weekend to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration, which is seeking to dramatically reduce the federal workforce, after a judge delayed Thursday's deadline. The move coincides with President Donald Trump's plan to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, leaving fewer than 300 workers of its current 10,000-employee workforce. These workers would be responsible for managing U.S. humanitarian efforts abroad. According to reports, only 12 staff members would oversee projects in Africa and eight in Asia. A lawsuit filed by the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees seeks a federal court order to stop the USAID cuts. Catholic aid group downsizes by nearly 50% amid USAID freeze Labor unions are fighting the buyouts for federal workers, arguing the plan is an illegal scam unauthorized by Congress and warning federal workers to read the fine print. 'What we've been urging is for people to look at these offers with caution because there's legal uncertainty,' said John Hatton of the National Active and Retired Federal Employee Association. 'We don't know what that means in terms of, do you still lose your job, do you waive all legal rights under this offer as well.' Buyout offer extended after judge’s ruling Millions of U.S. government employees had been facing a Thursday deadline to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration. Those who choose to stay still risk being laid off. U.S. District Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. ruled in favor of several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan spearheaded by Trump adviser Elon Musk. The judge did not express an opinion on the legality of the buyouts and directed administration officials to extend the deadline to apply until after a hearing scheduled for Monday. Saving USAID not the hill Dems should die on: Commentator Trump’s push to reduce the size of the government is unprecedented, causing turmoil in Washington and triggering protests and union concerns over potential legal violations. So far, more than 60,000 employees, about 2% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout, with more expected to join. It remains unclear how many of the federal government’s 2.3 million civilian workers will ultimately agree to the offer. What’s included in the buyout offer? On the surface, the Office of Personnel Management's offer seems straightforward: federal workers who resign will receive pay and benefits through September. However, the situation may not be that simple. The deal limits employees’ ability to address any issues if things go wrong. Even after workers accept the buyout, the government still has the right to rescind the offer. The buyout impacts not only employees at domestic agencies such as the Department of Labor, which has long drawn criticism from Trump’s supporters, but also those in intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Unions and some lawmakers are urging federal workers to reject the buyout offer, cautioning that, with government funding set to expire in March, their pay and benefits could be at risk. The move has sparked protests in Washington and across the nation. What happens if federal workers don’t accept the buyout offer? Federal workers who do not accept the offer may face job losses and miss out on the pay and benefits offered by the buyout. Did USAID money lead to Trump impeachment? The Office of Personnel Management has warned several federal agencies could downsize in the coming months, though this does not apply to military personnel or workers in immigration enforcement, national security and the U.S. Postal Service.

Coast Guard locates wreckage of missing Alaska flight	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The FAA confirms a plane found in Alaska is the wreckage of Bering Air Flight 445. In a statement, the agency said it and the National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating the crash and NTSB will provide all updates. The U.S. Coast Guard announced it had located an aircraft matching the description of a plane that went missing off the Alaskan coast Friday evening. The aircraft was located roughly 34 miles southeast of Nome, Alaska, and three deceased individuals were found inside. Airport employees accused of leaking DC plane crash video Nine passengers and the pilot were onboard the aircraft. It is not clear what the status is for the remaining individuals. The plane experienced a drop in speed and elevation prior to disappearing, authorities announced on Friday. An aircraft carrying 10 people across Alaska’s Norton Sound south of the Arctic Circle went missing Thursday afternoon and rescuers searched into the night for any sign of the aircraft. The Bering Air Caravan was heading from Unalakleet to Nome with nine passengers and a pilot, according to Alaska's Department of Public Safety. Authorities were working to determine its last known coordinates. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people in western Alaska, about 150 miles southeast of Nome and 395 miles northwest of Anchorage. The disappearance marks the third major incident in U.S. aviation in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people onboard and another person on the ground. The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m., and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. The aircraft was 12 miles offshore, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. 'Staff at Bering Air is working hard to gather details, get emergency assistance, search and rescue going,' Olson said. Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. Airplanes are often the only option for travel of any distance in rural Alaska, particularly in winter. The Nome Volunteer Fire Department said in a statement on social media that ground crews were searching across the coast, from Nome to Topkok. 'Due to weather and visibility, we are limited on air search at the current time,' it said. People were told not to form their own search parties because the weather was too dangerous. In an update early Friday, the department said that 'crews are still searching on the ground, canvassing as much area as possible,' but that 'we do not have any updated information on the location of the missing aircraft.' A U.S. Coast Guard airplane crew was expected to search the missing aircraft's last known position. The National Guard and troopers were also helping with the search, according to the fire department. It was 17 F in Unalakleet around takeoff, according to the National Weather Service. There was light snow falling and fog. The names of the people on board weren't yet being released. Nome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

(NewsNation) — Dr. Wayne Ross, a forensic neuropathologist hired by the family of Ellen Greenberg, believes the teacher's 2011 death was staged to look like a suicide, he told NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin. He cites a towel placed next to her, clean despite her 20 stab wounds, as evidence of the staging. The case was originally ruled a homicide, then changed to suicide. Greenberg's family has long found her passing suspicious, with her father saying he believes she was strangled. Attorney: Ellen Greenberg’s family hasn’t heard from her fiancé Ross agrees: 'To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she was strangled. Yeah, I would testify in the court of law.' The medical examiner who initially investigated the case released new legal verification indicating he believes the ruling of a suicide is inaccurate. Just days ago, the family of Ellen Greenberg reached a settlement agreement with Philadelphia officials to reopen the investigation. And Ross has an idea of what they might find — from bruises on her wrists and legs, to conflicting blood splatter evidence. Former DHS employee arrested for kidnapping child, falsifying documents Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who worked as Philadelphia district attorney when Greenberg was found dead, addressed the case Thursday. 'There's nothing I wanted more than to give these parents some finality, some answers, some clarity, and we received more evidence, more information during the course of our investigation that ... pointed toward a suicide,' Shapiro said. Ellen Greenberg's death Greenberg was found dead Jan. 26, 2011, in the kitchen of her apartment by her fiancé. The 27-year-old woman had been stabbed 20 times. Cost to sequester Megan Boswell jury thousands per day Philadelphia Medical Examiner Marlon Osbourne initially ruled the death a homicide due to the large number of stab wounds, including 10 on the back of Greenberg’s neck. But police challenged the finding and he changed his assessment to suicide. Osbourne did not offer an explanation for the change at the time, but a new statement showed he made the change after acquiring additional information from her case file and consulting with another doctor.

(NewsNation) — Bill O'Reilly tells NewsNation he doesn't fear any uprising led by Elon Musk, as he believes the Tesla billionaire doesn't actually 'have any power' in the administration. 'I'm not worried that he's going to do a coup d'état,' O'Reilly said. 'I'm not worried because he doesn't have any power. He can't subpoena anybody. He's just is an adviser.' Does DOGE have your personal information? 'He presents to Trump,' O'Reilly added. 'Trump does what he wants.' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been active since President Donald Trump took office and signed an executive order creating the organization just more than two weeks ago. After Musk vowed to cut $2 trillion from federal government spending, the tech billionaire has come under fire from Democrats questioning Musk’s authority to act. Its investigations — most notably into the U.S. Agency for International Development — have drawn ire from protestors and politicians alike who fear he has too much influence and power for an unelected official. 'Think this is just a hyped-up story. Doesn't mean very much. I'm happy if Elon Musk uncovers wasteful spending,' O'Reilly said. Elon Musk's role DOGE has been controversial from the start. Though it is not an agency or a Cabinet-level position, it has been treated similarly. Rep. Val Hoyle: I’m leaving DOGE Caucus because of Musk’s actions Because it is not an agency, Musk has not had to go through a Senate confirmation hearing that would typically be required for someone at that level of power. The White House has classified Musk as a special government employee with a limited contract, which means he is exempt from certain regulations regarding financial disclosure and transparency.

Rep. Val Hoyle: I’m leaving DOGE Caucus because of Musk’s actions	(NewsNation) — Rep. Val Hoyle, D-Ore., who was on the Department of Government Efficiency Caucus, announced live on NewsNation air that Elon Musk’s behavior has forced her to leave DOGE. 'It's like trying to replace your roof when someone is throwing dynamite through the window into your living room. It's just not possible,' Hoyle explained. 'So, I'm leaving the DOGE Caucus.' 'Right now, I just don’t think it’s possible with what’s happening,' Hoyle said, clarifying that the caucus doesn't directly work with Musk. Joe Rogan cheers Musk’s ‘business approach’ to government cuts 'President Trump handed over the keys to the White House, to the Treasury, to government, to an unelected billionaire, and you know, it's, quite frankly, very disturbing,' Hoyle said. Hoyle told 'CUOMO' that, while those involved in the caucus want to be 'good stewards of taxpayer dollars,' Musk is 'accountable to no one' and has made it impossible to get work done. She adds that neither she nor her Republican colleagues have any influence in efficiency operations. What powers does Elon Musk have? DOGE has been controversial from the start. Though it is not an agency or a Cabinet-level position, it has been treated similarly. Because it is not an agency, Musk has not had to go through a Senate confirmation hearing that would typically be required for someone at that level of power. 5 questions about DOGE’s access to federal payment systems The White House has classified Musk as a special government employee with a limited contract, which means he is exempt from certain regulations regarding financial disclosure and transparency. DOGE has also made unilateral changes to certain agencies, most notably USAID.
