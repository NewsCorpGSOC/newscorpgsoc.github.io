New Orleans deadly attack: A timeline of what is known	(NewsNation) — Bourbon Street is again open for business just a day after 14 people were killed and 35 injured in a deadly attack. On Thursday, just more than 36 hours after police said Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a rented truck onto a crowded Bourbon Street, city officials were given back control of the popular tourist destination ahead of the evening's Sugar Bowl as investigators continue to piece together information. As of Thursday morning, all of the victims have been identified and their families notified by New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said officials hope to provide a detailed timeline of what exactly took place in the deadly attack but said doing so this early into what remains an active investigation would be premature. Here’s what is known thus far. Shamsud-Din Jabbar travels to New Orleans The FBI said that Jabbar rented a Ford truck in Texas on December 30 and began the nearly 350-mile drive between Houston and New Orleans on New Year’s Eve. Turo, an online car rental platform, issued a statement Wednesday indicating there was nothing in Jabbar’s background that would show he was a threat. FBI officials said that while traveling between Texas and New Orleans, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook in which he pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, aka ISIS. In the first video, Jabbar said that he initially planned to harm his family and friends. However, he was concerned that the news headlines would not focus on the war between 'the believers and the disbelievers.' The FBI confirmed Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year's Day attack. The FBI said video footage showed Jabbar placing two coolers, each of which contained an improvised explosive device (IED), along Bourbon Street sometime between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. Investigators initially reported that they had reviewed video footage of two men and a woman placing devices on the street. However, the FBI said that those people were bystanders who stopped to look at the coolers before they walked away. Still, investigators are still hoping to speak with anyone who knew Jabbar and who may have spent time with him in the 24 hours leading up to the attack. Both of the devices located in the coolers were rendered safe, and reports of other devices that surfaced on Wednesday turned out to be misinformation, the FBI confirmed. The FBI said that the videos were posted to Facebook beginning at 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m. The Bourbon Street attack begins New Orleans police said officers responded to reports of a vehicle driving into a crowd on Bourbon Street at 3:17 a.m. Multiple people were struck before the vehicle crashed. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that the driver, who was later identified as Jabbar, got out of the truck and began firing at police. Two officers were struck by gunfire and were hospitalized. Jabbar was shot and killed by police. New Orleans Police said at a news conference Wednesday that Jabbar drove the rented truck up onto the sidewalk at Bourbon and Canal Streets, which were being blocked off by a police vehicle and officers. A bollard system, which had been installed in 2017 as part of a $40 million safety project, was being replaced at the time of the New Year’s Day attack. Who is Las Vegas explosion suspect Matthew Livelsberger? 'We had a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there,' Kirkpatrick said. 'And (Jabbar) got around it. She added: 'We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.' Airbnb residents forced to evacuate Residents at an Airbnb property located 1 1/2 miles from the scene of the attack were forced to evacuate around 8 a.m. on Wednesday after a fire broke out at the property. Witnesses told NewsNation that they had seen a white truck parked in the driveway of the property but that no one reported seeing Jabbar.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) The FBI said Thursday that the agency has secured that property and is conducting a search for potential evidence connected to the attack. FBI turns over control of Bourbon Street to New Orleans Cantrell said that the FBI returned control of Bourbon Street to the city late Wednesday night and that city crews began cleaning the street around 2 a.m. on Thursday. The cleaning process was completed by 8 a.m. to ensure that the street could be open as fans began to prepare for Thursday’s College Football Playoff quarterfinal game. 'I want to reassure the public that the city of New Orleans is not only ready for Game Day today, but we’re ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city because we are built to host at every single turn,' the mayor said. Bourbon Street was set to reopen to pedestrian traffic around 2 p.m. Thursday but was opened ahead of schedule as football fans and visitors alike returned. Louisiana Mayor Jeff Landry said that although the memory of the 14 victims will live on, it would be a tragedy for their memory to be 'snuffed out by fear.' 'The city will be back. We’ll be open for family, friends and loved ones who want some time to relax from the pressures of life,' Landry said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-attack-timeline/	2025-01-02T15:00:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001598416234.jpg?w=900
New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities	(NewsNation) — FBI investigators cannot definitively link the deadly attack that occurred early New Year’s Day in New Orleans with the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, but several similarities have been found between the two men involved, officials said Thursday. A NewsNation source identified the driver of the Tesla truck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel on Wednesday morning as Matthew Livelsberger, an active Army soldier from Colorado. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said at a news conference that they are still not 100% able to confirm the driver’s identity after his body was burnt beyond recognition in the explosion. Dog shot in face after months on run in Denver adopted into foster family But investigators said that tattoos found on the body matched those belonging to Livelsberger. A military identification card and passport belonging to Livelsberger were also found at the scene of the explosion, police said. Investigators believe that he was the only person to be inside the truck, which was rented in Colorado. The FBI, meanwhile, identified the driver of a rented Ford truck that killed 14 people and injured at least 35 others in Bourbon Street as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who also had a military background in the U.S. Army. Here is what is known about the similarities between Livelsberger and Jabbar. Liveslberger and Jabbar served in the United States Army The Department of Defense confirmed that Livelsberger was a Special Operations sergeant with the Green Berets and that he spent much of his time in the Army at Fort Carson in Colorado and in Germany. The Army told NewsNation that Livelsberger was assigned to the 10th Special Forces Group in Stuttgart, Germany. The spokesman also said that Livelsberger received several awards, including the Bronze Star Medal with Valor and other awards and commendations.

(Credit: Alcides Antunes) Livelsberger enlisted as an 18X and served in active duty from January 2006 to March 2011, a spokesman said. He then joined the National Guard from March 2011 through July 2012. After that, Livelsberger was in the Army Reserve until December 2012, when he entered active duty as an Army Special Operations soldier. Las Vegas police said Thursday that Livelsberger served at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Afghanistan in 2009. Investigators said that like Livelsberger, Jabbar also served at Fort Bragg and in Afghanistan in 2009. However, it is not yet known whether the two men were part of the same unit or in the same region of Afghanistan during their deployment. Investigators said Thursday they are working to confirm specific details about the two men's military careers that could place them in the same unit at Fort Bragg. Jabbar was part of the regular Army from March 2007 to January 2015 as a human resource specialist (42A) and information technology specialist (25B) before transitioning to the Army Reserve as an IT specialist from January 2015 to July 2020, an Army spokesperson told NewsNation. The FBI confirmed Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year's Day attack. He deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010 and held the rank of staff sergeant at the time of his discharge, according to the spokesperson. Before serving in the Army, Jabbar enlisted in the Navy in August 2004 under a delayed entry program but was discharged a month later, a Navy official said. Like Livelsberger, Jabbar was the recipient of several Army medals and commendations, including the Global War on Terrorism Medal and two Army Good Conduct medals. Livelsberger and Jabbar rented vehicles from Turo Investigators have confirmed that both the Ford truck used in the New Orleans attack and the Cybertruck that exploded in front of the Las Vegas hotel were rented through Turo, an online car rental app. Las Vegas police said Thursday that Livelsberger picked up the truck in Denver on December 28. Investigators then used Tesla charging station data to track the vehicle’s movements. Police said that the truck was charged in Monument, Colorado, on Dec. 30 and then was charged in Colorado and New Mexico on New Year’s Eve. NYPD presence increased at Trump Tower, Times Square On New Year’s Day, the truck was charged at three locations in Arizona, including in Kingman at 5:33 a.m. before it was first spotted in Las Vegas at 7:29 a.m. The FBI confirmed Thursday that Jabbar picked up the rented truck in Texas on December 30 and then drove the vehicle from Houston to New Orleans on New Year's Eve. Investigators said that during the trip, Jabbar posted five videos to Facebook, pledging his allegiance to ISIS.

'We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,' the statement said. The timing of the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion New Orleans police officers responded to Bourbon Street at 3:17 a.m. on New Year’s Day for a report of a vehicle that had driven onto Bourbon Street and struck pedestrians. The FBI said Jabbar’s final video to Facebook was posted at 3:02 a.m., which was just 15 minutes before police were called to Bourbon Street. Investigators determined that Jabbar drove the truck between Houston and New Orleans on Dec. 31, but they did not provide a definite timeline for his arrival into the city. The truck believed to be driven by Livelsberger was first spotted in Las Vegas at 7:29 a.m. Surveillance footage shows the truck pulling into the Trump hotel valet parking area before it left and traveled along Las Vegas Boulevard. It was then spotted parked at a business on the boulevard near Flamingo Road. At 8:39 a.m., the truck was spotted near the Sands Hotel and Casino before it returned to the Trump Hotel valet parking area, where the explosion took place within 17 seconds later, police said.

President-elect Trump vows to rid America of 'violent scum'	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is blaming President Joe Biden and other federal agencies for the nation's violent crime, including the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside a Nevada hotel, and has vowed to rid the country of 'violent scum'. Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that Biden, the Department of Justice and the FBI had devoted too much time focusing their attention on him rather than radical Islamic terrorism and other violent acts. The posts, which appeared on Trump’s Truth Social account after the deadly attack in New Orleans and the truck explosion, said that violent crime has become so bad in America that 'it will become hard to even imagine or believe.' The FBI said Thursday that Shamsud-Din Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account while driving from Houston to New Orleans, pledging his allegiance to the Islamic State. What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack On Wednesday night, Trump wrote Biden and his 'election-interfering thugs' have done to the country will not soon be forgotten. In the post, Trump accused the Department of Justice, FBI and Democratic state and local prosecutors of not doing their jobs. 'They are incompetent and corrupt, having spent all of their waking hours unlawfully attacking their political opponent, ME, rather than focusing on protecting Americans from the outside and inside violent SCUM that has infiltrated all aspects of our government, and our Nation itself,' Trump wrote. Biden did not respond to questions directed at him as he returned to the White House from the New Year holiday at Camp David on Thursday. Biden met with national security officials on Thursday to be briefed on the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion. The president was also briefed several times during New Year's Day on the incidents. Biden told reporters on Wednesday that his response to the New Orleans attack was 'one of anger and frustration.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-rid-america-violent-scum/	2025-01-02T11:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2188144000.jpg?w=900

Biden, Trump respond to deadly attack in New Orleans	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — As federal investigators investigate the deadly New Year's Day attack in New Orleans, President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump had starkly different reactions. At least 15 people were killed and dozens more injured after a vehicle drove into a crowd on Canal and Bourbon Streets early Wednesday morning in what the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism. The White House said Biden has held multiple briefings with federal law enforcement and U.S. Department of Homeland Security leaders. The Department of Justice also sent agents and other resources to New Orleans to help investigators. What is Turo?

'I know while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of New Orleans will never be defeated. It will always shine forth. We've seen it time and time again throughout its history, and I know we'll see it again,' Biden said during an address from Camp David. Trump also weighed in on the violence, writing on Truth Social, 'Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department.

Two stabbings at two NYC subway stations occurred New Year's Day	(NewsNation) — Two stabbings unfolded just minutes apart at two different subway stations in New York City on New Year's Day morning, leaving two hospitalized, police reported. Before 10 a.m. on New Year’s Day, the stabbings occurred on opposite sides of the city. The victims are in stable condition in the hospital. The attacks are part of a recent series of unrelated violent incidents occurring on or near subways. 10 people shot outside Queens night club on New Year’s Day: NYPD On New Year’s Eve, a man was pushed onto the tracks as a train was approaching, leaving him in critical condition. Days before Christmas, a man intentionally set a woman on fire while she slept on a train. The severity of these recent subway attacks has made riders, including tourists and residents, more fearful of the nation's largest transit system. But city officials are quick to point to data that shows the overall number of reported crimes on the subway system is the lowest year-to-date since 2010, exempting the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. There were 10 murders in 2024, which ties for a record 25-year high in 2022. The more violent attacks have typically occurred during peak hours and in nonviolent areas of the transit system.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/nyc-subway-stabbings-new-years-day/	2025-01-02T05:42:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/66291d431b0353.01473606.jpeg?w=900
What is an immersive explosive device (IED)?	(NewsNation) — Improvided explosive devices, or IEDs, were among the weapons found in the vehicle of the suspect in the attack that killed 15 people and injured 30 others in New Orleans on New Year's Day. IEDs are 'homemade bomb(s) and/or destructive devices to destroy, incapacitate, harass or distract,' according to the Department of Homeland Security. Examples include small pipe bombs which can be made to be more sophisticated in order to cause a lot of damage and loss of life. What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack Other attacks that used IEDs include the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Olympic Park bombing in 1996 and the London bombings in 2005. Police suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar as the person responsible for what the FBI has deemed a 'terrorist attack' after allegedly driving his vehicle into a crowd on the tourist-heavy Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning. Law enforcement is still searching the area for improvised explosive devices, according to the FBI. Other potential IEDs were also located in the French Quarter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/what-immersive-explosive-devices-ied/	2025-01-02T04:39:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2178157082.jpg?w=900
What we know about the Cybertruck explosion at Las Vegas Trump Ho...	LAS VEGAS (NewsNation) — Firework mortars and camp fuel canisters were found in the back of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Las Vegas Trump International Hotel Wednesday, killing one person, injuring seven others, and sparking an intense investigation into possible terrorism. The act was intentional, police said, adding that video shows the vehicle parked next to the hotel’s front doors as it explodes into flames. Police did not find any devices that would have been used to ignite the explosion in the truck and are unsure at this time how it ignited, authorities said. Cybertruck arrived in Vegas one hour before blast Clark County firefighters and Las Vegas Metropolitan police responded to the explosion and fire around 8:40 a.m. in the 2000 block of Fashion Show Drive, across from Fashion Show Mall and just west of the Las Vegas Strip. FBI investigating New Orleans attack as ‘act of terrorism’ Police tracked the truck through cameras at Tesla charging stations and found that it arrived in Las Vegas around 7:30 a.m. The truck then drove up and down Las Vegas Boulevard for about an hour before pulling into the Trump Hotel entrance. The truck sat in front of the hotel for about 15-20 seconds before it exploded, McMahill said. The blast went upwards, so the hotel's glass doors did not break. Have any suspects been identified? The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone. Both the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded in Las Vegas and the pickup truck used in New Orleans were rented from Turo, authorities said. Police have identified the person who rented the cybertruck but have not yet released the name. Social posts including a person’s name were incorrect, a source told NewsNation affiliate KLAS. 'We believe this is an isolated incident. We do not believe that there is a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this. We don't believe there's any other danger to the community right now. Over the next few hours and days, we will continue to do our best to research as much as we can and get to the bottom of this. and we won't stop until we're 100% certain as to what happened and why,' said FBI Acting Special Agent-In-Charge Jeremy Schwartz. In a statement, Turo said it was working with authorities. 'We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,' the statement said. Musk: Explosion was caused by fireworks or bomb Tesla founder Elon Musk, who is working with the FBI, said Wednesday afternoon on X that 'we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.' In an earlier post on the platform, Musk said that his entire senior term was investigating the explosion, adding, 'We’ve never seen anything like this.' Musk suggested that the explosion might also be an act of terrorism, noting that the truck involved was rented through the same app used in the New Orleans attack. However, the FBI has not confirmed this theory. What is Turo? The cars in both the Las Vegas explosion and the attack in New Orleans were rented on the app Turo, authorities say. Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace, often described as the Airbnb for cars. It allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles by listing them on the platform, where they can set rental prices, availability, and specific guidelines. Renters can browse local options, choose a vehicle that suits their needs, and complete the transaction securely through Turo’s system.

90%' sure New Orleans attacker was living in Airbnb: Neighbor	(NewsNation) — A neighbor says he is '90% sure' he encountered the suspect in the New Year's Day Bourbon Street attack at a New Orleans Airbnb that is now an FBI crime scene, just 1.5 miles from where the incident occurred. Wylie Whitesides, who lives two doors down from the rental property in the St. Roch neighborhood, claimed he noticed a suspicious man who matched the description of Shamsud-Din Jabbar days before the attack. Sources told NewsNation investigators believe the Airbnb was rented by the suspect in the Bourbon Street attack and despite heavy law enforcement presence, authorities have not confirmed this detail. 'He was a little bit taller than me, not a big guy, goatee beard, African American or Islamic,' Whitesides said of the man before seeing the suspect's photo. He said the encounter left him with a 'sketchy feeling.' What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack A white pickup truck, potentially connected to the suspect, was parked in front of Whitesides' home in recent nights he said. Another neighbor reported seeing someone repeatedly moving garbage cans up and down the street over several days. Early Wednesday morning, a fire broke out at the Airbnb, prompting the evacuation of dozens of residents around 8 a.m. The scene drew a massive law enforcement presence, including FBI special agents, Homeland Security investigators, ATF agents and New Orleans police and fire departments. Approximately 40 law enforcement officials were at the scene throughout the day, according to witnesses. While residents were initially evacuated, authorities began allowing them to return home around 8 p.m. CT, though the Airbnb remains cordoned off as an active FBI crime scene. Officials searching for more IEDs after deadly New Orleans attack The New Orleans Fire Department announced plans for a news conference Thursday morning to provide additional details about the investigation. Whitesides has spoken to the FBI and shared the same information. NewsNation has reached out to Airbnb for more information.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-attacker-airbnb-neighbor/	2025-01-01T19:54:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/8F61C1DA1FE21F798A06DF5AD3493CBC.jpg?w=900
New Orleans attack victims: What we know so far	(NewsNation) — Investigation continues into an overnight 'act of terrorism' in New Orleans' bustling Canal and Bourbon streets after a car drove into a crowd, killing 15 people and injuring at least 35 more. The FBI said it would issue a statement about the victims once all families have been notified. New Orleans attack suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack. In a Wednesday news conference, agency officials said they do not believe Jabbar acted alone. The Associated Press reported that investigators have reviewed video of three men and a woman placing possible explosives in the area where Wednesday’s attack took place. New Orleans attack: Suspect identified, Sugar Bowl postponed New Orleans attack victims Tiger Bech Tiger Bech, 28, died in a hospital following the attack, NewsNation local affiliate KLFY confirmed. He was reportedly kept on life support until his family could arrive, according to Kim Broussard, the athletic director at his former school, St. Thomas More Catholic High School in Lafayette, Louisiana. A Princeton graduate, Bech worked at New York brokerage firm Seaport Global, according to his LinkedIn page. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to all of the victims of the Bourbon Street attack,' Princeton Football shared on X. Reggie Hunter Baton Rouge native Reggie Hunter was among those killed in the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans, his cousin Shirell Jackson told NewsNation. 'He was loved by many. Excellent father, very supportive brother, supportive son, life of the party, great sense of humor, the one that made everybody laugh,' Jackson said. She tells NewsNation it's 'unfair and unjust' for Hunter's life to be taken so early. 'We had heard that he was shot. That's, that's what we were going on. So I'm praying that, you know, maybe they're doing surgery ... that's when the doctors informed us that he succumbed to his internal injuries and that he was deceased.' Hunter died from injuries sustained when he was run over, not by gunshot wounds, Jackson said. At the hospital, she witnessed multiple families receiving similar news about their loved ones who were killed or injured in the attack.

Why bollards weren't in place before New Orleans deadly attack	(NewsNation) — New Orleans law enforcement officials said bollards typically used to prevent traffic on Bourbon Street were not operable when a 42-year-old Texas man entered the popular tourist destination at a high rate of speed early Wednesday, killing 15 people and injuring 35 more. The man, who was identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar, drove a rented Ford truck onto Bourbon Street just after 3 a.m. in what the FBI is characterizing as an act of terrorism. 1 dead, 7 injured in Tesla fire, explosion at Las Vegas Trump International Hotel on New Year’s Day Police officials are now facing questions about why bollards that have been used to close off the street from traffic were not in place on New Year’s Eve and into early Wednesday when the attack took place. What is a bollard? Bollards are short, vertical posts that are used to serve as physical and visual barriers and are typically constructed of stainless steel, aluminum or concrete. According to the New Orleans Department of Public Works, the existing bollards along Bourbon Street were being removed and replaced as part of a project that began in November. Work was scheduled to continue into February and included replacing the current bollards with new removable bollards made of stainless steel. According to Fox 8 in New Orleans, the installation of the bollards in 2017 was part of a $40 million safety plan. The system consisted of four sets of barriers placed on either side of Bourbon Street intersections. The station said that the inner two columns can be pushed back when it is unlocked by a ground-level control panel. The new bollard system would have allowed the devices to be locked behind each crosswalk, the city said. During the recent construction project, the old bollards were removed and replaced by asphalt patches that allowed vehicle access. Bollards were not in place at time of deadly attack Witnesses told NewsNation on Wednesday that barricades were not in place at the time of the attack. At a news conference on Wednesday, New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that Jabbar drove the truck up onto the sidewalk, which gave him access to Bourbon Street. The bollard replacement project began less than eight years after they were installed. Shortly after being installed, the bollards began to malfunction, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. The city said that the bollard replacement project began in preparation for the city hosting the Super Bowl in early February. Bollards were not in place Wednesday because the project was nearing completion, Cantrell said. Kirkpatrick said that police officials have been aware of issues with the bollard system for some time. She said that because the bollards were not operable, police vehicles were parked at Bourbon Street to prevent traffic from getting through on New Year's Eve. Human remains found near Electric Forest music festival site However, she said Jabbar drove around the vehicles and onto the sidewalk to carry out the attack. 'We had a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there,' Kirkpatrick said. 'And (Jabbar) got around it. She added: 'We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.' Kirkpatrick said that if bollards had been in place, they would have prevented ambulances and first responders from reaching victims killed or injured during the attack. However, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno said that the absence of the bollards was not the reason the attack took place. 'This person was determined to inflict pain and death and harm on Bourbon Street, and I think he would have done that anyway he could,' Moreno said, according to MetroWest Daily News.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/bollards-new-orleans-attack/	2025-01-01T14:34:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001469314526.jpg?w=900

LAS VEGAS (KLAS) -- One person is dead and seven others are injured following a fire and explosion that started in a vehicle at the main entrance to the Las Vegas Trump International Hotel Wednesday morning. The new year was barely eight hours old when Clark County firefighters and Las Vegas Metropolitan police responded to the fire and explosion around 8:40 a.m. in the 2000 block of Fashion Show Drive, across from Fashion Show Mall and just west of the Las Vegas Strip. During a news conference, Sheriff Kevin McMahill said 'We saw smoke start showing from the vehicle and a large explosion occurs.' He added, 'There is one dead individual in the Cybertruck and I don't know if it's male or female at this time. We are investigating a number of leads' A Tesla Cybertruck caught fire at the entrance of Trump Int'l Tower in Las Vegas on Jan. 1, 2025. (Credit: Alcides Antunes) Clark County Fire Deputy Chief Thomas Touchstone said an engine arrived at the scene within minutes. 'There were multiple persons with injuries located around the vehicle.' Of the seven people who were injured, two were transported to UMC for treatment. McMahill said all the injuries were minor, at this point. A witness who asked to remain anonymous provided this photo of smoke at Trump International Tower near the Las Vegas Strip on Jan. 1, 2025, following a car fire. The sound of explosions followed by smoke raised concern for people staying at or near the hotel.

What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack	NEW ORLEANS (NewsNation) — Sources confirm to NewsNation local affiliate WGNO a 42-year-old man was responsible for the New Year’s attack that killed 10 people and injured 35 more in New Orleans. Shamsud Din Jabbar, said to be from Texas, was shot and killed by police after crashing into the crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street. Investigators recovered a handgun and an AR-style rifle after the shootout, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The FBI said an Islamic State group flag was recovered in the suspect's vehicle. Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans field office, said officials were investigating the discovery of at least one suspected improvised explosive device at the scene.

(NewsNation) — Members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua are reportedly attacking border agents with knives and tire irons. The New York Post reported that border officials are preparing for a potential gang attack on Wednesday. Alfonso Aguilar, the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship, believes the gang is taking advantage of the time remaining before President-elect Trump assumes office on Jan. 20. 'We’re seeing criminal organizations, members of Tre de Aragua, trying to get to the southern border and doing everything they can to enter the country because they know as soon as the Trump administration starts, it's going to be almost impossible to enter the country and be released into the community as it has happened during these past four years,' he said.

New Orleans attack suspect may not have acted alone: Ex-FBI agent	(NewsNation) — As police continue to piece together clues into what the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism in New Orleans, the suspect who was shot and killed by police may not have acted alone, a former FBI special agent told NewsNation. Stuart Kaplan said investigators won’t need long to identify the suspect who drove into a crowd on Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning, killing 10 and injuring 35. Given investigative tools available to police, suspects can't go unidentified for very long and Kaplan believes the suspect may have already been identified by law enforcement. Investigative technology may provide leads into where the man may have come from before carrying out Wednesday's attack. FBI: Homemade explosives seizure at Virginia farm largest in its history 'I would suggest this may be a byproduct of our unfortunate open border policies,' Kaplan told NewsNation, adding, 'Unfortunately this is the catastrophic result of an individual who was able to now create panic and fear.' Kaplan's sources suggest that the man may have entered the country illegally in the last week, and FBI investigators are working quickly to identify other 'potential bad actors' that may have been involved in the attack. Kaplan, citing sources, said government surveillance would have been able to place the suspect in Wednesday’s attack with other individuals who may have been involved. The sources indicate that the attack may be part of a bigger, more coordinated plot toward other venues and that 'other attacks may be coming our way.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-suspect-may-not-acted-alone/	2025-01-01T08:24:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001471685675.jpg?w=900

FBI: Homemade explosives seizure at Virginia farm largest in its ...	SMITHFIELD, Va. (WAVY) — Virginia residents in Isle of Wight County worried about the large FBI presence and numerous explosions heard off of Foursquare Road in mid-December finally have answers. According to federal court documents, agents had just uncovered a massive trove of pipe bombs, and deemed them too unstable to transport — so they blew them up. The FBI said it believes it's the largest amount of homemade explosives it has encountered in its history. Brad Spafford, 36, was taken into custody at his Isle of Wight County home on Dec. 17 and charged with a weapons violation. The FBI executed a search warrant and uncovered the 'improvised explosive devices,' along with bomb-making instructions and materials and a jar full of a homemade high-explosive stored in the family freezer.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'FBI bomb technicians, who X-rayed the devices on scene, assessed them as pipe bombs,' the newly filed document reads. 'The majority were found in a detached garage, organized by color. ... Some were hand-labeled 'lethal.' 'Some were preloaded into an apparent wearable vest,' it continued. 'In the garage were also found numerous tools and materials for manufacturing explosives, a home-made mortar, and riot gear.' The filing also describes how the the pipe bombs were made — with two layers of plastic tubes. '[I]n between the tubes were metal spheres which 'would enhance the fragmentation effect of the device upon its explosion.' it quotes an FBI analysis of one bomb. 'The lab concluded that the device was 'capable of causing property damage, personal injury and/or death.'' Spafford was released on $25,000 bond earlier this week. The new details in this case come from new filings from the defense, arguing to block his release. Spafford's attorney argued that he never posed a threat to anyone. A motion by the defense describes him as 'a hard-working family man with no criminal record.' '[T'he government has been investigating and carefully watching Mr. Spafford for approximately two years through the use of a confidential human source who was a friend and confidant,' it reads. 'During all of that time, there is no evidence or allegation that Mr. Spafford committed or attempted to commit any act of violence.' Spafford's original, and so far only charge, is for violating the National Firearms Act — for possessing a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16 inches. His Dec. 30 preliminary hearing found enough evidence to allow the case to move forward. The prosecution's filing worried about Spafford's ability to access weapons and the danger he might pose even to the officers who have to check up on him before trial. They acknowledged that new charges for the bombs — each one carrying 10 years — were almost certainly impending. Lawsuits, FBI probe engulf South Dakota doomsday bunker complex 'The defendant has the undisputed know-how, resources, and extreme inclination to manufacture and stockpile improvised explosive devices,' it reads. 'Even after losing his own fingers as a result of his homemade explosive materials, he made the apparent remarkable decision to keep an extraordinarily danger explosive material in the home's freezer next to food items that could be accessed by the entire family.' Most of the evidence prosecutors relied on for the firearms charge came from a person Spafford apparently believed he was friends with. He showed the man his illegal rifle and the two went shooting together. '[The source] also noted that the defendant was using pictures of the president for target practice at shooting at a local range, stated that he believed political assassinations should be brought back, and that missing children in the news had been taken by the federal government to be trained as school shooter,' the prosecution's filing reads. Spafford also allegedly joked about someone assassinating then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The document describes a casual meeting at his newly-purchased farm. 'He also discussed fortifying the property with a 360-degree turret for a 50-caliber firearm on the roof, and noted how he could block the driveway with a vehicle so no other vehicles could access,' it reads.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fbi-homemade-explosives-isle-of-wight-county/	2025-01-01T02:59:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-545129710-1.jpg?w=900
Israeli strikes kill 12 in Gaza as war grinds into the new year	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said Wednesday, as the nearly 15-month war ground on into the new year with no end in sight. One strike hit a home in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory, where Israel has been waging a major operation since early October. Gaza’s Health Ministry said seven people were killed, including a woman and four children, and at least a dozen other people were wounded. Another strike overnight in the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed a woman and a child, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The military ordered people to evacuate an area near Bureij overnight, saying it would strike there in response to recent rocket fire by Palestinian militants. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know A third strike early Wednesday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital and the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting around 250. About 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not say how many of those killed were militants. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are living in tents on the coast as winter brings frequent rainstorms and temperatures drop below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night. At least six infants and another person have died of hypothermia, according to the Health Ministry. American and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over the militants. Military blames ‘weakening of discipline’ in death of archaeologist who entered Lebanon with troops In a separate development, the Israeli military blamed 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' in the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist who was killed in southern Lebanon along with another soldier while visiting a combat zone in November. According to Israeli media reports, Zeev Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a 'fallen soldier' when it announced his death. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports at the time of his death said he entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier who was killed with him has expressed anger over the circumstances of his death. The military launched an investigation after they were killed in a Hezbollah ambush. A separate probe is looking into who allowed Erlich to enter. The military said the entry of civilians who are not military contractors or journalists into combat zones is not widespread. Still, there have been multiple reports of Israeli civilians who support a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon entering those areas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Biden doesn't believe he should have dropped out of race: Source	NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has told aides he believes he should not have ended his presidential campaign and that he could have defeated Donald Trump, a source has confirmed to NewsNation. Biden, who will leave the White House after Trump’s inauguration on January 20, said in the conversations that he believes he could have won the November election despite low approval rankings, sources confirmed. He also said he should have remained in the race despite the debate performance that many believe led to Biden dropping out of the race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris was defeated by Trump, who won both the Electoral College and popular vote en route to his capturing a second term in the White House. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know After the election loss, Harris vowed for a peaceful transfer of power during her concession speech. The Washington Post was the first to report the conversation between Biden and his aides. A NewsNation source with knowledge of the conversations between Biden and the aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that other associates believe Biden should have never dropped out of the race. Biden has not criticized Harris in the conversations, the source said. Biden said that Americans needed to keep the faith after Trump's victory and commended Harris for a 'whole heart effort.' 'The struggle for the soul of America, since our very founding, has always been an ongoing debate, and still vital today,' Biden said. 'I know for some people, it’s a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it’s a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-doesnt-believe-dropped-race/	2024-12-31T11:03:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2170948834.jpg?w=900
Drone discovers 'narco tunnel' between Arizona, Mexico	NewsNation) — Mexican law enforcement officials have discovered what they believe is a tunnel designed to smuggle drugs or people between the United States and Mexico after a drone detected the passageway. Photos of the tunnel were posted on a Facebook account operated by the State Public Secretary of Security in Sonora, Mexico. Investigators believe that the discovery will disrupt the construction of the tunnel. The agency said that the entrance of the tunnel was found in San Luis, Rio Colorado, in Mexico, which is located south of Yuma, Arizona. The tunnel stretched across the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a report by Arizona’s Family. The report indicated that a drone that was being used during a joint operation between Mexican authorities and U.S. Customs of Border Protection and discovered the tunnel's entrance just south of the border wall. ‘Common sense’ law requires congressional scrutiny, oversight of border security contracts Mexican police believe that the tunnel was in the early stages of construction. However, if completed, authorities believe the passageway would have been used as a 'narco tunnel' to smuggle drugs or people under the border wall and into the United States. 'Implementing the Border Security Protocol and using technology critical points were identified to strengthen surveillance in the area,' the Facebook post said. The police agency said that the tunnel was the third of its kind found near Yuma this year. The report said the Yuma Border Patrol did not have information about this specific tunnel. However, the agency reported it works with the Mexican police to combat border crimes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/drone-narco-tunnel-arizona-mexico/	2024-12-31T10:47:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e0c45ad05201.50438490.jpeg?w=900
Lawsuits, FBI probe engulf South Dakota doomsday bunker complex	(NewsNation) — An investigation into resident unrest at a South Dakota residential bunker complex, marketed to doomsday preppers, has uncovered multiple problems. South Dakota News Watch found the Vivox xPoint bunker complex, located eight miles south of Edgemont, is at the center of lawsuits, complaints to the state attorney general, a near-fatal shooting, and an FBI inquiry. Developed in 2016 on a former Black Hill Army Deport munitions storage facility, the complex features 500 above-ground concrete bunkers. While owner Robert K. Vicino claims more than 200 of the bunkers are leased and the community is thriving, many residents who sought to make it their permanent home disagree. At least 16 lawsuits underway Over the past four months, South Dakota News Watch uncovered 16 lawsuits involving Vivos xPoint, with actions filed both by and against residents, Vivos management, and its subcontractors. Five complaints have also been lodged with the South Dakota Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division, and two former residents confirmed FBI interviews. South Dakota doomsday city built at former Army base The lawsuits include eviction disputes, demands for refunds, and claims Vivos failed to deliver promised amenities, security, and services. Vivos owner Robert Vicino blamed 'bad apples' for the disputes, stating legal actions arise only if residents violate the 99-year lease or community rules. Residents pay up to $55,000 upfront, $3,000 for water, and ongoing fees, but they do not own their bunkers. Leases include non-disclosure clauses prohibiting media contact under penalty of fines or eviction. Attorney J. Scott James noted that evicted residents risk losing their investment, and any improvements made, with Vivos able to re-lease the bunkers. Residents interviewed by FBI The FBI's San Diego office has interviewed at least two former residents of the bunker complex, according to the South Dakota News Watch. One former resident, Elliott, told the outlet that FBI agents questioned him in November about Vicino 'dealing with problems in an illegal way.' Another ex-resident, David Streeter, told the outlet he was interviewed twice regarding leases, finances, and other allegations against Vicino. Streeter, who shot a Vivos subcontractor in August but wasn't charged, is involved in lawsuits against Vivos over evictions and defamation while also facing eviction himself. The FBI declined to respond to South Dakota News Watch's request for comment regarding the investigation or confirm if active investigations were underway. Vicino said he was unaware of any inquiry but welcomed it. Other issues residents are unhappy with At least three current and former Vivos residents told South Dakota News Watch they are concerned about two on-site subcontractors with criminal records Amenities promised by Vivos — prominently advertised on signs and its website — remain incomplete years after the complex opened. Residents report paying upfront for bunker leases or improvements that can take years to finish, if ever, while still being charged monthly fees for common area amenities. Doomsday prepping: Inside elite underground survival bunker One resident, Roehm, filed a complaint with the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office, citing issues such as an improperly installed septic system, unfinished roof repairs, and unfulfilled promises of security systems and personnel. In November, Michelle Collins, a Virginia resident, sued Vivos, alleging multiple contract breaches. According to her lawsuit, she paid $35,000 for a bunker lease, $3,000 for water, and $94,000 for improvements, while also covering annual land fees and monthly maintenance and security charges. Residents wanted a peaceful, stable life: Attorney Vicino said his son, Dante Vicino, who oversees operations at the complex, is in contact with the state attorney general's office. According to Robert Vicino, officials at the attorney general's office have praised their compliance, stating they're 'doing it by the book.' However, some residents have raised concerns about the response and protection provided by the Fall River County Sheriff's Office regarding complaints about the complex and its subcontractors. James said his clients are frustrated and disappointed, as they only sought a peaceful, stable life but have instead ended up in court. He said he hopes the state attorney general or another law enforcement agency will investigate the situation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/lawsuits-fbi-probe-engulf-south-dakota-doomsday-bunker-complex/	2024-12-31T10:28:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/south-dakota-doomsday-city.jpg?w=900

Nearly all of Puerto Rico is without power on New Year's Eve	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A blackout hit nearly all of Puerto Rico early Tuesday as the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate New Year’s, leaving more than 1.3 million clients in the dark. Officials said it could take up to two days to restore power. The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on. 'It had to be on the 31st of December!' exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. 'There is no happiness.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution. Luma said in a statement that it appears the outage was caused by a failure of an underground power line, saying it is restoring power 'in the quickest and safest way possible.' A Luma spokesman told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation. The blackout fanned simmering anger against Luma and Genera PR, which oversees the generation of power in Puerto Rico, as a growing number of people call for their ouster. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón, who is set to be sworn in on Jan. 2, has called for the creation of an 'energy czar' to review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found. Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he was in touch with Luma and Genera PR, adding on X that 'we are demanding answers and solutions.' Puerto Ricans began to plan ahead. 'I'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,' Raúl Pacheco said with a shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot. Julio Córdova, a municipal worker, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles. 'This affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?' he said, shaking his head as he raked leaves. While blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the island struggles with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in September 2017. The system, however, was already in decline after years of lack of maintenance and investment. Only recently did crews start making permanent repairs to Puerto Rico’s power grid following Hurricane Maria. The island continues to depend on generators provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to help stabilize the grid. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know In November, Puerto Rico’s government asked U.S. officials for permission to keep using more than a dozen portable generators for two additional years. Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride. 'They're part of my everyday life,' said Enid Núñez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority struggles to restructure more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of the island's government agencies. © Copyright 2024 Associated Press.

Center of the universe.' Mar-a-Lago preparing for NYE bash	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The cars begin lining up early in the morning to be screened by Secret Service agents under white tents near the fence that surrounds President-elect Donald Trump’s vast south Florida estate. Famous figures such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Tesla and X owner Elon Musk pop up at breakfasts, luncheons and other social gatherings held daily at the opulent Mar-a-Lago club. Over the weekend, Mike Love, one of the original members of the Beach Boys, performed the band’s greatest hits under an outdoor tent there as Trump, trailed by Secret Service agents, wandered through the crowd, swinging his fists to the music, according to videos posted online. At other parts of the evening, he stood next to his wife, Melania, near the pool, bobbing his head to the music. Kevin Cramer’s son sentenced to 28 years over chase, fatal car crash The resort is the 'Center of the Universe,' Trump declared on social media Friday, adding, 'Bill Gates asked to come, tonight.' Representatives for Trump and Gates didn't clarify if the Microsoft co-founder did indeed join the parade of figures making the trip to Mar-a-Lago. But the president-elect's post reflects the way his resort, where he's largely been holed up since the election, has become a salon and celebration for his movement. For the people he's selected for his administration — and those who seek to get jobs or curry favor with the incoming president — it's the place to be. Sightings of those turning up there, usually in photos posted online or in the occasional public event, offer a glimpse into the workings of Trump’s incoming White House and how he is setting priorities for office. They are also renewing concerns about transparency as the meetings are largely shrouded in secrecy, and raising questions about how Trump benefits financially as club members seeking to influence the new administration stay and eat there. 'It’s kind of unreal,' said James Fishback, an investor who has in recent days launched an investment fund in the club’s tea room and dined at the courtyard. 'This is the power center.' He recalled standing by the pasta table exchanging words with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has chosen to lead the Health Department. The winter holidays have been another occasion for Trump's celebrations and for big names to come visit. Jimmy Carter’s hometown pays tribute to late president A representative for Zuckerberg confirmed he joined Trump for a dinner the night before Thanksgiving. A Christmas Eve video showed Trump in one of the resort's ballrooms full of guests, dancing to one of his favorite songs, the Village People's 'Y.M.C.A.,' while his daughter Ivanka sat in a gilded chair nearby. It's not clear what Trump planned for New Year's Eve — he has traditionally held a bash at the resort — but in his social media post on Friday, he boasted, 'New Year’s Eve is going to be AMAZING!!!' During dinners with friends and family, Trump uses the Spotify account on his tablet to play many of the same tunes that were ubiquitous at his campaign rallies. One night, his guest of honor was Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Another night, the honor went to Akie Abe, the widow of slain Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. And, yes, that was Argentine President Javier Milei doing Trump's 'Y.M.C.A.' dance between the tables at a gala dinner. During the day, Trump often golfs at his nearby course with friends, relatives and allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Overall, the vibe is a mix of south Florida's monied social scene overlaid with the power dynamics of an executive job fair. 'He’s surrounded by a lot of old friends,' Graham said. 'I just know that everybody I know wants some job.' Musk has been a constant presence at the club, so much so that Trump’s granddaughter, Kai, wrote on X that he was 'achieving uncle status.' Trump has tasked Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy with leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental task force formed to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. Kevin Roberts, president of the think tank behind Project 2025, spoke at a December event with investors at the club. One of the guests at the small function was health care executive Dr. Peter Lamelas, later tapped by Trump to be U.S. ambassador to Argentina. Biden doesn’t believe he should have dropped out of race: Source Sometimes Trump relaxes for dinner alongside club members and guests under the yellow and white awnings in the courtyard. Other times, he will address large groups for black-tie events in the ballrooms. At a recent gala for a nonprofit led by Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, the song ″God Bless the U.S.A.,' a favorite of Trump's, cued the president-elect's entrance. 'We’re off to a really good start,' Trump told people gathered for the event. He then inquired about the whereabouts of Tom Homan, whom he has tapped to be border czar, and joked that Homan was from 'central casting.' 'Just relax, Tom. I want you to relax and get ready for the big push,' Trump said. Trump shared with the party guests that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom he threatened with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless she does more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows, 'has made progress.' At another recent event at Mar-a-Lago, this one hosted by the America First Policy Institute, the ballroom was full of recognizable Trump-world figures such as Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to the president, and Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and founder of Turning Point Action. A copy of the president-elect’s latest book was sitting on the chairs for guests as they arrived in gowns and tuxedos. As he entered the ballroom, Musk was swarmed by guests, including Kash Patel, whom Trump would later select to lead the FBI, before the tech billionaire took his seat at the center table of the ballroom. Musk was later joined there by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance. Trump tests influence over GOP with Johnson Speakership vote 'It’s the place to be and the place to be seen,' said Damian Merlo, a political strategist who advises the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele. Merlo was at that event as well as another event hosted by the Conservative Political Action Committee. At a news conference Trump held recently at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect noted the changed mood compared with his first term, saying, 'Everybody wants to be my friend.' Besides Zuckerberg, Trump has hosted other Silicon Valley executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. 'The top executives, the top bankers, they’re all calling,' Trump said. 'It’s like a complete opposite.' Actor Russell Brand traveled this month to the club to speak at an event, where he sat with actor Mel Gibson, former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson and others. Later in the evening, he stood by a palm tree on the lawn, listening to a bagpiper in a kilt. Brand later posted a video to X about his experience. 'Pretty amazing,' he said.

Jimmy Carter had a UFO encounter. What to know	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, left behind a unique legacy of openness about UFO sightings, including his own encounter in 1969, and a message to potential alien civilizations that continue to travel through space. As a rising politician in Georgia, Carter reported seeing an unidentified flying object outside a Lions Club in Leary, Georgia. He described a bright orb that changed colors from blue to red to white, moving toward and away from the group of about 25 witnesses before disappearing beyond the pine trees, per History.com. 'I've never believed that it came from Mars,' Carter told GQ magazine in 2005. 'I know enough physics to know that you can't have vehicles that are tangible in nature flying from Mars, looking around, and then flying back.' Carter said, 'And all of a sudden, one of the men looked up and said, ‘Look, over in the west!’ And there was a bright light in the sky. We all saw it. And then the light, it got closer and closer to us. And then it stopped, I don’t know how far away, but it stopped beyond the pine trees. And all of a sudden it changed color to blue, and then it changed to red, then back to white.' Lawmakers push to expand agencies’ power to cope with drones In 1973, then-Governor Carter filed an official report with the International UFO Bureau, according to History.com. During his 1976 presidential campaign, he promised to release all government UFO information if elected. However, after winning the presidency, Carter backed away from this pledge, citing national security concerns, per History.com. During his presidency, Carter maintained a fascination with space exploration. In 1977, he contributed a message to NASA's Voyager spacecraft mission, and carried on golden records into deep space, per the Daily Mail. 'We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations,' Carter wrote in the message, which continues to travel beyond our solar system along with recordings of Earth's music, languages and images, according to USA Today.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/jimmy-carter-ufo-encounter/	2024-12-30T19:14:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/02/bc343e0d27a14458bec7bff674e83888.jpg?w=900
How Jimmy Carter paved way for craft beer	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, was known to be a teetotaler. However, his name and legacy continue to buzz throughout the beer industry. In fact, without the 39th president's help, America's bustling craft beer scene might not even exist. When prohibition ended in 1933, the federal government rolled back most jurisdictions on home alcohol production — but left beer in a legal gray area. Homebrewing remained off-limits for decades, allowing big names like Anheuser-Busch, Schlitz, Pabst and Coors to dominate the market with light, mild lagers. Social Security: When are benefits being sent out in 2025? By the late 1970's, just five large breweries controlled about three-quarters of America's beer volume. Meanwhile, a small community of homebrewers was quietly experimenting with more flavorful, European-inspired style such as IPAs, porters and pale ales. Everything changed in 1978 when Carter signed HR 1337, legalizing homebrewing for personal use. The move allowed Americans to brew up to 100 gallons per person and 200 per household tax-free. Basement hobbyists becoming legitimate gave rise to the craft beer boom. From humble homebrew setups to full-scale operations, these small breweries have transformed the industry. Today, craft beer makes up over 13% of the US market. Experts say more than 90% of craft brewers began as homebrewers, proving just how pivotal the legislation Carter approved became. Before 1978, there were about 100 breweries across the United States. Now there's upwards of 10,000 and it's an industry that's still growing. Ironically, the former president himself rarely drank alcohol and famously never served little liquor in the White House, and yet his signature on that 1978 legislation laid the foundation for today's vibrant craft beer landscape.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/how-jimmy-carter-paved-way-for-craft-beer/	2024-12-30T17:22:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/651495e9c46199.52547691-e1722778856683.jpeg?w=800

(NewsNation) — Former Allman Brothers Band member Chuck Leavell, who has been the Rolling Stones' principal touring keyboardist since the 1980s, shared fond memories of the longest-living president's musical passion and genuine kindness on 'NewsNation Now.' He described first meeting Jimmy Carter in 1973 when the future president was still Georgia's governor. While Leavell and his bandmates expected Carter's gubernatorial visit to be nothing more than a quick photo-op, Carter sat with them for two hours, asking 'really great questions about the state of the music business in Georgia.' 'He was such a likable human being. He really was, you know, when you were in his presence, he made you feel comfortable. He was a great listener,' Leavell added, describing Carter as someone who had more than 'just a casual love of music.'

China hacked Treasury Department earlier this month: Officials	(NewsNation) — A Chinese state-sponsored hacker accessed U.S. Treasury workstations and stole documents in a 'major incident' in early December, a letter sent to lawmakers and reviewed by NewsNation confirmed. The Treasury Department was notified on Dec. 8, 2024, that a bad actor had 'gained access to a key' used by a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust. 'Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor,' the letter reads in part. Hackers have posted some RIBridges data on the dark web, McKee says With this key, the hacker was able to override security measures, remotely access workstations and access 'certain unclassified documents' from users. The Treasury Department said it is working with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'fully characterize the incident and determine its overall impact.' A BeyondTrust spokesperson shared the following statement with NewsNation: 'BeyondTrust previously identified and took measures to address a security incident in early December 2024 that involved the Remote Support product. BeyondTrust notified the limited number of customers who were involved, and it has been working to support those customers since then. No other BeyondTrust products were involved. Law enforcement was notified and BeyondTrust has been supporting the investigative efforts. BeyondTrust posted information regarding the incident and the on-going investigation on its website on December 8, 2024, including a summary, timeline, and indicators. The security advisory has been updated since then as part of BeyondTrust’s commitment to updating customers through the completion of this matter.' As of Dec. 30, the BeyondTrust service is offline, according to the letter. The department also assured lawmakers that 'there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/china-treasury-department-hack-security/	2024-12-30T14:19:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/cdfb1daf1c2e440291361ecca0562d4b.jpg?w=900
Northern lights could be seen in continental US on New Year's Eve	(NewsNation) — The solar system is putting on its own New Year's Eve show, with the northern lights potentially visible as far south as Oregon and Illinois on Dec. 31. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center issued a geomagnetic storm warning for New Year's Eve that could bring the aurora borealis much farther south than usual. The warning comes after several other solar storms made the northern visible to much more of the U.S. than typical in 2024. NASA spacecraft ‘safe’ after closest-ever approach to Sun The sun is currently in a period of solar maximum, where coronal mass ejections send plumes of plasma and magnetic field into space, triggering geomagnetic storm conditions to the Earth's magnetosphere. When CMEs come into contact with the magnetosphere, electrically charged particles collide with atmospheric gases and release energy that manifests as lights, giving us the colorful light show known as the aurora borealis. Weather forecast for viewing the northern lights Cloud cover could make viewing difficult in several states, including Washington, Oregon, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Those in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and parts of Idaho, on the other hand, have the best chance of catching a light show, though cloud cover could still be an issue. For the best chance of viewing the natural light show, head outside to a place with as little light pollution as possible. If you're struggling to see, your phone may help, as sensitive phone cameras can sometimes capture more of the lights than are visible to the naked eye.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/northern-lights-new-years-eve/	2024-12-30T14:11:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670a1332285440.89773874.jpeg?w=900
Trump border czar Tom Homan to migrants: 'Stay home'	(NewsNation) — Immigration officials and agents at the U.S.-Mexico border insist there is still time for a potential surge of immigrants to cross into the country illegally before President-elect Donald Trump takes office and cracks down on border entries. Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan, have pledged to begin mass deportation efforts on Day 1 of Trump’s second White House term. But with three weeks before Trump’s inauguration, federal immigration officials believe they could be facing an influx of migrants who attempt to find safety in the United States before the border is closed. Homan, however, is warning them not to come. Several caravans of immigrants have broken free from Mexico’s southernmost point in Tapachula near the Guatemalan border. However, those groups of migrants have not yet reached the U.S.-Mexico border. Migrant crisis added to record-level US homelessness: HUD Instead, smaller segments of those caravans have arrived in Eagle Pass, Texas, before Trump takes office. Since President Joe Biden took office in 2021, more than 8 million migrants have been encountered at the southern border. The majority were given a court date to appear at an immigration hearing, which can take years to materialize. Homan told NewsNation that immigrants who cross illegally and then enter the process seeking asylum should not get comfortable living in the United States. 'They need to hear, they need to understand, ‘Do not sell everything you own to give it to the criminal cartels to be smuggled into the United States because you’re not going to stay,’' Homan said. Homan said that the Trump administration will be ending the federal 'catch and release' program, which allows immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country as long as they are in the process for asylum. 'Stay in your homeland,' Homan told NewsNation. 'Be safe. Crossing into this country illegally is very dangerous.' Trump ‘border czar’ says he will override sanctuary city roadblocks Homan said that a record number of migrants have died attempting to cross into the United States and that a record number of Americans are dying from fentanyl. Homan blamed both the migrant and American deaths on the Biden administration and its approach to the border. Texas Department of Public Safety officers encountered two unaccompanied girls who were abandoned by a smuggler in Eagle Pass before the smuggler fled back to Mexico. Texas DPS said that the girls were ages 5 and 9 and were from El Salvador. Both children had a note that included an address and phone number. While Homan wants migrants to remain safe, he told NewsNation that many are ignoring warnings in an attempt to get family members across the border before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Homan’s warnings come at Mexico government officials announced they would open 25 detention centers for immigrants who were sent back across the border once they were detained by U.S. immigration officials. With a tougher stance coming once Trump takes office, Homan said there is one solution for migrants looking to remain safe. 'Stay home,' Homan said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/homan-migrants-stay-home/	2024-12-30T13:56:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24159796496621.jpg?w=900
Family of missing woman Ruthey Smith fear she was trafficked	(NewsNation) — Relatives of missing woman Ruthey Smith fear she may have been trafficked and are hoping to use a billboard to draw more attention to her disappearance. Dec. 27, 2024, should have been Smith's 22nd birthday. Instead, her family pleaded for the public's help in finding her nearly three years after she disappeared in a Los Angeles area notorious for gang violence and prostitution. Smith was last seen in March 2022. She had been working as a prostitute to gain financial independence for her daughter, who was born when Smith was 16. Chicago police searching for missing 12-year-old girl Tylea Vassor Her family describes Smith as a devoted mother. They had tried to find help and support for her, even staging an intervention for her. Smith's mother said she thinks Smith's being a sex worker and a Black woman have contributed to a lack of attention and urgency when it comes to investigating her case. The family said they initially approached the Los Angeles Police Department after Smith disappeared but the police refused to take the case. Ruthey and her daughter, Ocean.

Former President Jimmy Carter's state funeral: What we know	(NewsNation) — The state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, will be held on January 9 at Washington National Cathedral, the White House has announced. Jimmy Carter's funeral NewsNation confirmed on Monday that President Joe Biden, who addressed the nation on Sunday night after Carter's passing, is expected to deliver the eulogy at the funeral. More details are expected to be announced soon. The funeral will take place three days after Carter’s body is flown to Washington from Atlanta, where the former president will lie in repose on Saturday and Sunday at the Carter Center. The Carter Center announced on Sunday that public observances for the 39th president will be held in Atlanta and Washington before private interment will be held in Plains, Georgia. A state funeral is a national tribute that is traditionally reserved for a head of state, according to the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region and the U.S. Military District of Washington. The United States conducts the funerals on behalf of all people who hold, or who have held, the office of president, president-elect, and other people who have been designated by the president. A state funeral is typically made up of three stages and typically lasts 7-10 days. In former President Carter’s case, however, this week’s New Year’s holiday will delay the start of the process. Stage 1 of the state funeral takes place in the former president’s state of residence. The New York Times reported that Carter’s body will be taken by motorcade from Plains to Atlanta, which is the site of the Carter Center. Stage 2 includes ceremonies that are held in Washington before the state funeral culminates with interment. The Washington ceremonies may involve Armed Forces color guards, elite military bands and other representatives from service academies, the JTR-NCR/USAMDW said. Any services held outside of Washington include Washington-based honor guards and local service units as well as active duty, National Guard and Reserve for logistical, military band or salute guns support. Who will attend Jimmy Carter’s state funeral? State funerals are typically expected to be attended by other former presidents, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The New York Times reported it is not yet known whether President-elect Donald Trump will attend the funeral, which will take place 11 days before Trump’s inauguration.

Bush at the National Cathedral, Dec. 5, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Biden has also declared January 9 as a National Day of Mourning. Biden ordered all flags across the nation to remain at half-staff for the next 30 days. ABC News reported Carter asked Biden in 2023 to deliver his eulogy upon his passing. Biden endorsed Carter as the Democratic nominee for president during his first term as a U.S. senator and was the first member of Congress to do so. 'I think that what Jimmy Carter is an example of is just simple decency,' Biden said about Carter. 'And I think that’s what the rest of the world looks to America for.' NewsNation has confirmed that in addition to Biden speaking at the state funeral, eulogies will also be delivered by Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson who is the chairman of the board of the Carter Center. Other eulogies will be delivered by the son of former President Gerald Ford and the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale. Mondale was Carter’s running mate when Carter defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election. The national funeral will be the first to be held since former President George H.W. Bush died in 2018. What will happen before and after the national funeral? Once Carter’s body arrives in Washington on January 6, the former president will lie in state at the Capitol, where presidents dating back to Abraham Lincoln have been publicly remembered. Thousands of people are expected to pass through the Capitol Rotunda to pay their respects. The Carter Center issued a statement on Monday saying that the U.S. Congress graciously extended an invitation to allow the former president to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Washington National Cathedral is located just a few miles north of the White House and has been the venue used for several state funerals, ABC News reported. Other former presidents whose service was held at the church have included Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Carter will be returned to Georgia by military flight for burial after the national funeral. The New York Times reported that Carter’s body was initially set to be returned to Georgia by train, but that the former president objected. 'If you take my cold, dead body across the U.S. by train, I’ll haunt you until the day you die,' he told a staffer, according to the report. Carter is expected to be buried next to his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter, who died last year at the age of 96. The Carter Center family has asked that in lieu of flowers, donations are asked to be made to the nonprofit Carter Center, which is located at 453 John Lewis Freedom Parkway, N.E. in Atlanta.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/former-president-jimmy-carters-state-funeral-what-we-know/	2024-12-30T10:14:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ebe9a74477d4.41431495.jpeg?w=900
Judge blocks Biden admin from selling border wall materials	DALLAS (NewsNation) — A federal judge in Texas has ruled that the Biden administration must stop selling border wall materials that the outgoing president has refused to install. The Biden administration agreed to stop selling further border wall materials over the next 30 days. In a Truth Social post, President-elect Trump celebrated the blocked sale, calling the ruling 'a major, crucial WIN for America.' 'The Judge has also ordered an investigation into the illegal selling of the materials, which will expose just how corrupt and anti-American Radical Democrats are,' Trump added. What are the pros and cons of incremental budgeting? Texas AG applauds judge blocking sale The effort, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, began amid reports that the Biden administration was selling border wall materials. 'We have successfully blocked the Biden administration from disposing of any further border wall materials before President Trump takes office,' said Paxton, who has said he wants to help the incoming Trump administration with mass deportation efforts. Materials auctioned cheaply: Texas officials This battle over the border wall materials has been going on for years. In 2023, Congress ordered the U.S. Department of Defense to sell off remaining border wall materials. Some were sent to border states and federal agencies, while others were sold to a private auction company GovPlanet.com for pennies on the dollar, according to Texas officials. This December, Paxton filed a motion to halt further sales. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick celebrated the decision on X, calling it 'a huge win for Donald Trump and Texas!' 'The border wall that Joe Biden was attempting to auction off for pennies on the dollar in secret has been stopped,' he added. Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly planning to issue an executive order releasing funds to restart building the border wall, potentially on day one of his presidency.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/judge-blocks-biden-admin-selling-border-wall-materials/	2024-12-30T07:12:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2155622941.jpg?w=900
Homelessness in US at record high levels: HUD	(NewsNation) — According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's annual assessment report, overall homelessness in America rose by 18% in 2024. The report found more than 770,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, a 33% increase from 2023. The number of homeless older Americans also rose, with more than 140,000 people over the age of 55 going unhoused in the U.S. this year. Nearly half of these older Americans reported living in places not meant for humans. Can you fly with pot? Here’s what the TSA says 'No American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe and quality housing they deserve,' HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement. HUD officials noted that the report reflects information collected a year ago, and likely does not represent current circumstances. It also misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own. 'While this data is nearly a year old, and no longer reflects the situation we are seeing, it is critical that we focus on evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness,' Todman said. Black Americans were overrepresented among the homeless population at about 32%, despite making up 12% of the overall population. While nearly every demographic in the U.S. reported record levels of homelessness this year, veterans saw a drop in their numbers. 'We know what works, and our success in reducing veteran homelessness by 55.2% since 2010 shows that,' Todman said. In addition, major cities such as Dallas, Texas and Los Angeles, as well as Chester County, Pennsylvania, saw declines in homelessness. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/homelessness-record-high-levels-hud/	2024-12-30T06:23:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/generic-homeless-generic-homelessness-generic-camper.jpg?w=640
Texas deploys more than 300 responders to southeast Texas	AUSTIN (KXAN)-- Texas is sending more than 300 responders to assist with recovery following a severe weather event in southeast Texas, according to a Saturday statement from acting Governor Dan Patrick.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th US president, has died at 100	ATLANTA (AP) — Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, endured humbling defeat after one tumultuous term and then redefined life after the White House as a global humanitarian, has died. He was 100 years old. The longest-lived American president died on Sunday, roughly 22 months after entering hospice care, at his home in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died at 96 in November 2023, spent most of their lives, The Carter Center said. 'Our founder, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia,' the center said on the social media platform X. It added in a statement that he died peacefully, surrounded by his family. As reaction poured in from around the world, President Joe Biden mourned Carter’s death, saying the world lost an 'extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian' and he lost a dear friend. Biden cited Carter’s work to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil and human rights, promote free and fair elections and house the homeless as an example for others. 'To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility,' Biden said in a statement. Biden spoke later Sunday evening about Carter, calling it a 'sad day' but one that 'brings back an incredible amount of good memories.' 'I’ve been hanging out with Jimmy Carter for over 50 years,' Biden said in his remarks. He recalled the former president being a comfort to him and his wife Jill when their son Beau died in 2015 of cancer. The president remarked how cancer was a common bond between their families, with Carter himself having cancer later in his life. 'Jimmy knew the ravages of the disease too well,' said Biden, who scheduled a state funeral in Washington, D.C., for Carter on Jan. 9. Biden also declared Jan. 9 as a National Day of Mourning across the nation and ordered U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for 30 days from Sunday. Businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world — Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation’s highest office. The 39th president leveraged his ambition with a keen intellect, deep religious faith and prodigious work ethic, conducting diplomatic missions into his 80s and building houses for the poor well into his 90s. 'My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,' Carter once said. A president from Plains A moderate Democrat, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and technocratic plans reflecting his education as an engineer. His no-frills campaign depended on public financing, and his promise not to deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia. 'If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,' Carter repeated before narrowly beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who had lost popularity pardoning Nixon. Carter governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. His most acclaimed achievement in office was a Mideast peace deal that he brokered by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy. Yet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan. Carter acknowledged in his 2020 'White House Diary' that he could be 'micromanaging' and 'excessively autocratic,' complicating dealings with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. He also turned a cold shoulder to Washington’s news media and lobbyists, not fully appreciating their influence on his political fortunes. 'It didn’t take us long to realize that the underestimation existed, but by that time we were not able to repair the mistake,' Carter told historians in 1982, suggesting that he had 'an inherent incompatibility' with Washington insiders. Carter insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to 'protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully' and 'enhance human rights here and abroad' — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term. And then, the world Ignominious defeat, though, allowed for renewal. The Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind base of operations, asserting themselves as international peacemakers and champions of democracy, public health and human rights. 'I was not interested in just building a museum or storing my White House records and memorabilia,' Carter wrote in a memoir published after his 90th birthday. 'I wanted a place where we could work.' That work included easing nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, helping to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiating cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, The Carter Center had declared at least 113 elections in Latin America, Asia and Africa to be free or fraudulent. Recently, the center began monitoring U.S. elections as well. Carter’s stubborn self-assuredness and even self-righteousness proved effective once he was unencumbered by the Washington order, sometimes to the point of frustrating his successors. He went 'where others are not treading,' he said, to places like Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had wandered across the border in 2010. 'I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on projects that please me and reject the ones that don’t,' Carter said. He announced an arms-reduction-for-aid deal with North Korea without clearing the details with Bill Clinton’s White House. He openly criticized President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also criticized America’s approach to Israel with his 2006 book 'Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.' And he repeatedly countered U.S. administrations by insisting North Korea should be included in international affairs, a position that most aligned Carter with Republican President Donald Trump. Among the center’s many public health initiatives, Carter vowed to eradicate the guinea worm parasite during his lifetime, and nearly achieved it: Cases dropped from millions in the 1980s to nearly a handful. With hardhats and hammers, the Carters also built homes with Habitat for Humanity. The Nobel committee’s 2002 Peace Prize cites his 'untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.' Carter should have won it alongside Sadat and Begin in 1978, the chairman added. Carter accepted the recognition saying there was more work to be done. 'The world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place,' he said. 'The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched by equal understanding and mutual respect.' ‘An epic American life’ Carter’s globetrotting took him to remote villages where he met little 'Jimmy Carters,' so named by admiring parents. But he spent most of his days in the same one-story Plains house — expanded and guarded by Secret Service agents — where they lived before he became governor. He regularly taught Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church until his mobility declined and the coronavirus pandemic raged. Those sessions drew visitors from around the world to the small sanctuary where Carter will receive his final send-off after a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral. The common assessment that he was a better ex-president than president rankled Carter and his allies. His prolific post-presidency gave him a brand above politics, particularly for Americans too young to witness him in office. But Carter also lived long enough to see biographers and historians reassess his White House years more generously. His record includes the deregulation of key industries, reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cautious management of the national debt and notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health. He focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictators to release thousands of political prisoners. He acknowledged America’s historical imperialism, pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders and relinquished control of the Panama Canal. He normalized relations with China. 'I am not nominating Jimmy Carter for a place on Mount Rushmore,' Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic policy director, wrote in a 2018 book. 'He was not a great president' but also not the 'hapless and weak' caricature voters rejected in 1980, Eizenstat said. Rather, Carter was 'good and productive' and 'delivered results, many of which were realized only after he left office.' Madeleine Albright, a national security staffer for Carter and Clinton’s secretary of state, wrote in Eizenstat’s forward that Carter was 'consequential and successful' and expressed hope that 'perceptions will continue to evolve' about his presidency. 'Our country was lucky to have him as our leader,' said Albright, who died in 2022. Jonathan Alter, who penned a comprehensive Carter biography published in 2020, said in an interview that Carter should be remembered for 'an epic American life' spanning from a humble start in a home with no electricity or indoor plumbing through decades on the world stage across two centuries. 'He will likely go down as one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history,' Alter told The Associated Press. A small-town start James Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains and spent his early years in nearby Archery. His family was a minority in the mostly Black community, decades before the civil rights movement played out at the dawn of Carter’s political career. Carter, who campaigned as a moderate on race relations but governed more progressively, talked often of the influence of his Black caregivers and playmates but also noted his advantages: His land-owning father sat atop Archery’s tenant-farming system and owned a main street grocery. His mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns. Seeking to broaden his world beyond Plains and its population of fewer than 1,000 — then and now — Carter won an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946. That same year he married Rosalynn Smith, another Plains native, a decision he considered more important than any he made as head of state. She shared his desire to see the world, sacrificing college to support his Navy career. Carter climbed in rank to lieutenant, but then his father was diagnosed with cancer, so the submarine officer set aside his ambitions of admiralty and moved the family back to Plains. His decision angered Rosalynn, even as she dived into the peanut business alongside her husband. Carter again failed to talk with his wife before his first run for office — he later called it 'inconceivable' not to have consulted her on such major life decisions — but this time, she was on board. 'My wife is much more political,' Carter told the AP in 2021. He won a state Senate seat in 1962 but wasn’t long for the General Assembly and its back-slapping, deal-cutting ways. He ran for governor in 1966 — losing to arch-segregationist Lester Maddox — and then immediately focused on the next campaign. Carter had spoken out against church segregation as a Baptist deacon and opposed racist 'Dixiecrats' as a state senator. Yet as a local school board leader in the 1950s he had not pushed to end school segregation even after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, despite his private support for integration. And in 1970, Carter ran for governor again as the more conservative Democrat against Carl Sanders, a wealthy businessman Carter mocked as 'Cufflinks Carl.' Sanders never forgave him for anonymous, race-baiting flyers, which Carter disavowed. Ultimately, Carter won his races by attracting both Black voters and culturally conservative whites. Once in office, he was more direct. 'I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,' he declared in his 1971 inaugural address, setting a new standard for Southern governors that landed him on the cover of Time magazine. 'Jimmy Who?' His statehouse initiatives included environmental protection, boosting rural education and overhauling antiquated executive branch structures. He proclaimed Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the slain civil rights leader’s home state. And he decided, as he received presidential candidates in 1972, that they were no more talented than he was. In 1974, he ran Democrats’ national campaign arm. Then he declared his own candidacy for 1976. An Atlanta newspaper responded with the headline: 'Jimmy Who?' The Carters and a 'Peanut Brigade' of family members and Georgia supporters camped out in Iowa and New Hampshire, establishing both states as presidential proving grounds. His first Senate endorsement: a young first-termer from Delaware named Joe Biden. Yet it was Carter’s ability to navigate America’s complex racial and rural politics that cemented the nomination. He swept the Deep South that November, the last Democrat to do so, as many white Southerners shifted to Republicans in response to civil rights initiatives. A self-declared 'born-again Christian,' Carter drew snickers by referring to Scripture in a Playboy magazine interview, saying he 'had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.' The remarks gave Ford a new foothold and television comedians pounced — including NBC’s new 'Saturday Night Live' show. But voters weary of cynicism in politics found it endearing. Carter chose Minnesota Sen. Walter 'Fritz' Mondale as his running mate on a 'Grits and Fritz' ticket. In office, he elevated the vice presidency and the first lady’s office. Mondale’s governing partnership was a model for influential successors Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden. Rosalynn Carter was one of the most involved presidential spouses in history, welcomed into Cabinet meetings and huddles with lawmakers and top aides. The Carters presided with uncommon informality: He used his nickname 'Jimmy' even when taking the oath of office, carried his own luggage and tried to silence the Marine Band’s 'Hail to the Chief.' They bought their clothes off the rack. Carter wore a cardigan for a White House address, urging Americans to conserve energy by turning down their thermostats. Amy, the youngest of four children, attended District of Columbia public school. Washington’s social and media elite scorned their style. But the larger concern was that 'he hated politics,' according to Eizenstat, leaving him nowhere to turn politically once economic turmoil and foreign policy challenges took their toll. Accomplishments, and ‘malaise’ Carter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres of Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and nonwhite people to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. He appointed Paul Volker, the Federal Reserve chairman whose policies would help the economy boom in the 1980s — after Carter left office. He built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy. But he couldn’t immediately tame inflation or the related energy crisis. And then came Iran. After he admitted the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979 by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Negotiations to free the hostages broke down repeatedly ahead of the failed rescue attempt. The same year, Carter signed SALT II, the new strategic arms treaty with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, only to pull it back, impose trade sanctions and order a U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Hoping to instill optimism, he delivered what the media dubbed his 'malaise' speech, although he didn’t use that word. He declared the nation was suffering 'a crisis of confidence.' By then, many Americans had lost confidence in the president, not themselves. Carter campaigned sparingly for reelection because of the hostage crisis, instead sending Rosalynn as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Carter famously said he’d 'kick his ass,' but was hobbled by Kennedy as Reagan rallied a broad coalition with 'make America great again' appeals and asking voters whether they were 'better off than you were four years ago.' Reagan further capitalized on Carter’s lecturing tone, eviscerating him in their lone fall debate with the quip: 'There you go again.' Carter lost all but six states and Republicans rolled to a new Senate majority. Carter successfully negotiated the hostages’ freedom after the election, but in one final, bitter turn of events, Tehran waited until hours after Carter left office to let them walk free. 'A wonderful life' At 56, Carter returned to Georgia with 'no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.' Four decades after launching The Carter Center, he still talked of unfinished business. 'I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,' Carter told the AP in 2021. 'But it’s turned out to be much more long-lasting and insidious than I had thought it was. I think in general, the world itself is much more divided than in previous years.' Still, he affirmed what he said when he underwent treatment for a cancer diagnosis in his 10th decade of life. 'I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,' he said in 2015. 'I’ve had a wonderful life. I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.' ___ Sanz is a former Associated Press reporter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/ap-us-news/ap-jimmy-carter-the-39th-us-president-has-died-at-100/	2024-12-30T03:11:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67728079b742c0.37109972.jpeg?w=900

'His life was dedicated to others,' Biden said, listing some of his efforts which included working to fight disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections around the world, and build housing for the homeless with his own hands.

Jimmy Carter 'was most impactful one-term president': Stuart Eize...	(NewsNation) — Jimmy Carter was 'the most impactful one-term president' in modern American history, according to his former domestic policy adviser Stuart Eizenstat, who defended the 39th president's legacy following Carter's death Sunday at age 100. Eizenstat, speaking with NewsNation before Carter's passing, cited the former president's achievements in energy security and foreign policy, arguing that Carter's presidency laid crucial groundwork for America's future despite his 1980 electoral defeat to Ronald Reagan. 'The energy security which we enjoy as a country today, the lack of dependence on OPEC oil… rests on the foundation of three major energy bills that he passed,' Eizenstat said. How Jimmy Carter’s marriage to Rosalynn Carter helped shape his legacy He also credited Carter for initiating defense programs that would later be associated with the Reagan administration, including the cruise missile and stealth bomber. His post-presidential work through the Carter Center included monitoring over 100 democratic elections and helping combat diseases in Africa. 'This was a life well lived,' Eizenstat said, 'not just in longevity, but in its impact from the time he got into public life and served as a submariner to the time he passed away.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-impactful-one-term-president-stuart-eizenstat/	2024-12-29T18:44:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot-6-1.jpg?w=900
Geraldo Rivera recalls Jimmy Carter's life, legacy	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter was the 'most underrated president we've ever had,' NewsNation correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera said in the hours after the 100-year-old's passing. 'He was a wonderful president and even better in his post-presidential life, I think that history will come to regard him, really, truly, as one of the best we've had,' Rivera said on 'NewsNation Prime.' Carter, the 39th president known for his peanut farm and loving relationship with his wife, passed away on Dec. 29, 2024, in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, after more than a year of hospice care. Former President Jimmy Carter dies at 100 Rivera first met Carter at a campaign event in 1975, the first time the then-Georgia governor had traveled north of the Mason-Dixon line. Rivera ended up introducing Carter at the event through a connection with the southern rock band the Allman Brothers. 'I was very proud,' Rivera said. 'I played a tiny part in the history to help propel this really wonderful man, wonderful, compassionate man.' Carter himself said the Allman Brothers helped him get elected.

How long will flags fly at half-staff for Jimmy Carter?	(NEXSTAR) - Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, died 'peacefully' in his Georgia home Sunday, the Carter Center confirmed. He was 100 years old. Carter, the longest-living American president, underwent a series of short hospital stays before being placed in hospice care in February 2023. He had 'decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.' To pay tribute to Carter, and in accordance with federal law, the flag was lowered to fly at half-staff Sunday. Flags on federal buildings and grounds in the U.S. and its territories, as well as all naval vessels, will also fly at half-staff. You will likely also see your governor issue a proclamation ordering flags to fly at half-staff at state government facilities. Politicians mourn Jimmy Carter’s death According to a proclamation signed by then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954, because Carter is a former president, flags are to remain at half-staff for 30 days from the day of Carter's death. This is the longest period possible for the flags to fly at half-staff, reserved for the death of the sitting president or former presidents, per the proclamation. Should the sitting vice president, chief justice (current or retired) of the Supreme Court, or the sitting speaker of the house die, flags would be ordered to half-staff for 10 days from the day of death. For other officials – associate justices of the Supreme Court; a Cabinet member; a former vice president; the president pro tempore of the Senate; and majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate – flags are to fly at half-staff from the day of death until interment. Flags are flown at half-staff 'when the whole nation is in mourning,' the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs explains.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/how-long-will-flags-fly-at-half-staff-for-jimmy-carter/	2024-12-29T15:00:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/gettyimages-93160807-e1564950075396-1-e1735511691928.jpg?w=800

'President Carter lived a truly American dream,' McConnell said in a statement. 'His calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable.' Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp emphasized Carter's connection to his home state. 'As the only American president thus far to come from Georgia, he showed the world the impact our state and its people have on the country,' Kemp said in a statement. Former President Bill Clinton and his wife former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recalled their early support of Carter's 1976 presidential campaign.

Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who developed a personal friendship with Carter, called him 'one of my heroes' and praised his commitment to public service.

Carter to be honored with events in Georgia, Washington	Former President Jimmy Carter will be honored with public observances in both Georgia and Washington, D.C., in the coming days, following his death on Sunday. He will be interred in Plains, Ga., according to the Carter Center. Details on events are still being ironed out, handled by the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region. President Biden said in March 2023 that Carter had asked the sitting president to deliver his eulogy when the time came. Jimmy Carter’s accomplishments, in and out of office 'I spent time with Jimmy Carter, and it’s finally caught up with him, but they found a way to keep him going for a lot longer than they anticipated because they found a breakthrough,' Biden said at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. The Carter Center has encouraged anyone wishing to remember Carter to visit an official tribute website, at www.jimmycartertribute.org, home to a condolence book and commemorations of his life.

Notable quotes by Jimmy Carter	Some quotations from Jimmy Carter. We have a tendency to exalt ourselves and to dwell on the weaknesses and mistakes of others. I have come to realize that in every person there is something fine and pure and noble, along with a desire for self-fulfillment. Political and religious leaders must attempt to provide a society within which these human attributes can be nurtured and enhanced. — from 1975 book 'Why Not the Best?' ___ Our government can express the highest common ideals of human beings — if we demand of government true standards of excellence. At this Bicentennial time of introspection and concern, we must demand such standards. — 'Why Not the Best?' ___ I am a Southerner and an American, I am a farmer, an engineer, a father and husband, a Christian, a politician and former governor, a planner, a businessman, a nuclear physicist, a naval officer, a canoeist, and among other things a lover of Bob Dylan’s songs and Dylan Thomas’s poetry. — 'Why Not the Best?' ___ Christ said, 'I tell you that anyone who looks on a woman with lust has in his heart already committed adultery.' I’ve looked on a lot of women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times. This is something that God recognizes I will do — and I have done it — and God forgives me for it. But that doesn’t mean that I condemn someone who not only looks on a woman with lust but who leaves his wife and shacks up with somebody out of wedlock. — Interview, November 1976 Playboy. ___ This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our Government, and a new spirit among us all. A President may sense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it. — Inaugural address, January 1977. ___ It’s clear that the true problems of our nation are much deeper — deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages, deeper even than inflation and recession. ... All the legislation in the world can’t fix what’s wrong with America. ... It is a crisis of confidence. — So-called 'malaise' speech, July 1979. ___ But we know that democracy is always an unfinished creation. Each generation must renew its foundations. Each generation must rediscover the meaning of this hallowed vision in the light of its own modern challenges. For this generation, ours, life is nuclear survival; liberty is human rights; the pursuit of happiness is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants. — Farewell Address, January 1981. ___ We appreciate the past. We are grateful for the present and we’re looking forward to the future with great anticipation and commitment. — October 1986, at the dedication of the Carter Presidential Library and Museum. ___ War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn to live together in peace by killing each other’s children. — December 2002, Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. ___ Fundamentalists have become increasingly influential in both religion and government, and have managed to change the nuances and subtleties of historic debate into black-and-white rigidities and the personal derogation of those who dare to disagree. ... The influence of these various trends poses a threat to many of our nation’s historic customs and moral commitments, both in government and in houses of worship. — From 2005 book 'Our Endangered Values.' ___ I think that this breakthrough by Barack Obama has been remarkable. When he made his speech (on race) a few months ago in Philadelphia, I wept. I sat in front of the television and cried, because I saw that as the most enlightening and transforming analysis of racism and a potential end of it that I ever saw in my life. — August 2008, commenting on then-Sen. Barack Obama’s candidacy. ___ I think it’s based on racism. There is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African-American should not be president. ... No matter who he is or how much we disagree with his policies, the president should be treated with respect. — September 2009, reacting to Rep. Joe Wilson’s shout of 'You lie!' during a speech to Congress by President Barack Obama. ___ I’m still determined to outlive the last guinea worm. — 2010, on The Carter Center’s work to eradicate guinea worm disease. ___ You know how much I raised to run against Gerald Ford? Zero. You know how much I raised to run against Ronald Reagan? Zero. You know how much will be raised this year by all presidential, Senate and House campaigns? $6 billion. That’s 6,000 millions. — September 2012, reacting to the 2010 'Citizens United' U.S. Supreme Court decision permitting unlimited third-party political spending. ___ I have become convinced that the most serious and unaddressed worldwide challenge is the deprivation and abuse of women and girls, largely caused by a false interpretation of carefully selected religious texts and a growing tolerance of violence and warfare, unfortunately following the example set during my lifetime by the United States. — From 2014 book 'A Call to Action.' ___ I don’t think there’s any doubt now that the NSA or other agencies monitor or record almost every telephone call made in the United States, including cellphones, and I presume email as well. We’ve gone a long way down the road of violating Americans’ basic civil rights, as far as privacy is concerned. — March 2014, commenting on U.S. intelligence monitoring after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks ___ We accept self-congratulations about the wonderful 50th anniversary - which is wonderful - but we feel like Lyndon Johnson did it and we don’t have to do anything anymore. — April 2014, commenting on racial inequality during a celebration of the Civil Rights Act’s 40th anniversary. ___ I had a very challenging question at Emory (University) the other night: 'How would you describe the United States of America today in one word?' And I didn’t know what to say for a few moments, but I finally said, 'Searching.' I think the country in which we live is still searching for what it ought to be, and what it can be, and I’m not sure we’re making much progress right at this moment. — October 2014 during a celebration of his 90th birthday. ___ The life we have now is the best of all. We have an expanding and harmonious family, a rich life in our church and the Plains community, and a diversity of projects at The Carter Center that is adventurous and exciting. Rosalynn and I have visited more than 145 countries, and both of us are as active as we have ever been.

Jimmy Carter's accomplishments, in and out of office	(NewsNation) — The domestic and charitable achievements of Jimmy Carter, the nation's 39th president, extend well beyond his four years in office. Carter envisioned a 'competent and compassionate' government. From his championing of human rights to his environmentally conscious track record to his negotiating, policy-setting and personal contributions, echoes of Carter's influence are still noticeable today. Here's a look at his legacy, both in the White House and in the years after. Camp David Peace Accords In 1978, Carter played a significant role in the Camp David Accords, a pair of agreements that helped stabilize an otherwise tumultuous relationship between Egypt and Israel. From the outset of his presidency, Carter hoped to reconvene the Geneva Conference to end Arab-Israeli tensions. Ultimately, two weeks of secret negotiations at the U.S. presidential retreat Camp David yielded results. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed a series of agreements in September 1978. The Camp David Peace Accords are thought to be a framework for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt the following year. The Carter Center Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter went on to establish a non-profit organization centered on human rights in 1982. Today, the Carter Center is responsible for observing 114 elections in 39 countries 'to help establish and strengthen democracies' and was a leader in new public health approaches to prevent and control diseases in Africa and Latin America, according to the organization's website. By 2002, Carter would be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize 'for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.' Creation of the Department of Education President Andrew Johnson first attempted to create a U.S. Department of Education in 1867, but it was downgraded to the Office of Education out of fear it would have too much power over local schools. Under Carter, the Department of Education was officially created in 1980 with a different vision. While Johnson's department would have existed primarily to collect data about the nation's schools, Carter's was born out of growing efforts to help foster equal access to education, according to the department's website. Congress passed the Department of Education Organization Act in October 1979, and the department began carrying out its duties the following May. Established national energy policy Carter created the U.S. Department of Energy and is behind policy establishing national energy goals. The National Energy Act focused on reducing annual growth in energy demand and oil imports and gasoline consumption as well as improving the efficacy of heating and cooling systems, increasing coal production and introducing solar energy in American homes. He's also been lauded for decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. The Carter Work Project Carter was in New York to speak at a church in 1984 when he stopped by a Habitat for Humanity construction site, according to the organization's website. Wanting to secure more volunteers for the project, Carter and his wife returned to the site with dozens of people and helped renovate an apartment building. So began the first Carter Work Project, which is now a weeklong annual tradition. To date, the Carters have joined more than 103,000 volunteers across 14 different countries to repair and build thousands of homes, according to Habitat for Humanity.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carters-accomplishments/	2024-12-29T13:46:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/GettyImages-2070989.jpg?w=900
Five defining moments of Jimmy Carter's presidency	Former President Carter's post-presidential life lasted decades, putting his career in the White House in a deep rearview mirror in many ways. Carter died Sunday, according to the Carter Center. It was a memorable four-year term, and one that has some parallels to today's battles over inflation, and how to deal with an unstable Iran and Middle East. The Carter years brought a Democrat to office after the short presidency of Gerald Ford, who took office after the Watergate controversy that ended the Nixon administration. But the Georgia Democrat's presidency was ended by the Reagan revolution, which impacted the political scene for the following decades. Here are five defining moments from Carter's presidency. Camp David Accords Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin chats informally with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and U.S. President Jimmy Carter during their peace talks on September 6, 1978, at the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland. (Photo by Moshe Milner/GPO via Getty Images) Carter's crowning achievement as president was the peace treaty signed between Israel and Egypt in 1978. Carter invited Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David in Maryland to negotiate a peace agreement. After nearly two weeks of intense negotiations, which very nearly failed multiple times, the three men signed the Camp David Accords. The agreements included a process for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, an outline for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and frameworks for peace among Israel and its other neighbors in the region. The Sinai Peninsula was demilitarized, and Israeli ships won free passage through the Suez Canal. Sadat and Begin would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize later in 1981; Sadat was assassinated two years later. While the treaty did not lead to a lasting peace throughout the Middle East and was opposed by the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Arab states, it cast a long shadow on peace negotiations in the region, including a 2000 effort by former President Clinton. The intervention by Carter remains among the most significant diplomatic accomplishments by a president in modern history. ‘Malaise’ speech President Jimmy Carter at his desk in the Oval Office, talking to his new Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, White House, Washington, D.C., July 19, 1979. In mid-1979, the U.S. was facing high inflation, rising interest rates and both unemployment and energy crises. The problems were crippling Carter’s presidency. In July 1979, with an approval rating of just 29 percent, Carter decided to address the American public. In a nationally televised speech from Camp David, Carter laid out energy proposals such as increased domestic production, restricting foreign imports and taxing energy profits to fund research for new energy technologies. But the speech wouldn’t be remembered for Carter’s vision to curb the economic and energy crisis facing the nation. Instead, Carter’s speech on July 15, 1979, would be remembered as his 'malaise' or 'crisis of confidence' speech. Carter said the U.S. was facing a 'fundamental threat to American democracy' — what he called a 'crisis of confidence.' He argued Americans had lost faith in the ability to govern themselves and the future of the nation. It was a sober assessment by Carter, but it was one that voters did not greet kindly. Instead, it dropped public confidence in the embattled president even further. Olympic boycott A protester against the Moscow summer Olympics boycott during the Opening Ceremony for the XIII Olympic Winter Games on February 14, 1980, at the Lake Placid Equestrian Stadium, Lake Placid, United States. (Photo by Steve Powell/Allsport/Getty Images) Against the backdrop of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Carter ordered a boycott by U.S. athletes of the 1980 Summer Olympics that were set to be held in the Soviet Union. Carter convinced other countries, including Canada, West Germany and Japan, to boycott the event. Ultimately, 66 countries in total boycotted the games in an effort to isolate Moscow, which kept troops in Afghanistan. The 1980 boycott led the Soviet Union to boycott the 1984 Olympics hosted by the United States in Los Angeles, an effort joined by other Soviet states. In both Games, the boycotts had a huge impact on the competition, given the countries involved. Some athletes who had trained for years to compete at the Games were angry with Carter's decision. When the idea was floated for athletes from boycotting nations to compete in the Games under a neutral banner, Carter threatened to revoke the passports of U.S. athletes. Still, many Americans saw the decision as another way to fight against the Soviet regime. The U.S. has not launched a similar boycott of the Olympics since 1980. Creation of the Department of Education Jimmy Carter, then Democratic U.S. presidential candidate, campaigns during the Democratic National Convention in New York City. (AFP/AFP via Getty Images) Carter oversaw the creation of the Department of Education, a sizable expansion of the federal government that was opposed strongly by many Republicans at the time. GOP candidates more than 40 years after the decision still talk about ending the federal department. The newly established department was an offshoot of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. It was created, in part, to meet Carter's commitment to make the federal government more efficient. Before signing off on the creation of the agency in 1979, Carter argued that the federal government had beleaguered education in the U.S. because of 'bureaucratic buck passing.' Even though he thought the federal government played a 'junior role' to states and localities on education, he argued that a new federal bureaucracy was needed to streamline federal responsibilities. But Carter's move to create the department also came after he picked up the influential 1976 endorsement of the National Education Association, the largest labor union in the U.S. He committed himself to creating the department to secure the endorsement. The department faces enduring Republican dissent, with many over the years calling for it to be abolished. By 2022, the department's annual budget was more than $80 billion. Iranian hostage crisis US President Jimmy Carter signs the order blocking Iranian funds in US banks, on November 14, 1979, in Washington, D.C., as White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler (L), Secretary of the Treasury G. William Miller (2nd R) and Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti look on. (Photo by CONSOLIDATED NEWS PICTURES/AFP via Getty Images) The Carter presidency was badly shaken by the Iranian hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The 1980 presidential campaign took place against the backdrop of the hostage crisis, which began in November 1979 after the U.S. admitted the Iranian shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the country to receive medical treatment following the Islamic Revolution that toppled him. Daily newscasts on the hostage crisis added to Carter's already deep political problems, contributing to a sense of a nation defeated and in decline. Carter at one point ordered a rescue mission to try to release the U.S. hostages. It ended in failure, with eight U.S. service members dying when a helicopter crashed into a transport craft. Carter worked tirelessly to secure the release of the hostages, but they were not freed until minutes after former President Reagan was sworn in on Jan. 20, 1981. While polls weeks ahead of the 1980 presidential election showed a close race, Reagan won in a landslide. Carter won just six states plus the District of Columbia, taking 49 electoral votes to 489 won for the Reagan ticket. Reagan won the popular vote by more than 8 million votes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/five-defining-moments-of-jimmy-carters-presidency/	2024-12-29T13:43:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-138433866-e1701378494470.jpg?w=900
How Jimmy Carter's marriage to Rosalynn Carter helped shape his l...	Former President Jimmy Carter’s marriage to first lady Rosalynn Carter played a defining role in his life, spanning 77 years and making it the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history. Jimmy Carter died on Sunday, according to the Carter Center. Throughout his four-year presidency, the pair presented themselves as a team, with Rosalynn serving as one of his closest advisers and even being a presence in Cabinet meetings. And while the couple’s time in the White House was brief, they became a fixture in U.S. politics by championing various causes at home and abroad. 'Usually they say that first ladies are sometimes behind where society is in terms of what women can do, but I would say for Rosalynn Carter, she was out in front,' said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. 'She and her husband had worked as a team from the beginning and certainly as they went through life,' she added. Jimmy Carter dies at 100 Rosalynn Carter died Nov. 19, 2023, just days after she entered into hospice care. The former president made a rare public appearance at a tribute service for her on Nov. 28, 2023. Jimmy Carter started dating then-Rosalynn Smith while he was home from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., according to the White House Historical Association. Smith had just wrapped up her freshman year at Georgia Southwestern College. The couple married in 1946 before following Carter’s naval career, which took them to Virginia, Hawaii and Connecticut. However, this period of their life ended when Carter’s father died and the couple returned home to run his family’s peanut farm outside of Plains, Ga. The future first lady helped her husband with the business by working as a bookkeeper for the farm. 'We developed a partnership when we were working in the farm supply business, and it continued when Jimmy got involved in politics,' the former first lady said during a joint interview with her husband with The Associated Press ahead of the couple’s 75th wedding anniversary in 2021. 'I knew more on paper about the business than he did. He would take my advice about things,' she added, drawing a laugh and affirmation from her husband. Rosalynn Carter continued to support her husband by playing an integral role in his campaigns for state Senate, governor and later president. During the Carter administration, Rosalynn Carter notably represented her husband during trips abroad including Brazil, Poland, Costa Rica, Rome and Thailand. 'There are pictures of her meeting with the secretary of State and the head of the National Security Council, so Cyrus Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski,' Perry said. 'Major, big figures in the president’s Cabinet that she was meeting with separately from the larger Cabinet meetings.' Politicians mourn Jimmy Carter’s death She played a major role domestically, too, becoming the first spouse of the president since Eleanor Roosevelt to testify on Capitol Hill. Carter, who served as an active honorary chairwoman on the President’s Commission on Mental Health, was testifying about mental health, one of her chief issue areas as first lady. 'She, despite her activism, was not attempting to show herself to be a full partner with her husband even if she had wanted to be,' Perry said, referring to Roosevelt. 'But Rosalynn Carter, I think, was the first to do that in the modern era.' President Carter, whose administration was grappling with soaring inflation and energy costs, lost reelection in 1980 to then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan (R). But historians argue that the couple’s four years in the White House set them up for success down the road. 'What I say to the Gilbert and Sullivan’s lyric ‘he is the very model of a modern major general,’ in the case of Jimmy Carter, he’s the very model of a modern post president, and she’s the very model of a post or former first lady,' Perry said. After the presidency, the pair went on to establish the Carter Center, a nonprofit humanitarian organization seeking to 'prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health.' The opening line to the center’s mission statement reads: 'The Carter Center is guided by the principles of our Founders, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.' 'I always admire Jimmy Carter because he never downplayed the role of Rosalynn,' Perry said. 'He always up-played the fact that they were a partnership and he believed in her and trusted in her.' Jimmy Carter underscored the mutual respect he and his wife shared for each other during the couple’s interview with the AP in 2021, calling his marriage 'a full partnership.' 'My biggest secret is to marry the right person if you want to have a long-lasting marriage,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/how-jimmy-carters-marriage-to-rosalynn-carter-helped-shape-his-legacy/	2024-12-29T13:43:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/illustration_carterjimmy_carterrosalynn_022023mm-ap_marriage_v4.jpg?w=900

Photos: Jimmy Carter, from the White House to building houses	(NEXSTAR) - Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, died Sunday after he began receiving home hospice care in February 2023. He was 100 years old. Carter, the longest-living American president, had undergone a series of short hospital stays in the months leading up to hospice care, The Carter Center previously confirmed. He had 'decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.' Ultimately, he 'died peacefully Sunday, Dec. 29, at his home in Plains, Georgia, surrounded by his family,' the Carter Center said. Carter is preceded in death by his wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who died in November 2023. They had celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary just a few months earlier after Rosalynn was diagnosed with dementia.

(Adam Schultz, The White House via AP) Carter, previously governor of Georgia, beat then-President Gerald R. Ford for the presidency in 1976. He served a single term before being defeated by Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980. But Carter didn't ride off into the sunset after his landslide loss. Instead, he went on to spend decades on global advocacy for democracy, public health, and human rights via The Carter Center. The center was opened in 1982 by Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, now 95. Carter received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work through the center. Carter, who has lived most of his life in Plains, Georgia, traveled extensively into his 80s and early 90s, including annual trips to build homes with Habitat for Humanity and frequent trips abroad as part of The Carter Center's election monitoring and its effort to eradicate the Guinea worm parasite in developing countries. But the former president's health declined over his 10th decade of life, especially as the coronavirus pandemic limited his public appearances, including at his beloved Maranatha Baptist Church where he taught Sunday School lessons for decades before standing-room-only crowds of visitors. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter: A picture of the American dream In August 2015, Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver. The following year, Carter announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer. Carter was born Oct. 1, 1924, to a prominent family in rural south Georgia. He went on to the U.S. Naval Academy during World War II and pursued a career as a Cold War Naval officer before returning to Georgia with Rosalynn and their young family to take over the family peanut business after Earl Carter's death in the 1950s. A moderate Democrat, the younger Carter rapidly climbed from the local school board to the state Senate and then the Georgia governor's office. He began his White House bid as an underdog with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and policy plans reflecting his education as an engineer. He connected with many Americans because of his promise not to deceive the American people after Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia. 'If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,' Carter said often as he campaigned. Former first lady Rosalynn Carter dies at 96 Carter said after leaving office that he had underestimated the importance of dealing with Washington power brokers, including the media and lobbying forces anchored in the nation's capital. But he insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to 'protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully' and 'enhance human rights here and abroad' — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term. And years later, upon his cancer diagnosis as a nonagenarian, he expressed satisfaction with his long life. 'I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,' he said in 2015. 'I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.'

Jimmy Carter dies at 100	(NewsNation) — The longest-lived U.S. president in history, Jimmy Carter, has died at the age of 100. Carter, who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981, died Sunday in Plains, Georgia. At 100, Carter was the third-oldest living person to have served as a state leader. He had been receiving hospice care since February 2023. The Carter Center confirmed his death via X. Presidential historian and friend of Carter's, Dr. Larry Cook remembered Carter as a gracious and caring man guided by his faith and values. 'He's let it be known that his faith has guided him since he was a child and up through his adult life and through the presidency and beyond,' Cook said. 'It's who he is, his faith is who he is.' Carter was preceded in death by his wife, Rosalynn Carter, who died Nov. 19, 2023. The former president and first lady had the longest marriage of any first couple in U.S. history and celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary in July. 'They’ve experienced everything that you can together. I think the beautiful thing is that they are still together,' the Carters’ grandson, Josh Carter, recently told People magazine. 'They are still holding hands … it’s just amazing.' Born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, James Earl Carter Jr. was the first person on his father’s side of his family to graduate from high school. He was the only United States Naval Academy graduate to be elected to the White House. Presidential historian Robert Dallek said Carter will be remembered for his post-presidential work than his time in office. 'He'll never be seen as a great president. But he will be seen as a great humanitarian,' Dallek said. A month after Carter graduated, he married Eleanor Rosalynn Carter in 1946. 'She’s the girl I want to marry,' Jimmy Carter told his mother after his first date with Smith, who had grown up as a friend and neighbor of the Carter family in Plains, Georgia. In July 1953, Carter gave up his military career to save his family’s peanut farm and later became involved in local politics when he served on an education board. Carter served as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and as a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967. After Carter’s presidency, in 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has played an active role in human rights and disease prevention issues globally. The Carters helped publicize Habitat for Humanity as well.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-dies-100/	2024-12-29T13:13:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-29-151242.png?w=900
4 killed as storm system that spawned tornadoes moved across sout...	Officials were beginning to assess the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system moved across the southern U.S. over the weekend, spawning tornadoes across the region and killing at least four people. The line of severe weather led to about 40 tornado reports from southeastern Texas to Alabama, National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Pereira said, but those reports remain unconfirmed until damage surveys are completed. 'It’s not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year,' he said. In the Houston area, National Weather Service crews planned to conduct surveys Sunday for at least five tornados that hit north and south of the city on Saturday. At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman killed was found about 100 feet (30 meters) from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office. She said the exact cause of death wasn't immediately known. Four other people in Brazoria County suffered injuries that weren't considered critical, said Polston, who added that at least 40 homes and buildings were significantly damaged in the county. In North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on top of the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said 'it was just a freak accident' and that he believes Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 'It’s very sad, just terrible timing is pretty much all it was,' Maffucci said. The storms also were responsible for a number of downed trees in the area and 'quite a few wrecks,' Maffucci added. Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, including a teen, officials said. The 18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County as the storm brought high winds to the area, said Adams County Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two other people in the home were injured. Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were injured across the state, officials said. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama town of Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said meteorologist Chelly Amin. Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city of Athens, said she lives about two blocks from downtown, where most of the damage from the early Sunday morning storms occurred. Hollman said the storm hurled large HVAC units from the tops of building, ripped the roof off a bookstore and damaged a brick building adjacent to a veteran’s museum. A full-sized, stripped down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 'I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,' she said. 'I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some injuries and possibly some fatalities.' At 9 a.m. Sunday, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Also without power were some 54,000 customers in Georgia; 36,000 in Alabama; 20,000 in Louisiana; and 13,000 in Texas. Two roads were closed in western North Carolina — a region broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall — as of late Sunday morning because of severe weather, North Carolina Department of Transportation spokesperson Jamie Kritzer said. Part of U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, was closed in both directions in Swain County north of Bryson City, due to high winds. It was expected to reopen on Monday. Another road in Macon County near Franklin — State Road 1672, also known as River Road — was closed Sunday morning due to high water and was slated to reopen Sunday afternoon. The storms moved quickly through Georgia, where there were reports of trees toppled in the Atlanta area. During a week of bustling holiday travel, a few of the busiest U.S. airports were directly in the path of the severe weather. On Sunday morning, there were over 200 flight delays to or from the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and almost 20 flights were cancelled. At Charlotte Douglas International Airport there were nearly 500 delays and 28 cancellations. ___ Associated Press reporters Corey Williams and Julie Walker also contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-tornadoes-in-texas-and-mississippi-kill-2-as-storm-system-moves-across-southern-u-s/	2024-12-29T12:49:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771b6dd8ac368.19551325.jpeg?w=900
US children are struggling with reading — and so are adults	(The Hill) — Learning to read can become exponentially more difficult for older students and adults who have fallen behind, creating grave concerns as the number of individuals struggling with literacy into high school and adulthood is increasing. Data released in recent months shows K-12 schools are seeing more older students who cannot read at their grade level, coupled with an international study showing an increase in U.S. adults who cannot read past simple sentences. 'We are really taking a family literacy approach to understand this issue and to recognize that this is a multi-generational challenge. If the parents and caregivers struggle with literacy, the children are more likely to also struggle with literacy,' said Sarah Cacicio, the director of Adult Literacy and Learning Impact Network, which was convened by the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. 'Socioeconomic status and parents' literacy levels are bigger [...] indicators for how well a child is going to do, even more so than quality instruction. Although quality instruction is super important,' Cacicio added. 'That's why it's so important to address this issue of literacy at multiple generations.' The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), part of the Department of Education, released data earlier this month showing 28 percent of adults in the U.S. ranked at the lowest levels of literacy, compared to 19 percent in 2017. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library seeks New York state expansion NCES Commissioner Peggy Carr said in a news conference the increase was 'substantial.' Studies have shown that low literacy rates exacerbate everything from poverty and health care to low civic engagement. And while there are programs to help adult learners, concerns about time and money can prove problematic. 'We connected with individuals who could enroll in adult education services but have not, and what we found is that 80 percent of the adults surveyed didn't know about available programs in their area, but 84 percent said they would like to continue learning and enroll in a program. So, what that tells us is it's less about time and more about awareness. We really think that lack of awareness about free programs and access to resources and services is the No. 1 barrier, as well as perceived costs,' Cacicio said. Federally funded adult education programs 'are only serving, really, fewer than 10 percent of all of those who need literacy services,' she added. Adult literacy problems are tricky to resolve and lack a one-size-fits-all solution. When adults join reading programs, they can be at literacy levels ranging from third graders to high school seniors. 'I think one of the interesting things about adult learning is that you can't really design a standard curriculum,' Cacicio said. 'Some people are more looking for work-based learning, or if they're an English learner, they're trying to learn specific language and vocabulary that connects to their workplace,' she added. And the problem isn't limited to adults. Earlier this year, a study was released by the Educational Testing Service and the Advanced Education Research and Development Fund showing more than 20 percent of students in fifth through seventh grades stumble over words they can’t recognize or sound out. Experts aim to have children reading proficiently at their own level by third grade. Biden canceling student loan debt for 55K public service workers Over the summer, education firm NWEA published data showing eighth graders are a full year behind in reading and math. 'So, fourth grade is when you start to see significant gaps in in reading, and many times, these comprehension gaps are actually due to more foundational skills, so something that students didn't get either in phonics instruction or they're lacking vocabulary or background knowledge to be able to comprehend the text, or they're just haven't been taught comprehension strategies,' said Erin Bailey, vice president of literacy and content at Reading Is Fundamental. Students struggling with reading has become a top concern, with multiple states switching to the science of reading for young students in an attempt to help them meet standards before leaving third grade. Part of the difficulty once a student falls behind is teachers in higher grades haven't been trained to help students with the building blocks of reading. 'For most students, in most places around grade six, definitely by grade eight, students no longer have a reading teacher unless they're in an intervention or there’s some data that indicates they need some additional services, but your majority of kids, they're not in a reading class anymore,' said Miah Daughtery, NWEA vice president for content advocacy. 'Your average English teacher is no more prepared to teach reading than your average physics teacher. Your English teacher does not go to school to learn how to teach reading; they go to school to learn how to teach the humanities in English,' Daughtery said. This leads to a common reading problem between older students and adults, which is lacking context or background knowledge to understand the text in front of them. 'We have adolescents, young adults and adults who are still growing in their reading journey, either from being nonreaders to rudimentary readers to readers, even readers like me, who are good readers but really still need help with technical text and science text. The brain is such a phenomenal organ you can really learn how to read, for most people, throughout the course of your life,' Daughtery said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/us-literacy-adults-children-reading-writing/	2024-12-29T12:44:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/school-choice_lonas_AssociatedPress-1-e1734983418988.jpg?w=800
Tornadoes in Texas and Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe ...	HOUSTON (AP) — At least two people were killed and six more injured as several tornadoes touched down in Texas and Mississippi on Saturday, damaging homes and flipping vehicles as the storm system moved east across Alabama early Sunday. The National Weather Service's severe storm tracker indicated the system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4 a.m. The agency issued severe thunderstorm warnings with the possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia and the northwestern tip of Florida directly above the Gulf of Mexico. One person died in the Liverpool area, located south of Houston, and four people suffered injuries that were not considered critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office. There were 'multiple touchdown points' in the county between Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10 damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage, Polston said. In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. 'These storms are probably going to get a lot worse this evening and overnight the further east you go,' said Josh Lichter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area, though they may discover there were more when crews go out to survey the damage, and there was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line winds, Litcher said. North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the weather service said. The storms also caused departure delays of over an hour Saturday afternoon at Houston's two main airports, Bush Intercontinental and Hobby, according to the website FlightAware. About 71,000 utility customers were without power in Mississippi Saturday and the number was expected to rise, said Malary White, chief communications officer for the state's Emergency Management Agency. Around 3:30 a.m. Sunday, nearly 81,000 customers were without power in the state, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. The emergency management agency did not have official damage reports Saturday. First responders were focused on ensuring safety and making sure everyone was accounted for, White said. 'We do anticipate more thorough damage assessments starting in the early morning hours,' she said. The National Weather Service office in Birmingham, Alabama, issued overnight severe thunderstorm warnings for several areas in the southern part of the state, advising residents to seek shelter to avoid possible damaging winds up to 60 mph (96.5 kph).	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/ap-tornadoes-touch-down-around-houston-killing-1/	2024-12-29T06:12:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6771591a41a6d3.84666764.jpeg?w=900
Azerbaijan's president says crashed jetliner was shot down by Rus...	Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and criticized Moscow for trying to 'hush up' the issue for days. 'We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. (...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,' he told Azerbaijani state television. Aliyev said that the airliner, which crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and 'rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.' Aliyev accused Russia of trying to 'hush up' the issue for several days, saying he was 'upset and surprised' by versions of events put forward by Russian officials. 'Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,' he said. The crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike. Aliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash. 'First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,' he said. Aliyev noted that the first demand was 'already fulfilled' when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a 'tragic incident' though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow’s responsibility. He said that an investigation into the crash was ongoing, and that 'the final version (of events) will be known after the black boxes are opened.' He noted that Azerbaijan was always 'in favor of a group of international experts' investigating the crash, and had 'categorically refused' Russia’s suggestion that the Interstate Aviation Committee, which oversees civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, investigate it. 'It is no secret that this organization consists mostly of Russian officials and is headed by Russian citizens. The factors of objectivity could not be fully ensured here,' Aliyev said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation. The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan was underway at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. The crash is the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. Russia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base. ___ Associated Press writer Aida Sultanova in London contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-azerbaijans-president-says-crashed-jetliner-was-shot-down-by-russia-albeit-not-intentionally/	2024-12-29T06:01:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/677156d2db4507.14999544.jpeg?w=900
Plane burst into flames after skidding off runway at an airport i...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A plane burst into flames after veering off a runway at an airport in South Korea on Sunday, killing at least 28 people on board, emergency officials said. The fire engulfed the aircraft carrying 181 people when it skidded off the runway just after landing and struck a barrier. The country's emergency office said its landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned. Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. The transport ministry said the incident happened at 9:03 a.m. local time. The National Fire Agency said the fire was almost put out but officials were still trying to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane at the airport in the southern town of Muan. At least 28 people had died in the fire, the agency said. Emergency workers pulled out two people — one passenger and one crew member. It said it deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire. Emergency officials said they were examining the cause of the fire. Local TV stations aired footage showing thick pillows of black smoke billowing from the plane engulfed with flame. The incident came as South Korea is embroiled into a huge political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment. Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, making Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over. Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-south-korean-media-report-28-people-dead-after-a-plane-catches-fire-at-an-airport/	2024-12-28T18:26:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6770b3eaae0256.64581136.jpeg?w=900
UnitedHealthcare taught us ways to deny claims: Former employee	(NewsNation) — A former UnitedHealthcare claims representative says employees were systematically trained to deny medical claims and rush distressed customers off phone lines, revealing internal practices at the nation's largest health insurer amid growing scrutiny of the industry. Natalie Collins, who worked for UnitedHealthcare for nine months, said Saturday on 'NewsNation Prime' that staff received 'so many different ways to deny' claims during their two to three months of training, with supervisors often standing behind representatives instructing them on denial methods. 'We weren't given proper instruction to actually pay the claim, and there wasn't enough monies in certain files in certain companies to pay medical claims,' Collins said. 'We would have to just get the client off the phone as fast as we could.' Health insurance ‘delay tactic’ is too common: Former Cigna executive Collins described crying at her desk while handling calls from desperate patients, as supervisors laughed. Collins, now the owner of 'Mother's Keeper Doula,' quit her position after attempting to approve payment for a widowed mother of five whose husband died of pancreatic cancer, saying supervisors had instructed her to deny the hospice claim and get the caller 'off our phone line.' 'They just wouldn't allow me to submit the claim. There would be alerts on each claim telling us that either we had to put it back in our queue and it would just go to someone else, 30 days later, 60 days later,' Collins said. Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to state murder Collins' experience comes after accused UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to murder and terror charges in New York State Court. Public support for Mangione has grown, with his legal defense fund reaching $250,000 in donations. Doctor calls out claim denials amid UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting 'It's all about your employer and who they are negotiating with to get their employees the best health coverage,' Collins said when asked what she wanted the public to know. A recent poll found that about seven in 10 adults believe insurance company denials and profits bear at least moderate responsibility for CEO Brian Thompson's death. Collins said that while she understands public anger, she condemns violence. 'We the people are sick and tired,' Collins said. 'I don't believe anyone should die ... but people are angry. People have reasons to be very angry, and I feel that to my bones. I've seen it, I lived it, I processed them and I denied them.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/unitedhealthcare-ways-deny-claims-former-employee/	2024-12-28T18:07:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/B6E2BB6B39BF576D8A806AAA0CC58447.jpg?w=900
Trump weighs in on H-1B debate, backs immigration visas	President-elect Trump backed immigration visas for highly-skilled workers as the program has been in the spotlight after Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy faced backlash within the Republican leader's base for signaling their support for the H-1B work visa, which has been criticized as too complicated and susceptible to abuse. 'I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,' Trump said in a phone interview with The New York Post published Saturday. 'I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,' he added, as reported by the NY Post. Trump's support for the program comes as two of his key allies set to run the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk and Ramaswamy, have faced heightened scrutiny on Musk's social platform X from some in the GOP, including far-right activist Laura Loomer and other hard-line anti-immigration Republicans. More battles over transgender rights await Supreme Court The dispute further escalated late Friday night after Musk pledged to 'go to war' over the issue in a post on X. 'The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,' he wrote in the post. 'I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,' he added. The debate appeared to originate from a suggestion last month from Sriram Krishnan, Trump’s pick for White House policy adviser on artificial intelligence, that Musk examine removing caps on green cards for skilled immigrants. Krishnan’s comments resurfaced in recent days after he was appointed by Trump to serve in his incoming administration. The dispute also comes as the Biden administration announced a rule earlier this month clarifying who can apply for the visas, which followed years of lobbying for a more streamlined H-1B process. Some democratic lawmakers previously called on the Biden administration to address gaps in the immigration system to prepare for the incoming Trump administration’s expected crackdown on immigration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-weighs-in-on-h-1b-debate-backs-immigration-visas/	2024-12-28T14:35:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24308063014128-e1734698903451.jpg?w=900
Trump applauds blocked sale of Texas border wall materials	President-elect Trump celebrated the blocked sale of border wall materials following a Friday ruling from a federal judge in Texas. The incoming president, in a Saturday Truth Social post, called the ruling a 'major, crucial WIN for America,' calling out President Biden and 'his cronies' for seeking to stall the construction of the border wall, which was a central piece of Trump's first administration. 'The Judge has also ordered an investigation into the illegal selling of the materials, which will expose just how corrupt and anti-American Radical Democrats are,' he added. The effort, led in part by the state’s Attorney General Ken Paxton, began amid reports the Biden administration was selling the parts. Last week, Trump asked a Texas court to intervene. Trump weighs in on H-1B debate, backs immigration visas But Congress required the Biden administration to dispose of the materials. The measure, included in the National Defense Authorization Act, allows the sale of items if they are used to repair existing barriers and not install new ones. Friday's ruling prohibits the sale of any materials intended for border wall, which Trump says he is 'going to rebuild in order to protect our Country from violent migrant crime, fentanyl smuggling, sex trafficking, terror attacks, and other heinous, Nation ending disasters,' over the next 30 days. Trump first suggested a structure be erected along the United States to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country during his first campaign for the presidency. Although Trump campaigned on the notion that Mexico would fund the wall, the neighboring country never cut a formal check for the partition. At the end of Trump's first term, 694 miles of primary barriers were put in place, according to U.S. Customs and Border patrol. More battles over transgender rights await Supreme Court Texas, per the ruling, is also entitled to documentation that proves that the Biden administration has not disposed of border wall materials, which would violate an injunction from Paxton earlier this year that required the Biden Administration to spend statutorily obligated funds on building the wall. 'This follows our major victory forcing Biden to build the wall, and we will hold his Administration accountable for illegally subverting our Nation’s border security until their very last day in power, especially where their actions are clearly motivated by a desire to thwart President-elect Trump’s immigration agenda,' Paxton wrote in the release. Republicans made border security a prominent theme in the 2024 election cycle which helped propel the party to victory, gaining a trifecta in Washington. Trump has promised to carry out the largest deportation in the country’s history and hammer down ambitious immigration policies when he returns to office, with the help of 'border czar' Tom Homan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-applauds-blocked-sale-of-texas-border-wall-materials/	2024-12-28T14:32:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/TrumpDonald_MaraLago2_121624_APPhotoEvan-Vucci_e09620.jpg?w=900

Trump asks Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban so he can 'negotiate...	President-elect Trump asked the Supreme Court to delay the deadline for a potential TikTok ban, which is slated for the day before his inauguration. The court has agreed to hear TikTok’s challenge to the potential ban on an expedited schedule, but Trump told the justices that delaying the law until he returns to the White House could obviate the need for the court to weigh in. 'President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns,' wrote D. John Sauer, one of Trump’s personal appellate attorneys. Sauer is Trump’s nominee for U.S. solicitor general, which would have him take over managing the government’s defense of the ban from the Biden administration. 'In light of these interests—including, most importantly, his overarching responsibility for the United States’ national security and foreign policy—President Trump opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture, and seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office,' Sauer wrote. During the campaign, Trump voiced opposition to the law, which requires TikTok’s China-based parent company to divest from the app or face a ban by Jan. 19, and vowed to 'save TikTok.' However, the president-elect has offered few details about his plans to protect the app since winning the election. TikTok has noted the president-elect's sympathies in its legal arguments, suggesting the trajectory could change once he takes office. The new brief repeatedly touts Trump’s unique interest, calling him 'one of the most powerful, prolific, and influential users of social media in history' and noting his social media platform, Truth Social. 'Indeed, President Trump’s first Term was highlighted by a series of policy triumphs achieved through historic deals, and he has a great prospect of success in this latest national security and foreign policy endeavor,' Sauer wrote. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Jan. 10 on TikTok’s First Amendment challenge to the new law, giving the justices an opportunity to weigh in before the ban potentially goes into effect. Trump said he takes no position on the merits of the First Amendment issue but called it a 'historically challenging' question.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-delay-tiktok-ban-so-he-can-negotiate-a-resolution-to-save-the-platform/	2024-12-27T15:58:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Top-Trump_122224_AP_Rick-Scuteri.jpg?w=900
Border czar vows to 'target' Tren de Aragua gang	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump’s new border czar, Tom Homan, tells NewsNation’s Ali Bradley criminal gangs like Tren de Aragua will be his 'priority target,' and he will root them out once he takes office. 'We've been saying from Day 1 that the priority right out of the gate is public safety threats and national security threats. Tren de Aragua is a public safety threat,' Homan said. 'They have proven that they're in at least 16 states across this country, and they'll be a priority.' Tren de Aragua is a gang that started in a prison in the Venezuelan state of Aragua nearly a decade ago. It’s since expanded into what the Justice Department calls a 'transnational criminal organization.' The gang has spread to 16 U.S. states, according to a New York Post report citing an internal Department of Homeland Security memo. The Venezuelan gang is the fastest-growing transnational criminal organization, in part because the U.S. government cannot track criminal records in Venezuela. As such, members of the gang are more easily able to blend in with law-abiding migrants. What is the Tren de Aragua gang, linked to several crimes in US? In Colorado, Aurora police have acknowledged that 'components of Tren de Aragua' are operating in the area and have identified at least 10 known members. Homan vowed to 'remove them' and says he’s been working with state and law enforcement to monitor the gang’s activity. 'We'll be attacking Tren de Aragua right where they operate, where they live, and we're going to put them in detention,' he said. For the gang members who are applying for asylum, Homan said he will be putting on strict conditions of release. 'Participating in gang activity is a violation of conditions of release, so at a minimum, we want to take them back into custody,' he said. Tren de Aragua gang member arrested in El Paso Homan blamed President Joe Biden’s border policies as the reason why the U.S. hasn't been able to force Venezuela to take the gang members back, but that will all change under Trump, he said. 'Starting January 20, we'll have a very strong America-first president who's going to negotiate, if he needs to negotiate, or simply make these countries do what they should do,' Homan said. 'In the small chance they won't take them back, then we'll send them to other countries,' he said, adding that he is already in talks with several countries willing to take the gang members.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-czar-vows-to-target-tren-de-aragua-gang/	2024-12-27T15:45:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Gateway-hotel.png?w=900
Requiring federal workers to return to office will be hard: Comer	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump has warned federal employees who have been working on a remote basis that if they want to keep their jobs, they will need to return to their given office spaces. However, forcing government employees back into the office may not be as easy as threatening them with termination, a Republican lawmaker tells NewsNation. U.S. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said he anticipates that as the newly formed Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) prepares to tackle government waste, a downsizing of the federal workforce may be required. Trump’s campaign promise to force federal workers back to the office comes at a time when 17 of the 24 federal office buildings in Washington are at 25% capacity or less, according to a report released by the Government Accountability Office in the fall of 2023. Trump ‘border czar’ says he will override sanctuary city roadblocks The study found that the government spends an estimated $2 billion per year maintaining the office space and an additional $5 billion per year to lease it. However, as Trump pushes to force workers back into the office, Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told NewsNation that many government employee contracts include clauses that allow for remote work on a hybrid or full-time basis. Trump said earlier this month that he plans to do away with a waiver that he said President Joe Biden provided federal employees to work from home. He said that if needed, his administration would fight the waiver in court to force workers back to the office. 'If people don't want to come back to work, come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed,' Trump said. Comer told NewsNation that enforcing such a threat won't come without a legal challenge from the unions representing federal employees. More Americans say they need a break from political news: Survey 'This will probably head to court. But in the court of public opinion, I think the people that work hard every day and have to go to work and pay taxes, I don't think they're very happy with the fact that such a high percentage of the federal workforce is working from home,' Comer told NewsNation. 'And they're not held accountable like the employees who work for the federal government, who have to go to the office every day.' Although the government is spending billions each year on physical office space, experts maintain that the solution DOGE is seeking doesn't come by filling government-leased buildings with federal employees. Comey told NewsNation that in addition to closing down excessive federal offices, more attention needs to be paid to the workforce itself. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been tasked with heading up DOGE, have suggested that they would like to eliminate 25% of the federal workforce. However, Comer, who believes employees are more responsive and efficient in the office than they are from home, says that rather than eliminating jobs, the priority should be determining what government employees actually do. The New York Times reported that of the 2.3 million civilian workers working for the government in May, 1.1 million were eligible for telework, and about 228,000 were eligible for entirely remote work. 'Some of them haven't been seen since prior to COVID,' Comer said. 'We've got to bring them back, and I would like for every employee to have to explain to some competent person exactly what their job entails and what their day looks like working from home.' As DOGE prepares to get to work, Comer said that federal officials need to find a balance when it comes to what the work environment for many of these government employees looks like. 'The bottom line is, we have too many federal employees, the taxpayers cannot continue to pay them good federal benefits: the long-term pensions, the long-term health insurance, in addition to the just the everyday payroll,' Comer told NewsNation. 'The taxpayers cannot put this burden anymore, and we're going to have to get more efficient.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-rto-fight-comer/	2024-12-27T12:20:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Congress-Comer_061124_AP_J.-Scott-Applewhite.jpg?w=900
Man charged in fatal burning of woman on NYC subway to be in cour...	(NewsNation) — The man charged in the killing of a woman who was burned alive as she slept on a New York City subway train is due in court Friday. As Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is set to appear before a grand jury, there are still more questions than answers about the victim in this case. The New York Police Department is still trying to figure out the woman's identity. Authorities say Zapeta-Calil approached the woman on the subway and lit her clothing on fire. Zapeta-Calil then fanned the flames using a shirt, prosecutors said. Tiny homes at risk of being stolen: Report The 33-year-old from Guatemala was arraigned on murder and arson charges Tuesday. In court, he stood before the judge in a white jumpsuit and black hoodie. Zapeta-Calil did not speak and was surrounded by a dozen NYPD officers the entire time. The crime was caught on camera. Body-worn cameras on responding officers caught the suspect's face and his image was blasted on social media. Three teenagers in a different part of the city recognized him and called the police. Video footage shows an NYPD patrolman passing the scene casually. At one point, someone appears with a blanket to fan the flames, while another person is filming. At the time of the incident, Zapeta-Calil was living at a homeless shelter that provides outpatient services for substance abuse and mental health. A source close to the investigation tells NewsNation that Zapeta-Calil's attorney wanted his client to have a psychiatric evaluation, possibly setting the stage for an insanity defense. Federal immigration officials said Zapeta-Calil entered the U.S. illegally. He has been jailed at New York City's Rikers Island complex. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/man-charged-fatal-burning-woman-nyc-subway-in-court/	2024-12-27T05:41:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24359026391033.jpg?w=900
Trump 'border czar' says he will override sanctuary city roadbloc...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's incoming 'border czar' told NewsNation the administration will aggressively enforce immigration laws in sanctuary cities and may seek prosecution of officials who 'knowingly harbor' undocumented immigrants. 'Sanctuary jurisdictions aren't going to stop what we're going to do,' Tom Homan said in a NewsNation interview Thursday. 'If they don't want to protect their communities, then the Trump administration will.' Homan said immigration officers would focus on 'public safety threats' and emphasized that sanctuary jurisdictions could face legal consequences if they actively interfere with federal enforcement efforts. No ‘price tag’ for mass deportations, says incoming border czar 'They can stand by and watch us do it, but they cannot impede us,' Homan said. 'They cannot knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal from ICE. Those are crimes.' He warned that forcing immigration agents to make arrests in communities rather than jails would likely result in more 'collateral arrests' of undocumented immigrants who are not primary targets. Regarding sensitive locations such as churches and hospitals traditionally considered off-limits to immigration enforcement, Homan indicated the policy is under review. He said there are already exceptions for 'significant public safety threats' or national security issues. Homan dismissed sanctuary city officials' claims that their policies help protect crime victims and witnesses, calling it 'a stone-cold lie.' 'The victims and witnesses of crime certainly don't want the bad guy released back into their neighborhood,' he said. Republican strategist Katie Frost said that given the crisis along the U.S. southern border, 'all options need to be on the table' when it comes to enforcement. 'We have to do whatever is necessary to find people who broke our laws, came into this country illegally and have overstayed their visas, ' Frost told NewsNation. Russia suspected in Azerbaijan Airlines crash; black boxes recovered Frost pointed to the case of the woman who was set on fire on a New York City subway by a man that police said entered the U.S. illegally. She said that the question that has to be answered is, 'When is enough be enough?' Frost said that one of the reasons Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in November was because Americans are sick of how the Biden administration has handled securing the southern border. However, Democratic strategist David Carlucci, says that the details of how the incoming Trump administration handles mass deportations become a critical part of the issue. Carlucci told NewsNation that based on what he has heard from Homan, the 'border czar' does not have a concrete plan for carrying out mass deportations. Instead, Carlucci believes Homan just going to try to catch illegal immigrants. He said Homan needs to specify how he plans to carry out zeroing in on convicted criminals who entered the country illegally as he proposed when he first announced mass deportations. Homan said that if illegal immigrants who do not have criminal convictions are found with those who do, they run the risk of being arrested. Carlucci said that could have dangerous ramifications. 'Is this going to be some sort of government state where we'll all be questioned and audited for harboring illegal immigrants?' Carlucci said. 'At what ends do we go to? The incoming Trump administration should be working with local officials instead of trying to make some sort of scapegoat.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/tom-homan-override-sanctuary-city-roadblocks/	2024-12-27T05:10:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/videoframe_2526.png?w=800
Average mortgage rates close 2024 at the highest since July	(NewsNation) — Average mortgage rates will end the year on a high note — financially. This week, the housing market saw its highest 30-year mortgage rate since July at 6.85%, according to data from Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. That's up from last week and up from 6.61% during the same time last year. 'While a slight improvement in new and existing home sales is encouraging, the market remains plagued by an overwhelming undersupply of homes,' said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a news release. 'A strong economy can help build momentum heading into the new year and potentially boost purchase activity.' Tiny homes at risk of being stolen: Report The 15-year mortgage rates also climbed from 5.92% last week to 6% this week. These mortgage rates come after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week. Now, market players are looking to see how next year plays out with President-elect Donald Trump's policy initiatives and how they will impact inflation, and in turn, mortgage rates.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/average-mortgage-rates-increased-december-2024/	2024-12-27T04:20:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673f4ed67b4342.65100526.jpeg?w=900
Jackpot for Mega Millions over $1 billion after no numbers match ...	Hang onto those stocking-stuffer lottery tickets. The Mega Millions jackpot has surpassed $1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers drawn on Christmas Eve.

'We know that many people will likely receive tickets to Friday’s drawing as holiday gifts, and what a gift that would turn out to be if you ended up with a ticket worth a $1.15 billion jackpot,' Joshua Johnston, lead director for the Mega Millions Consortium said in a Wednesday statement. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350, while the odds of winning any Mega Millions prize are 1 in 24, according to lottery officials. Tickets for the game are sold in 45 states, along with Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions tickets are $2 a piece. Half of the proceeds from the sale of each ticket remains in the state where the ticket was sold. Drawings are held at 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesdays and Fridays. 'I can’t think of a better way to celebrate the holidays – whether Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, the Winter Solstice, or any other way people choose to celebrate the season – than by helping fulfill the dreams that come with a prize like this and prizes that will be won at all levels of the game,' Johnston said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/mega-millions-jackpot-1-billion-no-christmas-eve-wins/	2024-12-27T03:03:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-1297834427-1-3.jpg?w=900
NewsNation kept a wide lens on the border crisis in 2024	(NewsNation) — One of the most important issues to Americans on both sides of the aisle has been the ongoing immigration crisis, and NewsNation has been there every step of the way in 2024, highlighting not only the plight of migrants coming to the U.S. but the challenges this posed to Border Patrol and state officials. Over the last four years, the U.S. has seen the largest immigration surge in history, averaging more than 2 million migrants a year from all around the world in search of the American dream. 2024 began with more controversial moves by GOP Texas Governor Greg Abbott to relieve some of the burden placed on cities in his state by transporting migrants to sanctuary cities like Washington, DC, New York, Chicago and Denver. The standoff between state and federal reach on immigration continued in the courts, where NewsNation covered several lawsuits between the two. The Justice Department sued Texas, claiming the state's new immigration law violated the Constitution. Who is Trump’s new border czar Tom Homan? A federal judge blocked that law, but the state would ultimately be the victor and start arresting on the state level for criminal trespass. This also came as the Biden administration was told by the Supreme Court that it could take down razor wire installed by Texas that was meant to keep migrants out. The situation reached a fever pitch in March when more than 400 migrants tore down razor fencing during a riot on the border town of El Paso. Several Texas National Guard members were injured, and roughly 200 migrants were arrested. Drones, wire walls, buoys and pepper balls were all utilized by border control to fight illegal entry. But it wasn’t always effective. NewsNation was there to capture exclusive video of smugglers destroying barbed wire fencing to get migrants across the border. The fight to control the border was made harder by the cartel. Crime exploded as groups of masked gunmen kidnapped migrants, participated in human trafficking and transported guns and drugs across the border, including deadly fentanyl. NewsNation exclusively uncovered the amazing story of a teen who barely escaped capture by the cartel. The violence played out in U.S. border towns before moving north. NewsNation closely followed a brutal attack on New York police officers by a group of migrants with a notorious Venezuelan gang. ‘High volume’ scanning system going up at Texas border crossing NewsNation got an exclusive look into the dangers border agents face hunting down migrant smugglers. A ride-along showed how Border Patrol agents are tackling the trafficking of illicit drugs in El Centro, California, which has become a drug smuggling hotspot. The network closely reported on the murder of a 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, who was killed while jogging on the university’s campus by Jose Ibarra, who entered the U.S. illegally in September 2022. The team followed the highly emotional trial and eventual conviction of Ibarra, which brought even more attention to the debate over border laws. NewsNation was there as the 'take our border back convoys, also known as 'God's Army,' made their way to the southern border stopping in Virginia, Florida and Louisiana, before arriving at Texas to raise awareness about the crisis on the border.' President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to take a zero-tolerance approach to the border when he comes into office next year, and NewsNation will continue its pledge to cover this ongoing crisis.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/newsnation-border-recap-2024/	2024-12-26T14:26:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/GettyImages-2149335672.jpg?w=900
JonBenét Ramsey’s father to meet with police, urge new DNA tech	(NewsNation) — The Boulder Police Department says it plans to use new DNA technology in hopes of solving the killing of 6-year-old JonBenét Ramsey in 1996. Ramsey’s body was found 28 years ago in her family’s Boulder home. Now, her father is planning to meet once again with local police to discuss new DNA testing technology that may hopefully fill in the forensic gaps and bring closure to the Ramsey family. 'They have the ability to separate DNA — mixed DNA samples, which is one of the issues with the sample they got in 1997. They had an unidentified male DNA sample in early 1997, and it was mixed, apparently with JonBenét’s blood,' JonBenét’s father, John Bennett Ramsey, told NewsNation in November. 'That DNA can now, technology-wise, be separated. They have the ability to do familial genealogy research, which has been wildly successful in solving old cold cases. That's what we're asking the police to do.' Teen actor from ‘Baby Driver’ dies after falling from moving vehicle He says he is expected to meet with the Boulder police chief in January alongside representatives from a leading DNA lab to push for the new approach. Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn says the department remains committed to finding JonBenét Ramsey’s killer and that the department has already taken significant steps to modernize its investigation. In a video statement released in November, Boulder police said they were working with forensic experts to find the latest advancements in DNA technology and recently digitized all of their case evidence. They hope to use those thousands of files to create a searchable database that could reveal new leads. The department has also taken inventory of more than 2,500 pieces of evidence and reviewed 40,000 reports in the last year alone.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/jonbenet-ramseys-father-dna-tech/	2024-12-26T13:42:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/snapshot-2023-09-28T220700.744.jpg?w=814
No ‘price tag’ for mass deportations, says incoming border czar	(NewsNation) — Incoming Trump administration border czar Tom Homan tells NewsNation's Ali Bradley there is no 'price tag' for the mass deportations planned by the incoming administration, citing 'national security' concerns. 'What price do you put on national security? I don't think it has a price tag,' Homan said. 'What price do you put on the thousands of American moms and dads who buried their children? You want to talk about family separation; they buried their children because their children were murdered by illegal aliens that weren't supposed to be here. I don't put a price on that. I don't put a price on national security. I don't put a price on American lives.' Homan further defended the mass deportations’ $86 billion price tag, saying it would save American taxpayers money in the future. Trump criticizes Trudeau, Panama, Biden commutations on Truth Social 'This operation would be expensive,' he acknowledged. 'However, it’s going to save taxpayers a lot of money in the long run. Right now, we’re spending billions of dollars on free airline tickets, free hotel rooms, free medical care, free meals, the education system.' Homan, however, said they will also need help from Congress. 'We need more resources; we need funding. We obviously need to buy more detention beds because everybody we arrest, we have to detain to work on those removal efforts and get travel documents, get flight arrangements. So we need more detention beds,' said Homan. Homan said the Trump administration doesn’t plan on separating families but rather deporting them together. He said the administration is looking into using halfway houses to hold U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record? 'As far as U.S. children, that's going to be a difficult situation because we're not going to change your U.S. citizenship,' he said. 'Which means they’re going to be put in a halfway house or they can stay at home and wait for the officers to get the travel arrangements and come back and get the family. You know the best thing to do for a family is to self-deport themselves.' Homan also targeted birthright citizenship, saying having a child who is a U.S. citizen does not make undocumented immigrants 'immune from our laws.' 'We can't send that message,' he said. 'Because if we do, you're never going to solve the border crisis.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/deportation-price-tag-tom-homan/	2024-12-26T12:15:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot-13.jpg?w=900
US officials: Russia behind Azerbaijan plane crash, early indicat...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — U.S. officials tell NewsNation evidence indicates Russian air defenses downed the Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, killing 38 of the 67 people on board. The passenger jet flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashed while trying to make an emergency near Aktau. The flight had been en route from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia, but was diverted due to fog. The U.S. officials added that if the preliminary information proves to be true, it would further underscore Russian recklessness in its invasion of Ukraine. Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record? The Russian government on Thursday warned against spreading 'hypotheses' about the cause of the crash. 'The investigation is underway,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'And until investigators make their conclusions, it would be incorrect to make any kind of hypothesis. So, we cannot do it and nobody should do it. We must await the end of this investigation.' Azerbaijan observed a nationwide day of mourning on Thursday. National flags were lowered across the country, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals were sounded from ships and trains. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/us-officials-russia-behind-azerbaijan-plane-crash-us-officials-say/	2024-12-26T11:02:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24360347887622.jpg?w=900
Biden grants clemency to BMF co-founder Terry 'Southwest T' Fleno...	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has granted clemency to Terry 'Southwest T' Flenory, co-founder of the organization Black Mafia Family (BMF). Flenory was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 after prosecutors linked him and his brother, Demetrius 'Big Meech' Flenory, to an international drug trafficking operation, according to WXIA-TV. In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, Terry Flenory was released from federal prison and ordered to serve the rest of his sentence on house arrest, WXYZ-TV reported. Which members of Congress have missed the most votes — and why? Terry Flenory celebrated the decision on Instagram, sharing a photo of his clemency affidavit and videos of him removing his house arrest device, writing, 'It’s been a journey, but prayer and unwavering faith beyond mere human comprehension got us to this point.' Demetrius Flenory has not yet been pardoned. However, in October, he was transferred to a residential reentry program in Miami to serve the remainder of his sentence. Known for their leadership in BMF, both Terry and Demetrius Felonry's stories have been widely covered in the media and are dramatized in the Starz series 'BMF.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/biden-grants-clemency-bmf-co-founder-terry-southwest-t-flenory/	2024-12-26T08:16:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2186740159.jpg?w=900
Which members of Congress have the worst attendance record?	(NewsNation) — After U.S. Rep. Kay Granger’s five-month absence from Congress came to light, some Americans are left wondering if their elected officials are doing their jobs or if they are missing critical votes. As the 81-year-old is in a retirement facility dealing with dementia-related issues, other members of Congress have been chronically absent from Capitol Hill, too. NewsNation's Tom Dempsey reviewed data from govtrack.us, a congressional watchdog site, and found Granger isn't even the most absent member of Congress this year. Matt Gaetz ethics report: Rep. Ivey says ‘public deserves to know’ Arizona Democrat Rep. Raúl Grijalva missed 455 votes, roughly 88% of the House votes taken this year, as he battled cancer. The 76-year-old was reelected in November and has said his upcoming term will be his last. Pennsylvania Democrat Rep. Dwight Evans is the second most absent member of Congress, having missed nearly 63% of votes after suffering a stroke in May. He also won reelection in November after running unopposed. By comparison, Granger ranks third on this list, missing 54% of the votes. Coming in fourth is Minnesota Democrat Rep. Dean Phillips, who missed 149 votes this year, most of which were during his failed effort to run against President Biden in the primaries. Trump announces ambassador to Panama amid fight over canal On the other side of Congress, Vice President-elect JD Vance missed the most votes in the Senate, most of which were after being tapped as President-elect Donald Trump's running mate. Retiring West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin ranked second, having skipped 90 votes in the Senate this year. He's followed by a fellow outgoing senator, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who missed 73 votes this year, and Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun, who missed 70 votes while he successfully ran for governor. Three lawmakers died while in office, including Democrats Donald Payne Jr., Sheila Jackson Lee and Bill Pascrell.

Trump criticizes Trudeau, Panama, Biden commutations on Truth Soc...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump made more than 30 posts on his social media platform Truth Social in the span of 1 hour on Christmas. Among the posts Trump made on Tuesday was one announcing his pick for U.S. Ambassador to Panama, though he criticized the country itself. 'Kevin Marino Cabrera will serve as the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, a country that is ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dreams,' Trump wrote. This echoes comments the Republican made Sunday at the conservative conference 'AmericaFest,' where he said that the United States 'foolishly' ceded control of the canal to Panama, and suggested his administration would try to get it back. The president of San Jose, José Raúl Mulino rejected that notion as an affront to his country’s sovereignty. A million taxpayers will soon receive up to $1,400 from the IRS Along with revealing his new choice for his incoming administration, Trump used Truth Social to urge others to confirm his nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth and FBI director, Kash Patel. Both are facing criticism — Hegseth for sexual misconduct allegations and Patel for comments he's made about the 'Deep State' and other conspiracy theories. To Republican strategist Whitley Yates, the flurry of social media posts by the president-elect are 'very Trump.' 'He is someone who's consistently thinking about America, consistently on Truth Social talking about America,' Yates said on 'Morning in America' Wednesday. Democratic Strategist Brad Howard said although the 'meat' of the story is who Trump is nominating to be in his administration, he likes to throw other topics out there 'because he's really good at grabbing headlines and narratives and media attention.' 'It's working,' Howard said. 'But there are some troubling things here that he's proposing.' President-elect Donald Trump strongly defended cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Kash Patel in a flurry of Christmas Day Truth Social posts.

'If Canada was to become our 51st State, their taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World,' Trump wrote. He previously called making Canada the 51st state a 'great idea' in another Truth Social post as well. Instead of Trudeau, Trump suggested former professional hockey player Wayne Gretzky run for prime minister of Canada. Greenland, Trump added, is 'needed by the United States for National Security purposes.' Last week, Trump said the U.S. owning Greenland 'is an absolute necessity.' Múte Egede, Greenland’s prime minister, said in a statement that Greenland 'is not for sale and will never be for sale.' What is ‘walking pneumonia’? Trump slams Biden commutations Among his multiple posts on Tuesday were ones criticizing current President Joe Biden for commuting the death row sentences of 37 federal inmates to life in prison. 'I refuse to wish a merry Christmas to those lucky souls, but instead will say, go to hell,' Trump said. The White House announced Biden's commutations Monday. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said in a statement released for publication on Monday. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.' Throughout his time on the campaign trail for the 2024 election, Trump said his administration would not shy away from the death penalty. During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death.

Year-end travel: What you need to know about post-holiday trips	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Millions of Americans are traveling on Thursday as a record-breaking post-holiday rush continues. The Transportation Security Administration anticipates Friday to be one of the season's busiest days, with 40 million passengers projected to be screened on New Year's Day. AAA projects 119.3 million people will travel during the year-end holiday period, which runs through next Thursday. Here's what you can expect for holiday travel as the year comes to a close: 14K flights delayed since Monday: FlightAware Americans flying in the next few days are hoping to get to their destinations smoother than they did before Christmas. The flight-tracking website FlightAware reported some 14,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed since Monday, with over 400 cancellations. As of Thursday morning, more than 570 flights into and out of the U.S. have been delayed and 21 have been canceled. Return your 2024 holiday gifts by these deadlines Winter weather from Boston to Baltimore may have given folks in the northeast a White Christmas, but it also contributed to Christmas Eve delays. American Airlines reports it's all hands on deck after Tuesday's technical glitch that grounded flights for over an hour. Over 40% of American flights were delayed Tuesday, according to FlightAware. What will be the busiest travel days? Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Dec. 20 and 21, followed by Dec. 26, Dec. 27, and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on New Year’s Day. The slowest U.S. air travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day. AAA: 107M driving through New Year's Day About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA. The 107 million people hitting the road is 2.5 million more than last year. Additionally, AAA expects nearly 4.5 million people to take buses and trains this year, up nearly 10 percent from last year. Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per kilowatt hour, but varies by state. Transportation data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation’s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays. New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, the company said. Body found in wheel well of United Airlines flight from Chicago to Maui AAA recommends traveling early to avoid heavy traffic, as the peak driving times are in the afternoon and early evening. It also urges drivers to slow down and stay alert and refreshed behind the wheel. Planning ahead for 2025 Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But travel analysts suggest early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.

Ex-NASA astronaut encounters mysterious flying orbs 9,000 ft. in ...	(NewsNation) — Two months before the recent wave of unexplained drones in New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast, a former NASA astronaut encountered mysterious metallic orbs while flying a private plane, he revealed in an interview with NewsNation's The Hill. Leroy Chiao, who was a commander on the International Space Station, had a near-collision with unidentified flying objects in the panhandle of Texas in August as he was flying from Colorado in a small airplane. 'I was about 9,000 feet (in the air), and suddenly, out of nowhere, these two big metallic spherical orbs, one on top of the other about three feet in diameter, each went zipping by the left side of my airplane right underneath about 20 feet away,' Chiao said. The unmanned aircraft was not on the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control radar, Chiao said. Over a month later, the northeast drone mystery remains unsolved 'I got a good look at them only for a second, and it happened so quick, there wasn't even a chance to get scared, but it could have been a bad result if they had actually hit me,' he said. The former astronaut has flown several state space missions before, three of which lasted six months on the ISS. He said it's 'hard to believe' the government doesn't know what's going on with the drones that have been flying in New Jersey near U.S. military facilities. 'I think they could tell us what they know,' Chiao said. 'How could we have the best, most advanced military and technological capabilities in the world, and if they don't know? That's even more disconcerting.' Reports of drones began in mid-November, and residents and local officials have voiced their frustration over the lack of government transparency. 'To me, it seems like it's some kind of a military program,' Chiao said. 'It seems like it's way too widespread and organized to be some kind of prank unless somebody's got a lot of money to spend on that.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/nasa-astronaut-mysterious-flying-orbs/	2024-12-26T04:08:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-486714640.jpg?w=724
What is 'walking pneumonia'?	(NewsNation) — Cases of 'walking pneumonia' are rising for the first time since the start of the pandemic, with health providers reporting an increase in young children. Cases began climbing in the spring and peaked in late August, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Diagnoses appear to be rising the most among children, according to diagnosis data from March 31 through October 5, 2024. The percentage grew from 1% to 7.2% among children ages 2 to 4 years and from 3.6% to 7.4% among children ages 5 to 17 years, according to the CDC. The agency said the increase in babies and toddlers is notable because the infection is historically known to affect school-age more than younger children. Cases of ‘walking pneumonia’ are rising across the US 'We've seen a dramatic increase in illness and hospitalization due to Mycoplasma pneumonia,' said Dr. Mary Fairchok, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, told MedicalExpress. 'Adults can get Mycoplasma too, but it's really hitting the pediatric population.' What is 'walking pneumonia Walking pneumonia is a respiratory tract infection caused by the bacterium mycoplasma pneumoniae, according to the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. It is the common term for atypical or a mild form of pneumonia. Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes airways to swell, the air sacs in your lungs to fill with mucus and other fluids and a high fever and a cough with mucus, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The main differences between walking pneumonia and the more common pneumonia is that the former is milder and usually doesn’t require bed rest or hospitalization, the clinic stated. The highest rates of walking pneumonia generally occur in school-age children and teens, and people who have weakened immune systems or are recovering from another respiratory infection are at higher risk of severe infection. What are the symptoms of walking pneumonia? Symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, chest pain, cough and low-grade fever in adults. The infection doesn't tend to cause much nasal or sinus congestion in adults, the medical center stated. Walking pneumonia can feel like a bad cold or the flu. Children under 5 may experience symptoms other than a chest cold, including nasal congestion, sneezing, and watery eyes or gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, according to the CDC. What is ‘walking pneumonia,’ and why are cases rising? The infection is highly contagious and spreads through droplets in the air through coughing and sneezing. It can take up to three to four weeks from the time someone was exposed to the germ to the time that they're feeling sick. Walking pneumonia may last from four to six weeks. A cough is usually the longest-lasting walking pneumonia symptom, according to the Cleveland Clinic. How to test for walking pneumonia? Medical professionals can test for walking pneumonia with a nose swab similar to the COVID-19 test, the Cleveland Clinic stated. They could also order chest X-rays to see if there’s an infection in the lungs. Providers can also do a blood test and send the sample to a laboratory to confirm the infection. How to treat walking pneumonia The infection, like most, can be treated with antibiotics. Hospitalization is generally rare with this infection. Most people can recover on their own, but over-the-counter medicine can help ease symptoms. Why are cases rising? The infection has risen to levels unseen since the pandemic. The reason why it dropped since 2020 is because of infection prevention measures that went into place, like social distancing and masking, reported Johns Hopkins. 'In North America, we began to detect M. pneumoniae more frequently on tests in 2024. Since the summer, the proportion of tests that are positive for M. pneumoniae has gone up and is still going up right now,' the organization stated.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/what-is-walking-pneumonia/	2024-12-25T17:41:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67198c0c4990a0.81738904.jpeg?w=900

Alleged shoplifters learn retail crime now a felony in California	(NewsNation) — Two alleged shoplifters figured out the hard way retail crime is now a felony in California under Proposition 36. California's Seal Beach Police shared video on social media of an exchange between two suspects sitting in the back of a squad car where one realizes repeat offenders of retail theft can now face felony charges. 'That’s a felony?' the female suspect asked, referring to retail theft. 'B----, new laws. Stealing is a felony,' the other replied, adding, 'And this is Orange County, b----. They don't play.' Californian voters crack down on crime, pass Proposition 36 Police captioned the post 'Remember folks, Don’t Steal in Seal,' and they said the 'new proposition only strengthens our commitment to combating Organized Retail Theft.' Police also released video surveillance from several locations, including a Kohl’s and an Ulta store, that the suspects visited. In the video, three women are seen carefully selecting and stealing nearly $2,000 worth of merchandise from the stores. They are also seen calmly walking out holding the allegedly stolen items. The social media post also includes bodycam video from when officers chase the suspects. California voters approved Proposition 36 in November, which made shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increased penalties for some drug charges. A felony conviction could mean jail time of up to three years. ‘Peek-a-boo’: California police catch alleged shoplifter hiding in car trunk The measure partly rolls back a progressive law passed by voters in 2014 that downgraded several nonviolent crimes to misdemeanors, including theft under $950 in value and some drug offenses. The reversal reflects widespread anger among voters who are increasingly pinning the blame for homelessness and retail theft on criminal justice reform and progressive district attorneys. California Governor Gavin Newsom had opposed Prop 36, claiming that it would disproportionately impact minority communities and worsen jail overcrowding, but the legislation was approved by nearly 70% of California voters. Business owners have expressed their support for the new law but say they are waiting to see how it plays out in the legal system.

NewsNation became the voice for all Americans in 2024	(NewsNation) — NewsNation became the voice for all Americans in 2024 by focusing on the people behind the stories, taking on the issues that matter and bringing together all perspectives. Through town halls and in-depth reporting, NewsNation met communities where they are across the country. In 2024, NewsNation focused on the value of learning trades, as opposed to attending a four-year college or university, alongside 'Dirty Jobs' host Mike Rowe. One American shared his journey during a NewsNation town hall in April, saying he left college after realizing the pride of learning a trade like his forefathers. CUOMO Special Edition: Trading Up with Mike Rowe 'My whole heritage has been based on working a skill, having trades,' Micheal Gamez told Rowe and NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'That means a lot to me. Those are my heroes; my grandfather does that, and my dad does that, so I just said, ‘You know what? Now I'm out.' ... It is the land of the brave, and I got to be able to go out there and be brave enough to show that pride.' NewsNation continued to put into focus brewing issues at the border, highlighting not only the plight of migrants coming to the U.S. but the challenges this posed to border patrol and state officials. NewsNation took a ride with law enforcement officials at the U.S.-Mexico border, capturing four encounters on camera during one hour of live coverage. During the 'Dan Abrams Live' special episode, NewsNation reporters fanned out nationwide, reporting live on the border crisis and its impact on communities, education and crime rates. Teams used night-vision technology and a specially outfitted NewsNation border truck. 'It's not going to be about the finger-pointing,' NewsNation’s Dan Abrams told viewers as he covered the southern border. The stories we bring will 'hopefully make us all a little bit more informed about what is actually happening at our southern border, and maybe maybe even spur some change.' Hurricane Helene victims vow to rebuild and return NewsNation remained committed to covering two devastating hurricanes: Helene and Milton. The team spoke to those who lost almost everything and the struggles they still face to rebuild. During a crucial election year, NewsNation brought important voices together to have conversations on the issues that mattered to Americans and to agree and disagree with civility. Commentators Bill O'Reilly and Stephen A Smith joined Cuomo in a town hall along with Mark Cuban, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Sarah Palin, Rep. Ro Khanna, UFC President Dana White and Geraldo Rivera to discuss a slew of topics. Vice-president elect JD Vance also joined Cuomo in another town hall where voters could ask questions through social media and engage with the then-candidate. No matter what side of the aisle Americans fell on, their voice mattered at NewsNation in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/newsnation-voice-americans-2024/	2024-12-25T11:45:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/town-hall-wide-shot.jpg?w=800

Migrants rushing to board dangerous 'beast' train to border	(NewsNation) — Migrants who want to reach the border before President-elect Donald Trump takes office has led to a surge of people boarding a deadly 'beast' train that travels near the U.S. border. The freight train, called 'La Bestia' or 'The Beast' is infamously known to be one of the deadliest trains in Mexico. Claudia Rios, a Durango resident living near the train stop, told NewsNation that she’s seen more than 200 people attempt to board the treacherous train in recent days. 'Lately they come very aggressive, like all the good, all the kind migrants have crossed, because in this group that's coming, they're fighting among themselves,' she told NewsNation in Spanish. Trump wants mass deportations. A ride-along with immigration officers shows the challenges Rios also said she’s seen an alarming number of children and even people in wheelchairs trying to get on the train. Previously it was mostly adults traveling alone, she said. The train has no passenger railcars and only carries products north for export. Migrants have been known to ride atop the moving trains, facing physical dangers that range from amputation to death if they fall or are pushed. They are also subject to extortion and violence at the hands of cartels and gangs that control the routes north, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Authorities have also reported a rise in kidnappings and extortion by cartels who see the migrants as easy money. Fifteen Vietnamese migrants and a Mexican national were rescued from a ransom kidnapping. In Sonora, Mexico, 36 migrants, mostly from India, were crowded to a house until desperate cries for help brought authorities to the scene. Mexican officials have launched efforts to stop the rush aboard the train by trying to get those migrants off and into safety. They're also offering migrants bus rides to the border if they have an appointment with Customs and Border Patrol. However, sources tell NewsNation it’s impossible to stop every single one of these migrants. Cartels taking advantage of holiday deliveries Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott launched his own state efforts to slow down the crossings at the border putting up over 40 billboards in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico warning migrants about the dangers of crossing, especially sexual assault against women and children. The $100,000 campaign includes warnings written in Spanish, Chinese, Russian and even Arabic. 'This is tough medicine,' Abbott said. 'We want no more ‘rape trees’ in Texas. Do not make the dangerous trek to Texas.' Abbot said one billboard would warn migrants, 'Your wife and daughter will pay for their trip with their bodies.' Abbot also said Texas is excited about President-elect Donald Trump shoring up security along the southern border and he reiterated that mass deportations will happen on 'Day 1.' Abbott said that according to conversations he’s had with Trump, the border barrier will be expanded all along the Southwest border. With Donald Trump returning to the White House, there is intense interest in how the Republican will carry out his immigration agenda, including a campaign pledge of mass deportations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/migrants-beast-train-border/	2024-12-24T10:55:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/GettyImages-1488958111.jpg?w=900
Trump vows to direct DOJ to pursue death penalty in wake of Biden...	President-elect Trump vowed Tuesday to direct his Department of Justice (DOJ) to pursue the death penalty in the wake of President Biden’s clemencies of nearly every federal death row inmate. 'As soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families and children from violent rapists, murderers, and monsters,' Trump said on Truth Social. 'We will be a Nation of Law and Order again!' Trump’s remarks come just a day after Biden officially announced he has commuted sentences of 37 out of 40 prisoners on federal death row, reclassifying their sentences from execution to life in prison. The move, which has drawn mixed reaction, leaves only three 'hard cases' behind — that of two notorious mass shooters who carried out their killings in a church and synagogue and one of the brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. Some of the prisoners granted clemency have been on death row for more than a decade with their crimes including the murders of other prisoners and prison guards. Biden in a statement said he was commuting the sentences in part because he expected Trump's incoming administration to remove a moratorium placed on federal executions under Biden's White House, with the exception of those involving terrorism and hate-fueled murders. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said. Trump’s team criticized the president’s decision Monday, characterizing it as 'abhorrent' and a 'slap in the face.' 'These are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones,' Trump communications director Steven Cheung said. 'President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people,' Cheung added. Trump has said during his 2024 presidential campaign that he is in favor of seeking the death penalty for lesser offenses including for drug traffickers. While the president has faced criticism over the decision, he has gotten praise from some civil rights groups: the American Civil Liberties Union and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-vows-to-direct-doj-to-pursue-death-penalty-in-wake-of-biden-clemencies/	2024-12-24T10:24:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Leading-Trump_122224_AP_Rick-Scuteri.jpg?w=900

What to know about death of a woman set on fire in NYC subway	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — Attorneys for the suspect accused of burning a woman to death on a New York subway are gearing up for a possible insanity defense. New York City police have arrested a man on murder and arson charges in the death of a woman who was set on fire inside a subway train early Sunday morning. Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, was arrested Monday after being taken into custody the previous day. He's charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder and arson. It is unclear if Zapeta-Calil has an attorney and when he would be arraigned. One Menendez brother could be freed: DA Immigration officials say Zapeta-Calil, who is from Guatemala, had been deported in 2018 and didn’t have permission to be in the U.S. Zapeta-Calil is currently being held at Brooklyn Central Brooking. It is unclear when and where Zapeta reentered the U.S. Here’s what else is known so far. Defense may seek insanity plea: Source Zapeta-Calil's attorneys are seeking a psychological evaluation, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The suspect was taken to Interfaith Medical Center Monday night; however, officials have not confirmed if he was given a psych evaluation. Police told me the victim had no identification on her and that they may need the victim's dental records to identify her given the condition of the body. A Brooklyn address listed for Zapeta-Calil released by police matches a service center for Samaritan Daytop Village, which provides housing and substance abuse support. The organization has not yet responded to NewsNation's request to confirm whether Zapeta-Calil lived there or at a different facility. Woman severely burned, only teeth can ID her: NYPD The woman was asleep on a stopped F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. Sunday when the suspect set her clothing on fire, The New York Police Department said. Officers at the station reportedly smelled and saw smoke and observed the victim in the train car fully engulfed in flames, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The fire was extinguished, and the woman was pronounced dead. Police have not yet released her identity. Authorities said the victim was burned so badly that teeth will likely be needed to identify her, NewsNation WPIX reported.

Body-worn cameras from responding officers provided a detailed look at the suspect. After pictures of the suspect were released, three high school-age New Yorkers called 911 saying they saw and recognized him on a train at the York Street station, police say. 'Our officers at District 2 stopped that train at Herald Square and was able to keep the doors closed, walk the train, and place this very dangerous individual in custody. This is amazing work done by the public and the police working together.' The suspect had a lighter in his pocket, police say. New York Gov.

Eggs added to FDA's updated healthy claim food list	(NewsNation) — Eggs are now considered healthy under new guidance released recently by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA included eggs under its updated healthy claim definition, which the federal agency said reflects current nutrition science and dietary guidance. Under the new definition, eggs fit into the FDA’s healthy classification that requires foods to contain a minimum number of individual nutrients. Current dietary guidance recommends Americans build healthy eating patterns that include a variety of vegetables, fruits, dairy, proteins and whole grains. Soda manufacturers push to keep sugary drinks on SNAP list Other foods that qualify for the FDA’s healthy guidelines include fresh whole fruits and vegetables, salmon, trail mix with nuts and dried fruits, and plain low-fat or fat-free yogurt. States like Colorado will enact a new law beginning on Jan. 1 requiring stores to only sell cage-free eggs. NewsNation affiliate KDVR reported about 40% of eggs produced in the United States are cage-free. 'This news makes eggs a clear healthy choice, vindicating them from outdated science, Jen Houchins, director of nutrition research for the American Egg Board's Egg Nutrition Center, said in a statement released by the FDA. 'The FDA announcement reaffirms the egg's role in supporting the health of American families, with nutritional benefits for everyone. Eggs offer a good source of high-quality protein and contribute nutrients to the diet that Americans don't get enough of, like vitamin D and choline.' The health values of eggs have long been considered high in cholesterol and therefore, a risk to Americans’ health. However, research conducted by the FDA indicates that the cholesterol level in eggs does not negatively affect the body’s cholesterol levels as once believed. Organizations like the American Heart Association have added eggs to their heart-friendly list of foods. 'We applaud the FDA for this important update, which reflects decades of research and unequivocally affirms the value of eggs for healthy living,' Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board, said in a statement. 'Eggs are accessible in the refrigerator of nearly every U.S. household. Whether you're scrambling them for breakfast, grabbing them hardboiled for a quick lunch on the go, or enjoying some egg-and-veggie fried rice at dinner, Americans now know for certain that eggs are one of the healthiest foods for your family.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/eggs-fdas-updated-healthy-food-list/	2024-12-24T08:44:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/eggs-e1700070627909.jpg?w=900
Georgia homeowner arrested after attempting to remove squatter	(NewsNation) — Loletha Hale, a Georgia homeowner, was arrested while attempting to remove an alleged squatter from her home. Hale joined 'Morning in America' to detail why she was arrested after calling police to remove the woman from her Livingston, Georgia, home. 'I'm just not believing this, that she had the audacity to break the law to re-enter my home,' Hale said. Live Updates: Greensboro police officer killed in shooting at Food Lion on Lawndale Drive She added local courts and police have been unhelpful and cannot fathom why she was arrested and spent a night in jail after being charged with criminal trespassing and a misdemeanor count of terroristic threats. 'Your guess is just as good as mine,' Hale said of why she was arrested. 'I would have never imagined in a million years that not only myself but any homeowner would be arrested as a result of a squad event in their house. It's just no logical explanation. I can't explain it.' Per WSB-TV, Sakemeyia Johnson has been allegedly squatting in the home but was ruled to not be a squatter by a Clayton County Magistrate Court due to Johnson's relation to a formerly evicted tenant's partner. Despite a judge ruling in Hale's favor since, she told NewsNation she is unable to go to her home until she gets a writ, and is unsure when her home will be vacated. 'I have no clue when I will be able to get back into my home,' she said. 'I did speak with the court last week, and I was informed that a hearing would be scheduled for some type of evidentiary hearing on her appeal, although she has not met any of the statutory requirements for her to have an appeal. So I don't know why we're having a hearing, but I've not received notice of a date.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/georgia-homeowner-arrested-alleged-squatter/	2024-12-24T07:06:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Loletha-Hale.jpg?w=900

Starbucks baristas end strike, return to work for holiday	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Starbucks baristas returned to work on Wednesday following the largest strike of its kind at stores across the U.S. Meanwhile, Amazon delivery drivers paused their picket lines but plan to resume their fight for better wages and working conditions. Amazon workers are demanding the companies recognize them as unionized employees or meet their demands for an inaugural labor contract. This major year-end push stems from failed negotiations and strategically hits during the busiest week of the year. Contract negotiations at Starbucks The Workers United Union represents about 10,000 Starbucks employees at more than 500 stores. Union leaders said the strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio. In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. The five-day strike, which began on Friday, initially closed Starbucks cafes in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle. It's now expanded to 10 cities, though it impacts just a fraction of the more than 16,000 Starbucks locations across the country. Workers blame Starbucks for an impasse in talks, as the company blames workers for demanding unsustainable wage increases. A million taxpayers will soon get up to $1,400 from the IRS: Here's why The union argues Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. In launching the strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, Workers United said Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years. Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week. The company said it is ready to continue negotiation when the union wants to come back to the bargaining table. 'Workers United will seek to cause more stores to close and claim that their strike has reached 'hundreds of stores in dozens of cities,'' Sara Kelly, Starbucks executive vice president and chief partner officer, said in a statement Tuesday. 'The public conversation may lack the important context that the vast majority of our stores (97-99%) will continue to operate and serve customers, and we expect a very limited impact to our overall operations.' Teamster-led strikes at Amazon Action against Amazon is more extensive, centering around claims of corporate greed that shortchange employees. The Internal Brotherhood of Teamsters claims to have nearly 9,000 workers on strike nationwide, demanding higher pay and improved working conditions. According to the union, workers who voted to authorize strikes began picketing on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. Drivers argue they should get paid the same as United Postal Service workers or UPS drivers. Amazon and Starbucks workers are on strike. Trump might have something to do with it Amazon announced plans to raise wages for its subcontracted drivers to $22 an hour following union pressure. However, Teamsters members driving for UPS earn an average of $49 an hour. The Teamsters union has primarily focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors handling Amazon's deliveries. However, Amazon has rejected calls to negotiate, since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees. Teamsters also say the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers, totaling about 10,000 Amazon workers nationwide — a small portion of Amazon's 1.5 million employees. The union hasn't disclosed the number of workers participating in the strike or how long it will last. But it included Amazon-employed warehouse workers in San Francisco and subcontracted delivery drivers in cities like Chicago, New York City, Atlanta, and other parts of California. Will the strike impact holiday packages? For customers, logistics experts suspect there could be minor delays in California, Georgia, Illinois and New York. However, Amazon told NewsNation it doesn't expect the strike to impact operations, and won't affect customers receiving their packages on time. Additionally, Amazon argues the drivers are not its employees. The company also says these actions are protests, not strikes since no Amazon employee or third-party driver pays Teamsters union dues.

Ex-US Rep. Gaetz paid women for sex while in Congress: Ethics rep...	(NewsNation) — Former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz allegedly used illicit drugs and paid for sex with multiple women — including a 17-year-old girl — according to the final draft of a House Committee ethics report, which was was released to the public on Monday. Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the ethics committee on Monday, challenging the body’s 'unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of the report. Committee-ReportDownload The 37-page report concludes that Gaetz regularly paid women for sex between 2017 and 2020 and that on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2019, he possessed drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy. The committee also concluded that Gaetz knowingly and willfully sought to impede and obstruct the House Committe's investigation of his conduct. NewsNation reported last week that the ethics report would be released by Christmas after the House Committee initially voted not to release the report after the Florida Republican resigned his House seat. The report indicated that Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s initial pick for Attorney General, paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex or drugs on several occasions. That included money he paid to a 17-year-old girl in 2017. The report indicated Gaetz violated Florida’s statutory rape law as well as other state laws. Luigi Mangione, UnitedHealthcare CEO killing suspect, to be arraigned in Manhattan 'The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,' panel investigators wrote in the report. In his lawsuit, Gaetz claims that the report contains 'potentially defamatory allegations' that violate the House committee’s own rules. The suit said that while Gaetz was a member of Congress, the committee began an investigation of previously unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct. The suit said that the investigation continued after Gaetz resigned his seat and 'apparently voted' to release the report without proper notice to Gaetz. In a post on X on Monday, Gaetz wrote, 'There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.' The ethics report found Gaetz often used Venmo or PayPal to pay women during his tenure in Congress. Investigators zeroed in on a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, which they said 'violated the House gift rule.' The report also said that during the trip, Gaetz 'engaged in sexual activity' with multiple women, including one who described the trip itself as 'the payment' for sex on the trip. On the same trip, he also took ecstasy, one woman on the trip told the committee, the report found. The report concluded that in 2018, Gaetz arranged for his Chief of Staff to assist a woman with whom he engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the U.S. Department of State that she was a constituent. The report said that Gaetz paid 'Victim A' $400 to have sex with him, which she understood was payment for sex. The report indicated that Victim A was 17 and recently completed her junior year of high school. Investigators also determined that Gaetz had sex twice at a party, including one occasion that was witnessed by other party attendees. In response to the news that the ethics report would be released, Gaetz wrote on X last week, 'My 30's were an era of working very hard – and playing hard too. It’s embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.' Gaetz resigned after Trump named the former Florida lawmaker as his pick for Attorney General. Gaetz, however, withdrew his name as the nominee following controversy over him being tabbed by Trump. In a social media post, Gaetz said it was clear his confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction for the transfer of power over to Trump.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/gaetz-paid-women-sex-congress-report/	2024-12-23T07:51:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/gaetzmatt_043024gn02_w_f52f00.jpg?w=900
Frustration, fascination with drone sightings continue to grow	(NewsNation) — Americans' fascination and frustration levels with mysterious drone sightings continue to grow although the number of reports involving unidentified objects has dipped in the past few days. Federal agencies like the FBI have not provided definitive answers about where the drones are coming from. The agencies continue to maintain that the drones are not the property of the U.S. military and that there is no reason for concern about the objects being operated by foreign governments. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drones in certain parts of New York and New Jersey, where Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy maintains that anti-drone technology that was sent to the state isn’t working. Government handling of drones a ‘catastrophe’: Elizondo 'I think momentum and frustration is growing on this issue,' Brad Crispin, the co-founder of Americans for Safe Aerospace, told NewsNation. Crispin said out of the thousands of reported drone sightings, some have been misidentified. But he said that the main story surrounding the issue is the vulnerabilities that now exist in American airspace and the nation’s critical infrastructure. He said that a percentage of what people are seeing in the sky is 'truly concerning.' Crispin said that sightings at Picatinny Arsenal and Trump National Golf Course in New Jersey likely sparked the national fascination with drones. But the sightings are instead a 'years-running pattern' with mysterious overflights in sensitive areas by unidentified objects. 'Pilots are concerned, members of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee are concerned, and they’ve been raising the warning for years,' Crispin said. Crispin said the biggest concern is that federal agencies don’t know where the drones are coming from. Given the temporary bans in two states that will last until mid-January and anxiety over the misidentification of drones, Crispin said it has become evident that federal officials don’t have the drone issue under control. 'I think only a fraction of these (sightings) are concerning,' Crispin told NewsNation. 'But people want answers. Let’s identify what’s in our skies, There shouldn’t be unknown objects operating over military bases, operating over critical infrastructure. There’s no reason for it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/frustration-fascination-with-drone-sightings-continue-to-grow/	2024-12-23T07:31:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ.jpg?w=900
Gaetz sues Ethics Committee in last-minute bid to block release o...	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) on Monday filed a lawsuit against the House Ethics Committee in a last-minute attempt to block the panel from releasing its report on the Florida Republican. Gaetz, who resigned from Congress last month, filed the lawsuit as several outlets reported on leaked drafts of the Ethics Committee’s report, which CNN and CBS say found 'substantial evidence' that the ex-congressman violated House rules or Florida state laws that prohibit prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges and obstruction of Congress. The panel is expected to publicly release the report as early as Monday. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., asks a judge to issue an emergency order blocking the report’s release. Gaetz claims the committee is acting beyond its authority because it has no jurisdiction over him now that he has resigned from Congress. Gaetz’s attorneys said the report contains 'untruthful and defamatory information' that would 'significantly damage' his reputation. 'The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections,' Gaetz’s attorneys wrote. The suit names the Ethics Committee and its chair, Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), as defendants. Spokespeople for the Ethics Committee and Guest did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment. While the Ethics Committee does not have jurisdiction over former members of Congress, there is precedent to the panel releasing the report on ex-lawmakers — though it is rare. In 1987, for example, the committee released its report into former Rep. William Boner (D-Tenn.) after he resigned from the House. The legal action could be the final battle for Gaetz in the years-long investigation into the firebrand Republican. Before the Ethics panel resumed its investigation, the Department of Justice had investigated Gaetz for sex trafficking and whether he had sex with a 17-year-old girl. The DOJ in 2023 declined to charge Gaetz with a crime. Gaetz has repeatedly denied having sex with a minor and other wrongdoing, and pointed to the lack of charges as a means of discrediting the Ethics panel investigation. 'These claims would be destroyed in court — which is why they were never made in any court against me,' Gaetz told The Hill on Monday. The Ethics Committee continued investigating Gaetz after the DOJ declined to charge the Florida Republican, probing allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, accepting improper gifts, dispensing special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship and seeking to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. In a lengthy statement posted on X last week, after news broke that the panel reversed course and voted to release its report into Gaetz, the ex-congressman defended his conduct, saying it was 'embarrassing, though not criminal.'

Luigi Mangione, UnitedHealthcare CEO killing suspect, to be arrai...	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare is set to be arraigned Monday in a New York City court on state murder and terror charges. The Manhattan district attorney formally charged Luigi Mangione last week with multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism. His initial appearance in the New York State Supreme Court was preempted by federal prosecutors bringing their own charges over the shooting. What’s next for the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO? The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. The district attorney's office told NewsNation that it's working with federal authorities to coordinate Monday's arraignment, but has not yet confirmed a specified time for Mangione's court appearance. CEO killing 'intended to evoke terror': DA Alvin Bragg Mangione is accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan on Dec 4. He was arrested in Pennsylvania after a five-day search and was extradited to New York City on Thursday. On Tuesday, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg announced Mangione is now being indicted on one count of first-degree murder in the furtherance of terrorism, arguing the killing 'was intended to evoke terror.' Mangione's defense questions fed charges Meanwhile, Mangione’s defense team appears taken aback by the federal charges, which were introduced late last week. Federal investigators argue Mangione meticulously planned the murder, alleging the 26-year-old expressed hostility toward the insurance industry and wealthy executives. Karen Friedman Agnifilo, an attorney for Mangione, has accused federal and state prosecutors of advancing conflicting legal theories. In federal court last week, she called their approach 'very confusing' and 'highly unusual.' Prosecutors have said both cases will be worked on simultaneously, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Mangione is set to return to court next month for the federal charges, which could carry the death penalty.

Biden commutes sentences of 37 death row inmates to life without ...	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden announced that he is commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, meaning they will now have life sentences without the possibility of parole instead. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said in a statement released for publication on Monday. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.' In 2021, the Biden administration put a moratorium on federal death sentences in cases other than terrorism and 'hate-motivated mass murder.' Drones over New Jersey: Mystery continues month after first sightings Throughout his time on the campaign trail for the 2024 election, Trump said his administration would not shy away from the death penalty, however. 'We’ve never had (such) massive amounts of drugs pouring into our country,' he said during a campaign event in Arizona. 'And by the way, you’ll never solve the problem without the death penalty.' During the last six months of Trump’s first term, a record 13 federal inmates were put to death. The last of these executions happened just days before Biden took office. The number far surpasses executions under any president for more than a century. Before July 2020, the federal government hadn’t executed anyone in 17 years. The Trump administration also approved using pentobarbital in lethal injections even with evidence it could cause pulmonary edema, a painful condition akin to drowning. Hundreds of anti-capital punishment groups had been calling on Biden to commute the death row sentences, as they feared a renewed 'execution spree' in a Trump presidency. Death Penalty Action, an anti-capital punishment coalition of more than 350 groups, sent Biden a letter talking about the 'renewed concern and urgency' they had with Trump coming into office in less than two months. What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory? 'Suddenly the whole world has changed and if Joe Biden doesn’t commute these sentences, then Donald Trump is going to kill them,' Abraham Bonowitz, the executive director of Death Penalty Action, previously told NewsNation before Biden's commutations were revealed. Earlier this month, Biden pardoned 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes and commuted the sentences of 1,500 people placed on home confinement. It was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. At the time, Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. Biden also issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons and broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia. In addition, he's pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex.

Mexican, US police deploy more officers at border for holiday tra...	(NewsNation) — Officials on the southern border are warning that there will be major traffic in the area as thousands of people across the United States travel to see their families in Mexico this holiday season. In Laredo, Texas, the police department say lines of congestion can cause people to wait for hours. Officials in Eagle Pass, Texas are also reporting long lines of congestion on International Bridge One and International Bridge Two that could affect commerce. Some of the traffic on those bridges being rerouted to different roads. That journey to see loved ones can take up to two weeks for some — and lately, it's been much more dangerous to travel to Mexico, because of drug cartels working along the southern border. Travel tracker: What you should know as you prepare for holiday travel In recent years, hundreds of police officers have been monitoring roads and assisting travelers. To facilitate the holiday travel, Mexican officials have stepped up security on their side even more. For instance, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, police say they've deployed an additional 400 officers. On the American side, the Texas Department of Public Safety deployed additional officers as at least 9.1 million Texans will be hitting the skies and roads this year. In total, an estimated 119.3 million Americans will travel during the year-end holidays, according to the American Automobile Association. Officials are recommending that all those who head into Mexico look on social media for any statements from local law enforcement that come in.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/border-police-holiday-travel/	2024-12-22T18:38:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Laredo-Welcome-Sign-061323.jpg?w=900
White House made 'friendliest threat' over Biden's decline: DNC c...	(NewsNation) — A Democratic National Committee finance committee member told NewsNation Sunday she received a 'friendly threat' from the White House before publicly discussing President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. Lindy Li, who had raised millions for Biden's campaign, said on 'NewsNation Prime,' that a White House official called her the night before her scheduled appearance on Fox News Sunday in July. According to Li, the official told her, 'You're one of the President's most loyal supporters. We know you're going to stay loyal.' 'It was the friendliest threat possible,' Li said, comparing the exchange to dialogues from 'The Sopranos' and 'The Godfather.' Texas US Rep. Kay Granger in senior living facility: reports Li's comments come amid a Wall Street Journal report that sheds light on the 46th president's challenges, citing interviews with nearly 50 sources. Li said she observed concerning changes in Biden during fundraising events, noting an incident at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in May where Biden declined to take questions or work the rope line after a $1.1 million fundraiser. The DNC finance committee member also described increasingly restrictive practices at fundraising events, including pre-approved questions printed on note cards for donors to read. At some events, she said, no questions were permitted at all. While Li maintained she saw no signs of cognitive decline during the 2020 campaign, she said she noticed significant changes beginning in 2023. She characterized the current administration as a 'shadow presidency' run by Biden's inner circle. Trump pushes back on ‘President Musk’ claims 'President Biden, as a human being, is no longer capable of executing the duties of the commander in chief,' Li said. She added that she faced significant backlash for speaking out, including losing tens of thousands of social media followers. 'I don't want to get crucified again, but there are certain people around him, his senior advisors, who are essentially running the country,' Li told NewsNation. Li said she decided to come forward after feeling 'lied to at worst and manipulated at best' about campaign prospects and fundraising efforts, citing $2.5 billion in campaign spending that she helped raise. GOP lawmaker says Johnson made spending fight ‘way too complicated’ Biden’s decline widely reported in final days of presidency In the WSJ report, White House aides admitted to Biden having 'good days' and 'bad days' and making attempts to manage his cognitive 'limitations' while in office. The report details accounts from administration officials who say Biden would grow 'tired if meetings went long' and occasionally 'make mistakes.' Aides often repeated instructions, even for tasks like entering or exiting a stage. The report further claims that Biden’s inner circle has implemented stricter controls than in past administrations, limiting his interactions, information flow and conversations. The administration has denied any decline in the president’s abilities.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-decline-threat-lindy-li/	2024-12-22T18:01:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot-1-5.jpg?w=900
Trump pushes back on 'President Musk' claims	President-elect Trump on Sunday rejected the recent dubbing of tech billionaire Elon Musk as 'President Musk' by Democrats. 'No, he’s not gonna be president, that I can tell you,' Trump said at conservative group Turning Point's 'America Fest' in Phoenix, Ariz. 'And I’m safe, you know why? He can’t be, he wasn’t born in this country.' GOP lawmaker says Johnson made spending fight ‘way too complicated’ Democratic leaders have recently implied that the tech billionaire is the 'real leader' of the GOP in the wake of Musk’s hard-line campaign opposing a stopgap spending measure. In the last week, Musk railed against the stopgap measure on social media, with the president-elect following him in his disapproval of the deal negotiated by strong Trump ally House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) 'Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!' Musk said Wednesday on the social platform X, which he owns. At 'America Fest,' Trump said Musk 'went to Pennsylvania, and he stayed — stayed up there for a month, and helped us to win that state, which we won by a lot.' 'So he was really good,' Trump added. Trump said last month that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would serve as the heads of the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) panel, which aims to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and 'restructure federal agencies.' Biden ‘AWOL’ amid shutdown fight: ‘He’s completely disappeared’ DOGE will 'provide advice and guidance from outside of government' and work alongside the White House Office of Management and Budget, the president-elect said. 'It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,' Trump added. 'Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.' The Hill has reached out to Tesla, Musk's electric car company, for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-president-elon-musk/	2024-12-22T12:30:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/AP24279820874848-e1732732640825.jpg?w=900

Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) said on Sunday that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) made the government funding battle 'way too complicated.' 'I think he made it way too complicated,' McClintock said Sunday on NewsNation’s 'The Hill.' Donald Trump’s new administration: Who has he chosen so far? The California Republican argued Johnson likes to have people 'beat him up from time to time' but doesn’t think it is necessary under a second White House term under President-elect Trump.

2 US Navy pilots shot down over Red Sea in apparent 'friendly fir...	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become, with ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time of the friendly fire incident, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what the pilots' mission was and did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen which the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. However, there were no images or information released regarding the strikes — which has happened previously when airstrikes hit vital facilities for the rebels. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, released a prerecorded statement hours later in which he claimed the rebels launched eight drones and 17 cruise missiles in their attack. He also claimed without offering any evidence that the Houthis shot down the F/A-18, likely following a pattern of him making exaggerated claims. During the Eisenhower's deployment, he repeatedly falsely claimed the carrier had been struck by Houthi fire. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would act 'forcefully' against the Houthis, as it has against other allies of Iran, 'only in this case, we are not acting alone.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-two-us-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-apparent-friendly-fire-incident-us-military-says/	2024-12-22T07:55:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67683744319dc6.09387986.jpeg?w=900
Driver killed by police after driving truck through Texas mall, i...	KILLEEN, Texas (KXAN) — A driver was shot and killed by law enforcement officers after driving a truck into a busy mall on Saturday night, injuring five people, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. At around 5 p.m., a DPS trooper tried to stop a black pickup truck after a 911 caller reported a possible intoxicated driver in Belton, about 20 miles from Killeen. The driver refused to stop, prompting a chase, DPS explained during a Saturday night press conference. The pickup then turned into the parking lot of the Killeen Mall, nearly 70 miles north of Austin, before driving into the building, striking people as it went. Blake Lively accuses ‘It Ends With Us’ director Justin Baldoni of harassment, smear campaign 'The suspect drove through the doors and continued to drive through the JCPenney store, striking multiple people,' Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety said in an evening news briefing. 'The trooper and the Killeen police officer continued on foot after this vehicle, which was driving through the store, actively running people over. He traveled several hundred yards.' At least five people were injured by the vehicle, according to DPS. Four victims were taken to area hospitals, while another traveled to a hospital separately. They ranged in age from 6 to 75 years old and their conditions were not immediately known, Washko said.

(KXAN Photo/Frank Martinez) Troopers and Killeen Police officers followed the truck into the mall on foot, linking up with off-duty officers from three other local agencies. Officers from the state public safety department, Killeen, and the off-duty officers 'engaged in gunfire to eliminate this threat,' Washko said. The Texas Rangers will investigate the shooting. Washko did not have information about the suspect's identity at the time of the briefing. A public information officer for DPS said posts sharing misinformation spread rapidly online in the midst of the incident, including several seen by Nexstar's KXAN that claimed there was an active shooter within the Killeen Mall. At around 6 p.m. Killeen Police said on Facebook that there was no active shooter in the mall, adding that while the mall and surrounding area were 'secure,' the public should avoid it. Daniel Bartlett was at work at JC Penney when the incident happened. He said he was in the store's backroom when he heard gunshots and ran into the store to help people get out, not knowing what happened. 'It's, it's only what, four days till Christmas? And so there's a lot of shoppers, and, you know, there's a lot of people that are running,' Bartlett explained. 'There's only two entrances to get out, and so people are running out the salon entrance, and I go, and I hold the door open to help people out because people are panicking.' Deer wearing hi-visibility vest spotted in Michigan 'I didn't know someone drove through our store. All I knew is that there was gunshots.' Bartlett told KXAN he also helped people get into a safe area within the store office before returning to the shopping floor, and that's when he saw the destruction. 'So I get out there and I'm looking for co-workers, and that's when I see the destruction. It is clean through.' Bartlett said he'd never seen anything like it. 'I don't know. I really don't.

German authorities received tipoffs last year about the suspect i...	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — German authorities said they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged on Sunday about the five people killed. Authorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven’t publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Authorities say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. He described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. He is being held in custody as authorities investigate him. The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said in an interview on the German broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that his office received a tipoff from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, which led authorities to launch 'appropriate investigative measures.' 'The man also published a huge number of posts on the internet. He also had contact with various authorities, made insults and even threats. However, he was not known to have committed acts of violence,' said Münch, whose office is the German equivalent of the FBI. He said that the warnings, however, proved to be very unspecific. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also said Saturday on X that it received a tipoff about the suspect in the late summer of last year. 'This was taken seriously, like every other of the numerous tips,' the office said. But it also noted that it is not an investigative authority and that it referred the information to the responsible authorities. It gave no other details. The Central Council of Ex-Muslims said in a statement that the suspect had 'terrorized' them for years as it expressed shock at the attack. 'He apparently shared beliefs from the far-right spectrum of the AfD and believed in a large-scale conspiracy aimed at Islamizing Germany. His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,' said the statement. The group's chairwoman, Mina Ahadi, said in the same statement: 'At first we suspected that he might be a mole in the Islamist movement. But now I think he is a psychopath who adheres to ultra-right conspiracy ideologies.' Police in Magdeburg, the capital of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Sunday that those who died were four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy. Authorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond. The suspect was on Saturday evening brought before a judge, who behind closed doors ordered him to be kept in custody on allegations of murder and attempted murder. He is facing a possible indictment. The horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany make it likely that migration will remain a key issue as the country heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. A deadly knife attack in Solingen in August pushed the issue to the top of the agenda, and led the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tighten border security measures. Right-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union’s migration policies and described it as a 'terrorist act.' At an annual press conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orbán insisted that 'there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.' Orbán vowed to 'fight back' against the EU migration policies and alleging without evidence that 'Brussels wants Magdeburg to happen to Hungary, too.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

Government handling of drones a 'catastrophe': Elizondo	(NewsNation) — The public has yet to get answers regarding the mysterious drone sightings reported in eastern states, showing how much the Biden administration 'doesn’t seem to have a handle on things,' a former Pentagon official says. Lue Elizondo, who led Pentagon investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), aka UFOs, told NewsNation the public messaging surrounding the unexplained drones has been a 'catastrophe.' 'I have never seen an administration handle a topic as poorly as this,' he said. 'We're not informing the American people of the truth and this is yet another example of, for whatever reason, this administration doesn't seem to have a handle on things.' Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey and parts of New York since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. New Jersey drones not national security risk: White House The FAA temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey and 30 areas in New York, where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17. The agency has warned that 'deadly force' could be used against the drones if they pose an 'imminent security threat' and that the government is using 'drone busters' to take down unauthorized flyers. Elizondo blasted officials, saying the only two possibilities for the lack of information is that they are either 'lying or they’re incompetent.' 'Either one of those is really a bad place for this administration to be in,' he said. Elizondo believes the incoming Trump administration may do a better job with transparency, saying many key figures tapped by the former president are known to be 'extremely proactive and dedicated to getting to the bottom of what's actually going on.' FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating the drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. Speculation has run rampant, with some expressing concerns the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Authorities say many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. While not identifying the drones as UAPs, Elizondo says the drones fit into what he calls the 'five observables' associated with UAPs. The possibility is there, he said. 'Once people really know the truth, the whole truth, about this topic, and particularly the UAP topic, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of reconciliation.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elizondo-government-drones/	2024-12-21T18:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/snapshot_19458a.jpg?w=900
NJ rep. says it's alarming Feds can't bring down one drone	(NewsNation) — U.S. Rep. Chris Smith says he is 'disturbed' more isn’t being done by federal officials to bring down even one of the mysterious drones flying over that state in order to get answers. Smith, a Republican serving New Jersey's Fourth District, told NewsNation he has been disappointed by the lack of transparency and effort put forth by the Biden administration to quell concerns about who is behind the drone flap. 'Why can't they bring one of these down?' he asked. 'Is our airspace so susceptible and so easily violated that we can't go and say, ‘OK, here they are, let's get at least one and find out...what's the origin?' Smith said many New Jersey residents have been 'alarmed' by the flying objects, and all they want is answers and support to handle the air infestation. New Jersey drones: State senator wants state of emergency Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones in New Jersey and parts of New York since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.

The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating the drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. 'They keep saying it’s not a foreign threat, but they don’t know that,' Smith said, adding that he is highly concerned the drones could be from China or Iran. FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey 'It certainly begs the question, why are we not aggressively looking to determine the source, and they're not doing that,' he said. 'If they are doing it, they are failing in a colossal way.' Speculation has run rampant, with some expressing concerns that the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government. Authorities say many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars. But those are not reassurances, Smith said, adding that he believes the drone activity has been 'ramping up.' He also said the flight restrictions imposed by the FAA lead him to believe all is not well as the government is implying. 'If there's nothing to see here, then why are you taking further action to protect because that's where the sightings are,' Smith said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/new-jersey-feds-drone/	2024-12-21T18:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/07/64a2eaf73e05e1.31816879.jpeg?w=900
Chicago closing last migrant shelter as it moves to 'unified syte...	(NewsNation) — Chicago, Illinois will close its last shelter specifically for migrants later this month as it merges these services with others the city currently offers to homeless people. A migrant shelter at 1310 N. Elston Avenue is set to shut down by Dec. 31, city officials said at a news conference Friday. Besides that shelter, Fox 32 Chicago writes, there are five other shelters in Chicago, two of which are run by the state of Illinois and three that are operated by the city. These will be integrated into Chicago's One System Initiative, meaning these shelters won't only be for migrants, but any homeless individuals in need of housing. What is the Project Blue Beam drone conspiracy theory? Under the new unified shelter system, which will launch in January 2025, will be 3,800 beds added to the 3,000 already existing in the system. On Dec. 20, SPARC, or Shelter Placement and Resource Center, opened. SPARC is a new, 24/7 access point for single adults with 200 temporary beds. About a year ago, there were around 15,000 migrants, some of whom were sent from Texas under a program by Gov. Greg Abbott, who lived in 28 shelters, according to city data compiled by The Chicago Tribune. During this time, over 30,000 measles vaccines and tens of thousands of other vaccines were administered to migrants and 17,000 people were resettled in apartments. At Friday's press briefing, officials said there are currently 2,476 migrants in city shelters, but these numbers will no longer be tracked under the new system. Deputy Mayor for Immigration Beatriz Ponce de León said this information is no longer needed because Chicago is no longer in 'that crisis state.' 'Everyone in the new system will be under will be under the same policy,' she said. 'There’s no need to collect that data.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/chicago-closing-last-migrant-shelter-unified-sytem/	2024-12-21T16:06:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/11/6543b0834ef3e9.01583529.jpeg?w=900
Senate Democrats condemn ethical lapses by Thomas, Supreme Court ...	Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee condemned the Supreme Court for an 'ethical crisis of its own making' in a new report released Saturday. The report follows Democrats’ 20-month investigation into the court’s ethics, spurred by ProPublica reports last year detailing how Justice Clarence Thomas accepted various luxury gifts and trips from a billionaire while on the court. In particular, the majority staff report critiques Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, all prominent conservative justices, claiming they violated their legal obligations by not disclosing gifts or failing to recuse from certain cases. Biden signs bill to avert government shutdown 'Any claim that the Court can adequately police itself is belied by the fact that the Court has not taken meaningful action to address ethical misconduct and no justice has faced consequences for unethical behavior—despite dozens of credible allegations of misconduct by multiple justices over decades,' the report states. 'An enforceable code of conduct for the Supreme Court is essential in light of the Court’s failure to police itself,' it continued. Democrats have pushed the Supreme Court to strengthen its ethics standards for years, but revelations of Thomas’s trips and other ethics controversies sparked renewed interest as public trust in the court plummeted. 'The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,' the report states, critiquing the judiciary’s policymaking body for not taking further corrective action. Thomas has denied wrongdoing and said he was not previously obligated to disclose the trips, provided by billionaire Harlan Crow, under a personal hospitality exception that has since been clarified. Here’s what made the cut in Congress’ 1,500-page government funding deal 'On a personal note, Kathy and I are saddened that our dear friends, Clarence and Ginni Thomas, have been subjected to these baseless smears for the past two year,' Harlan Crow said in a statement. 'They are good and honorable people and no one should be treated this way.' In response to the pressure, the justices ultimately adopted a statement of ethical principles last November. Democrats have criticized it for including no binding enforcement mechanism, as opposed to the code in place for other federal judges. The new report reups Democrats’ calls to pass legislation that would create an enforceable ethics code. Republicans blocked the bill, expressing confidence in the justices to police their own ethics and view Democrats’ investigation as a partisan attempt to tear down the conservative-majority court. Thomas and the other justices did not return a request for comment sent to a court spokesperson. Mark Paoletta, a close friend of Thomas whom President-elect Trump has selected for a senior role in the Office of Management and Budget, called the report 'pathetic' and criticized Democrats for releasing it the Saturday before Christmas. 'When they come back, they will thankfully be in the minority. Good riddance,' Paoletta wrote on X.

Funding saga forecasts future struggles for Speaker Johnson	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) averted a government shutdown, but the days-long rollercoaster as the leaders cycled through multiple plans leaves serious questions about how the Speaker will manage the House GOP under President-elect Trump — and whether he can keep his gavel. The intra-party clashes that were on full display this week will be even more consequential next year as Johnson aims to push through an ambitious legislative agenda in Trump’s first 100 days in office with an even slimmer GOP majority in the House. Republican frustration with Johnson this week boiled over beyond the typically antagonistic hardline conservative wing as he went from unveiling a bipartisan 1,500 bill and then abandoning it due to GOP opposition; to pushing a slimmed-down plan B that included a debt ceiling increase requested by Trump, which failed on the House floor; to finally ushering through the slimmed-down version without a debt ceiling lift. 'There’s zero communication from leadership to the membership. And it’s frustrating. And it’s something that should change before January 3,' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) said as she entered a House GOP conference meeting on Friday. 'We need a clear understanding of how we’re going to do things next session, because what’s happening now is completely unacceptable.' Jan. 3 is the first day of the 119th Congress, where the first order of business for House members will be electing the Speaker. Johnson cannot afford more than one Republican defection on the House floor in the Jan. 3 Speakership election, assuming all members are present and voting. Republicans are set to have 219 Republicans taking the oath of office on Jan. 3, and all 215 Democrats are expected to vote for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) – with Jeffries saying this month that Democrats will not save Johnson from a GOP revolt. One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.), is already publicly pledging to vote against the Speaker on Jan. 3. 'We’re legislating by braille here,' Massie said Friday. 'I think this wasn’t handled well. And then I still have all the grievances from last at the beginning of this year; FISA, Ukraine, all of those things. I think there's going to be a reckoning eventually.' A number of other Republicans who spoke to The Hill this week also withheld their support for Johnson. And Johnson is losing backing from others who previously supported him. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, told The Hill on Wednesday after the initial 1,500-page funding bill was released that he still supported Johnson. But on Friday after the House passed the stripped-down version, Harris said in a statement on X that he was 'undecided on what leadership should look like in the 119th Congress,' citing concerns about unpaid new spending not offset by cuts. Yet even some who were highly critical of Johnson’s handling of the funding deal this week, such as Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.), said they are not ready to force a floor fight over the Speakership. 'We’ll see how it goes … I want a consensus pick,' McCormick said. 'Of course, he's made mistakes. And any quarterback in any Super Bowl, including the MVP, can make mistakes. But you know, nothing's done until it's done.' The situation echoes the sequence of events that led to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) being ousted from the Speakership in October 2023 just days after he pushed through a short-term government funding bill with the help of Democrats. But there are several differences in the dynamics. While former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) claimed that he moved to oust McCarthy over policy gripes, McCarthy maintained that Gaetz had a personal vendetta against him over an ethics investigation. Delaying the election of a Speaker for multiple days, as was the case with McCarthy in 2023, would also clash with Congress’s statutory responsibility to count the electoral votes that certify Trump’s victory on Jan. 6. Johnson has also enjoyed the support of Trump, which helped him get nominated as Speaker in an unanimous internal voice vote in November. The Speaker on Friday night emphasized that he was in 'constant communication' with Trump during the continuing resolution negotiation process — and that he had talked to Elon Musk, who had posted incessantly against Johnson’s original bipartisan deal, within an hour of the stopgap and disaster aid package passing. Musk, in turn, posted on X that Johnson 'did a good job here, given the circumstances.' But some members think Trump could be doing more to signal his support for Johnson. Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) said that 'going multiple rounds, fighting with one another' over the Speakership, as members did with McCarthy over 15 ballots in 2023, would 'delay the work that we have to do to deliver on the America first mandate.' 'I think President-elect Trump can play an enormously constructive role in helping speaker Johnson get there early,' Barr said. Asked after the vote Friday if he is confident that he can keep the Speakership, and if he could win on the first ballot, Johnson said to each question: 'Yes.' Difficulties for Johnson will extend far beyond Jan. 3, though. 'There's going to be a reckoning when Trump figures out that Mike Johnson has constraints on him that were imposed before President Trump won the election,' Massie said, adding that there will be tensions between what Trump wants Johnson to do and what GOP members want him to do. Some of that tension emerged this week, when Trump made a last-minute demand to increase the debt limit as part of a deal to continue government funding. Trump wanted to get the issue out of the way before he takes office in January so Democrats could not use it as leverage, but many Republicans balked at raising the debt limit without significant spending cuts. In an attempt to appease Trump, Republicans struck an agreement to raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion in exchange for $2.5 trillion in net cuts to spending, done through a reconciliation package next year, two sources confirmed to The Hill. That adds a significant layer of complexity to an already-ambitious legislative agenda that Republicans were hoping to push through Congress and onto Trump’s desk without Democratic support. Republicans were already eyeing that party-line reconciliation process to extend tax cuts first passed under Trump’s term and to address border issues. And after some members of the House GOP are confirmed to join the Trump cabinet, Johnson will be able to afford zero defections on party-line measures until GOP replacements are chosen in special elections. 'It’s gonna be a fist fight on every vote,' Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) said. Given the steep challenges, Johnson was asked by a reporter Friday evening if he even wants to keep the job. 'Being Speaker of the House is a challenge in this modern era, but it’s a challenge that we accept,' Johnson responded. 'I wouldn't say it's the most fun job in the world all the time, but it's an important one. A hugely consequential moment for the country.'

Death toll in attack on Christmas market in Germany rises to 5, w...	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Germans on Saturday mourned both the victims and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor intentionally drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers, killing at least five people, including a small child, and injuring at least 200 others. Authorities arrested a 50-year-old man at the site of the attack in Magdeburg on Friday evening and took him into custody for questioning. He has lived in Germany for nearly two decades, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg. officials said. The governor of the surrounding state of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters that the death toll rose from two to five and that more than 200 people in total were injured. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that nearly 40 of them 'are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.' Several German media outlets identified the suspect as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Mourners lit candles and placed flowers outside a church near the market on the cold and gloomy day. Several people stopped and cried. A Berlin church choir whose members witnessed a previous Christmas market attack in 2016 sang Amazing Grace, a hymn about God's mercy, offering their prayers and solidarity with the victims. The man behind the attack There were still no answers Saturday as to what caused him to drive into a crowd in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. Describing himself as a former Muslim, the suspect shared dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he said was the 'Islamism of Europe.' Some described him as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers. Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann said he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile. 'After 25 years in this ‘business’ you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists — that really wasn’t on my radar, ' Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King’s College London, wrote on X. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn’t be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt’s governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' Magdeburg is still shaken The violence shocked Germany and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that’s part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt’s capital. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Chancellor Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser traveled to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening. Faeser ordered flags lowered to half-staff at federal buildings across the country. A recount of the horrifying attack Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers swarmed around the suspect and took him into custody. Thi Linh Chi Nguyen, a 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam whose salon is located in a mall across from the Christmas market, was on the phone during a break when she heard loud bangs and thought at first they were fireworks. She then saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car. Shaking as she described the horror of what she witnessed, she recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at the tram stop where the suspect was arrested. The number of injured people was overwhelming. 'My husband and I helped them for two hours. He ran back home and grabbed as many blankets as he could find because they didn’t have enough to cover the injured people. And it was so cold,' she said. The market itself was still cordoned off Saturday with red-and-white tape and police vans every 50 meters (about 54 yards). Police with machine pistols guarded every entry to the market. Some thermal security blankets still lay on the street. Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the attack on X. ___ Aboubakr reported from Cairo and Gera from Warsaw, Poland.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-germans-mourn-attack-on-christmas-market-with-no-answers-about-why/	2024-12-21T03:27:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6766a67f1a8b28.74242458.jpeg?w=900
House passes bill to avoid government shutdown	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The House voted to support a measure keeping the government funded past Friday night’s deadline, sending the bill to the Senate just hours before a looming shutdown. The chamber voted 366-34-1 in support of the legislation to avoid a shutdown. The Senate is expected to vote on the plan later Friday evening. After weeks of back and forth, Congress was able to come up with a funding bill to keep the government running. This marks the end of tumultuous negotiations on Capitol Hill. More Americans optimistic about coming year: Marist survey Republicans had abandoned a bipartisan plan Wednesday to prevent a shutdown after President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk came out against it. What is the spending bill? The spending bill lays out how to distribute federal money to agencies, departments and programs that keep the government running. Creating this budget has led to many clashes between Republicans and Democrats. What were the two sides arguing about? Trump had tied a demand for dealing with the debt ceiling to the dispute over government funding, saying one should not be addressed without the other. When he rejected the spending proposal on Wednesday, Trump said that he wanted the debt ceiling debate settled before he takes office next month. Warning of trouble ahead for Johnson and Republicans in Congress, Trump told Fox News Digital, 'Anybody that supports a bill that doesn’t take care of the Democrat quicksand known as the debt ceiling should be primaried and disposed of as quickly as possible.' GOP Senator Rand Paul pushes Elon Musk for House Speaker After meeting with his caucus, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries rejected any possibility that his members would bail out Republicans as the shutdown threat loomed. 'GOP extremists want House Democrats to raise the debt ceiling so that House Republicans can lower the amount of your Social Security check,' Jeffries posted Thursday on social media. 'Hard pass.' Jeffries and other Democrats said Republicans should honor the spending agreement that was negotiated before Trump got involved. Which agencies would have been impacted by a shutdown? Each federal agency determines its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, but basically any government operations deemed nonessential stop happening, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees would have seen their work disrupted. Wisconsin lawmakers to set up DOGE-inspired committee called ‘GOAT’ Sometimes workers would have been furloughed, meaning that they kept their jobs but temporarily didn't work until the government reopened. Other federal workers might have stayed on the job but without pay, with the expectation that they would be paid back in full once the government reopened. What was Elon Musk's role? Elon Musk brought to a sudden halt a bipartisan budget proposal by posting constantly on X (formerly Twitter) and threatening Republicans with primary challenges. The social media warnings preceded Trump's condemnation of a measure negotiated by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, which effectively killed the stopgap measure that was designed to prevent a partial shutdown of the federal government.

Live coverage: House to vote at 5 pm on new effort to prevent shu...	The House is poised to vote on a measure to keep the government funded past Friday night's midnight shutdown deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Friday afternoon that the House would vote on a modified version of the bill that was defeated Thursday — minus the debt ceiling provision pushed by President-elect Trump. Democrats and a few dozen Republicans on Thursday rejected the bill that paired a three-month government funding extension, $110 billion in disaster and farm aid and other measures with a two-year extension of the debt limit. Senate Republicans were left fuming over what they called the dysfunctional 's‑‑‑ show' and 'fiasco' they witnessed in the House, as two proposals to fund the government through Christmas failed this week. 'I guess it’s back to the drawing board,' incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told The Hill as he exited the Capitol. These 38 Republicans voted against the Trump-backed spending bill We'll be tracking developments here all day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/live-coverage-house-to-vote-at-5-pm-on-new-effort-to-prevent-shutdown/	2024-12-20T14:31:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/johnsonmike_111224gn11_w.jpg?w=900
Drones over New Jersey: Mystery continues month after first sight...	(NewsNation) — After more than a month of sightings across multiple states, lawmakers and the general public are no closer to finding out what the mysterious drones are spotted in New Jersey and a handful of other states. An unexplained large number of drones began flying over sensitive military sites in New Jersey in mid-November, and while the White House and the Pentagon insist they don't pose a threat, lawmakers are demanding answers. For the second week in a row, NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will examine the enduring mystery of the drones being spotted over New Jersey and other states. Tune in to Coulthart's second special report 'Drones over New Jersey' at 9 p.m. ET on Saturday, Dec. 21. Not sure where to watch NewsNation? Use our ChannelFinder app to locate NewsNation on your TV. And get caught up with what we know so far by watching last week's special report here. Why shooting down mystery drones carries big risks What are lawmakers doing about the drones? On Dec. 12, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with three other U.S. senators, sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Aviation Administration requesting a briefing on the situation. Since sightings of the drones have spread in news outlets and on social media, a slew of elected officials -- local, state and federal -- have been outspoken about what they call a lack of transparency from the government. FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey Last week, a group of New Jersey lawmakers met with state police and DHS, but some were left frustrated about the lack of answers they received. Republican New Jersey state Rep. Brian Bergen told NewsNation that meeting was 'a whole lot of nothing.' 'All they did was tell us they don’t know anything that’s going on,' he said. Where are the drones? Other than New Jersey, they have been spotted in other Northeastern states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Sightings have also been reported in California, Florida, Ohio and Minnesota. NewsNation confirmed House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., received a classified briefing on the drones, and lawmakers on both sides have called for the drones to be intercepted. 'We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,' said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., last week. Eyewitness accounts of New Jersey drones include politicians, journalist FAA bans drones in parts of New Jersey Following the large number of mysterious drone sightings, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said federal security agencies requested the flight restrictions, which are effective through Jan. 17. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the restrictions are out of an 'abundance of caution,' without explaining further.

Can you fly with pot? Here’s what the TSA says	(WJW) – Ohio is one of the most recent states to legalize recreational marijuana. About half the US has legalized recreational marijuana, and more states have legalized marijuana for medical use. So, what does that mean for you when you’re flying to see friends and family for the holidays – or any other time of year? How many local ER visits are blamed on marijuana? Can I travel on a plane with marijuana? The short answer is no. Most cannabis products remain illegal under federal law. Since TSA security is under federal jurisdiction, bringing marijuana through a TSA checkpoint could lead to criminal charges. Here’s the TSA’s official statement on traveling with marijuana – which applies to both carry-on and checked bags. Marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products, including some Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law except for products that contain no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis or that are approved by FDA. (See the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334.) TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law to local, state or federal authorities. TSA’s screening procedures are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers. Accordingly, TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs, but if any illegal substance is discovered during security screening, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer. TSA notes that its employees are not trained for drug screening and that they’re looking for security threats, not drugs. Will marijuana eventually be allowed? The rules will likely change if marijuana is reclassified. Marijuana is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Yes, marijuana can cause psychosis In the spring, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration proposed to shift marijuana from a Schedule I drug, which includes heroin and LSD, to a less tightly regulated 'Schedule III' drug, which includes ketamine and some anabolic steroids. Federal rules allow for some medical uses of Schedule III drugs. The proposed change faces a lengthy regulatory process, and there’s no timeline for the change as of now.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/can-you-fly-with-pot-heres-what-the-tsa-says/	2024-12-20T12:05:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2161792208.jpg?w=683

Would the US Postal Service stop during a shutdown?	(NewsNation) — A government shutdown will not affect the mail, meaning even if Congress does not pass a funding plan, holiday gifts still out for delivery should arrive. Congress has until midnight Saturday to avoid a government shutdown. If it misses the deadline, several agencies would not have the funds to continue operating, meaning some services would be delayed or stopped and federal workers would be furloughed or work without pay. What services are impacted when the government shuts down? However, the USPS is funded through the sale of its products and services, not by tax dollars, meaning it will stay operational if Congress fails to avert a shutdown. 'U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,' according to a 2023 post on the government agency’s website. Services that would be impacted by a shutdown National parks Facilities that require staffing would close but visitors could still access some memorials and open-air parks where staffing isn’t required. Federal courts Federal courts usually have enough money on hand from court filings and other fees to stay open for several weeks during shutdowns. After that, they curtail services. Federal prisons stay open. Veterans Veterans Administration hospitals stay open and benefit checks are issued during a shutdown, but new benefit applications and pending claims aren’t processed. Active duty military During a shutdown, military personnel would continue to work, but they don’t get paid until Congress provides funding. Some civilian military employees are furloughed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/would-post-offices-close-during-shutdown/	2024-12-20T07:58:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP20231702729442-e1730217747717.jpg?w=800
Richard Allen sentenced to 130 years for Delphi murders	(NewsNation) — Richard Allen, who was convicted of killing two Indiana girls in the 2017 Delphi murders, was sentenced to 130 in prison during a sentencing hearing held on Friday. The sentencing range for Allen was 45 years to 130 years in prison. He was given 65 years for counts three and four, to be served consecutively, for a total of 130 years. Counts one and two were vacated because of double jeopardy. Allen was convicted on Nov. 11 in the killings of Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14. A jury found him guilty of two counts of murder and two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping. Delphi killings: Timeline of events in Richard Allen case When he was arrested in October 2022, more than five years after the February 2017 killings, Allen was employed as a pharmacy technician just blocks from the county courthouse where he later stood trial. The trial came after repeated delays, a leak of evidence, the withdrawal of his public defenders and their reinstatement by the Indiana Supreme Court. Allen’s defense team has said that they would not participate in Friday’s sentencing hearing as they prepare to appeal Allen’s conviction. He has continued to maintain his innocence throughout the legal process.

What services are impacted when the government shuts down?	(NewsNation) — Federal lawmakers have until midnight Friday to pass a budget, or else the government will shut down, impacting millions of employees and consumers ahead of the holiday. Without a funding plan, the shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 21 and last until Congress passes a spending bill. Here are the government services and agencies that would be affected if the government shuts down. What does a government shut down impact? Federal employees, including military members, would not be paid. Non-essential agencies would stop service, while essential workers, such as police officers and air traffic controllers, would still report for duty. Citizens who don't work for the government may be impacted as well if certain agencies are closed or understaffed. Johnson says plan C reached to avert shutdown, vote expected Air Travel: The Transportation Security Administration is considered essential, so employees would be working without pay. Still, delays and interruptions could happen. Social Security: Payments for current recipients would continue because Social Security is deemed essential, but services for new claims could be delayed due to furloughed staff. Medicare and Medicaid: Current recipients would continue to receive benefits, but new applicants could see delays. Mail Service: The United States Postal Service would continue operations and remain open. Student Loans: Student loan services would continue to process payments, and payments will still be due. Speaking with an agent or getting help may come with delays, however. Government employee pay: Furloughed federal employees would receive back pay when a shut down ends, but government contractors will not. Passport Services: The processing of passport applications may be slowed or halted. FEMA cleanup and protection: The agency will still respond to emergencies in the event of a disaster, but long-term projects would be delayed. National Parks and Museums: Many national parks and federally funded museums would likely close or have limited operating hours. Food Assistance Programs: People who receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would continue to payments, but new enrollment or renewals could face delays.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/government-shutdown-impacted-agencies-and-services/	2024-12-20T06:17:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2184674649.jpg?w=900
Amazon drivers strike at multiple hubs over pay, conditions	SKOKIE, Ill. (NewsNation) — More Amazon warehouse workers are set to join the picket lines on Friday, as thousands of workers affiliated with the Teamsters union continue their strike, demanding higher wages and improved safety conditions just days before Christmas. Delivery drivers went on strike Thursday at seven major hubs across the United States, fighting for better pay and safer working conditions. The NYPD reported two arrests during a strike in the New York City borough of Queens but didn't specify why. The timing is strategic, as Amazon relies heavily on drivers during the holidays, and delays in deliveries could Amazon says the workers represent a small fraction of their workforce and expect holiday shipments to be delivered on time. Travel tracker: What you should know as you prepare for holiday travel Why are workers striking? The Teamsters said the workers, who voted to authorize strikes in recent days, joined picket lines on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. Drivers argue they should get paid the same as United Postal Service workers or UPS drivers. Amazon announced plans to raise wages for its subcontracted drivers to $22 an hour following union pressure. However, Teamsters members driving for UPS earn an average of $49 an hour. 'I'm gonna get paid this Friday, and more than half my check is going to go towards paying bills, paying insurance, and then my benefits that get taken out. More than half my check is about just benefits alone,' an Amazon worker told NewsNation. 'We should be getting fair pay, especially with the cost of living in California.' Where are the strikes happening? Amazon employs a few hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters union has primarily focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors handling Amazon's deliveries. However, Amazon has rejected calls to negotiate, since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees. Teamsters also say the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers, totaling about 10,000 Amazon workers nationwide — a small portion of Amazon's 1.5 million employees. The union hasn't disclosed the number of workers participating in the strike or how long it will last. But it included Amazon-employed warehouse workers in San Francisco and subcontracted delivery drivers in cities like Chicago, New York City, Atlanta, and other parts of California. Will Amazon strike affect your holiday packages? How has Amazon responded? Amazon says the strike will not affect customers receiving their packages on time and argues the drivers are not its employees. The company also says these actions are protests, not strikes since no Amazon employee or third-party driver pays Teamsters union dues. 'They've worked hard over the last several weeks to drum up a lot of attention and also to try to convince employees and third-party drivers to join them out there on their protest lines. They weren't successful so they brought in a bunch of outsiders to harass our employees and to make it difficult for them to get in and out of our facilities,' said Kelly Nantel, Amazon's director of Global Media Relations.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/amazon-drivers-strike-multiple-hubs-over-pay-conditions/	2024-12-20T05:21:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2190075792.jpg?w=900
Johnson says plan C reached to avert shutdown, vote expected	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Republicans have arrived at a plan C to avert a shutdown and the House will vote Friday morning on the legislation. 'Yeah, yeah, we have a plan,' Johnson said Friday morning as he entered the Capitol. 'We're expecting votes this morning, so you all stay tuned. We've got a plan.' He did not say what it entails. Lawmakers have little time to avoid a shutdown: Government funding runs out when the clock strikes midnight late Friday. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) said on CNBC on shortly after Johnson’s comments Friday morning that he thinks Washington will probably avoid a shutdown since 'we’re pushed up against Christmas here,' alluding to the likely path forward without directly confirming it, saying that will be up to the Speaker’s office to announce it. 'There’s a chance today a clean CR [continuing resolution], short term clean CR, it may be for two, three weeks,' Mullin said. 'That was something that was discussed, you know, late last night, you know, even some discussions this morning. I’m not going to say that’s going to happen, but you know, that’s really the option that’s on the table.' If Johnson does move forward with a clean, short-term stopgap, it is unclear if that will muster enough votes to clear the House. A handful of Republicans have historically opposed continuing resolutions, and Democrats have evaluated the Speaker’s proposals on a case-by-case basis, two factors that are fueling the chances of a shutdown so close to the deadline. It's also unclear if Johnson’s plan will appease President-Trump and his demand to raise the debt ceiling as part of the CR. Friday’s vote will be the latest effort by the House to fund the government ahead of the partial shutdown deadline. And it will come hours after the House on Thursday voted down Johnson’s plan B bill that combined a three-month government funding extension with $110 billion in disaster and farm aid, some other policy measures, and a two-year suspension of the debt limit — the latter of which was a last-minute demand by Trump. The failed vote marked a blow for Johnson and Trump, who endorsed the package, urged lawmakers to support it and threatened primary challengers for anyone who opposed it. Aside from the debt limit increase, the plan B proposal was a stripped-down version of an initial funding deal that Johnson negotiated with Democrats and revealed earlier in the week. That initial bill included measures like a health care deal and an increase in pay for members of Congress that ballooned the bill to over 1,500 pages, prompting outrage from Republicans, Trump, and Elon Musk helped kill the package. Members on Thursday night were unsure how they would solve the funding impasse after the plan B failed. They will have to not only get a bill that can appease Trump and pass in the narrow House GOP majority, but get approval from the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House. Johnson's comments Friday morning came moments before he was scheduled to huddle in his office with members of the far-right Freedom Caucus and at least two figures in the incoming Trump administration: JD Vance, the vice president-elect, and Russell Vought, who served as head of the White House budget office in Trump's first term. A long list of conservative House Freedom Caucus members trickled into the room after Johnson's arrival, including Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Andy Harris (R-Md.), the chairman of the group. None of them commented. 'It's gonna be beautiful,' said GOP Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.). House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) also arrived at Johnson’s office early Friday morning. Trump’s last-minute demand to address the debt limit has drastically complicated the government funding process. It emerged as one of the main sticking points in negotiations, which is drawing opposition from Democrats and Republicans. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) wrote on social media Thursday that increasing the borrowing limit at this juncture was a 'hard pass,' in-part prompting most of the caucus to oppose the proposal that hit the floor that day. On the other side of the aisle, conservative Republicans have criticized raising the debt ceiling without cutting spending. 'New bill: $110BB in deficit spending (unpaid for), $4 TRILLION+ debt ceiling increase with $0 in structural reforms for cuts. Time to read the bill: 1.5 hours. I will vote no,' Roy wrote on X. Congress is not expected to have to deal with increasing the debt until summer 2025.
