Ruben Gallego projected to win Arizona US Senate seat	(NewsNation) — NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has called the race for the U.S. Senate seat for Arizona in favor of Ruben Gallego. See all Arizona race results here. The race between U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Republican Kari Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for Arizona governor two years ago, was one of the closest watched Senate races this election cycle. The battle to replace outgoing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who decided not to seek reelection, has been a critical race for Democrats to maintain their razor-thin majority in the U.S. Senate. Arizona has also been a battleground state that is critical for Democrats to win in order to stay in the White House. Gallego, a Marine combat veteran once serving in the Iraqi invasion, received endorsements from dozens of Republicans, including former aides to the late Republican Sen. John McCain, who was also a veteran. He was also endorsed by the Arizona Police Association, a blow to Lake who’d been backed by the group in 2022. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Lake, a former news anchor, has been a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, vehemently repeating his unfounded claims that he won the 2020 election. Her support was reciprocated with endorsements from the former president in both 2022 and 2024. 'If you want to get to President Trump, you have to get through me,' her Senate campaign website reads. Lake narrowly lost her 2022 gubernatorial bid to then-Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs but refused to accept the results, falsely blaming election fraud and voter disenfranchisement. Gallego’s campaign centered around raising the federal minimum wage, reinstating abortion rights and improving veterans' rights. The son of a single, immigrant mother, Gallego has voted for funding to hire and deploy thousands more Border Patrol agents and says he supports border security. Lake’s campaign also focused on increased border security, along with making America energy-dominant, reducing inflation and returning abortion policy decision-making to the states.

Watch live results from the presidential election, important swing states and the balance of power in Congress. NewsNation will also be tracking your local state elections and impactful ballot initiatives around the country. As of late September, Gallego held a 3-1 fundraising advantage and a double-digit polling advantage over Lake. This was one of eight open Senate races where the incumbent did not run for re-election. A total of 34 Senate seats are up in 2024 with 23 being held by Democrats and independents. Republicans can retake control of the upper chamber of Congress by stealing two seats from Democrats or by winning the 2024 presidential election and stealing just one other seat. As a result, the outcome of this race will affect the balance of power within the Senate in 2025.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/arizona-senate-results-lake-gallego/	2024-11-09T18:04:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Thumb-Arizona-Ruben-Gallego.jpg?w=900
Qatar suspends its mediation efforts on Gaza and the Hamas office...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Qatar has suspended its key mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel, it said Saturday, after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal for Gaza. It wasn't immediately clear whether the remaining Hamas leadership hosted by Qatar must leave, or where it would go. Hamas has good relations with Iran and Turkey, and some of its leaders are now in Lebanon. However, Qatar is highly likely to return to mediation efforts if both sides show 'serious political willingness' to reach a deal, according to an official with Egypt, the other key mediator. Qatar told Israel and Hamas it can't continue to mediate 'as long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith' and 'as a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose' in Qatar, a diplomatic source briefed on the matter said. Qatar told Hamas it will have to leave if it isn't ready to engage in serious negotiations, the source said. In Washington, a U.S. official said the Biden administration informed Qatar two weeks ago that the Hamas office's continued operation in Doha was no longer useful and the Hamas delegation should be expelled. A senior U.S. official said that after Hamas rejected the last proposal for a cease-fire, Qatar accepted the advice and informed the Hamas delegation of the decision 10 days ago. A senior Hamas official said they were aware of Qatar’s decision to suspend mediation efforts, 'but no one told us to leave.' Hamas has repeatedly called for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as a condition for any cease-fire deal. Israel seeks the return of all hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and insists on a presence in Gaza. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Israeli prime minister’s office had no comment. Late Saturday, the state-run Qatar News Agency published comments attributed to Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, confirming that Doha informed parties in the talks 10 days ago that it 'would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round.' 'Qatar will resume those efforts with its partners when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians,' the report said. There continued to be no end in sight to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon, where Israel’s military said it struck command centers and other militant infrastructure in Beirut’s southern suburbs and elsewhere. An Israeli airstrike on the southern port city of Tyre late Friday killed at least seven, officials and a resident said. Hezbollah 'should continue (the fight) and we will continue to back them up even if we lose our families, our homes, and end up in the dirt,' said one Beirut resident, Mohammed Mekdad, as people searched the smoking rubble. In Gaza, Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said, while Israel announced the first delivery of humanitarian aid in weeks to the territory's hungry, devastated north. One strike hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City’s eastern Tufah neighborhood, killing at least six people, the territory's Health Ministry said. Two local journalists, a pregnant woman and a child were among the dead, it said. Israel's army said the strike targeted a militant belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, offering no evidence. Another Israeli strike killed seven people, including two women and a child in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Israel's army didn't respond to a request for comment. And an Israeli strike hit tents in the courtyard of central Gaza’s main hospital, killing at least three people and wounding a local journalist, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said. It was the eighth Israeli attack on the compound since March. Israel says aid trucks reach northern Gaza The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said 11 aid trucks containing food, water and medical equipment reached the enclave's far north on Thursday. It's the first time any aid has reached there since Israel began a new military campaign last month. But not all the aid reached the agreed drop-off points, according to the the U.N. World Food Program. In the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, Israeli troops stopped one convoy bound for nearby Beit Lahiya and ordered the supplies to be offloaded, WFP spokesperson Alia Zaki said. Israel’s offensive has focused on Jabaliya, where Israel says Hamas had regrouped. Other areas affected include Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun just north of Gaza City. U.S. deadline is looming for Israel The aid announcement came days before a U.S. deadline demanding that Israel improve aid deliveries across Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, issued Thursday said there's a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza, the territory's most isolated area. COGAT rejected those findings and said the report relied 'on partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.' No emergency services functioning north of Gaza City The U.N. estimates that tens of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza. Earlier this week, the Health Ministry said there were no ambulances or emergency crews operating north of Gaza City. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to U.N. figures. More than a year of war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They don't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. 'It has been 400 days and the hostages are still in Gaza. There is a war without a direction. It’s so sad,' said Eial Tiskim, who attended the latest protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand a cease-fire deal. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Lee from Washington.

Trump names inaugural committee co-chair, rules out Haley and Pom...	Former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler will co-chair President-elect Trump’s inaugural committee alongside Steve Witkoff, Trump's campaign announced Saturday. The Republican leader said the committee will 'honor' his victory in the 2024 election. 'The Trump Vance Inaugural Committee will honor this magnificent victory in a celebration of the American People and our nation,' Trump said in a statement. 'This will be the kick-off to my administration, which will deliver on bold promises to Make America Great Again,' he added. 'Together, we will celebrate this moment, steeped on history and tradition, and then get to work to achieve the most incredible future for our people, restoring strength, success, and common sense to the Oval Office.' Trump resistance rises in states led by Democratic governors Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in 2019 by Gov. Brian Kemp (R) due to a resignation from former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). While in office, she was a staunch supporter of Trump and supported a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 election results but spoke out against the measure after the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The selections come after Trump tapped longtime senior advisor Susie Wilkes to serve as chief of staff. She will be the first woman in history hold the position. A guide to key figures in Donald Trump’s orbit On Truth Social, the incoming president also mentioned two people who won't be joining his administration: former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' the president-elect said in the Saturday post. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,' he continued. 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' While campaigning, Trump's opponents alleged he did not like to be 'challenged by women' and Trump received flack for telling people he’d protect the demographic whether they 'like it or not.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-names-inaugural-committee-co-chair-rules-out-haley-and-pompeo/	2024-11-09T16:59:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP21005187029238-e1694210693733.jpg?w=900
Jury convicts two men accused of plotting to kill Border Patrol a...	(NewsNation) — A jury in Missouri has convicted two men on a long list of charges stemming from their alleged conspiracy to murder U.S. Border Patrol agents, and for shooting at FBI agents when the two men were captured. The federal court jury in Jefferson City, Mo., on Thursday found Jonathan S. O’Dell, of Warsaw, Mo., and Bryan C. Perry, of Clarksville, Tenn., guilty in connection with what prosecutors said was a plan to recruit members to their group called the '2nd Amendment Militia' in 2022. American woman, 3 migrants charged with running Texas migrant stash house 'Perry posted a video on TikTok in which he discussed illegal immigrants coming into the United States from Mexico,' said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri. 'Perry stated that the U.S. Border Patrol was committing treason by allowing these illegal immigrants to enter the United States, and that the penalty for treason was death,' the statement added. In later posts, Perry said he was 'ready to go to war against this government,' and that 'we were going out huntin’'. On Oct. 7, 2022, the day before the men said they were going to travel to the border, FBI agents raided O’Dell’s home. After an exchange of gunfire, O’Dell and his girlfriend surrendered, but Perry aborted his apparent surrender and fought with agents who eventually subdued him. El Paso Sector sees people trying to cross border before Trump win Between their capture and their trial, O’Dell escaped from a county jail and was on the run for three days before being recaptured in Ray County, Mo. According to the U.S. Attorney’s statement, both Perry and O’Dell face mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum sentence would be life without parole. There is no word yet on when the two will be sentenced.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/militia-convicted-border-patrol-agents/	2024-11-09T14:39:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-57610138.jpg?w=822
FEMA employee fired for directing team to avoid homes with Trump ...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A FEMA employee was terminated over the weekend after reportedly advising her survivor assistance team not to go to Florida homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Donald Trump. In a statement sent out Saturday afternoon, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell confirmed that the employee had been fired, adding that her actions were 'reprehensible.' Judge agrees to pause Jan. 6 case after Trump’s election win 'This is a clear violation of FEMA's core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,' Criswell said. According to FEMA, the matter was referred to the Office of Special Counsel, and officials have been working to ensure similar acts do not happen again. The agency did not specify which neighborhoods in Florida were being canvassed by the employee's team. However, the incident comes as relief workers have been aiding those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in several parts of the state. 'I want to be clear to all of my employees and the American people, this type of behavior and action will not be tolerated at FEMA, and we will hold people accountable if they violate these standards of conduct,' Criswell added in her statement. Hurricanes, storms cost US $500 billion this year: Analysis FEMA did not provide any additional details on how officials were notified of the employee's actions, nor the exact circumstances surrounding the incident. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took to social media to comment following initial reports of the alleged misconduct. In a post on X, DeSantis said he had directed state officials to investigate the matter further. 'The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,' the governor wrote. 'At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government’s targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/fema-employee-fired-trump-sign/	2024-11-09T13:31:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/YardSignsHarrisTrumpGettyImages-2174737008-e1730401432832_4af2cd.jpg?w=800
Diddy files for bail for 4th time, judge rejects gag order reques...	(NewsNation) — The last 24 hours for Sean 'Diddy' Combs has been a period of denial, developments and details. Diddy's lawyers filed a fourth request for bail in a Manhattan federal court Friday, citing new evidence in his case on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Also on Friday, a judge rejected his 'unprecedented' gag order request, filed last month, that would bar victims and their lawyers from speaking publicly about the case. The rapper's attorneys claimed 'inflammatory extrajudicial statements' were impeding his right to a fair trial. But Judge Arun Subramanian contended implementing a gag order would violate the victims' free speech under the First Amendment. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits: Timeline 'The unprecedented relief that Combs seeks on this motion is unwarranted,' the judge wrote in his ruling. One of the alleged victims' lawyers, Ariel Mitchell, has been granting interviews to NewsNation for several months, revealing shocking details about what happened to her client. Mitchell told NewsNation's 'Banfield' Thursday that her client, Courtney Burgess, was given 11 flash drives containing at least eight sex tapes involving eight celebrities. Diddy’s team 'is pissed, to say the least,' she said. Diddy’s lawyer: ‘Improper pretrial publicity’ preventing fair trial In September, Mitchell told NewsNation that another client of hers was contacted about the sale of one of the musician's alleged sex tapes. 'I can tell the video was pornographic. This was in his Atlanta home, and it does seem like the person isn’t looking into the video,' Mitchell said. To me, it doesn’t seem like that person knows they’re being videotaped.' 'These prospective witnesses and their lawyers have made numerous inflammatory extrajudicial statements aimed at assassinating Mr. Combs’s character in the press,' said Diddy's attorney Marc Agnifilo in the Oct. 20 motion. His lawyers have persistently requested the release of their client since his September arrest, proposing a $50 million bail package on four occasions. The previous three requests were denied. Diddy’s team ‘pissed’ about flash drive video claims: Lawyer In their fourth request, the proposed bail package updated its conditions, suggesting Diddy undergo 'strict 24/7 security monitoring' and 'near-total restrictions on Mr. Combs’ ability to contact individuals other than counsel' during at-home detention. This 'will reasonably assure the appearance of [Mr. Combs] as required and the safety of any other person and the community,' the motion said. It also calls the government's case 'thin.' The defense claims to have received 23.5 terabytes of new material that was unknown at the time of previous hearings. 'The new material demonstrates that the government previously misrepresented the weight of the evidence. And it undermines the government’s claim that Mr. Combs presents a danger,' the motion said. Diddy's trial is set for May 5. He remains incarcerated at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/diddy-bail-judge-gag-order-request/	2024-11-09T10:03:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/la-me-ln-sean-diddy-combs-arrested-at-ucla-201-001.jpg?w=750

US will appeal judge's ruling that 9/11 defendants can plead guil...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department will appeal a military judge's ruling that plea agreements struck by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and two of his co-defendants are valid, a defense official said Saturday. The ruling this past week voided Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's order to throw out the deals and concluded that the plea agreements were valid. The judge granted the three motions to enter guilty pleas and said he would schedule them for a future date to be determined by the military commission. The department will also seek a postponement of any hearing on the pleas, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss legal matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rear Adm. Aaron Rugh, the chief prosecutor, sent a letter Friday to the families of 9/11 victims informing them of the decision. The ruling by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, allowed the three 9/11 defendants to enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and would spare them the risk of the death penalty. The pleas by Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi would be a key step toward closing out the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense lawyers under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo had approved the agreements. But the deals were immediately slammed by Republican lawmakers and others when they were made public this summer. Within days, Austin issued an order saying he was nullifying them. He said plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary. The judge had ruled that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals. The agreements, and Austin’s attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants, given their torture in CIA custody. While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it is not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals. The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin’s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by 'clean teams' of FBI agents that did not involve violence.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-us-will-appeal-judges-ruling-that-9-11-defendants-can-plead-guilty-and-avoid-the-death-penalty/	2024-11-09T09:43:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672fa00ce1a564.94459298.jpeg?w=900
Biden, Trump to meet Wednesday at Oval Office: White House	(NewsNation)— Since Election Day, President-elect Donald Trump's phone has been ringing, and one of those calls was from President Joe Biden: an invitation to the Oval Office.

What a Trump administration could mean for education	(NewsNation) — 'Save American education' is one of President-elect Donald Trump's pillars to his approach in reforming the American school system. What does that look like? From changing Title IX to eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, Trump's proposed policies will affect the future of curriculum in public schools. Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here’s what he’s proposed Trump's main education policies In the early stages of the presidential race, Trump laid out 10 principles for his education policy plan. 'Rather than indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material, which is what we're doing now, our schools must be totally refocused to prepare our children to succeed in the world of work,' President Trump said in September 2023 address. He pledged to eliminate the Department of Education and to return school choice to the states. He vowed to 'restore' parental rights, meaning parents would know what their children are taught in the classroom, be able to openly communicate concerns with teachers and principals, protect children's privacy, be updated on acts of violence at schol, allow them to inspct professional development materials and be notified before an out-of-school guset speaks in class. They would also be able to review the budget and spending of the school, have the right to opt out of school healthcare services and be immediately notified if a teacher has 'worekd to change their children's name, pronouns or understanding of his or her gender.' Some of the proposed policies are already in place; parents can often have meetings with school staff, federal laws protect the privacy of children and schools notify parents through various channels of communication about violence or other concerning events that may occur. Trump also supports the election of principals by parents and will adjust increase or decrease funding to schools based on their policies. The future of the Department of Education Trump has voiced his desire to abolish the Department of Education since his first term in office. Under new proposed policies for his second term, Trump said he would remove 'the radicals who have infiltrated the federal Department of Education, and get to Congress reaffirm the president’s ability to remove recalcitrant employees from the job.' He also promised to cut federal funding for any school or program that pushes 'Critical Race Theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.' Critical race theory is defined as an academic field focused on the relationships between social conceptions of race and ethnicity, social and political laws and media. Trump said he would direct the DOE to open civil rights investigations into school districts engaging in 'race-based discrimination, including discrimination against Asian Americans.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security What will happen to Title IX? Keeping men out of women sports has been a pillar to Trump's and other Republicans' education policies. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funding. Transgender athletes are in jeopardy of being able to play in sports that are in line with their gender identity. For example, a transgender girl who wants to play on a girl's softball team would be required to play boys' baseball under Trump's policies, which violates Title IX under its current directions. Will student loans be forgiven under Trump? Student loan forgiveness was not a focus of the Trump campaign, unlike Biden's promise to cancel student loan repayment during his run for president. Trump largely has not addressed this topic, but some of his other policies, such as aboloshing the DOE, may impact student loans. What will Trump do on immigration, foreign policy? Trump's policies at a glance In summary, these are Trump's main education policies: Eliminate the Department of Education Cut federal funding for schools that promote critical race theory Bar transgender girls from playing in sports designated for boys Adjust funding for schools based on their policies 'Drastically' cut the number of school administrators including Diversity, Equity and Inclusion departments Adopt a 'Parental Bill of Rights' Implement a voting process to elect principals Allow parents to choose which public school their children attends Create a credentialing body to certify teachers Enhance discipline for students engaged in drug involvement Support concealed carry of weapons by teachers Protect the right to pray in schools Reinstate the 1776 Commission, which would adjust the history curriculum in schools	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-administration-education-policy/	2024-11-09T08:43:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24081507390710-e1719339224991.jpg?w=800
Your paycheck may be larger in 2025, even if you don't get a rais...	(NEXSTAR) — While there's plenty of time left in November, you may already have something exciting to look forward to in 2025: a slightly larger paycheck, even without a raise. Why? Thank the IRS. As it does every year, the agency recently announced roughly five dozen changes to various tax provisions that will impact 2025 (and when we file taxes in 2026). Among the notable changes were standard deductions rising by 2.7% and individual tax brackets shifting. Will you have a three-payday November? How to tell Like others before it, the IRS's changes are meant to combat inflation. They are, however, smaller than we saw in 2024 and much smaller than in 2023. Those changes may have an impact on your paycheck, putting more money in your pocket — unless you got a raise of more than 2.7%, then that will also give you a boost. IRS tax provision updates can help cut back on 'bracket creep,' which occurs when inflation moves you into a higher income tax bracket or reduces how beneficial credits, deductions, and exemptions are, according to the Tax Foundation. Say, for example, you are making $101,000 this year. You fall into the third tax bracket, meaning you're taxed 10% on the first $11,600 you earn; 12% on the chunk between $11,601 and $47,149; then 22% on what you earn between $47,150 and $100,524; and 24% on every dollar above that. IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? If you don't get a raise going into 2025, and remain at $101,000, you would not reach the 24% tax bracket. Instead, you would be taxed 10% on the first $11,925 you earn; 12% on the income between that threshold and $48,475; then 22% on the rest. (This is a simple example that did not take into account the standard deduction and other tax-related aspects.) If the brackets did not adjust, you would be stuck with a higher tax liability, despite your $101,000 salary having less buying power in 2025 because of inflation, the Tax Foundation explains. But, because the tax brackets are adjusting, you stand a chance of seeing less money withheld from your paycheck for federal taxes (your employer is able to calculate how much is withheld using your W2 and IRS documents). Gen Z is thriving financially in these US cities, new report says Even though your paycheck may grow in 2025, financial experts say it's important to remember you aren't exactly receiving 'extra' funds — they are intended to offset inflation. Inflation is down slightly in 2024 to 2.4%, U.S. Labor Department data from the previous 12 months, ending in September, shows. That's an improvement over 2023's 3.4% and 6.5% in 2022.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/your-paycheck-may-be-larger-in-2025-even-if-you-dont-get-a-raise/	2024-11-09T08:15:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1164644813-e1704995059280.jpg?w=800
Hurricanes, storms cost US $500 billion this year: Analysis	(The Hill) - Hurricanes and tropical storms have caused economic losses of nearly $500 billion as they have ravaged the country this year, according to analysis by AccuWeather. Experts estimated that the economic loss and damage from Hurricane Beryl, which hit the Gulf Coast in July, was between $28 billion to 32 billion. Hurricane Debby, which hit the Carolinas hardest a month later, imposed some $28 billion in damages, while Hurricane Francine cost about $9 billion. But the biggest economic trauma was delivered by hurricanes Helene and Milton, which swept through the South in late September in October, according to the AccuWeather experts. Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of North Carolina, was estimated to have inflicted between $225 billion to $250 billion in total damage and economic loss — flooding homes, destroying roads, ripping up trees and leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power, in some cases for weeks. To assist the state’s population, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dished out more than $194 million to individuals and households in the Tar Heel State, according to the agency’s data released late last month. Hurricane Milton, which ripped through Florida in early October, has caused between $160 billion and $180 billion in economic loss and total damage so far, according to the analysis. The storm intensified quickly, tearing through communities, destroying homes and filling the streets with mud as more than 3 million people were without power at one point. 'Our hearts go out to everyone impacted this hurricane season. This has been an incredibly costly and destructive hurricane season,' said AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter. But he noted the pain is far from over. 'It will take years for many of these communities, families and small businesses to recover. It could take a decade or longer to recover in some of the towns hit hardest by Helene,' he said. 'Some communities may never fully recover from the catastrophic inland flash flooding we witnessed this year.' The analysis comes as job growth in the month of October stalled at 12,000, according to data released by the Labor Department earlier this month. Some large strikes impacted the figure, but impacts from hurricanes Helene and Milton also played a role as forecasters had projected that the country would add around 115,000 jobs. 'The business and tourism losses are adding up quickly. Our estimates also consider the long-term healthcare costs,' Porter said. 'Hurricanes can take a tremendous toll on the health and well-being of people who survived these storms and were exposed to hazardous flood waters, toxic mud and dust, as well as mold and mildew inside damaged homes and apartments.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/climate/hurricanes-storms-cost-us-500-billion-this-year-analysis/	2024-11-09T05:55:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24287115642437-e1731096285758.jpg?w=900
Democrats' election reckoning pits liberals against centrists	The Democrats’ shellacking at the polls this week has triggered a feisty battle between the ideological wings of the party about what went wrong — and who bears the blame. Some liberals say the party didn’t tack far enough to the left to animate the base. Many centrists say it tacked too far to the left and scared away moderate voters in key battleground states. And Democratic leaders are now faced with the difficulty of working to ease the tensions and ally the feuding factions in order to form a unified front against President-elect Trump as he prepares to enter the White House for his second term. 'It will be a big challenge,' said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), former chair of the House Democratic Caucus. The debate is hardly new. Democrats have repeatedly clashed over the party’s strategy after tough election cycles, and the battle lines are the same now as then, pitting liberals vs. moderates. But this year the stakes were higher. Heading into the polls this week, Democrats had warned that Trump was an existential threat to the nation’s democratic foundations, and their fight to keep him from regaining power was was framed as nothing less than an effort to rescue the republic and the institutions that sustain it. Following Trump’s runaway victory over Vice President Harris on Tuesday, the internal dispute over the party’s strategy, message and direction has taken on a new level of urgency and intensity. For some, the party’s woes revolve around mis-messaging on kitchen-table economic issues, like inflation, wages and the accelerating trend of wealth inequality. For others, the trouble stems from the explosive debate over the Israel-Hamas war. For still others, the problems relate to culture war battles, including that over transgender rights. Whatever the issue, Tuesday’s election results — and the subsequent reckoning that’s shaking the Democrats — is sure to consume all the oxygen in the party for some time to come as leaders, lawmakers, donors and strategists sift through the ashes in search of answers for why so many voters left them for Trump this year. The early stages of that process are spilling into public view. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a liberal icon who has built a career around issues of economic justice, made waves this week when he said there was 'no great surprise' that working class voters had fled the Democrats because the party establishment had 'abandoned' them in favor of moneyed interests. 'The American people are angry and want change. And they’re right,' he said. Moderates countered that it was, in fact, the progressive movement that had doomed Harris and the Democrats on Election Day. Many of them singled out the issue of transgender rights as the culprit — an issue the Trump campaign had put under a bright spotlight with tens of millions of dollars in spending on late-campaign, anti-trans ads. Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who won by 2 points this week in a battleground Long Island district, told The New York Times that the Democrats are struggling because they are 'pandering to the far left.' 'I don’t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don’t think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports,' he said. Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) told CNN's Kasie Hunt that 'there are folks on the far left who alienate a ton of people,' pointing to the transgender debate as an example. And Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) echoed those warnings, telling the Times that Democrats are too concerned about offending the transgender community at the expense of addressing 'the challenges many Americans face.' 'I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,' Moulton told the Times. The comments sparked some pushback from other Democrats on Capitol Hill, who accused the culture war critics of scapegoating. 'The Democratic Party needs to do some serious introspection to understand what went wrong and why our message isn’t resonating or reaching people,' Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) posted on social platform X. 'But one thing’s for sure — blaming trans kids isn’t the answer.' Other lawmakers noted that virtually no Democrats had focused their campaigns on the transgender issue this cycle. It was Republicans, they said, who exaggerated the Democrats’ support for trans rights in order to sow division and win votes. 'That's the problem. The Republicans created this strawman and then beat the shit out of it,' a Democratic lawmaker said. 'I just don't think any Democrats I know were out there rooting for biological boys to compete with biological girls in high school sports. This is just not something that we were talking about or prioritizing. But to hear Republicans, that was like our whole agenda. 'Trump, literally, was telling people that your child is going to come home from school one day with a gender reassignment.' Democrats are hardly the only party facing internal divisions. Since House Republicans took control of the lower chamber last year, their time in power has been practically defined by clashes between far-right conservatives, many of them in the Freedom Caucus, and party leaders and their more moderate allies. The divisions have prevented GOP leaders from passing even the most basic legislation, like bills to fund the federal government, without significant Democratic support. In the midst of their internal policy fights, Republicans toppled a sitting Speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), for the first time in the nation's history and expelled another member of their conference, former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), over corruption allegations that are expected to land him in prison early next year. Still, for all the chaos, Republicans were able to flip control of the Senate and White House, and they have the edge in the battle for the House, although it remains too close to call as the last ballots are counted and the last races are formalized. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a centrist Washington Democrat representing a Trump-won district, is leading in her race for a second term. She told the Times this week that her party is struggling because too many lawmakers fail to grasp the hardships facing working class voters — and talk down to them as a result. 'No one is listening to anything else you say if you try to talk them out of their lived experiences with data points from some economists,' she told the Times. As Congress prepares to return to Washington next week, Larson emphasized the difficulty facing Democrats as they seek to be a welcoming 'big-tent' party that can appeal to a broad array of voters without offending others. He warned against abandoning party values in the quest for that broader appeal, but acknowledged that the message probably needs some work. 'In the case of all 435 districts, you're going to hear different things — both culturally, and also in terms of economics,' he said. 'It doesn't mean you abandon the ideas and the sense of equality for all Americans. But there are perhaps better ways to state it, and show it, and demonstrate it, instead of having it perceived by the other side that this is all that we stand for.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-election-reckoning-pits-liberals-against-centrists/	2024-11-09T05:46:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/supporters_harris_110424gn03_w.jpg?w=900
North Korean GPS manipulation disrupted dozens of planes and vess...	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said North Korea disrupted GPS signals from border areas for the second-straight day on Saturday, affecting an unspecified number of flights and vessel operations. Tensions between the rival Koreas have escalated as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program and engages in electronic and psychological warfare, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash and anti-South Korean propaganda leaflets in the South. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels. While warning aircraft and vessels near western border areas, South Korea’s military did not specify how North Korea was interfering with GPS signals or detail the extent of disruptions. 'We urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,' the South’s joint chiefs said in a statement. North Korea’s GPS signal disruptions and balloon campaigns highlight the vulnerability of South Korea’s Incheon International Airport, its main transportation gateway, analyst Sukjoon Yoon recently wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website. The airport, which carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo annually, is less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from North Korea. 'No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety,' Yoon wrote. He said that in 2024, North Korean trash balloons halted the airport’s runway operations 12 different times for a total of 265 minutes. Kim has shown more hostility this year toward Seoul’s conservative government — which maintains a hard line on Pyongyang — with the North abandoning its long-standing goals of reconciliation with its war-divided rival and rewriting its constitution to cement South Korea as a permanent adversary. North Korea also blew up sections of its unused road and rail routes linked with the South in October in a symbolic display of anger toward Seoul, and opened November with a flight-test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile to dial up pressure on Washington. South Korean officials say North Korean activities to disrupt GPS signals from western border regions increased as the country began launching trash-carrying balloons toward the South in late May, which the North described as a retaliation against South Korean civilian activists flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Aside from North Korea’s weapons demonstrations and non-conventional provocations, there’s growing concern over its reported provision of military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. South Korean officials say the deepening military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang could possibly result in Russian technology transfers that increases the threat posed by Kim’s military nuclear program.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-north-korean-gps-manipulation-disrupted-dozens-of-planes-and-vessels-south-korea-says/	2024-11-08T20:50:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672edb3214a837.35204222.jpeg?w=900

Dr. Mark Hyman: RFK Jr. on Trump Cabinet could improve health car...	(NewsNation) — A prominent physician and wellness expert says President-elect Donald Trump's expected health care appointee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., could help address what he calls 'the greatest epidemic of chronic disease in the history of humanity.' Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and chief medical officer of Function Health, said Friday that chronic disease transcends political divisions and requires urgent national attention. 'Six in 10 of us have chronic illness. Fifty-one percent of children have some type of chronic illness, including obesity,' Hyman said on NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' RFK Jr. wants to remove fluoride from water systems: What is it? The doctor emphasized that recent years have seen dramatic increases in various conditions, citing a 50% rise in heart disease, 30% increase in cancer and 150% surge in Alzheimer's cases alongside a 200-300% increase in pharmaceutical use. While acknowledging concerns about Kennedy, who is not a doctor and has expressed controversial medical opinions, Hyman argued for systemic changes to America's food and health policies. He criticized the current system, noting that 'ultra-processed food is the No. 1 killer in the world' and claiming it causes 11 million global deaths annually. Kennedy has been openly angling for a lead position in one of several public health agencies, hoping to make his 'Make America Healthy Again' platform a reality, especially around immunizations. How much of the vote did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receive? The former presidential candidate said Wednesday there are 'entire departments' within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that 'have to go.' 'In some categories … there are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA … that have to go, that are not doing their job. They’re not protecting our kids,' Kennedy said during an interview on MSNBC. Kennedy allies and members of Trump’s close circle have started discussing a variety of places for the former independent candidate to have influence in a second Trump term, most recently around vaccine data, and are even floating workarounds to the confirmation process on Capitol Hill if he faces pushback. However, many public health experts have expressed opposition and are growing increasingly alarmed at the prospect of Kennedy holding any kind of senior position with influence over the U.S. health system. Some have sought to draw attention to his more controversial claims about the science of vaccinations and an unverified link between children, autism and shots as well as his founding of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? Another leading health expert, Georges Benjamin, who serves as executive director of the American Public Health Association, said people in the public listen to Kennedy, even if he has no credibility in the public health sector. Amplifying Kennedy’s voice could lead to distrust of scientific experts and undermine important messaging. Kennedy became particularly critical about vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, when over 1.1 million people died, according to U.S. health records, and partisan fights broke out over things like mask requirements and vaccine mandates in the workplace and public. 'I’m not going to take away anybody’s vaccines,' Kennedy told NBC News when asked whether there were specific vaccines that Kennedy would want to remove from the market. When asked if he would eliminate any health agencies, Kennedy told MSNBC, 'To eliminate the agencies, as long as it requires congressional approval, I wouldn’t be doing that.' 'I can get the corruption out of the agencies,' he added. Ozempic can lead to muscle mass loss: Study Dr. Mark Hyman says Ozempic is not the solution Addressing the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic, Hyman cautioned against viewing it as a comprehensive solution to America's health crisis. He estimated that providing such medications to all overweight Americans would cost approximately $5.1 trillion, arguing instead for dietary and systemic changes to the nation's food system. 'The problem is we live in a toxic food environment where the bad choice is the easy choice, and the healthy choice is the hard choice,' Hyman said. 'That needs to stop, and that can be stopped with policy.' NewsNation partner The Hill contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mark-hyman-rfk-trump-cabinet/	2024-11-08T19:32:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/EB3AA69BBA764A27D798FBFA0EC8CAFE.jpg?w=900

ChatGPT rejected over 250,000 AI image requests in the month leading up to Election Day according to a Friday blog post from OpenAI. Users tried to generate photos of President-elect Trump, Vice President Harris, Vice President-elect Vance, President Biden and Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.) 'We’ve applied safety measures to ChatGPT to refuse requests to generate images of real people, including politicians,' the company wrote. 'These guardrails are especially important in an elections context and are a key part of our broader efforts to prevent our tools being used for deceptive or harmful purposes.' Meta rolls out new feature in hopes of protecting users Instead, ChaptGPT directed election related questions to CanIVote.org through a partnership with the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) in an effort to remain politically neutral. The platform is directing inquiries about the election results to news outlets like the Associated Press and Reuters. In recent weeks, OpenAI had to ban a foreign influence operation known as Storm-2035 which was pushing out influential Iranian political content. The company said it will continue to monitor ChatGPT to ensure responses are accurate and ethical. This year, the company applauded the Biden administration's efforts to outline policy regarding national security and AI technology.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/ai/chatgpt-blocked-over-250000-presidential-candidate-images-openai/	2024-11-08T18:17:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/659f06b85d37e5.26715849-e1707412990681.jpeg?w=900
Amsterdam violence against Jews ‘horrifying’: US diplomat	Warning: This video contains images of violence some may find disturbing. (NewsNation) — The top U.S. government antisemitism watchdog said she is horrified by Thursday night’s violence in Amsterdam in which roving gangs attacked people leaving a soccer match involving a team from Tel Aviv. 'There seemed to be a serious breach of security and response,' said Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, the U.S. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism. Lipstadt told NewsNation’s 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' that while Amsterdam authorities appeared to do very little during the violence, they are now taking it 'very seriously.' 'Today, the Dutch government is responding strongly,' she said. Racist text messages sent to Black Americans may be from Poland Lipstadt would not directly compare the violence to the infamous Kristallnacht, the November nights in 1938 in which Nazis targeted Jews in several cities in Germany and Austria. That, she said, was government-organized terror. 'It (the Amsterdam violence) was a pogrom, but not in the sense of it being government-organized. I think we have to make that distinction,' Lipstadt added. Antisemitic attacks have been increasing for some time, she said, but they have been 'surging' since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israelis. Australia’s prime minister proposes social media age restriction 'This has been going on in many places, including the United States. We’ve seen it in London. We’ve seen it in Berlin. We’ve seen it in many places. The protestors feel that it’s open season and that nothing is going to happen to them. Unless there is consequences — unless there is enforcement — not only is this going to continuem but it’s going to get worse,' Lipstadt said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/amsterdam-violence-jews-us-diplomat/	2024-11-08T16:38:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/ams.png?w=652
GOP inches closer to retaining House majority	Control of the House has yet to be determined, as a number of critical races remain too close to call, leaving lawmakers — and voters — waiting to see which party will hold the majority next year. The sprint to 218 seats, however, is nearing the final stretch, after a handful of additional races were called in the days following election night. Republicans had secured 216 seats in the lower chamber as of Friday morning, with Democrats trailing at 204 seats, according to Decision Desk HQ. A total of 15 races have not yet been called: Democrats are leading in eight of the contests, while GOP candidates are ahead in the other seven. Republicans, nonetheless, are wasting no time in claiming victory even as the final tally remains unclear. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said the House is poised to remain in GOP hands, and he has already launched his bid to retain hold of the gavel. Democrats, meanwhile, are holding out hope that they could eke out a razor-thin majority. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Thursday it 'has yet to be decided who will control' the House next year, pointing to ongoing ballot counting in Oregon, Arizona and California. Several competitive House races have been called in the past couple days, including Rep. David Schweikert's (R) reelection in Arizona's 1st Congressional District; Rep. David Valadao's (R) reelection in California's 22nd Congressional District; April McClain Delaney's (D) election in Maryland's 6th Congressional District; Rep. Andrea Salinas's (D) reelection in Oregon's 6th Congressional District; Rep. Julia Brownley's (D) reelection in California's 26th Congressional District; and Rep. Linda Sánchez's (D) reelection in California 38th Congressional District. Here are the uncalled races to watch in the quest for control of the House. California’s 21st Congressional District Rep. Jim Costa (D) is fighting for his political life in California’s 21st Congressional District in a race that surprisingly emerged as a nail-biter this cycle. Costa, a 10-term lawmaker, was leading Republican Michael Maher, a former FBI agent, by 1.1 percentage points — or 1,476 votes — at the time of publication, according to Decision Desk HQ, with 62.7 percent of the vote in. The race was never expected to be close. The district broke for President Biden by 20.3 percentage points in 2020, and Cook Political Report rated the seat 'solid Democrat.' A victory by Maher would flip the district red. The current margin contrasts with that from 2022, when Maher challenged Costa for the seat and lost by 8.4 percentage points. California’s 9th Congressional District Rep. Josh Harder (D) is locked in a tight race against Stockton Mayor Kevin Lincoln (R) in California’s 9th Congressional District, a contest that is threatening to end the incumbent’s tenure on Capitol Hill. Harder, who was first elected to the House in 2018, was leading Lincoln by 1.4 percentage points at the time of publication, with 56 percent of the vote reported. A victory by Lincoln, who has served as mayor of Stockton since 2021, would be a boon for Republicans: Biden won the district by 12.6 percentage points in 2020, making the district reliably blue. Cook Political Report had rated the district 'likely Democrat.' California’s 47th Congressional District The race to succeed outgoing Rep. Katie Porter (D) in California’s 47th Congressional District is coming down to the wire, with Republican Scott Baugh, a former Assembly member, and Democratic state Sen. Dave Min running neck and neck for the seat. Baugh, who previously served as the state's Assembly minority leader and Orange County GOP chair, was leading Min by 0.2 percentage points — or 616 votes — as of publication, with 78.7 percent of ballots reported. A Baugh victory would flip the seat red and mark the first time the district has a GOP representative since 2003. Biden won the district by 11.1 percentage points in 2020; Cook Political Report rated the district 'lean Democrat.' Porter opted against running for reelection to vie for the Golden State’s Senate seat, which opened up after Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) died last year. Sen. Laphonza Butler (D) is temporarily filling the seat but elected not to run for a full term. Porter, though, lost to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) in the Democratic primary. Alaska’s at-large Congressional District Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola (D) is fighting for political survival in Alaska’s at-large Congressional District, where she is currently trailing Republican entrepreneur Nick Begich in the ranked-choice-voting state. Begich was leading Peltola 49.6 percent to 45.5 percent with 74 percent of the vote in at the time of publication. Alaskan Independence Party candidate John Howe secured 3.9 percent, and Democrat Eric Hafner pulled in 1 percent. The lone Alaska district is one of a handful that President-elect Trump won in 2020, making it a key pickup target for Republicans. That year, Trump beat Biden in the state by 10.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' Arizona’s 6th Congressional District The race in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District has become as close as it can be. Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), a first-term lawmaker, was leading former Democratic state lawmaker Kirsten Engel by just 435 votes — or 0.1 percentage points — with 82 percent of ballots tallied. The district is as purple as any can get: In 2020, Biden won the area by 0.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' The race is a rematch from last cycle, when Ciscomani narrowly edged out Engel by 1.4 percentage points. California’s 13th Congressional District Rep. John Duarte (R) is leading former Democratic state Assembly member Adam Gray in California’s 13th Congressional District, but the closely watched race remains uncalled. With 58.4 percent of the vote in, Duarte — a first-term lawmaker — was ahead of Gray by 2.3 percentage points. The race has been one of the most closely watched contests this cycle, with Democrats hoping to pick off Duarte in the district after it broke for Biden by 10.9 percentage points in 2020 — a feat the party failed to achieve in 2022. That year, Duarte beat Gray by 0.42 percentage points — just 564 votes. Cook Political Report rated this year’s race a 'toss up.' California’s 27th Congressional District Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) is slightly ahead in his race against Democrat George Whitesides, the former Virgin Galactic CEO who also served as NASA chief of staff during the Obama administration — but the numbers are tight. Garcia is leading Whitesides by 1.4 percentage points — or 3,240 votes — with 76.1 percent of the vote in. A win by Garcia would let out a sigh of relief among Republicans, who were under pressure to defend the seat amid a strong Democratic effort. Democrats consider the district a top pickup opportunity, citing the fact that it broke for Biden by 12.4 percentage points in 2020. Cook Political Report rated the race a 'toss up.' California’s 41st Congressional District Rep. Ken Calvert (R) is fighting tooth and nail to hold his seat in California’s 41st Congressional District. Calvert — a 30-plus year veteran of the House who is a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee — was leading Democrat Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, by 3 percentage points with 71.2 percent of the vote in. The district has emerged as a key battleground. In 2020, it broke for Trump by 1.1 percentage points. Cook Political Report rated this year’s race a 'toss up.' Calvert is currently running ahead by a smaller margin than his victory against Rollins in 2022. That year, he beat the GOP challenger by 4.6 percentage points. Colorado’s 8th Congressional District Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D) is hanging on in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District by a slim margin against Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans. Caraveo, a first-term lawmaker, led Evans by 0.4 percentage points — or 1,321 ballots — with 85.5 percent of the vote in. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.' Oregon’s 5th Congressional District Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R) is in danger of being defeated in Oregon’s 5th Congressional District, where Democratic state Rep. Janelle Bynum is leading the incumbent. Bynum was ahead of Chavez-DeRemer by 2.5 percentage points with 84.4 percent of the vote in. Independent Brett Smith earned 4.6 percent of the vote, Libertarian Sonja Feintech notched 1.5 percent, and Andrea Townsend secured 1 percent. A Bynum victory would flip the district blue in a huge success for Democrats, who zeroed in on the area after it broke for Biden in 2020. Chavez-DeRemer was one of the most vulnerable Republicans on the ballot this cycle. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.' Washington’s 3rd Congressional District Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) looked poised to squeak out a victory against Republican Joe Kent, staying on despite being one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection this cycle. Gluesenkamp Perez, a first-term lawmaker, was leading Joe Kent, a retired Green Beret backed by Trump, by 3.1 percentage points with 94.5 percent of the vote in. Republicans had their eyes on the district after it broke for Trump by roughly 4 percentage points in 2020. In 2022, however, Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Kent by 0.82 percentage points. This year’s race was rated a 'toss up' by Cook Political Report. California’s 49th Congressional District Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) is close to securing another two years in Congress, though the race has not yet been called as more ballots are counted. Levin, a three-term lawmaker, was leading Republican business owner Matt Gunderson by 2.2 percentage points as of publication time, with 77.4 percent of the vote accounted for. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'lean Democrat,' which sits in a district that Biden won by 11.4 percentage points in 2020. California’s 6th Congressional District Rep. Ami Bera (D) is poised to win another term representing California’s 6th Congressional District, as he is leading Republican Christine Bish by a healthy margin. With 45 percent of the vote in, Bera, a six-term lawmaker, was leading Bish, a small business owner, by 13.7 percentage points, though the race had not yet been called by Decision Desk HQ. California’s 39th Congressional District Rep. Mark Takano (D) is likely to win another term on Capitol Hill, though votes are still being tallied in California’s 39th Congressional District. As of Thursday evening, Takano led Republican business owner David Serpa by 10.6 percentage points with 60.8 percent of the vote reported. California’s 45th Congressional District Rep. Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) has a healthy lead against Democrat Derek Tran, though the race has not yet been called. With 74.7 percent of the vote in, Steel, a two-term lawmaker, was ahead of Tran, a consumer rights attorney, by 3.8 percentage points. The district is one of the 17 areas Biden won in 2020 that are currently represented by a Republican, making it a top pickup target for Democrats. Biden won the area, which includes Orange and Los Angeles counties, by 6.1 percentage points in 2020. Cook Political Report rated the seat a 'toss up.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/gop-inches-closer-to-retaining-house-majority/	2024-11-08T16:19:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GOP_061824_Photo_GregNash.png?w=900
Kristi Noem: Democratic governors should work with Donald Trump	(NewsNation) — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that Democratic governors who have pledged to resist President-elect Donald Trump's immigration policies are being 'extremely irresponsible' and should instead seek dialogue with the incoming administration. 'If I had a new president in the White House, and even if he wasn't from my political party, the first thing I would do would be call him up and see if I could get a meeting,' Noem said on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' The Republican governor, who is reportedly being considered for interior secretary in Trump's cabinet, dismissed early opposition from Democratic governors like Illinois' JB Pritzker and California's Gavin Newsom as 'not a mature response' to Trump's election victory. Judge agrees to pause Jan. 6 case after Trump’s election win Newsom, a fierce critic of Trump, called on lawmakers Thursday to convene a special session later this year to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration ahead of another Trump presidency. The move — a day after the former president defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race — effectively reignited California’s resistance campaign against conservative policies that state Democratic leaders started during the first Trump administration. The move is also part of a growing discussion among Democratic state officials across the country seeking to protect policies that face threats under Trump’s leadership. Kristi Noem on interior secretary rumors: 'I will help Trump however I can' Regarding her own potential cabinet position, Noem deflected questions about reports she's being considered to lead the Interior Department, saying only that 'the only person who will make that decision is President Trump' while noting she 'love[s] being governor of South Dakota.' Charges brought in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Trump The governor also expressed support for the Justice Department's decision to suspend investigations into Trump, saying it was 'a good first step' toward restoring faith in federal law enforcement agencies. She said Trump had assured her he did not plan to pursue political prosecutions once he was in office. 'Trump ally and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is a possibility for Interior Secretary, according to a person familiar with the matter,' a Wall Street Journal story published Thursday that looked at a variety of potential cabinet appointments said. She was the only one mentioned for the Interior Department slot. If chosen and confirmed, Noem would replace the Biden administration’s Interior secretary, Deb Haaland, who, according to the department’s website, 'made history when she became the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary. She is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a 35th-generation New Mexican.' Among the U.S. Department of Interior’s official responsibilities are federal relationships with tribal governments, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Indian Education. Who is Susie Wiles, Trump’s WH chief of staff? Noem, as governor, has faced ups and downs with tribal governments in South Dakota. She offered emergency assistance after flooding in 2019, moved the state Office of Indian Education from the state Department of Education to the state Department of Tribal Affairs, has been banned from many of the nine reservations at different times and shifted funding so the state’s law enforcement training program could conduct the first-ever class for tribal officers this year. Trump’s little-noticed campaign promise to shift thousands of federal employees who are in Washington, D.C., to ‘patriot-led states’ also points to a potential gain for South Dakota. Trump has won South Dakota all three times in his presidential bids. On Tuesday, he received 272,000 votes vs. 146,837 for Harris. That 63% was slightly more than the 62% Trump received from South Dakota voters in 2020 and 2016.

Who is Susie Wiles, Trump's WH chief of staff?	(NewsNation) — Trump has selected Susie Wiles — a longtime Republican strategist and the leader of president-elect's 2024 campaign — as his chief of staff. The announcement makes Wiles the first woman to fill the role. It comes about two weeks after Wiles fired back at billionaire Mark Cuban, who claimed Trump doesn’t typically surround himself with 'strong, intelligent women.' Harris loss: Democrats ask what went wrong 'I’m told @mcuban needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump,' Wiles wrote on X — her first post in about two years. 'Well, here we are! I’ve been proud to lead this campaign. Complimented by @Linda_McMahon ,Chair for Transition Policy and @LaraLeaTrump, RNC Co-Chair.' The account Wiles posted from no longer appeared active as of early Friday afternoon. Who is Susie Wiles? Wiles, 67, is a longtime Republican strategist and the leader of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. She also worked alongside Trump in 2016. Some lawmakers describe Wiles as someone who can handle egos and strong opinions. Her political career spans several decades and began as a scheduler for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. GREENSBORO, NC - June 10 : Susie Wiles stands by as former president Donald Trump speaks to staff and reporters aboard his airplane, known as 'Trump Force One,' as he travels home after speaking in GA to NC on Saturday, June 10, 2023, in Greensboro, NC. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Although she’s now in the limelight for her association with Trump, Wiles has worked with politicians who tout more moderate views, Reuters reported. She’s also worked for Trump allies such as Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Wiles was pivotal to DeSantis’ success in Florida’s 2018 gubernatorial race. DeSantis dismissed her after his win, leading Wiles to join Trump’s orbit and help the now-president-elect defeat DeSantis in the Republican primary election. Her relationship with Trump Wiles has a reputation for remaining loyal to Trump. She’s considered a trusted adviser who can help manage the president-elect and his impulses. Some have joked that Wiles is the only person Trump listens to. 'Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected,' Trump said. 'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well-deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.'

Infighting, finger-pointing: Dems look inward after shellacking	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Democrats are still reeling from their Election Day loss, trying to figure out where it all went wrong and where the party goes from here, leading to infighting, finger-pointing and Monday morning quarterbacking. Team Biden advisers are pointing the finger at Team Harris advisers and vice-versa, going from blaming President Biden for running at all, to Vice President Harris for how the campaign was run. According to Axios, there was an all staff call Thursday evening where leaders pleaded with staffers not to talk to reporters. Harris, who was on the call, and told staffers, 'This sucks, and there's also so much good that has come from come of this.' One staffer reportedly said the message was detached from reality of what happened, saying, 'We are told the fate of democracy is at stake. And then the message was, we'll get them next time.' Justice Department brings charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Trump Biden will leave office after leading the United States out of the worst pandemic in a century, galvanizing international support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion and passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will affect communities for years to come. But having run four years ago against Trump to 'restore the soul of the country,' Biden will make way after just one term for his immediate predecessor, who overcame two impeachments, a felony conviction and an insurrection launched by his supporters. Trump has pledged to radically reshape the federal government and roll back many of Biden's priorities. Only about 4 in 10 voters in the 2024 presidential election approved of how Biden handled his job as president, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. Roughly 6 in 10 disapproved, and Donald Trump won a strong majority of those voters who were dissatisfied with Biden. Some high-ranking Democrats, including three advisers to the Harris campaign, expressed deep frustration with Biden for failing to recognize earlier in the election cycle that he was not up to the challenge. The advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Thune urges Trump to stay out of race to replace McConnell Biden, 81, ended his reelection campaign in July, weeks after an abysmal debate performance sent his party into a spiral and raised questions about whether he still had the mental acuity and stamina to serve as a credible nominee. But polling long beforehand showed that many Americans worried about his age. Some 77% of Americans said in August 2023 that Biden was too old to be effective for four more years, according to a poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs. The president bowed out on July 21 after getting not-so-subtle nudges from Democratic Party powers, including former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Biden endorsed Harris and handed over his campaign operation to her.

Jack Smith asks for pause in Jan. 6 case after Trump's election w...	(NewsNation) — Special counsel Jack Smith asked the federal judge in the Jan. 6 case against President-elect Donald Trump to pause any further proceedings while the Department of Justice considers its next steps after he won the 2024 election. 'As a result of the election held on Nov. 5, 2024, the defendant is expected to be certified as President-elect on Jan. 6, 2025, and inaugurated on Jan.20, 2025,' a filing from Smith said. 'The Government respectfully requests that the Court vacate the remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.' Smith said he will give an update to the court on the status of these deliberations by Dec. 2. Smith charged Trump with four felonies, accusing him of conspiring to subvert the 2020 election results. Trump has pleaded not guilty.

Justice Department brings charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with assassinating the Republican president-elect. Investigators learned of the plot to kill Trump while interviewing Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national identified by officials as an Iranian government asset who was deported from the U.S. after being imprisoned on robbery charges. He told investigators that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to put together a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan. Two other men who the authorities say were recruited to participate in other assassinations, including a prominent Iranian American journalist, were also arrested Friday. Shakeri remains in Iran.

The plot, with the charges unsealed just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, reflects what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil.

Thune urges Trump to stay out of race to replace McConnell	Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) is urging President-elect Trump not to put his thumb on the scale in the race to elect a successor to outgoing Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), putting a new wrinkle in the high-stakes contest. Thune in recent days has declared his preference that Trump give Republican senators space to make their own decision about who should lead the new Senate GOP majority, arguing it would be in Trump’s 'best interests' to stay neutral. That argument has been echoed by Thune’s allies, such as Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who told CNN earlier this week that Trump should 'stay out of the race.' Thune’s comments are creating a stir among Senate insiders two days after Trump won a resounding victory over Vice President Harris and helped Republicans regain the Senate majority. Allies of Thune’s two rivals in the leadership race, Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), say that calls for Trump to stay out of the leadership race indicate that Thune is nervous that the president-elect would endorse either Cornyn or Scott — which would be a serious setback. 'He’s terrified. He knows that Trump won’t endorse him. If he knows that, then Trump getting involved hurts him,' a Senate Republican aide said. Thune’s rivals have a better relationship with Trump, especially Scott, who’s the closest to the president-elect of the three. Scott represents Trump’s adopted home state of Florida, and as National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman traveled to Mar-a-Lago in April of 2021, when Trump was still something of a pariah among GOP senators, to give him a 'Champion of Freedom' award. Scott was later challenged about it in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, who asked if he was endorsing Trump’s 'lies' about the 2020 election. Trump on Thursday named Susie Wiles, who ran Scott's first campaign for governor in 2010, as his White House chief of staff. She served as his presidential campaign manager. He was also the first senator to travel to New York to attend Trump’s criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records. Scott and his allies are hoping that Trump will weigh in strongly on his behalf in the leadership race. Without Trump’s enthusiastic endorsement, he probably does not have a viable path to becoming majority leader, Senate Republican sources say. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has endorsed Scott, called on Trump Thursday to intervene in the leadership race. 'Jesse, if you’ve got any influence with President Trump, ask President Trump to come out publicly and say he wants to work with someone as accomplished as Rick Scott to accomplish his agenda,' Johnson asked conservative podcast host Jesse Kelly in an interview. Cornyn, who served as Senate GOP whip during Trump’s first two years in the White House, doesn’t have as good a relationship with Trump as Scott but his supporters argue he’s closer to the president-elect than Thune. Cornyn spent time with Trump in recent weeks at a rally in Reno, Nevada, and a meeting in Austin, Texas. He was also a special guest at fundraisers for the Trump-Vance campaign in Laredo, San Antonio and Houston in August. The Texas fundraising swing raised 'well into the seven figures' for the Trump campaign, according to a source familiar with Cornyn’s political operation. Cornyn has reminded Trump of their accomplishments working together when he served as the No. 2-ranking Republican in 2017 and 2018, including passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and confirming conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 'As I told President Trump, I’m interested in getting the band back together again,' Cornyn told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. Thune has had rockier relationship with Trump in the past. It hit a low point after Thune opposed an effort to object to the certification of electoral votes for Joe Biden after the 2020 election. Trump got so made about Thune’s pledge to defeat objections to Arizona’s and Pennsylvania’s electoral slates four years ago that he called for the amiable South Dakota Republican to face a primary challenger in 2022. 'South Dakota doesn’t like weakness,' Trump tweeted in December of 2020. 'He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!' Thune, nevertheless, cruised to an easy reelection. Thune has since tried to mend fences with Trump. He visited the president-elect at his Mar-a-Lago home in March and spoke to him on the phone Wednesday. The No. 2-ranking Senate GOP leader has pledged to work closely with Trump to pass his legislative agenda in 2025 and 2026 if he is elected to become the next Senate majority leader. But he advised Trump on Wednesday to let Senate Republicans make their own decision about who should lead the conference next year, defending what Republican senators have long viewed as their prerogative to run their own conference. 'I’m staying in regular contact with him and with his team and, obviously, if he wants to, he could exert a considerable amount of influence on that but, honestly, I think my preference would be and I think it’s probably in his best interest to stay out of [the race,]' Thune told CNBC’s Joe Kernen. 'These Senate secret-ballot elections are probably best left to the senators and he’s got to work with all of us when it’s all said and done,' he said. Thune made similar comments in a Fox News interview, acknowledging that Trump could swing the race one way or another. 'The president obviously has tremendous influence if he chooses to use it. I think in leadership elections, particularly in the Senate … it is a very sort of inside baseball thing,' he said, arguing that Senate Republicans will be able to find the right person for the job without outside influence. 'I think if he lets it play out, we'll get the right person. I've had conversations with him and have told him that we want to get his team in place so that he can hit the ground running and get to work on an agenda to make sure that he and our team succeeds,' he said. The last time a president played a major role in picking a Senate majority leader was in late 2002. Sen. Bill Frist’s (R-Tenn.) close relationship with then-President President George W. Bush was a big reason why he was elected to succeed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who resigned from the leadership after making controversial remarks at late-Sen. Strom Thurmond’s (R-S.C.) 100th birthday party. Frist had previously served as NRSC chairman but he didn’t work his way up the leadership ranks as other GOP leaders have done, and his management style as well as his deference to the Bush administration rankled some GOP senators.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/thune-urges-trump-to-stay-out-of-race-to-replace-mcconnell/	2024-11-08T09:06:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/thunejohn_070924gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Baja officials brace for 'elevated' deportations under Trump	SAN DIEGO (Border Report) -- Officials in Baja California expect a high increase in the number of deportations by the U.S. government once Donald Trump returns to office. Throughout the campaign, Trump promised to deport large numbers of migrants should he regain the presidency. Trump’s return to White House sets stage for far-reaching immigration crackdown 'Every time there are changes in the United States, it directly impacts us especially when people are being returned,' said Jorge Rivera Manzo, director of governmental migrant affairs with the state.. 'Some will go directly back to their countries, others will arrive in Mexico depending on agreements made with each country, but we are getting ready for elevated returns.' Rivera Manzo stated that right now, shelters are relatively quiet with 60% vacancy rates in Tijuana and 70% in Mexicali. Migrants urged to get legal aid as Trump promises mass deportations José María García Lara, who is in charge of a shelter called Movimiento Juventud 2000, said he is worried about the expected migrant traffic in the city with people deported through Tijuana as a result of Tuesday's election. 'When people are waiting for asylum, hoping the United States will help, it leads to a lot of uncertainty among the migrants we have here at the shelter,' he said. One of those migrants, Emir Garcia, says they are here out of necessity and not by choice. She remains hopeful Trump will decide to help the migrants. Texas’ border takeover a factor in migrant, US citizen deaths, activists say 'We're all afraid, all the migrants, we need his help,' Garcia said. 'We know he has to take care of his country, but he also needs to help others around the world.' Lucia Chique with her two children at the Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana. (Jorge Nieto/Special for Border Report) Others like Lucia Chique, from Mexico, aren't expecting much from the incoming Trump administration. 'Donald Trump doesn't want us, he doesn't want Latinos, he doesn't want Mexicans,' she said. 'There are going to be a lot of deportations of those seeking asylum, it's going to get very complicated.' Chique also worries the CBP One app, which helps migrants land appointments to lawfully cross the border and ask for asylum, will be discontinued once Trump takes over. Right now, the app is providing 1,450 daily appointments to migrants. Troubled by illegal border crossings, Arizona voters approve state-level immigration enforcement Jesus Ramos is a migrant from Mexico staying athe the Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana. (Jorge Nieto/Special for Border Report) 'We're using the application, but you hear rumors that he's going to eliminate it, it's going to get harder for migrants.' Other CBP One users, like Jesus Ramos, want Trump to continue the program. 'I've been waiting three months for an appointment, I just want to get to the U.S. to see my grandparents one more time,' he said.

Kushner will not join second Trump administration, may advise on ...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will not return to the White House for a role in the second administration, the Financial Times reported Friday, but he could advise on Middle East policy. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, served as one of Trump's senior advisers from 2017 to 2021. Also the former director of the Office of American Innovation, Kushner led the authoring of the Trump peace plan, a proposal by the Trump administration to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, under the first administration.

What happens between now and inauguration?	(The Hill) — President-elect Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 election Wednesday, unlocking a path to the White House that involves a series of key events required to ratify the results. This process is outlined in the Constitution. The steps ensure an election is fairly processed and ballot counts are properly documented. Officials craft paperwork that records the presidential ballot totals from Election Day, the first Tuesday in November, to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. Certificate of Ascertainment Each state must first submit its Certificate of Ascertainment, which lists the names of all the individuals on the slates for each candidate and the number of votes each individual received. It also shows which individuals were appointed as the state's electors, according to the National Archives. These documents must be sent to the Archivist of the United States by Dec. 11. They are the country’s official election record. Trump starts planning for second administration Certificate of the Vote Electors will meet in their respective states on Dec. 17. Each person casts a vote for president and vice president on separate ballots. Electors record their votes on six Certificates of Vote, which are paired with the six remaining Certificates of Ascertainment, according to the National Archives. Next, they sign and seal six copies of both the Certificate of Vote alongside the Certificate of Ascertainment. The documents are sent to Congress, where the votes are counted, and to the National Archives and Record Administration, as part of the official records of the presidential election. Every state will also receive a copy for its permanent records in addition to three backup sets. New Congress members instated The new Congress will convene at noon Jan. 3, as outlined in the Constitution, and lawmakers will be sworn in. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the meeting as Senate members take their Oath of Office, as well as the House Speaker for House members. 2024 Election results Congress counts electoral votes Congress will count electoral votes on Jan. 6. Harris will be the first sitting vice president to oversee the counting of her own electoral loss since Al Gore in 2002. The states' election results will be brought into Congress in two wooden boxes. Harris will hand sealed certificates to tellers, who will tally the votes. This is the first time a new process outlined under the Electoral Count Reform Act will be in place. The law confirms the vice president cannot change the election outcome on Jan. 6 and helps to resolve legal challenges swiftly, according to the Associated Press. The law was passed after the Capitol attacks on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of the election. Biden: Trump win lays to rest question of election ‘integrity’ Inauguration President-elect Trump will be sworn in on Inauguration Day at noon on Jan. 20, as laid out in the Constitution. He will also provide an address to the nation. The event is planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC).	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/what-happens-between-now-and-inauguration/	2024-11-08T00:17:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24309743494639-e1730756286639.jpg?w=900
Harris loss: Democrats ask what went wrong	(NewsNation) — Democrats are grappling with Vice President Kamala Harris' defeat to Donald Trump in Tuesday's presidential election, and blame is being cast. Democratic strategist Joshua Doss and left wing political commentator Cenk Uygur joined NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo to discuss what went wrong for Kamala Harris and the Democrats. Doss argued that Harris ran a good campaign, focusing on working-class policies, while Uygur argued Harris was a bad candidate, only caring about donors. Chris Cuomo said the results should tell Democrats they need to focus 'less on who is woke' and more on 'who is broke.' For the most part, Democrats did not direct arrows toward Harris, who many say ran the best campaign she could have given the circumstances of her 100-day sprint following President Biden’s withdrawal from the race. But there was some second-guessing on Harris’ running mate pick of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who one operative said 'ultimately offered next to nothing.' There also was some griping about how Harris’ economic message largely fell flat. And there are larger discussions about the campaign’s polling and how it missed Trump’s growing coalition of Latino voters. Leader of the free world has never been a role Trump has embraced. The world has gotten the message Some of the vice president’s backers are also expressing frustration that Biden’s decision to seek reelection until this summer — despite long-standing voter concerns about his age and unease about post-pandemic inflation as well as the U.S.-Mexico border — all but sealed his party’s surrender of the White House. 'The biggest onus of this loss is on President Biden,' said Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden in 2020 for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Harris’ unsuccessful run. 'If he had stepped down in January instead of July, we may be in a very different place.' NewsNation’s 'The Hill' and Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/harris-loss-democrats-ask-what-went-wrong/	2024-11-07T21:47:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24312026609813.jpg?w=900
Many obstacles to Trump’s mass deportation promise: Ex-ICE offici...	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to deport 11 million migrants in the U.S. illegally has more than a few obstacles, according to a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director. The first is staffing and funding from Congress, according to John Sandweg, who worked in the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. 'Trump is going to need a lot more ICE agents. That's going to require a lot of appropriations from Congress,' he said. Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security The administration would also need a massive number of 'detention beds,' something Sandweg told NewsNation is far easier said than done. The main thing, according to Sandweg, is the state of the existing U.S. immigration system. 'There are backlogs in the immigration courts. The Supreme Court has said that migrants are entitled to due process before they’re deported,' said Sandweg. 'That means Trump is going to have to find a way to bypass those immigration courts. I think during the campaign, just in all candor, I don't think they had a clear road map for how they're going to kind of overcome those challenges.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/obstacles-trump-mass-deportation/	2024-11-07T16:17:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66bfeaba4bd428.13636202.jpeg?w=900
Trump picks Susie Wiles for White House chief of staff	Susie Wiles, who led President-elect Trump’s campaign for the past two years, will serve as his chief of staff when he takes office in January. 'Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,' Trump said in a statement. 'Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again,' he added. 'It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.' The chief of staff pick was the first administration post Trump has announced since he clinched the presidency in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Wiles is a widely respected GOP operative from Florida who has avoided the spotlight even as she steered Trump’s third White House campaign alongside Chris LaCivita. She navigated the largely male-dominated campaign without making enemies, and Trump allies were quick to congratulate her on the role. 'This is great news. Susie was a huge asset to President Trump on the campaign and will be a huge asset in the White House. She's also just a really good person. Onward!' Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social platform X. Trump called on Wiles to speak during his victory speech Wednesday morning, but, as evidence of her tendency to avoid the spotlight, she declined. 'We call her the ice baby,' Trump joked. 'Susie likes to stay in the background. She's not in the background.' Prior to serving as a top Trump adviser in the 2024 election, Wiles led his Florida operations in the 2016 campaign. She went on to work with Ron DeSantis (R) on his gubernatorial campaign in Florida, but she left DeSantis’s team amid rising tensions. Chief of staff is seen as the most influential job in the White House, aside from the presidency itself, and Wiles will be tasked with managing Trump and his team of at-times competing factions — a job that proved difficult and thankless during his first term. Trump went through four chiefs of staff during his first term in office. His first pick, Reince Priebus, lasted six months before being replaced by John Kelly, who has since become an outspoken critic of Trump. Wiles is the daughter of former NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall.

Powell says he won't resign for Trump, can't be fired	Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a clear, direct response when asked during a press conference Thursday if he would step down if asked to do so by President-elect Trump. 'No,' said Powell, whose term as chair ends in 2026 Trump starts planning for second administration When asked to elaborate and if he would be legally required to leave, he again said, 'No.' Powell later said it is 'not permitted under the law' for the president to fire or demote him or any of the other Fed governors with leadership positions. Trump appointed Powell during his first term in 2017 but repeatedly and publicly criticized the Fed and its chair for not cutting rates fast enough throughout his tenure. Powell also said in 2019 that he would not resign if asked by Trump. President Biden reappointed Powell in 2021 — despite objections from progressives who have criticized the chair — saying he has burdened the average American by keeping rates too high for too long. Trump suggested earlier this year that Powell, a lifelong Republican, was 'political' and would cut rates ahead of the 2024 election to help Democrats. While the Fed did cut rates in September by a whopping 50 basis points, Trump handily defeated Vice President Harris this week. The Fed is a politically independent agency and closely guards its reputation. But in August, Trump suggested he should 'have at least a say' in monetary policy, including interest rates, because he has 'made a lot of money.' Here’s what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security Trump later walked back his comments during an interview with Bloomberg. 'I think it’s fine for a president to talk,' he said. 'It doesn’t mean that they have to listen.' What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes 'A president certainly can be talking about interest rates, because I think I have very good instincts,' he said. 'That doesn’t mean I’m calling the shot, but it does mean that I should have a right to be able to talk about it like anybody else.' Trump also said over the summer that he would let Powell serve out his term, 'especially if I thought he was doing the right thing,' but that he would not reappoint him for another term.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/jerome-powell-donald-trump-federal-reserve-chair/	2024-11-07T15:00:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/powelljerome_070924jg09_w.jpg?w=900
Voters approve abortion-rights measures in 7 states	(NewsNation) — Abortion-rights measures passed in 7 states and have failed in at least 1 thus far, as voters in nearly a dozen states were asked to decide whether reproductive rights should be guaranteed. A record 10 states had abortion rights measures on their ballots this year in response to restrictions and bans on reproductive rights across the country. Abortion measures on state ballots Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and New York approved the abortion rights measures, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ has projected. Florida voters are projected to reject an abortion access measure, leaving the state's bans intact. The measure passed in Missouri with support from more than 74% of voters, according to Decision Desk HQ. The state will now have a constitutional amendment protecting abortion until fetal viability, with the exception when a health care professional determines it’s necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant woman. States that voted on ballot measures to provide abortion access. (Green: Approved, Red: Rejected) Voters in Nebraska approved a ballot measure limiting abortion to the first trimester. Nebraska's competing measure to solidify abortion access appeared to fail with more than 95% of the vote counted. Fifty-eight percent of voters in South Dakota voted 'no' to abortion rights being added to the state constitution, with 95% of votes in, according to NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ. Once called, the state would preserve a near-total ban there. Which states voted to protect abortion and elect Trump? Most measures gave voters a choice to solidify the right to abortion in state constitutions. All but two of the measures were citizen-led, meaning they were written by citizen groups and placed on ballots after getting enough signatures. Trump and abortion rights Several of the states that passed measures also voted for President-elect Donald Trump, indicating a disconnect between voters’ values on a central issue and those of their preferred party. Alternatively, protecting abortion access may be a comfort to voters who support Trump but aren’t clear on his views about abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, launching a national push to have voters decide abortion laws at the state level. Since then, a number of states have tackled the issue, with the last big wave of ballot measures taking place in 2022 when six states put abortion to a vote. A June Gallup poll revealed a record-high 32% of America’s voters would only vote a candidate into a major office if their opinions on abortion aligned, up 8 points from 2020. The number of U.S. voters who advocate for abortion rights is holding historically high at 54%. That percentage hit a fever pitch after the Roe ruling, and since then, the percentage of those supporting the right to an abortion has never dropped back below 50%, according to the poll. What’s involved in Donald Trump’s border security plan? Abortion legal battles The efforts were an uphill battle for many states where reproductive rights advocates faced legal fights in courts brought by anti-abortion groups seeking to remove measures from ballots. Abortion rights activists and Women's March leaders protest as part of a national day of strike actions outside the Supreme Court, Monday, June 24, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) In Arizona, anti-abortion groups sought to block the measure from getting on the state's ballot by legally challenging a handful of words that were left out of the description and argued the 'primary thrust' of the amendment was a 'wholesale dismantling of existing law related to abortion in Arizona.' Their lawsuit was dismissed by a judge who said there’s no legal reason to prevent it from being considered by voters, reported the Arizona Mirror. The measure passed with 61% approval. Legal battles are expected for the approved measures, and some anti-abortion groups say they will continue to fight against the laws. 'These ballot initiatives are vague and undefined,' Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy at Students for Life, told The Washington Post. The vagueness, she added, opens the door for legislation more tightly regulating medication abortion. Abortion's importance to the election Like in 2022, abortion continued to be a motivating factor for a notable share of voters in 2024, according to nonprofit KFF. About 4 in 10 voters said abortion had a major impact on their decision about whether to turn out, and over half said it had a major impact on which candidates they supported, the group found. Abortion was a major issue central to driving voters to the polls in the 2022 midterm elections, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In polling leading up to Election Day, abortion had surpassed inflation to be the top issue in the presidential election for young women. Abortion-rights ballot measure supporters across the country raised nearly eight times as much money as groups campaigning against the amendments on ballots across the country. 'This shows overwhelmingly that voters believe in abortion access, and it disputes all the misinformation and disinformation that we’ve been hearing about abortion access and belief that people do not care about it,' Christian F. Nunes, the president of the National Organization for Women, which advocates for women’s rights, told NewsNation prior to Election Day. Missouri reverses abortion ban Under current Missouri law, abortion is nearly completely banned, with exceptions for medical emergencies, making the state one of the most strict in the country. Under the newly passed amendment, the state will now guarantee people’s right to make decisions about their reproductive health, such as whether to get an abortion, take birth control or get in vitro fertilization. 'Tonight, through the sheer will and power of the people, Missouri becomes the first state to end a total abortion ban at the ballot box,' Mallory Schwarz, Abortion Action Missouri executive director, said in a statement after the vote. Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state’s abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care. The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional. Mike Kehoe, the governor-elect of Missouri, vowed to continue fighting the law. 'Well we’re going to have to work with our legislators to find out what are any other options to protect innocent life, you’re right once it’s in the constitution it’s not an option, so we’ll have to look to what all the avenues are available,' Kehoe said, reported WDAF-TV. 'Life supporters will not sit back and watch as Big Abortion works to dismantle all the health and safety protections put in place to protect women and babies,' Missouri Stands with Women spokesperson Stephanie Bell said in a statement. Nebraska's competing abortion ballot measures Nebraska gave voters two competing measures on abortion rights, where one asks voters to enshrine the right to an abortion until fetal viability or later to protect the health of the pregnant woman in the state constitution. The other sought to amend the state constitution to keep the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman. With 92% of votes in, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ projects voters have approved Initiative 434, which prohibits abortion after the first trimester and keeps the state’s current law. The race had not been called for the measure solidifying rights, but 51% of voters have voted against it so far. Several lawsuits were filed in an effort to block one or both of the initiatives, but the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that both measures could appear on the ballot because each side had enough signatures. Florida votes no on abortion access ballot question In Florida, voters had the opportunity to amend the state constitution to protect the right to abortion until fetal viability or when necessary to protect the pregnant person’s health. The measure garnered support from 57% of voters, falling just short of the 60% it needed to pass, according to DDHQ totals. The state’s six-week abortion ban will continue to be in place. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and other GOP leaders had repeatedly tapped into taxpayer-funded resources to fight the ballot initiative, according to Politico reporting. Kamala Harris vows peaceful transfer of power in concession speech State police in Florida also allegedly visited the homes of voters who signed a petition to get an abortion-rights amendment on the ballot as part of a state probe into alleged petition fraud.

Here's what a Trump presidency could mean for Social Security	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump vowed to end taxes on Social Security retirement benefits on the campaign trail, but as he heads into his second term that promise could be hard to keep. 'You would have to have bipartisan buy-in to do that and it's hard for me to imagine that happening,' said Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who specializes in Social Security. Today, individuals who earn above $25,000 pay income tax on up to 50% of their Social Security retirement benefits. For seniors who earn above $34,000, an additional 35% of benefits are taxable. Nine states also collect taxes on Social Security. Can you live on Social Security alone in 2024? Trump pledged to end those taxes at the federal level: 'Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security, and they won’t,' he said at a July rally in Pennsylvania. But that could be a tall order. Any changes to Social Security's taxation structure would require 60 votes in the Senate, meaning Republicans and Democrats would have to work together to make it happen, Blahous pointed out. Even if retirees on both sides of the aisle support Trump's idea, there's a major reason lawmakers are unlikely to: Social Security's finances are in dire straits. In roughly a decade, retirees could see their benefits slashed by 21% if Congress doesn't take action. Ending taxes on benefits — which account for 4% of the retirement program's income — would squeeze the program further. In other words, Trump probably needs to propose a plan that increases revenue before lawmakers will agree to slash taxes. Social Security benefits are taxed in these US states A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) found that Trump's Social Security agenda — which also includes ideas like eliminating taxes on tips, imposing more tariffs and deporting unauthorized migrants — would 'dramatically worsen' the program's finances and move up the insolvency date three years, from 2034 to 2031. Trump’s campaign slammed the CRFB analysis at the time, saying: 'The so-called experts at CRFB have been consistently wrong throughout the years.' Polling suggests most Americans are in favor of changing the payroll tax so high earners pay more into the Social Security system, which would help bolster the program's revenue. So far, Trump hasn't signaled that he's open to the idea. Will Social Security change under Donald Trump? Trump has repeatedly said he won't 'cut one cent' from Social Security or raise the retirement age. The official Republican Party Platform adopted at the Republican National Convention echoed those promises but it's less clear how Trump plans to shore up the program's finances. Earlier this year, the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) 2025 budget proposal suggested raising the retirement age for those not near retirement 'to account for increases in life expectancy.' Trump has pointed to economic dynamism as a potential solution and has suggested bolstering the program by tapping into 'incredible wealth under our feet' in the form of oil and gas. The CRFB reported that would do little to address the shortfall. The most likely scenario, as Blahous sees it, is that Trump's second term will look a lot like his first, meaning few changes, if any, to Social Security. 'His standpoint has been, 'I'm just not going to change anything' and I think that's a fairly likely bet,' Blahous said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Aaron Cirksena, founder and CEO of MDRN Capital and a retirement planning specialist, thinks ending taxes on benefits would be popular if Trump can make it happen. 'To retirees, when they're getting taxed taking Social Security payments out of the system it feels like they're basically getting taxed twice on it,' he said. Today, about 40% of Social Security recipients pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. That share has risen from 26% in 1998 because the exemption thresholds don’t go up with inflation, an example of so-called 'bracket creep.' For now, Cirksena said it's a bad idea to shift your retirement strategy based on potential changes down the road. 'Until things are actually enacted and they're set in stone, don't make any hard, concrete plans,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-presidency-social-security/	2024-11-07T11:50:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Election-Trump-full-screen-2.png?w=900
Live: Biden addresses nation after Trump wins presidency a second...	(NewsNation) — Current U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the nation Thursday morning in the Rose Garden following Republican former President Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election. Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris gave her 'whole heart effort, and she and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran,' Biden said. 'The struggle for the soul of America, since our very founding, has always been an ongoing debate, and still vital today,' Biden said. 'I know for some people, it’s a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it's a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made.' Trump's win means Republicans will regain control of the White House four years after they lost to Biden in 2020. The GOP also won control of the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, though the fate of the House of Representatives still hangs in the balance. Trump showed an early lead as polls started closing Tuesday evening in the East Coast with the 'red mirage.' He had early wins in swing states like Georgia and North Carolina. Pennsylvania ultimately gave him the final electoral votes to seize the 270 needed to secure the presidency. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Biden called Trump and congratulated the President-elect on his victory and emphasized a smooth transition of power, extending an invitation to the White House. At 78 years old Trump will become the oldest president to be elected to the White House. Biden previously held that title, as he was 77. During Democratic nominee Harris' concession speech, she promised a peaceful transfer of power to Trump, and urged supporters to keep fighting for the ideals of her campaign at the ballot box, in the courts and in the public square.

Trump starts planning for second administration	(NewsNation) — The 2024 election is in the books, which means the clock has started on the transition to the second Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump's second inauguration is just 75 days away and the race is on for Trump to get teams in place for his new administration. How often does the US see a unified government? Trump takes office in January Trump's family has been helping the President-elect through the transition process. Trump will take office in January after Biden finishes his term. He’s already pledged to address the ongoing crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that he will begin mass deportations of illegal immigrants on day one. He has also promised to address the economy with Republicans ready to push to renew the 2017 tax cuts which were achieved during Trump’s first term, The New York Times reported. The GOP also promised 'massive reform' to the Affordable Care Act, the report said. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said health care reform would be a large part of the Republican agenda within Trump’s first 100 days as president. Trump also claimed he would end the 'Green New Deal atrocities' on his first day if reelected. The measure was never signed into law. Some of the names already being floated as possible Trump cabinet members include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who dismissed Trump's federal classified documents case, has also been floated as a possible attorney general. 2024 Election results Election fallout Trump spent his day on Wednesday at Mar-a-Lago, fielding phone calls from world leaders and donors. He also spoke with his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, who formally conceded the election. Both Biden and Harris spoke about the importance of unifying the country and a peaceful transition of power. A message the vice president echoed in her formal concession speech to supporters on Wednesday. 'A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny,' Harris said. 'While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness.' NewsNation also learned that President Joe Biden called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. The two are expected to meet in person at the White House soon. Biden will address the nation Thursday for the first time since the election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/75-days-trump-inauguration/	2024-11-07T06:23:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182676763.jpg?w=900

A total of 34 U.S. Senate seats were determined on Election Day, with Democrats and Independents representing 23 of those races. Meanwhile, Republicans held a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives with 220 seats over the Democrats who held 212 and three seats being vacant into Tuesday’s election.

Peter Navarro explains how Donald Trump will compose his Cabinet	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump will assume his second non-consecutive term on Jan. 20, and now the transition team is compliling a shortlist of possible White House Cabinet members. How will Trump 2.0 be distinct? Ex-Trump administration adviser Peter Navarro explains what he believes the President-elect will do differently this time. 'I think the lesson of the first term was it's important to get the appointments absolutely correct. We had some folks there early on that were very, very difficult,' said former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, who served from 2017 to 2021. Some likely Cabinet contenders include Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. Others have speculated Trump may tap Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran as an independent presidential candidate earlier in the race, and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, who campaigned for him. What Donald Trump will do differently in second White House term Navarro was the first Trump White House official to service prison time related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and was released in July after serving a four-month sentence. He joined NewsNation's 'On Balance with Leland Vittert' Wednesday to discuss how Trump might choose his Cabinet. 'I think there's going to be a battle between the MAGA folks and the Wall Street folks,' Navarro said. 'I think if you see Wall Street-type people in key places like Treasury or the National Economic Council within the West Wing, that's going to be very, very difficult. One of the problems we had in the first term is that Wall Street was continually fighting.' Still, Navarro said he thinks Trump will bring on veterans from the first administration. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? 'I think what the boss is looking for, and I’ve thought about this a lot ... you want somebody to be loyal to the president … who'll be honest and blunt when need be but loyal,' Navarro said. 'Most importantly, they need to be loyal to the agenda, the Trump agenda, particularly on trade, particularly on border issues. He likes people who are good with the media, and if you're in the West Wing, you really have to have a command of how the policy process works.' The first 100 days of the second Trump administration could see '100 or more' executive orders, according to Navarro.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/peter-navarro-cabinet-selection-trump/	2024-11-07T01:21:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/navarropeter_081122gn15_w.jpg?w=900
What Donald Trump will do differently in second White House term	(NewsNation) — After President-elect Donald Trump previously criticized early voting, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee says it was critical that he led the effort to get more voters to the polls before Election Day. An estimated 85.9 million early votes were cast before Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to secure a second term in the White House, but Ronna McDaniel said after the victory that Trump made a change in encouraging his supporters to go against his former voting guidance. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes 'There’s no better person that’s going to get voters to change their habits, to believe in it, than President Trump,' McDaniel said, adding, 'This is certainly something that took an education, but it wouldn’t have happened without the top of the ticket saying it. This has to be the norm going forward. We can’t expect to get everything on Election Day.' Heading into Trump’s second White House term, McDaniel expects things to be different than his first. Trump has a better understanding of Washington, she said, and she believes Trump will have a definite plan from Day 1. Trump could have a fully Republican-controlled Congress to work with after the GOP flipped the Senate, but McDaniel says he will be eager to work across the aisle. 'I think he is talking about things that have bipartisan support,' McDaniel said. 'Like a border that we need safe and secure, like making sure we that we tackle our energy independence. I think there’s so much bipartisanship in Washington, and I believe President Trump will work across the aisle.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-do-differently-white-house/	2024-11-06T17:36:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2182130711.jpg?w=900
Chris Cuomo breaks down what 2024 election outcome means	The views expressed in this article are those of the author, and not of NewsNation. (NewsNation) — The 2024 Democratic defeat runs deeper than conventional wisdom suggests. While many blame voter demographics or point fingers at specific groups, the reality is much simpler: Americans voted their pocketbooks. With costs higher than four years ago, voters prioritized economic concerns over warnings about President-elect Donald Trump's character flaws or democratic threats. NewsNation led the way in election coverage, delivering accurate calls before other networks thanks to solid modeling from Decision Desk HQ. Kamala Harris vows peaceful transfer of power in concession speech Wednesday's pivotal moment came when Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech at Howard University, formally acknowledging Trump's victory. The Democratic campaign strategy proved fundamentally flawed. They bet everything on an anti-Trump message, believing that highlighting his dangerous potential would overcome all other voter concerns. Bernie Sanders identified this critical error — the party had abandoned its core message about helping working families in favor of becoming solely the anti-Trump party. This miscalculation was costly. Most Trump voters aren't blind followers. They're pragmatic citizens worried about their families' financial security, physical safety and personal freedoms. While Trump certainly has his devoted base, the majority of his supporters voted for him because they believed he better understood their everyday concerns. When will House results come out? They saw him as someone who would fight against what they perceive as overreach in education policy, border control and speech restrictions. The media played a troubling role in this election. While NewsNation called races based purely on data, other networks showed clear hesitation when the numbers pointed to Trump. This bias only reinforces the perception that establishment institutions are working against ordinary Americans' interests. Trump now faces a greater challenge than winning the election.He must somehow transition from disruption to progress, from division to unity. Real solutions to border security and economic improvement require more than just walls or tax cuts -— they demand collaborative policy-making and genuine leadership. What Trump’s proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes Looking forward, Democrats have an opportunity to rebuild as the opposition party. They need to fundamentally rethink their approach, focusing less on telling voters why they're wrong and more on understanding and addressing their genuine concerns. The party must reconnect with working families and demonstrate how progressive policies can actually improve their daily lives. For the country to move forward, both sides need to engage in honest reflection. Fairness and cooperation must replace gratuitous division. The election is over, and now comes the harder task of governance. Simply demonizing the other side — whether it's Trump supporters or progressive activists — solves nothing. Real progress requires understanding that most Americans want the same things: economic security, safe communities and a better future for our children. The fundamental lesson of this election is clear: You cannot win by dismissing voters' concerns or telling them their feelings are wrong. The path forward requires less judgment and more understanding, less ideology and more practical problem-solving.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/opinion/chris-cuomo-breaks-down-what-the-2024-election-outcome-means/	2024-11-06T17:35:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_27a87f.jpg?w=900
What will Trump do on immigration, foreign policy?	(NewsNation) — Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said he will take a hard-line stance on immigration once in office, including enacting mass deportations of unauthorized migrants. Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokeswoman in the Trump administration, said there are various policies one can expect the former president to follow through on in his second term. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? However, there are other indicators for how Trump will deal with the southern border as president, such as who he picks to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Ortagus said. 'We know that he's going to want to try and to finish the wall,' Ortagus said, adding that Trump will also likely take on the controversial CBP One app. 'If you're circumventing the legal process, whatever the policy is, I think you can likely expect a second Trump term to not allow policies that are actually circumventing the law.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/what-will-trump-do-on-immigration-foreign-policy/	2024-11-06T16:59:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24303574162285.jpg?w=900
What Trump's proposed tax plan could mean for American incomes	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump pledged to implement several initiatives if he defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, including a plan to eliminate personal income taxes in exchange for at least a 10% tariff on all important imported goods and a 60% tariff on products imported from China. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s plan to expand his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would, in 2024 dollars, cost $3.2 trillion over 10 years and $10.3 trillion over the next 30 years. With Trump projected to win a second term in the White House, however, what does his proposed tax plan mean for the earnings of everyday Americans? The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, shows that the Trump tax proposal benefits American workers in various income brackets following an election in which many voters considered the economy their top concern. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? The Wharton project estimates that the Trump tax plan would increase the nation's primary deficits by $5.8 trillion over 10 years on a conventional basis and by $4.1 trillion on a dynamic basis, the report finds. Here’s how the Trump plan benefits the income of Americans, according to Wharton research. Income bracket: $48,000 Income category: Lower class Income gain under Trump: 1.8% or $870 Wharton analysis: The projected increase was much lower than Harris’ proposed plan (1.8% vs. 4.8% or $2,260), and under Trump’s tariff proposal for products coming from China and other places, those tariffs turn middle-and-low-income earners into 'net losers' because of the increased cost of goods, especially from China, the Wharton project reported. Income bracket: $81,000 Income category: Middle class Income gain under Trump: 2.1% or $1,740 Wharton analysis: While the Harris plan called for the Child Tax Credit to increase to $6,000 for newborns and $3,600 for children under 5 beginning in 2026, the Trump plan keeps the tax credit at $2,000. However, since the tax credit is scheduled to shrink, Wharton researchers consider his proposal a financial gain for Americans in this income grouping. Part of Trump’s plan, however, calls for the stoppage of taxes on Social Security benefits. The Tax Foundation projected retirees who earn between $55,000 and $137,000 to be the biggest winners, the Wharton research project found. Trump return likely to slow, not stop, US clean-energy boom Income bracket: $138,000 Income category: Upper Middle Class Income gain under Trump: 2.8% or $3,970 Wharton analysis: This group represents the first to see a bigger financial gain than under the Harris proposal. With Trump planning to extend provisions of his 2017 signature plan, Wharton researchers found that the upper middle class would see significant benefits under Trump. By extending the cuts beyond 2025, earners in this income bracket would see lower tax rates and a doubling of the standard deduction, the Wharton report said. Under the Trump plan, the standard deduction would jump to $24,000 from $13,000 for couples and to $12,000 from $6,500 for single residents. Income bracket: $327,000 Income category: Top professional earners Income gain under Trump: 2.7% or $9,020 Wharton analysis: Researchers found that like the upper middle class, this income bracket would also see significant benefits from the extension of the 2017 Trump plan. The Trump initiative raised the threshold of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Before 2017, Wharton researchers, citing the Tax Policy Center, found that about 18% of workers earning between $200,000 and $500,000 paid the AMT. After the Trump plan went into effect, less than 1% were affected by the AMT. Income bracket: $1.8 million Income category: Top 99% Income gain under Trump: 2.6% or $47,220 Wharton analysis: By extending the 2017 plan, earners in this wage bracket saw the top income tax rate drop from 39.6 to 37%, which resulted in a tax cut of nearly $50,000, the Wharton project found. In addition, business owners who earn $1.8 million benefit from a 20% deduction for qualified business income, the Wharton group reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trumps-tax-plan-american-incomes/	2024-11-06T11:42:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Trump-ElectionNight.jpg?w=900
Here are the key races that haven't been called yet	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is projected to win a second term in the White House, but the outcomes of other hotly contested races remain unclear as election officials tally votes Wednesday. Election night 2024 live results: Donald Trump projected to win presidency The fates of several House and Senate seats were also uncertain as totals continued to roll in from precincts throughout the country. Election officials publish unofficial results after the polls close on Election Day, but those results will fluctuate as officials count in-person, mail-in, provisional, overseas and military ballots. Each state has its own rules for when different kinds of ballots can be counted. Throughout election night and — in some states — several days later, unofficial results will periodically change to reflect those totals. US Senate races Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, and Republican Kari Lake are competing for Arizona's open Senate seat. Green Party candidate Eduardo Quintana is also campaigning for the role. Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is seeking reelection over Republican challenger Sam Brown. Pennsylvania Republican David McCormick is challenging Democrat incumbent Sen. Bob Casey Jr. in a race that could influence which party controls the Senate. House races Alaska Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaskan Native woman to represent the state in Congress, is seeking reelection to Alaska’s only at-large congressional district.

Watch Live: New York AG Letitia James on Trump sentencing	(NewsNation) — New York State Attorney General Letitia James will speak about the status of the case against President-elect Donald Trump. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26 for his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. While Trump could pardon himself in the federal crimes of which he's accused, he has no power to pardon himself on the conviction in New York, nor the 2020-related crimes he faces in Georgia. When will House results come out? In September, a federal judge swiftly rejected Trump’s request to move the case to federal court so that he could seek to have his conviction overturned in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said the defense failed to meet the high burden of proof for changing jurisdiction and that Trump’s conviction for falsifying business records involved his personal life, not official actions that the Supreme Court ruled are immune from prosecution.

How much of the vote did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receive?	(NewsNation) — After encouraging his supporters not to vote for him, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. received nearly 594,000 (about 0.4% of the popular vote) and zero electoral votes. RFK Jr. was on the ballot in every state except Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming. In late October, the Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal to remove RFK Jr. from the presidential ballot in two battleground states. Who could be part of Donald Trump’s second administration? Kennedy wanted to get off the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan after dropping his independent bid and endorsing Republican Donald Trump. He argued that keeping him on violated his First Amendment rights by wrongly implying he still wanted to be elected president. Michigan and Wisconsin said removing his name so late in the election season, with early voting already underway at the time, would be impossible. More than 1.5 million people in Michigan had already returned absentee ballots, and another 264,000 had voted early, state attorneys wrote in court documents. In Wisconsin, over 858,000 people have returned absentee ballots. The justices did not detail their reason in an order rejecting the emergency appeal, as is typical. One justice, Neil Gorsuch, publicly dissented in the Michigan case. RFK Jr. suspended his independent campaign in August. Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines off the market Kennedy said his internal polls had shown that his presence in the race would hurt Trump and help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Kennedy cited free speech, the war in Ukraine and 'a war on our children' as among the reasons he would try to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states. Prior to Donald Trump’s Nov. 5 victory, Kennedy said Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies like the Food and Drug Administration or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should he win the 2024 presidential election. 'He’s asked me to clean up the corruption number one,' Kennedy said during a town hall with NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'Number two, end the conflicts of interest, return those agencies to their rich tradition of gold standard, empirically-based, evidence-based science, evidence-based medicine, and to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country.'

Kamala Harris to address the nation Wednesday	(NewsNation) — A top Kamala Harris aide told attendees at the campaign’s gathering Tuesday night that the vice president plans to address the nation on Wednesday. 'Thank you for believing in the promise of America ... We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight...' Harris campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said. Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon sent out a letter to staff on Tuesday night, assuring them that the current closeness of the race was 'exactly what we prepared for.' In the email, Dillon said staff have known all along that this is a 'razor-thin race.' Donald Trump projected to win presidential election for second time 'While we continue to see data trickle in from the Sun Belt states, we have known all along that our clearest path to 270 electoral votes lies through the Blue Wall states,' O'Malley Dillon wrote. 'And we feel good about what we’re seeing.' Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to win a presidential election for a second time, as NewsNation/ Decision Desk HQ projects he will win Pennsylvania. Speaking to supporters at around 1:30 a.m. CT Wednesday, Trump said, 'This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before. 'Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,' Trump said. 'There’s never been anything like this in this country and maybe beyond, and now it’s going to reach a new level of importance because we’re going to help our country heal.' Trump’s running mate and now Vice President-elect JD Vance, who also spoke, called the former president’s win the greatest political comeback 'in the history of the United States of America.' 'He turned out to be a good choice,' Trump said of Vance.

When will House results come out?	(NewsNation) — With former President Donald Trump projected as winning the 2024 presidential election and the Republican Party flipping the Senate, Democrats' last hope for a foothold in Washington now rests in the House of Representatives. Track the balance of power in Congress Why are the results for the House taking so long? Several key states, including California and New York, will continue counting mail ballots received after Election Day, provided they were postmarked by Nov. 5. This legal framework means final results in these crucial contests could take days or even weeks to determine. California, the nation's most populated state, with its high volume of mail ballots and voter-friendly counting rules, traditionally takes weeks to process all votes. With multiple competitive House races in California still undecided, the final balance of power might not be known until late November, according to a few estimates. Key US House races to watch on election night Path to control the House The magic number remains 218 seats for either party to claim the majority, currently held by Republicans under Speaker Mike Johnson. The Democrats' path to victory requires picking up at least four seats net. So far, Republicans have been able to flip two seats, with many holding on to their seats.

Who could be part of Donald Trump's second administration?	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump has secured a White House win and now will need to mull over who will join him for his second administration. While he hasn’t confirmed anyone, several names have been swirling as possible contenders. At the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original Cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible — a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Here’s who could join his administration: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. RFK Jr. said Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if he wins the 2024 presidential election. 'He’s asked me to clean up the corruption, number one,' Kennedy said during a town hall with NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'Number two, end the conflicts of interest, return those agencies to their rich tradition of gold standard, empirically based, evidence-based science, evidence-based medicine, and to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country.' Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks as he endorses Republican presidential nominee former President Trump at a campaign rally at the Desert Diamond Arena, Aug. 23, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. Kennedy ran as first a Democrat and later an independent in the election before dropping out and endorsing Trump. Trump said he would let Kennedy 'go wild' on issues related to food, medicine and health if elected to another term. Kennedy, in the past, has disseminated false information about health topics such as vaccines and is known for spreading conspiracy theories, as well. Because of this, NewsNation partner The Hill reports that medical experts have raised concerns about Kennedy’s potential influence in a future Trump administration. Elon Musk Trump has said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would probably be too busy to serve in his Cabinet if he wins the election in November but suggested the billionaire tech mogul could 'consult.'

Now, look, he’s running big businesses and all that, so, he can’t really, I don’t think he’d be [free] for the Cabinet,' Trump said in an interview on the 'Shawn Ryan Show.' 'I’d put him in the Cabinet, absolutely, but I don’t know how he could do that with all the things he’s got going,' he continued. 'But he could sort of, as the expression goes, consult with the country and give you some very good ideas.' Trump said in September he would create a 'government efficiency commission' first proposed by Musk, whom Trump said agreed to lead the new task force. Close Thank you for signing up!

How NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ called Pennsylvania for Trump	(NewsNation) — NewsNation was the first outlet to call the race in Pennsylvania for Donald Trump and as a result, was also able to call the race to the White House for Trump, immediately after. NewsNation's race call partner has issued a statement on how this call was made. Read the full statement below: Decision Desk HQ’s Statement on Our Pennsylvania Race Call Decision Desk HQ projects that former President Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, enough to elect him as the 47th President of the United States.How we made this race call: We deeply value information-sharing and transparency so the public knows they can trust our results. At the time of this race call, 93% of the vote in Pennsylvania was in – including mail-in ballots and Election Day votes. The data showed: In Philadelphia County and collar counties, including Bucks County, Montgomery County, and Chester County, President Trump was over-performing his 2020 results by more than 5% in each county. President Trump was over-performing his 2020 results in rural counties across Pennsylvania by more than 10%. Despite matching President Joe Biden’s 2020 margin in the Pittsburgh area and surrounding Allegheny County, Vice President Kamala Harris’s vote percentages were insufficient to overcome former President Trump’s gains elsewhere across the state. Bellwether counties, including Erie County, Centre County, and Monroe County, all went for President Biden in 2020, but flipped to President Trump in 2024.

Donald Trump projected to win presidential race	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump is projected to win a presidential election for a second time, as NewsNation/ Decision Desk HQ projects he will win Pennsylvania. Trump faced off against the Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris in a tight and highly contentious race. With Trump’s projected win, the Republicans will regain control of the White House four years after he lost to President Joe Biden in 2020. Trump will become the oldest president to be elected to the White House at 78 years old. President Joe Biden was previously the oldest president to be elected at 77. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: Track results live He will enter the White House with a Republican-controlled Senate, NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ projects. Trump showed an early lead as polls started closing in the East Coast with the 'red mirage.' With early wins in swing states Georgia and North Carolina, Pennsylvania gave him the final electoral votes to seize the 270 needed to secure the presidency. On his way to 270 electoral votes, the Republican candidate won Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Wyoming, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, West Virginia, Montana, Idaho and Utah. The victory comes just months after Harris entered the race in late July after Biden suspended his campaign. This campaign season, Trump has been the target of two assassination attempts. In July, a gunman fired and struck Trump while on stage during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service returned fire, killing the gunman, Thomas Crooks. In September, an alleged would-be gunman was positioned outside one of Trump’s golf courses before the Secret Service fired at him. The suspect, Ryan Routh, pleaded not guilty to assassination attempt charges. Despite the attempts on his life and numerous legal battles after being indicted four times on various charges, Trump remained defiant in his campaign for a second term in the White House. 'Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country,' Trump predicted during a 93-minute speech accepting the Republican nomination for president in Milwaukee, which just took place less than a week after the Pennsylvania rally. 'Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.' Where are Trump and Harris right now? On the campaign trail, Trump focused on border security and the economy, blaming Biden and Harris for the number of immigrants who have crossed into the U.S. illegally since 2021. Trump targeted Harris, saying she had failed as Biden’s 'border czar' while also blaming the current administration for allowing inflation to soar out of control. Trump and Harris faced each other in only one presidential debate, where both took jabs at one another on several key policies. Despite being pressed by Harris to participate in a second debate, Trump declined, saying he had already participated in two debates, counting the one in Atlanta against Biden. Trump said that a second debate with Harris would be too late, citing the fact early voting had already begun in several states. Trump will take office in January after Biden finishes his term. He’s already pledged to address the ongoing crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that he will begin mass deportations of illegal immigrants.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-president-wins-president-second-term/	2024-11-05T22:25:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/WIN-Trump-16x9-1.jpg?w=900
Donald Trump projected to win Pennsylvania	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is projected to win Pennsylvania, taking 19 electoral votes in the crucial swing state, according to NewsNation/Decision Decision Desk HQ. See the results of the presidential race in other states here. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump had been neck and neck in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, leading up to the election, according to polling by NewsNation partner The Hill. Pennsylvania voters favored the Democrats in six straight elections prior to 2016, but Trump won the state that year by 0.7 percentage points. Biden clinched Pennsylvania back for Democrats in 2020 by 1.2 points. Pennsylvania lost an electoral vote from 2020 to 2024, going from 20 to 19 as the population declined. An October survey by Emerson College Polling and The Hill found the economy was the top issue for Pennsylvania, followed by threats to democracy and immigration. Much of Harris’ and Trump’s strategy was to reach out to the state’s rural voters, who typically lean red. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. The Harris campaign hired a rural engagement director to make additional inroads into those communities. In addition, Harris tried to reassemble the coalition behind Biden’s winning campaign, including college students, Black voters and women animated by protecting abortion rights. Trump drilled into his support for fracking — extracting oil and natural gas from underground formations. It’s a key issue in Pennsylvania, which is the second biggest producer of natural gas in the country behind Texas. The state holds over 100,000 jobs, and the industry has an economic impact of $41 billion. Harris has said she will not ban fracking. Meanwhile, Trump was the target of an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania’s Butler County in July. A gunman shot at the former president with a rifle from the roof of a building near the rally stage. Trump was hit in the ear and rushed off stage. One rally attendee was killed, and two more were injured. The gunman, Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by the Secret Service.

What is a 'red mirage'? Is it happening now?	(NewsNation) — Quick ballot counts could cause Election Day mirages, and they may not be good indicators of the candidate who will win. An Election Day 'red' or 'blue mirage' is when a candidate leads early after the polls close until other methods of votes are counted. NewsNation's political editor, Chris Stirewalt, says what appears to be shifts in voting patterns through election night is actually just a predictable pattern based on how different areas count their votes. 'It doesn't matter which piece you put in, first or last in a puzzle. It doesn't change the picture. The image remains the same,' Stirewalt said. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: Track results live It’s important to wait until all ballots are counted because the swing states tend to sway both ways throughout the day. Is the 'red mirage' happening now? Former President Donald Trump had an early lead right after polls started closing on the East Coast with wins in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. The votes in the crucial state of Pennsylvania are still being counted to determine a winner. The 'red mirage' phenomenon is an expectation that Republican voters are more likely to cast their ballots in person, whereas Democrats are more likely to vote by mail. That dynamic can result in GOP candidates seeing an early lead that later fades as mail-in ballots are counted. While the 'red mirage' is creating confidence among Republican supporters, NewsNation political analysts discuss how Vice President Kamala Harris is trending well in Michigan, Wisconsin and possibly Pennsylvania, which could swing the momentum back toward the Democrats. Pennsylvania doesn’t require counties to report their mail-in votes first, and they aren’t allowed to start processing those votes until Election Day. 'We are in for a car crash tonight because it's close,' Stirewalt said, suggesting that both parties will have moments of optimism and anxiety as various regions report their results through the night. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Rural areas count their votes faster since they have fewer ballots to process, less crowded precincts and shorter lines. 'The Hill Sunday' host described how vote counting moves from 'outside in,' starting with rural areas, then moving through suburbs and finally reaching dense urban centers. NewsNation is providing live results tracking on major races nationwide powered by Decision Desk HQ. Watch live results from the presidential election, important swing states and the balance of power in Congress. NewsNation will also be tracking your local state electionsand ballot initiatives on issues like abortionand minimum wage around the country. 'The less populous parts of the country count faster because the precincts aren't as crowded,' Stirewalt said. 'There aren't as many ballots to count in individual places, and the lines aren't as long in all of these places.' In Virginia, despite Trump leading in raw vote totals, the remaining votes are from Democratic strongholds like Fairfax and Henrico counties. 'Red mirage' during the 2020 election Stirewalt, who is also a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, explained that in 2020, the red mirage was amplified due to the high number of Democratic voters using mail-in and early voting, which skewed early results in favor of Republicans. This election's core battleground remains in the upper Midwest states along what Stirewalt calls 'the I-70 corridor' into Michigan and Wisconsin. While noting that Trump is performing better in key areas than in 2020, the political editor indicated current numbers suggest performance below 2016 levels.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/red-mirage-blue-mirage-is-it-happening/	2024-11-05T18:47:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-1962444959.jpg?w=900

Russia behind bomb threats against Georgia precincts, officials s...	(NewsNation) — A series of non-credible bomb threats targeting Georgia polling sites 'were of Russian origin,' Georgia Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger said. Five non-credible threats temporarily evacuated two Fulton County, Georgia, precincts for about 30 minutes each,' Fulton County Election Director Nadine Williams said at a morning news conference. Track your state’s election results 'Thankfully, these locations are now operational again and all polling sites are secure with an active security presence,' she said. Authorities including Georgia state officials and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are investigating the claims and say it’s safe for voting to continue. ​​ The FBI acknowledged the threats and said in a statement that none of them are credible so far. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Raffensperger criticized Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere with the election. 'We identified the source and it was from Russia … ' Raffensperger said during a separate morning news conference, which the FBI later confirmed. 'They’re up to mischief it seems and they don’t want us to have a smooth, fair and accurate election.' 'They think they can get us to fight among ourselves and they count that as a victory,' he continued. 'So that tells you a little bit about the Russians. They’re not our friends. Anyone who thinks they are hasn’t been reading the newspapers.' NewsNation has reached out to the South Fulton Police Department in Georgia for additional comments. What time do the polls close in my state? U.S. adversaries are intensifying disinformation efforts and promoting false claims about voter fraud, intelligence officials warned Monday. Safety measures are in place. Around the nation, about 60 national guardsmen from six states have been activated for election support, Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder said. Roughly 600 guardsmen from 17 states are also on standby. The lines were moving quickly Tuesday morning in Georgia, with check-in times under one minute in some locations. Voters cast more than 29,500 ballots across Fulton County’s 177 polling sites as of 9:40 a.m. ET, Williams said. This story is developing.

Live results of swing states nationwide	(NewsNation) — Seven pivotal states are being closely watched on Tuesday as these could deliver either presidential candidate the final Electoral College votes needed to secure a victory. See the results of the presidential race in all 50 states here. Swing states, sometimes referred to as battleground states, are a critical part of a presidential candidate’s path to 270 electoral votes. This year these states are: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been neck-and-neck in nearly all major swing state polls, leading both to blitz the highly contested states in their final days of campaigning. Swing states are typically up for grabs for both parties’ candidates, changing election cycle to cycle, and often have the ability to sway the outcome of the election. To win the presidency, a candidate must get 270 electoral votes of the available 538. In 48 states along with Washington, D.C. the winning candidate gets all the electoral votes allocated to that state, but in Maine and Nebraska, electors are assigned using a proportional system.

Live results: Balance of power in Congress	(NewsNation) — The balance of power could shift in both chambers of Congress on Election Day, led by several toss-up races that could determine which party holds power in the federal legislature. See the results of the presidential election here. A total of 34 U.S. Senate seats will be determined on Election Day, with Democrats and Independents representing 23 of those races. Democrats are vying to hold on to the slim majority they have held in the upper chamber of Congress for the past two years.

Meanwhile, Republicans hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives with 220 seats over the Democrats who held 212 and three seats being vacant into Tuesday’s election. While there were hundreds of races, just a tenth of the races were deemed competitive, according to the Cook Political Report.

Key US Senate races to watch on election night	(NewsNation) — Control of the Senate is up for grabs on Tuesday as more than a dozen critical races could shift the balance of power between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have held the slimmest of majorities for the last two years with Vice President Kamala Harris playing tiebreaker on 50-50 votes, but control could be upended. A total of 34 Senate seats are up for re-election with Democrats and Independents representing 23 of those races. For Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate, they’d need nearly all incumbents to win reelection and party members to win open seats in Arizona, Michigan and Maryland. Meanwhile, Republicans only need two seats in total to take the majority. Polling in the months leading up to the general election has shown Republicans favored to win back control in the Senate, with Democrats defending their seats in some of the tougher-to-hold battleground states, including in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Click on your state to see results as they come in. You can also scroll to the bottom to see each state's results. Trump and Harris spent the final days of their respective campaigns neck-and-neck in national polling and election forecasts. Neither candidate’s lead in the seven swing states was outside of the margin of error, creating a virtual deadlock. Both candidates focused their stretch-run campaign rallies on states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia – all of which are expected to factor into who is declared the winner.

Political experts told NewsNation that due to the razor-thin margins separating Trump and Harris, voters may not know who the next president will be possibly for days. Heading into the final week leading up to the election, NewsNation partner Decision Desk HQ predicted that Trump had a 54% chance of winning the presidency. Harris maintained a slim lead in the national polls, but Decision Desk HQ President Drew McCoy told NewsNation that several factors gave the edge to Trump. Despite the forecast that seemed to favor Trump, McCoy said that Harris held a similar advantage a couple of weeks prior, making the presidential race essentially a toss-up. Haris made her closing argument to American voters a week before Tuesday’s election. The Vice President delivered the speech from the same site where Trump stirred up supporters after he was defeated by Biden and that came ahead of the riots at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. 2021. 'There’s a big difference between he and I,' Harris told reporters last week. 'If he were elected, on day one he’s going to sit in the Oval Office working on his enemies list. On day one, if I am elected, which I fully expect to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

He also accused his Democratic opponent of spearheading a campaign of hate in the days leading up to Tuesday. Trump, who was shot in the ear in an attempt on his life during a Pennsylvania campaign rally just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, spent much of his campaign insulting and criticizing Harris’ tenure as Biden’s vice president. Trump also referred to his recent rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City as a 'lovefest' amid criticism that the event included sexist and racist comments and that was overshadowed by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage.' Trump claimed two days after the rally that he did not hear the comments. Harris remained focused on the future and asked voters at her rallies to 'turn the page' on Trump while focusing on undecided voters in the critical swing states that were expected to determine the nation’s next president. Harris also attempted to win over undecided voters over what the future would look like with her as president amid criticism that a Harris victory would simply mean an extension of Biden’s presidency.

Key US House races to watch on election night	(NewsNation) — All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for grabs on Tuesday with about two dozen being highly competitive and prone to flips. This election will be crucial for both parties who are battling for the balance of power. The GOP has a narrow majority in the House with 220 seats over the Democrats who held 212 and three seats being vacant prior to Tuesday’s election. Republicans had taken back the House by a slim margin during the 2022 midterm elections, flipping key seats in Washington, New York and California. In 15 House races in 2022, winners came out on top with fewer than 2 percentage points and this year seven of those races were rematches between incumbents and the same challengers. While there were hundreds of races, just a tenth of the races were deemed competitive, according to the Cook Political Report. Twenty-five were considered toss-ups with 11 of the seats held by Democrats and 14 by Republicans, and 17 races were rated as either leaning Democratic or leaning Republican.

Bill O'Reilly: Trump would be up '10 points' if I ran campaign	(NewsNation) — Bill O'Reilly believes Donald Trump would be 'up by 10 points' if he was running the former president's campaign. 'I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's absolutely true,' O'Reilly said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'I have a good rapport with Trump. I'd give him a Plan B. … A Plan B, he'll consider, because everything is a negotiation.' Trump’s nephew warns of unchecked power in a second Trump term OReilly says President Biden's recent 'garbage' comment 'saved' Trump by taking the heat off of the negative comments made about Puerto Rico by a comedian at an earlier Trump rally. But O'Reilly adds that Trump's own comments at his rallies have hurt him at times. 'Trump has run out of gas,' O'Reilly said. 'Trump's always been an entertainer as well as a politician. That's not a good combination. ... Trump wants to be funny at his rallies. ... It worked at the beginning, but now I think it's hurting him.' Some political strategists believe comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who made a controversial joke calling Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' last week in addition to other crass and bigoted remarks, could cost Trump the election. 'Every Puerto Rican in Pennsylvania has heard about the garbage comment. They all know about it,' said former Republican strategist Mark McKinnon. McKinnon said he thinks the 'garbage' comment is energizing voters who otherwise would not have turned out to cast ballots. Meanwhile, Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said the 'joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Trump, speaking at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort last week, referred to his rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden as a 'lovefest' despite criticisms it was racist and insulting. Other speakers during the Madison Square Garden rally preshow made comments targeting Latinos, Black people, Jewish people and Palestinians as well as sexist insults targeting Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump responded that everyone was happy and excited to be at the New York event and called critics ridiculous for tying it to a 1939 Nazi rally. Instead, Trump said that for him and his campaign, thousands of people were looking to be together and talk about how they wanted to change America. What Election Night trends could provide early clues on results? Vice President Harris and Trump are deadlocked in key swing states, according to a survey released Monday. Polling from Emerson College Polling and The Hill released before Election Day shows Harris and Trump in a tight set of matchups in the battleground states. Trump holds an edge in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, while Harris has the edge in Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/bill-oreilly-donald-trump-campaign/	2024-11-04T18:18:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/38ADF2B18821469B5B96EE308BB24226.jpg?w=728
Stirewalt breaks down what to expect with election night results	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris only have a few hours left to make their final appeals to voters ahead of the election. With 270 electoral votes needed to win, each candidate’s path to victory appears distinct. Key states and poll closing times The first crucial presidential election results will emerge from Georgia when polls close at 7 p.m. ET, with election analysts watching Forsyth County in suburban Atlanta for early signs of Trump's strength among affluent voters. North Carolina follows shortly after, with Nash County serving as a key indicator. The working-class region, with its 40 to 45% Black population, could signal whether Harris successfully mobilized Black voters. 4 potential paths to victory in the 2024 election The 8 p.m. ET rush of results positions Pennsylvania as the potential decider, with Erie County serving as the state's traditional bellwether. Erie's results have accurately predicted the statewide winner in the past two presidential cycles. By 9 p.m. ET, Michigan takes center stage, particularly three counties surrounding Detroit and Kent County near Grand Rapids. Trump's decision to end his campaign in Grand Rapids — as he did in previous races — underscores the region's importance in securing moderate Republican voters. Election experts predict a winner could emerge between midnight and 4 a.m. Eastern. Early results from Georgia and North Carolina, expected by 9:30 p.m., could provide strong indicators of the national outcome. Both states' efficient vote-counting systems typically deliver 80% of results by early evening, potentially offering clear signals of voter trends before the slower-counting Midwest states report their totals. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Trump and Harris paths to victory Harris faces a mathematically simpler path, needing only to defend traditionally Democratic states to reach 270 electoral votes. She could win without either North Carolina or Georgia if she maintains the Democratic Midwest firewall. Trump's route proves more challenging, requiring him to flip at least one traditionally Democratic state. While showing strength in Arizona, he needs either Pennsylvania or a combination of Michigan and Wisconsin plus Arizona or Nevada to secure victory.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/stirewalt-election-night-results/	2024-11-04T16:47:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/snapshot_aeba71.jpg?w=900
How do I know if my mail-in vote was counted?	(NewsNation) — Several states across the United States allow their constituents to vote by mail, which can make the voting process far more streamlined for individuals. However, there have been concerns that mail-in, or absentee, ballots are inefficient or may be unable to be counted. Voters can request their ballots via USA.gov and Vote.org. They can also track their ballot status here. How to register to vote With Election Day closing in, NewsNation has all you need to know about mail-in voting. What to know about mail-in ballots Dating back to the Civil War, mail-in voting has been an institution of U.S. elections. The frequency of mail-in voting increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are varying ways in which someone can qualify for mail voting; absentee voting (excuse or no-excuse) and standardized mail voting. Which states allow mail-in voting? Every state allows mail-in voting, but the degree to which varies. Where are Trump, Harris, Vance and Walz campaigning today? All-mail elections occur predominantly on the West Coast. This means constituents will receive a ballot at their residence and can mail in their ballots, or vote in person. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington all allow mail voting under all circumstances. The only other state in the nation to have such practices is Vermont. Washington D.C. also allows all-mail voting. Twenty-eight states have a no-excuse absentee policy, meaning voters don't need to explain themselves to receive a mail-in ballot. These include Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Which states don't allow mail-in ballots? All states allow absentee voting, but a worthy excuse must be provided in the following states: Alabama: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, working during voting hours, student living outside of the county, election worker, incarcerated (not convicted of 'moral turpitude'), aged 65+, caregiver, military service, religious beliefs/practice. Arkansas: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, uniformed services member. Connecticut: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, election worker, armed forces member, religious beliefs/practice. Delaware: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, working during voting hours, religious beliefs/practice, armed forces member. Indiana: Illness/disability, caregiver, out of the county, work, religious reasons, aged 65+, election worker, armed forces or public safety officer, 'serious sex offender', state address confidentiality program. When does early voting begin in my state? Kentucky: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, state address confidentiality program, elderly age. Louisiana: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiver, state address confidentiality program, elderly age, military forces, aged 65+, involuntary confinement, incarceration, jury duty, religious practices. Is USPS prepared for the 2024 election? Mississippi: Out of county, illness/disability, aged 65+, work, caregivers, incarceration for a non-disenfranchising crime. Missouri: Out of county, illness/disability, religious beliefs/practices, election worker, essential worker, incarceration, state address confidentiality program. New Hampshire: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiving, work, religious beliefs/practices, incarceration, state address confidentiality program, protected by domestic violence protective order. South Carolina: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiving, work, aged 65+, incarceration, armed forces. Tennessee: Out of county, illness/disability, caregiving, work, aged 60+, reside in a nursing home, religious beliefs/practices, election worker, jury duty, military member. Texas: Out of county, illness/disability, work, expectant within three weeks before or after Election Day, incarceration. West Virginia: Out of county, illness/disability, work, state address confidentiality program, incarceration, first responder. How are mail-in votes counted? According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in 31 states voters must sign an affidavit on their ballot envelope which helps ballot workers verify their signature against their voter registration record. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Ten states require a copy of personal identification or the ballot to be notarized or have a witness signature — Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. Ten other states — Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming — plus Washington D.C., verify that a signature is on an absentee, but do not verify the signature itself. What are the pros and cons of mail-in voting? Proponents of absentee voting suggest it is a more cost-effective measure than in-person voting. It also allows for greater convenience and increased participation, particularly for those who would not be able to vote due to work or geographical constraints, among others. The primary concern of mail-in and absentee voting is the integrity of elections and the threat of voter fraud. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

However that notion can be countered by earlier voters tending to be more partisan compared to undecided voters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/mail-in-absentee-voting-how/	2024-11-04T13:39:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2175014852.jpg?w=900
Are ballot selfies illegal?	(NewsNation) — Some enthusiastic voters may have to resist the urge to post a photo of their marked ballot this election season as many states ban sharing ballot selfies. Sharing selfies of completed ballots has become a way some voters show who they supported, but concerns over coercion and even bribery have led at least 14 states to make it illegal. Voting in secret has long been a staple in American history, but the explosion of social media and ballot selfies has caused the secrecy issue to resurface, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Three governors races to watch this November Some free speech groups say voters should be able to share ballot selfies, which has forced lawmakers to weigh free speech against concerns of maintaining order against bribery, coercion and the risk of exposing others’ ballots. There is no federal law regulating ballot selfies, leaving the issue up to each individual state. What states make ballot selfies illegal? At least 14 states have made it illegal to take a ballot selfie, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. These include Alaska, Montana, Illinois, Nevada, South Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, West Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. In Texas and Tennessee, ballot selfies during in-person voting are illegal, but there is no law prohibiting or allowing absentee ballot selfies, according to the group. In Michigan, voters can post photos of their marked ballot as long as they don’t share them while they are at the polling place. However, voters cannot include themselves in the photo with their ballot. Many other states do not have explicit laws on ballot selfies, including Oregon, Idaho, Kansas and Maine.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Many government officials have defended the restrictions, saying they could lead to a host of other problems for voters. Former Idaho Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck told Vox in 2020 that he worries that in the age of 'cancel culture,' if 'a secret ballot were breached, if people knew how other people were voting,' there could be consequences. A spokesperson for Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft told the outlet that 'the secrecy of your ballot ensures that there cannot be voter intimidation.' Intimidation is also cited as a reason to preserve secrecy. In 2020, a Florida company president sent a letter in his employees’ paystubs that told them layoffs could be imminent if 'Biden and the Democrats win,' KTRK-TV reported. The outlet noted that 'some employees ... feel they were threatened with being laid off if they did not support President Donald Trump.' Where are ballot selfies legal? Several states have gone in the opposite direction and explicitly allowed voters to share ballot photos. These states include California, Washington, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Iowa, Alabama, Hawaii, Kentucky, Virginia and New Hampshire. 'Sharing a ballot selfie is a magnificent display of civic participation,' Marc Levine, the member of the California State Assembly who led the charge on amending the law in 2016 to allow ballot photos, told The New York Times. Some groups pushing for ballot selfies to be legal in every state say the original intent to preserve secrecy was designed to prevent vote-selling and voter coercion, but that is no longer the case. The net worth of richest Congress members 'The evil it was trying to address was a union boss or employer following workers into a polling place and making them show who they voted for,' Leo Glickman, a lawyer who argued that the law violates the right to freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, told the outlet. But there’s no evidence that is happening today, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said. The group says that no state has offered even a single example of someone taking and sharing a ballot selfie for the purpose of committing a crime. What is the punishment for posting illegally? Punishments for posting ballot selfies in states where it's illegal vary by each state. In Nevada, a violation is a felony with a sentence of one to four years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. In Illinois, it's a Class 4 felony, which carries penalties of one to three years in prison and a maximum fine of $25,000. A selfie post will get a voter 'not more than six months [in prison] or by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars' in Massachusetts.

Election officials asked her to take down her post, but Hogarth refused and filed a lawsuit against the state Board of Elections over the letter.

How are presidential election votes counted?	(NewsNation) — Finalizing the results of a presidential election is often a slower process than voters realize — a misunderstanding that makes it easier for misinformation to take root. As Nov. 5 draws near, former President Donald Trump is repeating claims about voter fraud and planting new seeds of doubt about the process this time around. Violent threats against poll workers increasing ahead of election Here’s how the ballot counting process works and what you can expect on election night. When do election officials start counting votes? Election officials publish unofficial results after the polls close on Election Day. Those results will fluctuate as in-person, mail-in, provisional, overseas and military ballots are counted. Each state has its own rules for when different kinds of ballots can be counted. Throughout election night and — in some states — several days later, unofficial results will periodically change to reflect those totals. How are ballots counted? Election officials need to process mail-in ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. Trump and Harris pledged to save Social Security. Here’s what they’ll do. While some states begin processing mail-in votes before Election Day, others can process them the same day as the election before polls close. Once those ballots are processed, how and when they’re counted and reflected in live, unofficial results vary greatly. When will the presidential election results be final? Results you see the night of the election, the next morning, and often weeks later are always unofficial. It typically takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Before anything is official, a joint session of Congress must take place to count the Electoral College votes for president and vice president. Why does it take so long to finalize election results? Once election officials in each jurisdiction receive every ballot, they need to canvass them. That usually means analyzing vote totals to find and fix any discrepancies between the number of voters and the number of ballots cast, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. What to know about poll watchers Most states also conduct audits as an extra measure to make sure their totals are accurate. Once canvasses and audits are done, the election results are certified as final. Can election results change after votes are certified and final? Yes. Some races may be subject to a recount after the certification process if it was a close call or if a candidate or interest group requests it. In those cases, every ballot in a contest is recounted and could hypothetically change the official results. Recounts have flipped the results in three non-presidential races. They helped Al Franken win his Minnesota Senate seat in 2008 and led Thomas Salmon to secure his role as Vermont state auditor in 2006. Christine Gregorie was also declared the winner of the Washington gubernatorial race in 2004 after a recount. All three candidates were Democrats.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/how-are-presidential-election-votes-counted/	2024-11-04T13:36:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2059253561.jpg?w=900
What to know about poll watchers	(NewsNation) — Thousands of poll watchers will be observing the election process this November in an effort to catch any irregularities. These volunteers have long served an integral role as the eyes and ears for political parties to ensure that the actual mechanics of voting are administered fairly and accurately. In the years since former President Donald Trump made unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020, the Republican National Committee has said that it hopes to recruit 100,000 poll watchers in 13 states this year. The party said it will deploy monitors to observe every step of the election process, create hotlines for poll watchers to report perceived problems and escalate those issues by taking legal action. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Both parties have a long history of organizing supporters to serve as poll monitors, and the Democratic National Committee said it plans its own volunteer recruitment effort. Several election officials in presidential swing states said they feel this kind of transparency and engagement is one of the best ways to help skeptics feel confident in the many safeguards baked into the election process. Research shows that fraud is very rare, voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent, and many instances of alleged fraud are, in fact, mistakes by voters or administrators, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan institute at the New York University School of Law. What do poll watchers report? Watchers are appointed by political parties, candidates or ballot issue groups to observe some portion of the election process without interfering in the voting process, according to the Election Assistance Commission. They must go through a training program on election rules before manning polls. Watcher duties vary under state law but largely include keeping track of voter turnout for their parties and making sure that the election rules are being followed. How to register to vote In some states, watchers are allowed to challenge an individual voter’s eligibility and report any potential issues. However, no states allow poll watchers to stop or otherwise try to interfere with someone trying to vote. They do their jobs by flagging issues for the current authorities, who will then look into the claims. Poll watchers have played an integral role in the election process. After the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, watchers were able to monitor elections to help realize the law’s promise of rooting out voting discrimination in places that still sought to suppress Black voters, according to the Brennan Center. Who can be a poll watcher? Qualifications vary by state, but poll watchers generally must be registered voters, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In most states, political parties, candidates and ballot issue committees can appoint poll watchers. In some states, organizations and civic groups can also appoint poll watchers, according to the organization. States differ on whether the poll watcher must be registered in the county or precinct rather than just in the state. Several states exclude law enforcement officers from being poll watchers. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Many states also limit the number of poll watchers at a voting location to ensure the voting process is not disrupted and may be explicit about what a poll watcher may and may not do at a polling location. When poll watchers become disruptive While poll watchers are supposed to be silent observers they can and have run the risk of disruption. Their access to spaces and records that are otherwise off-limits to the public creates a risk of abuse, according to the Brennan Center. Watchers can also cross the line with voter intimidation, harassment of election workers, the spread of disinformation and coordinated efforts to undermine elections, the group said. During Texas’s 2020 elections, a poll watcher accused a voter of not looking like a U.S. citizen and demanded to see their ID, the Brennan Center reported. In Arizona’s Pima County's early voting period in 2022, watchers complained loudly about 'fraudulent elections' and repeatedly tried to view private voter data, according to Time. When does early voting begin in my state? Election workers in Wayne County, North Carolina, had to move watchers who stood between voters and voting machines in 2022. 'You need to back off!' Anne Risku, the election director in North Carolina’s Wayne County, told a poll watcher who wedged herself between a voter and the machine. While there have been concerns about strengthening guardrails for poll watchers, several states have moved in the opposite direction. Florida and North Carolina recently changed their laws to grant watchers additional access. The Florida law has already led to an increase in watchers and subsequent challenges to voter eligibility.

Trump says he'll put ex-NFL player in charge of US missile shield	(The Hill) - Former President Trump told supporters Sunday that he wants to put former NFL player and failed GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker in charge of a new missile defense shield if elected. Walker, a staunch ally of Trump, appeared at a rally in Macon, Ga., where he flubbed the GOP presidential candidate’s name twice. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics 'It is time for it to stop, and it stops on Tuesday when we vote for my friend, and your friend, Donald Trump Jr. — Donald Trump. Jonald J. Trump,' Walker said at the end of his speech. Trump, who spoke after Walker, said if elected, he would 'build a missile defense shield all made in the USA,' and 'put Herschel Walker in charge of that little sucker.' Trump over the past year has declared that he would create an 'Iron Dome' for the United States in a second term, referring to the missile defense system used by Israel. Democrats call for investigation into grocery prices On Sunday, he said 'a lot of' such a system would be built in Georgia. But Iron Dome is used against short-range missiles, and any such system built to protect the U.S. mainland would come with an astronomical price tag and little use in stopping mid- to long-range missiles, such as from North Korea or Russia. It is unclear if Trump meant Walker would be in charge of overseeing all U.S. missile defenses or the process of building a new system. Walker spent 12 seasons in the NFL beginning in the late 1980s before retiring and pursuing business ventures in food processing, with no experience in missile defense or national security. He eventually made his way to politics and served under Trump as a co-chair of the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition from 2019 to 2020. Walker launched his first political campaign in Georgia's 2022 Senate election, during which he supported finishing Trump’s southern border wall and for Washington to 'heavily invest' in the military. Walker’s campaign, however, was plagued by controversies and baffling and false statements. He mistakenly said there were 52 states, falsely claimed he was once an FBI agent, and lied about graduating from the University of Georgia, when in reality he had left to play professional football and did not complete his degree.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-herschel-walker-missile-shield/	2024-11-04T11:27:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24309007583298-e1730746223488.jpg?w=900
Border important issue in battleground states like Arizona	(NewsNation) — Both candidates in the 2024 election have been talking about immigration, with Republican former President Donald Trump promising the country’s largest mass deportations in history and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris arguing to voters she is going to be tough on the border. In battleground border states like Arizona, this is an especially hot topic. Migrants arriving at Yuma in 2021 had to wait for so long for Border Patrol they began walking through the city looking for help. The regional medical center was sitting on more than $26 million in uncompensated migrant care. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Last year, in Lukeville, Arizona, thousands of migrants from Africa came across the border through holes cut in the wall by cartel members. NewsNation crews were there when more than 800 men waiting along the border to be transported were processed. The majority of fentanyl seized last year also came through Arizona. Immigration has had a profound impact on the economy. About 50% of the labor market’s recent growth came from foreign-born workers between January 2023 and January 2024, according to The Economic Policy Institute analysis of federal data. What Trump, Harris have said about the border Trump supporters have linked migrants to the rising cost of housing and said that the number of migrants coming into the country means they're taking jobs from American citizens. Democrats have noted that experts don't agree with Trump's comments on housing prices and say the Republican nominee's mass deportation plan would hurt employment opportunities for all Americans. The Biden administration’s early struggles to address the record number of people who poured across the border over the last 3 1/2 years may have done more damage than they can recover from despite unlawful crossings between the ports of entry being down. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said at a rally in Scottsdale on Saturday that this election's stakes 'could not be higher.' 'Arizona knows that better than almost any state in the union,' Vance said. 'There are over 453,000 illegal immigrants in this state because Kamala Harris refuses to do her job.' During an Oct. 29 speech, Harris said politicians need to stop treating immigration 'as an issue to scare up votes in an election and instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is, that we must finally come together to solve.' 'I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the border security bill that Donald Trump killed,' Harris said. Harris has leaned heavily on the failed Senate border bill as part of her campaign. However, opponents of the bill say it would have meant amnesty for millions and an open door for many more each year. The Border Patrol union pulled its support for the bill, and the National Sheriff's Association also came out in opposition to it. Arizona border ballot measure Arizona residents will consider a new ballot measure that would give more power to local officials when it comes to enforcing immigration law. Proposition 314 would make it a crime for noncitizens to enter Arizona from anywhere other than a port of entry, as well as allow for state judges to order deportations. In addition, state and local police would be given the power to arrest anyone who crosses the border without proper authorization. Supporters of the bill say something has to change after the state became such a hotbed for human and drug smuggling. Opponents call it reminiscent of the controversial Senate Bill 1070, which made it a crime to be in the state without immigration papers. They say that bill basically allowed law enforcement to racially profile people if they speculated that they crossed the border illegally. Senate Bill 1070, passed in 2010, was stripped down by the U.S. Supreme Court after it deemed aspects of the legislation unconstitutional in 2012.

Betting odds show Trump favored but Harris rising	(NewsNation) — Polls show former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are dead even heading into Election Day, and betting markets have also become closer in recent days. Unlike polling averages, which are primarily based on aggregated survey data, prediction markets offer insight into where people are putting their money. Those markets allow users to wager on the outcomes of future events. Betting platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket and PredictIt have shown Trump as the favorite since mid-October, which remains the case, but Harris' chances have improved recently. Election odds in every 2024 swing state Kalshi, a prediction market startup, shows Trump with a 53% chance of winning, compared to 47% for Harris, as of Nov. 4 at 11 a.m. A week ago, Trump was at 60%. Nearly $200 million has been wagered so far, according to Kalshi. Polymarket — which has seen more than $3 billion in bets on the election — showed Trump favored at 56% compared to Harris at 44%, as of midday Nov. 4. Last week, Trump was above 66% at one point. Another platform, PredictIt, showed Harris with an edge. A contract for a Harris win was priced at 54 cents versus 53 cents from Trump around 11 a.m. Nov. 4. That's an improvement for Harris from a week ago when Trump was at 59 cents, and Harris was at 45 cents. The RealClearPolitics betting average showed Trump with a 56% chance of winning and Harris at 43% as of Nov. 4. Note: Betting odds change from minute to minute, and the current percentages may not be reflected above. Are betting markets more reliable than polls? A U.S. appeals court cleared the way for election betting last month, and many are looking to gambling markets as a reliable indicator of which way the election will go. Proponents of prediction markets argue that they are better forecasters because they're more responsive to breaking developments than polls. In other words: Bettors are economically motivated to factor in new information faster. 'Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,' Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune last month. While it's true betting markets have generally been good forecasters of U.S. elections, there are some caveats to keep in mind. For one, betting platforms may be susceptible to manipulation. A Frenchman recently bet more than $30 million on Polymarket predicting a Trump victory, according to the Wall Street Journal. 'Even though volumes have surged on Polymarket this year, it is still small enough for one wealthy, opinionated individual to push prices around with a multimillion-dollar bet,' the WSJ noted. Big bets on Trump don't mean the market is rigged Other research from academics at the University of Arizona and University of Kansas suggests 'manipulating political stock markets is difficult and expensive to do for more than a short period.' Michael Schwimer, founder of the sports betting consultant firm JAMBOS Analytics, dismissed betting manipulation concerns in a recent NewsNation interview. He pointed out that international bets for Trump can't rig the markets any more than a big bet on the World Cup will affect how the game is played. PredictIt has an $850 cap on individual bets, which limits the potential for a single person to sway the odds. Liberty Vittert, a professor of data science at Washington University and the resident on-air statistician for NewsNation, also cautioned against reading too much into betting markets. '[Bettors] are betting on nothing more substantial than the 'vibes' that once made Harris’ victory seem inevitable earlier this summer,' Vittert wrote in a recent op-ed for The Hill. She added: 'In 2016, Hillary Clinton was the 88 percent favorite to win on the Sunday before the election. If you had the bright idea of putting your life savings on the easy favorite in hopes of making a quick buck, you lost it all.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/betting-odds-2024-election/	2024-11-04T11:03:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24304037053551.jpg?w=900
Has the Electoral College ever favored Democrats?	(NEXSTAR) — Did you know there have been five U.S. Presidential Elections in which the winner lost the popular vote? The Electoral College has voted to elect John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Benjamin Harrison in the distant past, and George W. Bush and Donald Trump in modern times. Ignoring the presidents of the distant past, as the political parties at those times were in flux and differed from today's Republicans and Democrats, it's easy to see why some argue the Electoral College has recently only benefitted Republicans. Can you vote in person if you were mailed a ballot? The Electoral College has famously decided a different winner in two modern-day elections: the 2000 Election and the 2016 Election — both Electoral College votes favored the Republican candidates who lost the popular vote, George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The reputational fallout of these votes — where the College appeared not to side with the will of the American people — has contributed to an increasingly unfavorable view of the Electoral College over the past few decades. Earlier this month, Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz even called for abolishing the Electoral College, though the Harris campaign later said this was not part of the official platform. 'I think all of us know, the Electoral College needs to go,' said Walz. 'We need a national popular vote.' Recently, Pew Research found that 64% of Americans (over 6 in 10) say they'd prefer the winner of the U.S. presidential elections be decided by national popular vote only. About 35% polled favored keeping the Electoral College. ‘He’ll never know’: 1 in 4 people lie about who they vote for When broken apart by political party, Pew Research found that most Democrats (87%) say they'd prefer the president be elected by popular vote only. Meanwhile, only 46% of Republicans say the same. Sixty-one percent of Moderates and more liberal Republicans said they'd prefer only a popular vote. Despite proposals to change or abolish the Electoral College (the University of Central Florida reports there have been over 1,000), there are many reasons why these attempts failed. Firstly, as UCF History Professor John Sacher explains, the Electoral College is part of the U.S. Constitution — and amending the Constitution is complicated and difficult. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Additionally, Sacher argues that the Electoral College is useful in instances like the 2000 Presidential Election. Despite Gore winning a plurality of the popular vote, he didn't win a majority. Neither Bush nor Gore won the majority and it fell upon the electors to decide. Sacher explains: 'We are the only nation that still uses an Electoral College... Given that this discussion has already lasted well over 100 years, we may be in for 100 more.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/electoral-college-democrats/	2024-11-04T11:02:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1284095375-1-e1730308594799.jpg?w=800
Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voter...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris has shaken the 2024 election, putting pressure on her Republican opponent since she entered the race in July. Since replacing President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket, Harris has quickly gained momentum, posing a threat to the healthy lead former President Donald Trump held over Biden, both nationally and in swing states. Harris has since announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, who himself has since extinguished any Democratic doubts during his performance at the DNC. How Americans can register to vote ahead of Election Day Ohio Sen. JD Vance‘s nomination as Trump’s vice president pits him against Walz. Ahead of the 2024 election, NewsNation is committed to covering the issues that matter most to voters so they can make the most informed choices possible at the polls. Here is how the leading candidates’ policies compare on key voter issues. You can also read specific policy breakdowns for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Abortion Border crisis Climate change Crime Fentanyl crisis and opioid epidemic Inflation Israel-Palestine conflict Policing and gun safety Project 2025 Social Security War in Ukraine Abortion Trump During the September debate, Trump falsely said Democrats support abortions in the third trimester and after birth. No state in the country allows termination after birth. He refused to commit to vetoing a national abortion ban. When asked directly if he would veto a ban, Trump indicated Congress wouldn’t need to pass one. The former president wouldn’t initially say during a town hall whether he supports a federal abortion ban. He called the overturning of the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade 'a great victory' during a CNN town hall. In April 2024, he said on his social media platform Truth Social that it’d be best if states handled abortion the way their constituents want, adding he’s in favor of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Also said on Truth Social that he 'strongly' supports fertility treatments and that he 'has never and will never' advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives. Harris Harris said women do not want abortion bans, speaking about women who are miscarrying and denied care because doctors are afraid to go to jail and young teens who are incest victims being forced to give birth. She committed to signing a bill to protect the right to abortion across the U.S. Harris is aligned with Biden in her view on abortion and said 'everything is at stake' regarding women’s reproductive rights. The vice president is in favor of ensuring all American women have access to legal abortions. 'Every person of whatever gender should understand that, if such a fundamental freedom such as the right to make decisions about your own body can be taken, be aware of what other freedoms may be at stake,' Harris said in a joint MSNBC interview with Hadley Duvall, an abortion rights advocate from Kentucky who was raped by her stepfather as a child. Harris falsely wrote on X that Trump would ban abortion nationwide. She then added: 'President Joe Biden and I will do everything in our power to stop him and restore women’s reproductive freedom.' Harris also visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota in March, describing the banning or heavy restriction of abortions as 'immoral.' 'How dare these elected leaders believe they are in a better position to tell women what they need,' Harris said at the time. 'We have to be a nation that trusts women.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: VP picks' political views Border crisis Trump Trump and his allies have falsely accused Haitian immigrants in the small Ohio town of Springfield of abducting and eating pets. There’s no evidence that the community is doing that, officials told The Associated Press. The former president would launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, paid for with redirected military funds, Reuters reported. He would restore his 2019 'Remain in Mexico' program, which required asylum-seekers at the U.S. border to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed. Trump said he would end what he called 'catch and release' and instead detain all migrants who are caught entering the United States without authorization or violating other immigration laws. He'd also deputize the U.S. National Guard and local law enforcement to help with rapid deportations, according to Reuters. The former president said he would enact travel bans denying entry to people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and 'anywhere else that threatens our security.' Block communists, Marxists and socialists from entering the U.S. and send deportation officers to 'pro-Hamas' protests. End 'birthright' citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. End Biden’s immigration parole program and roll back Temporary Protected Status designations. Try again to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly referred to as DACA. While he was president, about 450 miles of barriers were built along the Southwest border, according to the Associated Press. Harris Among Republicans, Harris has the ironic moniker of 'border czar,' owing to her work wherein she oversaw diplomacy with Mexico and the Northern Triangle as a means of addressing 'root causes' of migration. Biden gave her the responsibility of manning everything immigration along the southern border in 2021, with her role, according to the White House at the time, to stem the arrival of 'irregular migrants.' Republicans heavily criticized the Biden-Harris approach to the border, a hot-button issue this election cycle. Under the Biden-Harris administration, migrants crossing into the US from Mexico hit record highs at the end of 2023. Close to 250,000 crossed during December 2023, surpassing the previous high of 224,000 encounters in May of 2022, also under the Biden-Harris watch. Harris announced in March that $5.2 billion in pledges from private companies had been made to prop up Central American communities to deter illegal entry to the U.S. under her guidance. 'The problems, of course, did not occur overnight, and the solutions will not be achieved overnight,' Harris said of the border at the time. Climate change Trump During the September debate, Trump falsely claimed that under Harris there would 'be no fossil fuels' and the country would 'go back to windmills.' At one point, Trump called himself a 'fan' of solar but then criticized solar farms that take up large plots of land. Claimed he will end the 'Green New Deal atrocities' on his first day if reelected. The measure was never signed into law. Said he would free up stores of liquid gold for energy development. Vowed to speed up approval of natural gas pipelines into the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York. Exit the Paris Climate Agreement again. Trump previously pulled the U.S. from the agreement, but Biden rejoined upon taking office. Said he would fight litigation from environmentalists. Harris During the September debate, Harris also called for investment in 'diverse' sources of energy, 'So we reduce our reliance on foreign oil.' Harris has backed the Biden administration’s climate initiatives, including legislation providing billions in tax credits for renewable energy and electric vehicles, the New York Times reported. 'The clock is not just ticking, it is banging,' she said last year, referencing climate change-driven disasters. She noted the administration made 'the largest climate investment in America’s history.' During her 2020 presidential bid, Harris emphasized environmental justice, addressing climate change’s effects on poor and minority communities. She’s continued this focus as vice president. In 2019, as a senator, Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., proposed legislation to evaluate environmental rules’ impact on low-income communities. It would have created an Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability and climate justice advisers in federal agencies. Harris introduced a broader version in 2020. Neither bill passed, The New York Times reported. How are presidential election votes counted? Crime Trump Said he would move homeless encampments out of cities. Vowed to give police more authority, deploy the military to fight the nation’s drug problem and impose the death penalty for convicted drug dealers. Promised to deliver record funding to hire and retrain police officers, strengthen qualified immunity and increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. Said he would send federal prosecutors and the National Guard into high-crime communities, according to his campaign website. As president, Trump granted pardons to 73 people and commuted the sentences of an additional 70. That includes former staff members and advisers such as Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Stephen K. Bannon and George Papadopoulos. Harris Harris, in April, hosted reality television star Kim Kardashian at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform after the Biden administration granted clemency to people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. The U.S. incarcerates more people than any other country. About 1 in 5 of those 1.9 million people are behind bars for a drug-related offense. Black and Latino people are disproportionately incarcerated, and drug law reform has the broadest support among young voters. Black, Latino and young voters tend to favor Democrats. 'Everybody makes mistakes, and for some, that might rise to the level of being a crime,' Harris said at the White House. 'But is it not the sign of a civil society that we allow people a way to earn their way back and give them the support and the resources they need to do that?' Harris’ record as California attorney general, however, drew the ire of many progressives during her 2020 bid for the presidency. During her seven years as a district attorney and then six as attorney general, she defended the cash bail system in a pair of federal court cases, shifting course only weeks before she entered the Senate. As a presidential candidate in 2020, she pledged a wholesale overhaul of the country’s criminal justice system, arguing for marijuana legalization, bail reform and a moratorium on the death penalty. Vice President Harris will face off with Republican nominee former President Trump this November for the White House. (Associated Press) Fentanyl crisis and opioid epidemic Trump Said he would 'impose a total naval embargo on cartels.' Vowed to designate cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Promised to order the Department of Defense to 'inflict maximum damage' on cartel leadership and operations. Said he would seek death penalty eligibility for cartel members and traffickers. Said he would permanently designate fentanyl as a federally controlled substance. Promised to threaten China with 'a steep price' unless it works to end the export of fentanyl’s chemical precursors. Vowed to create partnerships to encourage companies to provide job opportunities and skills training to people recovering from addiction. Said he would expand federal support for faith-based counseling, treatment and recovery programs. Promised family leave to care for relatives trying to overcome addiction. Harris In May 2024, the Biden-Harris administration announced the approval of over $1.5 billion in state or tribal opioid response funding to address the overdose crisis. Harris gathered state attorneys general from across the country at the White House in July 2023 to discuss fentanyl and illicit drugs in America. 'We each recognize and have joined together today because we are facing a public health crisis, and it also, therefore, is an issue that must have a response that addresses the underlying public health concerns that are both about addiction and treatment,' Harris said. Harris wants to increase access to and the affordability of naloxone, which reverses overdoses, with the vice president calling it 'the difference between life or death.' How do Donald Trump, Kamala Harris’ net worths compare? Inflation and economy Trump Promised 'lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for American workers' by enacting universal baseline tariffs that 'reward domestic production' and tax foreign companies. Said he would lower interest rates. Claimed to have achieved the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years — 3.5% with 6.4 million added jobs before the pandemic. During his presidency, federal debt held by the public rose from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion, influenced by Trump’s tax cuts, particularly his slashes to the corporate tax rate, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center’s FactCheck project. Trump is proposing tax cuts for big businesses and the wealthy to spur investment. He said his tax cuts would garner 3% growth, a milestone he did not reach in his first term. Trump has proposed broad tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. He has proposed no taxes on tips or Social Security income. Harris Shortly after taking office as vice president for Biden, the administration signed the American Rescue Plan, a $2 trillion stimulus package that delivered checks to Americans, boosted unemployment insurance benefits and expanded the child tax credit. Inflation peaked at a four-decade high of 9% in summer 2022 but has since receded to around 3.5%. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, which invested in clean energy that the White House estimates created 117,000 jobs and will reduce Americans’ energy costs by as much as 9% by 2030. Harris has said inflation was a high priority for the administration. 'The President and our administration’s probably highest priority is bringing down the price of gas and cost of living,' Harris said. During her time as a senator, Harris tried to get a bill passed where tax credits up to $6,000 would be available for middle- and low-income households. Harris has also been a strong proponent of forgiving student debt, spearheading the Biden administration’s move to abolish debt for several hundred thousand students at Corinthian Colleges. In 2017, she co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’ proposal for free college for middle-class students at four-year public schools and all who attended two-year institutions. Harris wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and big businesses to fund investments in housing and tax credits for parents. She has proposed more financial assistance for first-time homebuyers and expanded tax credits for parents. She also wants to cut taxes for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Harris wants to remove taxes on tips. . Israel-Palestine conflict Trump Said Israel should 'finish the problem' in Gaza, but warned that Israel is losing the public relations battle Was critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack Told Time Magazine in April that Netanyahu 'rightfully has been criticized for what took place' Trump has said Israel should 'finish the problem' in Gaza, though he has warned that the Israelis are losing the public relations battle. Trump has been critical of Netanyahu in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack Told Time Magazine in April that the prime minister 'rightfully has been criticized for what took place' Said during an October Fox News interview, 'We need to protect Israel, there is no choice' Told Israel’s intelligence agencies to 'step up their game' Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Harris When asked how to handle the war in the Middle East, Harris said that Israel has a right to defend itself, citing the Oct. 7 attacks, while also saying that too many Palestinian civilians have been killed during fighting in Gaza. She said the war must end, there must be a cease-fire deal, and the hostages must be released by Hamas. Harris called for an 'immediate cease-fire' in Gaza in March, describing the situation as a 'humanitarian catastrophe,' the New York Times reported. She said Hamas’ threat to Israel 'must be eliminated' but added that 'too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.' She opposed an Israeli invasion of Rafah, southern Gaza, where over a million people had fled. 'I have studied the maps. There’s nowhere for those folks to go,' she said, noting about 1.5 million people were there after being told to go. Harris has repeatedly expressed support for a two-state solution. Policing and gun safety Trump During his first presidential campaign, Trump positioned himself as a defender of the Second Amendment. A Trump-era ban on bump stocks was overturned by the Supreme Court in June 2024, which said the Trump administration overstepped when it banned the rapid-fire gun attachments. After the May 24, 2022, Uvalde, Texas, shooting at Robb Elementary School, Trump called for 'drastically' changing the nation’s approach to mental health and 'a top-to-bottom security overhaul. at schools across this country' but dismissed calls for further firearm restrictions, AP reported. Trump vowed at an event sponsored by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in February to undo Biden-era gun restrictions if reelected. Harris Harris said during the September debate that she's a gun owner She has called for implementing universal background checks and expanding red flag laws to take away guns from people who are deemed dangerous or unstable. She also wants to ban so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Harris took a tough stand on policing in the wake of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. She co-sponsored legislation in the Senate that would’ve banned police from using chokeholds and no-knock warrants, set a national use-of-force standard and created a national police misconduct registry, among other things. It would have also reformed the qualified immunity system that shields officers from liability. The list in the legislation included practices Harris did not vocally fight to reform while leading California’s Department of Justice. And while she now wants independent investigations of police shootings, she didn’t support a 2015 California bill that would have required her office to take on such cases. In June, as vice president, Harris said that more needed to be done at the federal level to prevent gun violence during a campaign stop in Maryland. Harris, after high-profile shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, in 2022, called for a ban on assault-style weapons. Kamala Harris’ political views, from the border to the economy Project 2025 Trump At the September debate, Trump pushed back claims he's tied to plan, saying, 'I have nothing to do with Project 2025. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it purposely.' Trump has previously disavowed the controversial project, posting on his social media site that he has 'no idea' who is behind Project 2025 and knows 'nothing' about it, but dozens of people who worked closely with him and helped shape his administration are involved in the plan. 'I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,' he wrote. 'Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.' Trump’s campaign has previously said he sets his own priorities and that outside groups don’t speak for him. However, Trump's running mate, Vance, appears to have close ties with the people who had a hand in writing the conservative policy playbook. Harris One of Harris’ main points of attack on the Republican ticket is Project 2025, which she warns will go into effect should Trump get reelected. Harris has seized on the plan, linking it directly to Trump. At the September debate, Harris alleged Trump would sign a national abortion ban, referencing Project 2025. She said Americans believe the government should not control the freedom to make decisions about their body. Harris has pushed back against Trump’s denials, saying he will implement the conservative plan 'hatched by people who used to work for Donald Trump that focuses on the first 180 days' on her campaign website. Harris has spoken about Project 2025 numerous times both while campaigning for Biden and after she became the Democratic nominee for president. Her campaign website has a page dedicated to Project 2025 calling it 'Trump’s plan to take your power, your control and your money.' 'Donald Trump’s plans for a full government takeover have been exposed,' it reads, adding 'his Project 2025 agenda would strip away our freedoms.' At a campaign rally in Wisconsin, Harris said Project 2025 was a 'plan to weaken the middle class.' Harris’ running mate, Walz, also has spoken out against the conservative guidebook. 'Don’t believe him when he’s playing dumb about this Project 2025,' Walz said at a Glendale, Arizona, rally. 'He knows exactly what it will do. They are not playing. They wrote their plan out.' Harris has presented a diametrically opposite position on the issues Project 2025 aims to restructure. Social Security Trump Told Republicans in Congress not to cut 'a single penny' from Medicare or Social Security. Later made comments suggesting he was open to cuts to Medicare and Social Security; his team walked these back and claimed the remarks were taken out of context. Encouraged Republicans to focus their funding cuts on areas of 'waste, fraud and abuse' in addition to programs dealing with foreign aid, immigration, climate change and LGBTQ rights, Reuters reported. Said in a campaign statement he would reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. Harris When she was a U.S. senator for California, she supported the Social Security Expansion Act, which is now championed by leaders including Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., CNBC reported. As vice president, in Biden’s 2024 budget proposal, the administration called for 'protecting and strengthening' Social Security but offered few specifics on reforms to the program, CNBC reported. During the 2020 campaign, the administration proposed raising taxes on those making more than $400,000 to shore up Social Security but largely dropped the idea after taking office, Politico reported. The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare has endorsed Democrats’ Social Security plans, which call for applying additional taxes on wealthy individuals with incomes over $400,000, CNBC reported.

Falsely claimed that the war had killed 'millions' since Russia invaded Ukraine 2 1/2 years ago, while the United Nations says 11,700 civilian deaths have been verified. Called for a cease-fire in an official campaign statement. Said he could 'solve the conflict in a single day.' Trump: 'Every day this proxy battle in Ukraine continues, we risk global war.' More generally suggests overhauling the State Department, the 'defense bureaucracy' and intelligence services to fire who he called members of a 'deep state.' What are Donald Trump’s stances on major issues to voters? Harris Harris praised American and NATO support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion so far — and called for it to continue. Harris announced that the U.S. would donate over $1.5 billion to Ukraine, with funds coming from the State Department and USAID. The financial assistance will aid infrastructure, security, energy and refugee assistance. Harris has been in lockstep with Biden about helping Ukraine amid its war with Russia. During the June summit regarding peace in Ukraine, Harris spoke about the American commitment to the Eastern European nation.

Harris campaigns in Pennsylvania on eve of election	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Pennsylvania on Monday as she makes her final appeal to voters one day before the presidential election. Harris is scheduled to attend rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia alongside celebrities like DJ Cassidy, Fate Joe, Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey. She’ll begin by speaking at a campaign rally at 2:10 p.m. ET in Allentown, Pennsylvania, followed by a 9 p.m. ET rally in Pittsburgh and an 11 p.m. PT rally in Philadelphia. Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threats The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is neck-and-neck heading into Election Day. NewsNation’s partner Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) predicts Trump will win Pennsylvania by 53%. The Keystone State was a tipping point in the previous two presidential races. Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes are the most of any battleground state. Trump’s projected success would buck trends. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican for president by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Tuesday’s election remains a tossup in Pennsylvania, where Harris and Trump both had 50% chances of winning as recently as Oct. 20, according to DDHQ forecasts. This story is developing.

Trump stumps in battleground states in final push ahead of electi...	(NewsNation) — With election day less than 24 hour away, former President Donald Trump is making one final push to win over voters in battleground states. It's been four years since the former president lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, and since, he's been traveling the country and speaking to voters in hopes of returning to the Oval Office in January. Plus, it could be his last chance at becoming president a second time. Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threats Trump's last push ahead of election day Trump will watch the election results on Tuesday from his Mar-a-Largo Estate in Florida; but before then, he will barnstorm battleground states over the next 24 hours. Trump planned four rallies, beginning in Raleigh, North Carolina and stopping twice in Pennsylvania with events in Reading and Pittsburgh. The Republican nominee ends his campaign the way he ended the first two, with a late Monday night event in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Pennsylvania and Michigan are part of the 'blue wall' states for Democrats, and Trump's campaign hopes for a breakthrough. North Carolina is also seen as a must win state for the former president, but it's one where the polling shows an opportunity for Democrats to flip the traditionally Republican-leaning state. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Historic voter turnout Over the weekend, Trump's campaign made its final stretch, saying it's pleased with voter turnout already. The campaign told NewsNation their internal data shows the Trump campaign is turning out more mid and low-propensity voters, who are people who only vote in presidential elections or have never voted before. Trump spent the night in Georgia on Sunday, looking to build on the enthusiasm in the Peach State. 'You know we're on the five-yard line, maybe even the one-yard line. We're right there. We had a tremendous amount of early votes, records like no one can believe,' Trump said at his rally in Macon, Georgia. He continued, 'But all I can say is on Tuesday, just go out and vote. We're gonna close this thing out and it's gonna be party time.' Republicans are betting on voter turnout, arguing enthusiasm is on their side. About 77 million Americans already have voted early, but both candidates are pushing to turn out many millions more supporters on Tuesday. Either result on Election Day will yield a historic outcome. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said the Trump campaign was feeling 'bullish.' A Trump victory would make him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of a felony, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump would also become the second president in history to win non-consecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century.

Election denial concerns rise as officials prep for polling threa...	(NewsNation) — With just two days until the presidential election, more than 77 million Americans have already cast their votes amid mounting legal challenges and concerns about election integrity. In Iowa, a federal judge ruled the state can continue challenging hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens, a decision critics say threatens the voting rights of new U.S. citizens. Recent polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading in Iowa by 3 percentage points. Legal battles are intensifying in key swing states, with both parties filing lawsuits challenging various aspects of the election process. The Republican National Committee has filed 135 lawsuits across 26 states over the past year, primarily concentrated in seven battleground states representing 93 electoral votes. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues In Pennsylvania, considered a crucial swing state, the Trump campaign secured a legal victory when early voting was extended in Bucks County after Republican voters reported being turned away. The state's Supreme Court also ruled in favor of Republicans by rejecting mail-in ballots without handwritten dates for the 2024 election. 'I think those cases are indicative of this overall strategy, which is kind of throw spaghetti at the wall strategy in challenging the integrity of our elections,' said Danielle Lang, Senior Director for the Voting Rights Program at Campaign Legal Center. 'It failed in 2020. They're getting a head start this time, but it's going to fail here as well, and the voters will decide this election, not political actors or litigation.' A Trump-aligned group is reportedly preparing to challenge this year's election results, citing concerns about voter fraud without providing evidence. If either candidate contests the results, they could file lawsuits or request recounts, potentially leading to Supreme Court involvement. The situation echoes the aftermath of the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump filed multiple lawsuits challenging the results. The Supreme Court declined to hear several of these cases, effectively upholding lower court rulings and the election outcome. Election officials and law enforcement are currently preparing for potential threats at polling locations as Americans express growing concern over election denialism.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/election-denial-polling-threats/	2024-11-03T18:00:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e378c8695379.01414579.jpeg?w=900
Republicans target weekend absentee ballot returns in Georgia	Republicans are taking aim at Democratic strongholds in Georgia that opened locations this weekend for voters to return their absentee ballots in person. The Republican National Committee (RNC) filed a new lawsuit Sunday after a state judge one day prior rejected allegations that deep-blue Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, was violating Georgia’s election law over its extension. Harris, Trump both see paths to victory as election nears Republicans cite a provision that mandates drop boxes close when in-person early voting, known as advance voting in Georgia, concludes, which it did Friday. The new case challenges both Fulton and six other Democratic-leaning counties that have similarly continued to accept hand-delivered absentee ballots through the weekend. It was filed in federal court and claims the practice violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection and its delegation of elections authority to state legislatures. 'The county’s actions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by granting special privileges to voters of those counties in violation of state law, thus arbitrarily and disparately affecting against voters and candidates in other counties,' the lawsuit states. The areas being sued include Fulton County and swaths of the Atlanta area that make up much of Democrats’ base in the key swing state: Cobb, DeKalb, Gwinnett and Clayton counties. The other two are Chatham County, which includes the city of Savannah, and Athens-Clarke County. President Biden won all seven counties in 2020 as he flipped Georgia blue in the presidential race for the first time in nearly three decades. This cycle, the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast estimates Trump has a 65 percent chance of winning the key battleground. The announcements to allow people to return absentee ballots in person this weekend and Monday quickly came under fire from the GOP. Close Thank you for signing up!

Subscribe Now On Balance with Leland Vittert Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Republicans sued Fulton County late Friday night, leading to a hastily scheduled online hearing the following morning. Judge Kevin Farmer ruled in favor of the county, which was backed by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The state law provision at issue did not concern hand delivery of absentee ballots, he said. 'That refers to drop boxes. There are no drop boxes here. Drop boxes are off the table,' Farmer said. Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, said 305 absentee ballots were ultimately returned this weekend during the extension, which will continue Monday. Republicans have also criticized some of the counties for initially not letting the party’s poll watchers observe the continued ballot returns. RNC Chair Michael Whatley on Saturday wrote on the social platform X that observers were ultimately allowed inside. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states Alex Kaufman, a Georgia attorney who represents the party, criticized Fulton County officials for announcing the extension just hours before it began. 'We have poll watchers that we would have had to have gone out. This clearly changes the time and conduct of the election at the last moment,' Kaufman said at Saturday's court hearing. The dispute over the extension is part of a broader legal battle playing out in key swing states over mail ballots. The current odds in every battleground state The DNC and other groups convinced a Georgia judge to extend the return deadline until Nov. 8, three days after Election Day, for 3,240 absentee voters whose mail ballots weren’t delivered in Cobb County. In Pennsylvania, the DNC similarly persuaded a state judge to extend additional options for Erie County voters that experienced mail ballot issues due to a vendor problem. The judge found that 365 voters received duplicate ballots and up to 17,000 others may not have received theirs. And in Bucks County, a populous area located north of Philadelphia, the Trump campaign won its lawsuit to extend on-demand mail balloting after voters reported long lines and being turned away early on the final day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-weekend-absentee-ballot-returns/	2024-11-03T16:05:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/georgia_lee_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
Do you have to fill out the entire 2024 election ballot? Here's w...	(NEXSTAR) — With many high-stakes races on the ballot, voters face important decisions on Election Day, from presidential candidates to state and local measures. While some people may fill out a bubble in each section, others may be unsure about certain races and wonder: is it necessary to vote on every item? This can be especially true with lengthy ballots that contain numerous down-ballot races, judicial appointments, or proposals that may not have received widespread media coverage. Ballot box fires stoke fears of election violence Though widely encouraged, completing the entire ballot is not required. Ballots that are partially filled — referred to as 'undervoted' ballots — are still valid. So, you can opt to leave certain sections blank if you don't wish to vote on them. 'For example, a voter may choose to vote for president, senator, and governor, but not for other offices or ballot measures that are lower down on their ballot,' the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency explains on a website debunking election rumors. 'Even if a ballot includes an undervote in a particular contest, properly marked votes on their ballot are counted.'

(AP Photo/John Locher) To help make informed decisions, USA.gov, the federal government's official web portal, suggests reviewing voter guides and sample ballots before heading to the polls. Voter guides offer background information on candidates and ballot measures, including each candidate's experience, goals, and explanations of specific issues that will be on the ballot. You can find personalized guides using sites like Ballot Ready and Vote411. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics Sample ballots, on the other hand, simply show the elections, candidates, and measures you’ll encounter without additional information. Many local election offices offer downloadable sample ballots online, according to USA.gov. Voters can often bring these materials into the voting booth, which may be helpful to avoid memorizing each selection. However, some polling places restrict cell phone use, so paper copies may be the better option. Just make sure to check your local election office’s rules ahead of time.

DNC vice chair says 'we're prepared' for close race	Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Chair Ken Martin on Sunday projected confidence going into Election Day on Tuesday, saying Democrats have long prepared for a close race. 'I am really confident, in the end, not only with the early vote returns that we've seen, but also with the ground game that we have, that we'll be successful on election night,' Martin said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. 'Look, we've built this campaign from the very beginning; by the way, we knew this was going to be a close campaign, and we built it, and we're prepared for it,' he continued. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Martin said he tells voters to ignore the 'three Ps: polls, pundits and politicos' and said he was confident because Vice President Harris has the ground game going for her, and it’s riskier banking on low-propensity voters to turn out, which Martin suggested the Trump campaign is doing. 'One of the reasons we're buoyed, not only is the early vote returns that we're seeing throughout the nation, but also the fact that throughout all the battlegrounds, the only campaign that really has a sizable on-the-ground operation capable of actually getting their supporters to the polls, is the Harris-Walz campaign,' Martin said. 'And in the end, if you believe that this is a tied game, in the final quarter of the game, the tie has to go to the campaign that actually has the organization on the ground to get their voters and their supporters to the polls, and in all these battlegrounds, the only presence we're seeing on the ground in any sizable fashion is the Harris-Walz campaign,' he continued.

RNC chair: 'We are in a great position to win this thing on Elect...	Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Michael Whatley said in a Sunday interview that he is confident in former President Trump's ability to win the Electoral College vote on Tuesday. 'We certainly have a great shot at winning the national vote, but I think more importantly is that we are going into Election Day with leads in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, and we are doing substantially better in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania than we were in either 2016 or in 2020,' Whatley said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. 'So we are in a great position to win this thing on Election Day,' he continued. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night The latest polling ahead of Election Day shows that Trump and Vice President Harris are locked in a close race, including in some of the key battleground states. In the national polling average from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points, with 48.3 percent support to Harris’s 48.1 percent. The polling averages in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia show Trump leading Harris by approximately 1 to 3 points. Trump leads Harris by an average of less than 1 point in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Michigan has Harris leading by an average of 0.2 points. 'We are very bullish,' Whatley continued in his interview. 'And Donald Trump is right now barnstorming across every one of these battleground states and talking directly with the American voters about the issues that they care about, and that's what's going to get him across the finish line.'

Harris, Trump both see paths to victory as election nears	The presidential race is tight, and neither candidate has a clear lead. But in the final weekend before Election Day, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump are ready to declare victory. Both campaigns say they have laid the groundwork to win. Both think they have the correct rationale for why they should win. Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states The Harris campaign says their ground game will help see them through, pointing to more than 2,500 staffers and volunteers in key states. They also say issues like abortion along with Harris's favorability rating, which is several points higher than Trump’s in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill average of polls, will help catapult the vice president to the White House. At the same time, the Trump campaign points to polls that show that voters don't think the country is heading in the right direction, highlighting the recent rising costs and the overall 'vibe' of the economy. They also say Harris is tied to President Biden, whose own approval rating is underwater. Historically, they say when an incumbent has a low approval rating — Biden is at 40 percent — the opposing party prevails. They also feel good about their registration and early vote numbers. 'I think both sides have valid reasons for how and why a win is possible,' said one Democratic strategist close to the Harris campaign. 'That's part of the reason why it's so close and why neither side has the advantage. Every poll is ridiculously close.' A poll released by Gallup this week showed that approximately 49 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Harris compared to 44 percent for Trump. Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, also has a higher favorable rating at 45 percent than Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (Ohio), who is at 39 percent. Those numbers bode well for Harris, Gallup noted, because candidates with higher favorability ratings have typically won recent presidential elections. 'Honestly, there’s any number of data points and reasons I think Harris will win, but there’s also the Potter Stewart analogy: You may not be able to define a winning campaign, but you know it when you see it,' Democratic strategist Christy Setzer said. 'Harris continues to pack stadiums, generate excitement, while controlling the media narrative.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now On Balance with Leland Vittert Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'It’s a high-wire act she’s pulling off right now, and for the last 100 days, and she’s making it look easy.' Since becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has leaned into abortion as an issue, and Democrats say that was a smart tack. They point to a recent NBC News poll that showed likely voters feel 'strongly' about abortion. When respondents were asked if there was one issue they felt strongly about that would decide their vote for or against a candidate, 22 percent said abortion, outranking other issues including immigration, protecting democracy and even cost of living. The current odds in every battleground state Since the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, Democrats have successfully rallied women around the issue, turning out record numbers of voters during the 2022 midterm elections. And that momentum shows no sign of slowing, Democrats say. 'So far, women are still voting at post-Dobbs level, and there are no corresponding sights yet of the ‘bro vote surge’ they have been targeting,' said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale. 'Harris has a strong closing message on the economy, abortion, and democracy, while Trump is flailing from grievance to grievance, playing dress-up garbage man, and threatening to shoot people.' But the Trump campaign says their message on top issues including the economy and immigration has been resonating with voters, a point even Republicans who aren’t supporting Trump acknowledge. 'When he’s on message and he’s talking about the issues, his points crack through the noise more than Kamala’s do,' one GOP strategist said. 'I still can’t tell you what her vision is.' Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Republicans have also 'made massive voter registration gains, and we are far outperforming in our share of the early vote relative to two or four years ago across all battleground states.' 'Voters know that Kamala Harris has destroyed our country, but President Trump will fix it when he ends inflation, secures the border, and makes America strong again — and that is why he is well-positioned for victory,' Leavitt added. Republicans say they have successfully tied Harris to Biden, who remains highly unpopular with the American electorate, which serves as a red flag to political observers. 'The bottom line is for Kamala Harris to win, she’d have to break history,' CNN’s Harry Enten, who analyzes election data, said this week on the cable network. Enten also pointed to recent polls that showed a majority of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction. 'There isn’t a single time in which 28 percent of the American public thinks the country is going on the right track in which the incumbent party actually won,' Enten said. Republicans also maintain Trump has also made significant inroads with Hispanic and Black men. 'It’s a matter of whether they can get them out to the polls now,' said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist who has worked on recent presidential campaigns. 'If he hits his mark with those two subsets of voters, look out.' How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election Speakers at a Trump rally in New York City last weekend caused a stir when a comedian made inappropriate jokes about Latinos and Puerto Rico. On Friday, Harris campaign aides said they saw the rally break through to undecided voters, giving them a shot in the arm in the final days of the campaign. The officials said internal data shows Harris winning by double digits among voters who just decided who to support in recent days. The Harris campaign also got good news on Saturday after a Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in Iowa showed Harris with a three-point lead over Trump. The poll of more than 800 voters who were surveyed showed Harris over Trump 47 percent to 44 percent. While the poll is within the margin of error, it revealed a significant shift from a September survey in the state which showed Trump leading by 4 points. Are Nevada voters swayed by promises of ‘no tax on tips’? The Trump campaign immediately cast the poll as a significant outlier, but it still gave the Harris camp a jolt of momentum. A second Democratic strategist said while Trump had been seen as the candidate with the momentum over the last couple of weeks, Harris has seen a turning point of sorts in the last several days. 'I think we are exactly where we need to be,' the strategist said. But Vale and other Democrats have concluded one thing: No one knows how it will end. 'It’s going to be close, and a grind to the finish,' Vale said. 'But the saying ‘Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades’ also applies to the Electoral College.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-victory-paths/	2024-11-03T14:37:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Declare_110324_Illustration_Courtney-JonesJulia-Demaree-Nikhinson-and-David-CalvertAPand-Adobe-Stock.png?w=900
Sen. Moore Capito: 'I don’t anticipate a scenario' where GOP refu...	Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said she does not anticipate a scenario in which Senate Republicans refuse to certify the election results but stressed she thinks former President Trump will win on Tuesday. 'Well, I think we want fair and safe elections. I think we see early reports that the safety and security of our ballots across the, across the country, now appear to be safe, and I think that is a great reassurance to all of us who are voting for President Trump,' Capito said in an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt when asked whether Senate Republicans were prepared to certify Vice President Harris as the next president if she is whom voters select on Election Day. 'Obviously, in a close election, every vote counts,' she continued. 'I don't anticipate a scenario where we're not ready to certify whoever wins, and but I believe that will be a reelection of President Trump.' What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Capito, however, avoided disagreeing with Trump when asked about his recent claims on social media that Pennsylvania 'is cheating and getting caught' ahead of the election. Pennsylvania is one of the closest battlegrounds for the major party candidates ahead of this election. 'Well, I think, I think Pennsylvania definitely needs to get their act together because we know in 2020 there were more than a few very suspicious ballots cast, and investigations showed that those who were in charge fell way short of assuring that our ballots were safe, counted properly, and attributed to the correct candidate,' Capito said, echoing unsubstantiated claims the former president has made. 'So I understand why President Trump is very suspicious of the state of Pennsylvania,' she continued. Capito said Pennsylvania has a lot of early votes and is being watched closely. Dems will ‘absolutely not’ repeat Jan. 6 if Trump wins: Senator 'I think what he's doing is very smart, and that he's keeping those in Pennsylvania feet to the fire. They know everyone's watching,' Capito said of the former president. 'Pennsylvania should definitely have this together. They've had, they've been challenged over the last four years as to the authenticity of the votes cast in 2020. I hope that they hear this, but they do know that those of us who experienced that in 2020 are very suspicious,' she said.

Trump says 'Fox News is not our friend,' claims it's airing 'Demo...	Former President Trump on Sunday took aim at Fox News for airing what the GOP presidential nominee sees as too much coverage devoted to the Democrats, just a few days before the election. 'FoxNews keeps putting on Democrat ads, as part of their news program. Their soundbites are almost all of Harris and her Democrat friends, all of whom are on the shows,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday morning. RFK Jr.’s public health plans under Trump rattle critics 'FOX NEWS IS NOT OUR FRIEND. It’s crazy!' Trump continued. The GOP presidential nominee has for months railed against Fox, the top-rated cable news channel, over its coverage of him and programming, though he is seen on the outlet regularly for interviews, town halls and other appearances. Just a few weeks ago, Trump criticized Fox News for airing negative political ads attacking him and said he would appeal directly to media mogul Rupert Murdoch to get them removed from the air during an interview on the network. 'In the old days, you never played negative ads. In other words, when I leave here, I’ll then be hit by five or six ads,' Trump said two weeks ago during an in-studio interview on 'Fox &amp; Friends,' the network’s flagship morning show. 'You mean Fox News?' host Brian Kilmeade interjected. 'When I leave, I’ll have 12 people from Kamala on, and pretty much unopposed,' Trump said. 'For 19 days, I don’t think we should do that anymore. I think you shouldn’t play negative ads. It’s very tough.' 'You do a show — and I complain all the time. I love complaining,' he added. 'I like to have everything perfect. But when I leave here … it’s sort of a net neutral.' The Hill has reached out to Fox News for comment. Trump’s latest remarks come just days before Election Day, as the race between him and Vice President Harris remains neck and neck. In the latest national polling average from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points, with 48.3 percent support to Harris’s 48.1 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-fox-news-ad-claims/	2024-11-03T12:32:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24308055921869-e1730601486191.jpg?w=900
FCC commissioner claims Harris on ‘SNL’ violates 'equal time' rul...	(The Hill) — A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner has claimed that Vice President Harris’s recent appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' violates the 'equal time' rule. 'This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,' Commissioner Brendan Carr posted on the social platform X Saturday in response to a post from The Associated Press about Harris being on the show that night. 'The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct - a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,' Carr, a Trump appointee, continued. Kamala Harris appears on ‘Saturday Night Live’ as mirror image of Maya Rudolph The FCC’s 'equal time' rules let rival candidates ask for equal air time. During her appearance on this week’s episode of 'SNL' Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph, who often impersonates her, for a cold open sketch. While Rudolph was playing the vice president, Harris began her 'SNL' debut on the other side of a mirror from the comedian. 'I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do — you can open doors,' Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which former President Trump had a hard time grabbing the handle of a garbage truck.

FCC commissioner claims Harris on ‘SNL’ violates 'equal time' rul...	(The Hill) — A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner has claimed that Vice President Harris’s recent appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' violates the 'equal time' rule. 'This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,' Commissioner Brendan Carr posted on the social platform X Saturday in response to a post from The Associated Press about Harris being on the show that night. 'The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct - a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,' Carr, a Trump appointee, continued. Kamala Harris appears on ‘Saturday Night Live’ as mirror image of Maya Rudolph The FCC’s 'equal time' rules let rival candidates ask for equal air time. During her appearance on this week’s episode of 'SNL' Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph, who often impersonates her, for a cold open sketch. While Rudolph was playing the vice president, Harris began her 'SNL' debut on the other side of a mirror from the comedian. 'I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do — you can open doors,' Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which former President Trump had a hard time grabbing the handle of a garbage truck.

Harris seeks boost from women voters to help her over finish line	Vice President Harris is seeking to maximize turnout from women voters in the final days before the election in hope the critical voting block can carry her over the finish line. While much of the conversation in the closing days of the campaign has surrounded Harris’s soft support among men, Democrats argue that women have the chance to boost Harris. They point to the voting bloc’s role in securing Democratic wins in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections. But Republicans remain skeptical that women, particularly suburban women in swing states, will be a shoo-in for Harris, pointing to concerns over the economy. 'Kamala Harris is positioned to win this election because of women,' said Jessica Mackler, the president of EMILY’s List, a group dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office. On Wednesday, the Harris campaign hammered Trump for defending comments he made in September, in which he pledged to be a 'protector of women.' During a rally on Wednesday, Trump said he disagreed with counsel from his advisers that he not use that language. 'I said, ‘Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I’m going to protect them. I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things,’' Trump told supporters in Wisconsin. Harris responded to Trump’s remarks on Thursday, calling them 'the latest in a series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women and their agency.' 'It actually is very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,' the vice president told reporters in Wisconsin. And earlier this week, the Harris campaign released an ad featuring actor Julia Roberts in which she encouraged women to vote for the vice president even if their husbands were backing Trump. 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,' Roberts says in the spot. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign worked to amplify comments from Harris campaign surrogate Mark Cuban, in which he told ABC’s 'The View' on Thursday that 'you never see [Trump] around strong, intelligent women.' Trump’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt tied Harris to the comments in a statement to The Hill. 'Kamala Harris' campaign thinks women who support President Trump are weak and dumb, and she takes issue with President Trump wanting to protect women, men, and children from migrant crime and foreign adversaries,' Leavitt said. 'Women deserve a President who will secure our nation's borders, remove violent criminals from our neighborhoods, and build an economy that helps our families thrive — and that's exactly what President Trump will do,' she continued. On policy, Harris and her allies have sought to amplify abortion access and reproductive health care in the closing salvos of the campaign, tying it to her campaign’s theme of 'freedom.' Amanda Zurawski, a Texas woman who sued the state after she said she was denied an abortion while facing pregnancy complications, delivered remarks alongside her husband ahead of Harris’s own closing argument remarks at the Ellipse outside the White House on Tuesday. Harris herself addressed the issue in her remarks, telling supporters she will 'restore what Donald Trump and his hand selected Supreme Court Justices took away from the women of America.' 'Kamala Harris has delivered this really clear message about the contrast, particularly on the issue of reproductive freedom,' Mackler said. Democrats point to their past success on the issue. In 2022, Democrats largely blunted what was expected to be a red wave in most parts of the country by focusing on abortion access in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The effects were also felt a year later in Virginia’s off-year elections, where Democrats took control of the state’s general assembly. In 2024, Harris and Democrats are tying Trump to bans and restrictions on the procedure at the state level. 'What we have seen since the Dobbs decision in every election is that women are motivated on the issue of abortion and this election is going to be fought and won on abortion,' Mackler said. The issue of abortion access seems to be resonating for young women in particular. According to a KFF survey released earlier this month, roughly four in ten women under 30 said abortion is the most important issue to their vote. Republicans, on the other hand, say abortion is not the only factor impacting the way women will vote in November. 'I don’t think they want to be defined as an abortion voter,' said Kristin Davison, a national GOP strategist. 'Obviously they care about the issue, but it’s not their main driver because they probably have bills to pay and crime is going up in their Atlanta suburb and they aren’t sure Harris is up to the job to fix it.' Republicans also point to the suburban female swing voters, predicting they could vote against Harris on the economy. 'The No. 1 issue for suburban women is the economy,' said Lauren Zelt, a national Republican strategist. 'The Harris campaign is working hard to make this about reproductive issues and understandably so. But at the end of the day women are the primary financial decision makers for their families and they’re going to be voting with their pocket books.' However, many Democrats say the two issues are fundamentally linked. 'I don’t see abortion and economy as separate issues,' said Rachel O’Leary Carmona, the executive director of the Women’s March. 'When we’re talking about the economy, I don’t think with the amount of women heads of household, women primary earners, women who are in the workforce that we can extricate the issue of reproductive freedom from concerns about the economy.' Others have pointed to poor messaging toward women on the part of Republicans, pointing to overly masculine messaging from figures like Elon Musk. 'This bromance and masculinity stuff, it borders on edgy to the point that it’s going to make women uncomfortable,' former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley told Fox News’ Bret Baier on Tuesday. 'You have got affiliated PACs doing commercials about calling Kamala the 'c' word or speakers at Madison Square Garden, you know, referring to her and her ‘pimps,’' she continued, referring to a video posted on X by Musk's super PAC calling Harris the 'c-word' before calling her a 'communist.' The video was deleted by the group on Monday. 'That is not the way to win women. That is not the way to win people who are concerned about Trump’s style,' Haley said. Early voting data shows heightened enthusiasm among women. According to a Politico analysis of the early vote data, women account for 55 percent of the early vote compared to men, who make up 45 percent in the battleground states. Democrats say they are optimistic about those numbers based on how women have broken in polling so far. A CBS News poll released earlier this week showed 55 percent of women supporting Harris, while 43 percent said the same about Trump. On the flip side, 45 percent of men said they were supporting Harris and 54 percent said the same about the former president. 'Every state will be different,' Davison said. 'I do think a woman in Buckhead, outside of Atlanta or Marietta, is going to have a different approach than someone who is in Media, Pa., which is in Delaware County outside of Philadelphia.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/harris-seeks-boost-from-women-voters-to-help-her-over-finish-line/	2024-11-03T10:15:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Female-voters_110324_AP_David-Calvert.jpg?w=900
Election security is a 'top concern': Atlanta mayor	(NewsNation) — Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens is focused on ensuring Atlantans feel safe as they head to the voting booth before Election Day. While concerns linger about the security of the election and those voting, Dickens told 'Morning in America Weekend' that is a top priority in his city. 'Election security is a top concern right now, the Atlanta police department and Fulton County Police Department are working hand in hand to make sure that all polling locations are safe so that voters can feel safe as they go to the polls and leave the polls,' Dickens said. Given the heightened rhetoric in American politics, there are worries violence and unruliness could occur once the next president is announced. 'We hope that individuals will use their best common sense to accept the results of the election, knowing that there's very little fraud that will occur, that this is going to be a safe and secure election, but we make sure that you know, as I talk to our police chief every single morning, we're going to do what needs to be done to keep the people of Atlanta safe,' Dickens added. According to Decision Desk HQ, former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 2.2% in the key battleground state of Georgia.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/election-security-top-concern-atlanta/	2024-11-03T10:10:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-2176590215.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. says Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking wa...	PHOENIX (AP) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president. Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century. Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride. 'On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,' Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, 'want to Make America Healthy Again,' he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy. Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, 'but it sounds OK to me. You know it’s possible.' The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, 'He’s going to have a big role in the administration.' Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as 'a very talented guy and has strong views.' The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump’s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say. Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids. In August, a federal agency determined 'with moderate confidence' that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water. A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it’s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn’t say what those measures should be. In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food &amp; Water Watch. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit. What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to 'reorganize' agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture. But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: 'You can work on food, you can work on anything you want' except oil policy. 'He wants health, he wants women’s health, he wants men’s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,' Trump added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-donald-trump-would-push-to-remove-fluoride-from-drinking-water/	2024-11-03T09:44:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6727b6feee7ff2.41652838.jpeg?w=900
Final Senate rankings: 5 seats most likely to flip	Two days remain until Election Day, and Republicans are aiming to take control of the Senate and expand their majority. Democrats hold a 51-49 advantage, which Republicans have already sliced into with their pending victory in West Virginia. That leaves them needing only one more seat to win back the upper chamber, with Montana and Ohio being the prime targets. According to Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), the GOP has a 70 percent chance of wrestling back the Senate. A number of battleground races have tightened to dead heats, and the performance of former President Trump and Vice President Harris could also play a role in the outcomes. For the final time of the 2024 cycle, here are the top five seats likely to flip: Montana Republican Tim Sheehy, left, is in position to topple Democratic Montana Sen. Jon Tester. (Ben Allan Smith, The Missoulian via Associated Press) A win in Montana means the majority for the GOP, and the party has felt increasingly bullish that Republican Tim Sheehy is in position to topple Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). Montana is widely considered Republicans’ best chance at flipping a seat, outside of West Virginia. According to a recent survey by The Hill/Emerson College, Sheehy leads by 4 percentage points (50 percent to 46 percent) over the three-term incumbent. And the Cook Political Report has the seat in its 'lean Republican' column. Perhaps more indicative of where the race stands is how each side has maneuvered their final spends. A top GOP outside group recently shifted nearly $3 million from Montana to Nevada, where Republicans have seen some last-minute tightening, showing confidence that Sheehy is ready to seal the deal. 'I'm feeling certain about Montana right now,' one Senate Republican told The Hill, noting that recent internal polls on the GOP side have shown Sheehy holding a lead over Tester that is outside the margin of error. Democrats, however, don’t think this race is over despite the public polls. They are quick to note that Montana is notoriously difficult to poll and say that Tester’s 2012 victory, his last run in a presidential year, shows he can win despite polls showing him down. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), left, and Republican Bernie Moreno. (Jeff Dean and David Dermer, Associated Press) The race between Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Republican Bernie Moreno has drawn to even with Tuesday fast approaching. A win in Ohio would expand Republicans’ majority and the race has become the most expensive contest on the Senate map this year. Brown held a steady lead that lasted through Labor Day, buoyed by a massive advantage on the airwaves, but the wind appears to be at Moreno’s back now. An average of polls from DDHQ and The Hill shows Moreno up by just less than 1 percentage point. Republican operatives have argued that the contest is mirroring the trend line of Sen. JD Vance’s (R-Ohio) race two years ago. Vance trailed then-Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) throughout the summer and into October before overtaking and ultimately defeating him by 6 points. They are also counting on a boost from Trump. The operatives say an 8-point victory at the presidential level should be enough to pull Moreno across the finish line. Brown himself has reportedly told donors that an 8-point margin is one that he likely cannot overcome. 'Sherrod's an A [candidate] and Bernie's a C-,' one GOP operative involved in Senate races said. 'But we should win it based on gravity.' The Ohio contest is set to become not only the most expensive Senate race this cycle, but of all time. The Georgia Senate race in 2020 between Sen. Jon Ossoff (D) and former Sen. David Perdue (R) attracted $412 million, with this contest set to eclipse the $500 million mark. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), left, and Republican Eric Hovde. (Mark Schiefelbein and J. Scott Applewhite, Associated Press file) Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) is trying to hang on for dear life as Republican Eric Hovde has brought the must-win race for Democrats to a virtual dead heat. Republicans are eyeing Wisconsin as one of their best pickup opportunities outside of Montana and Ohio. Baldwin, a two-term incumbent, ran ahead of Hovde throughout much of the cycle, but that lead has largely disappeared as GOP-leaning men have come home to the Republican Party. The Cook Political Report rates the contest a 'toss-up.' Still, whether Hovde can get over the final hump remains a major question. According to the final Marquette University Law poll, Baldwin holds a 2-point lead over the GOP nominee. Perhaps just as important, she is outrunning Harris by a slight margin. Democrats still see work to do in the home stretch, and that centers on turning out Democratic-heavy Milwaukee. 'I think you'll see a real focus on the city of Milwaukee from Democrats up and down the ballot in the final hours,' one Wisconsin-based Democratic operative said, pointing to Harris’s rally with Baldwin in the city on Friday and other smaller events. Republicans, meanwhile, see Baldwin as a generic Democrat who will have trouble separating herself from the top of the ticket despite what the Marquette poll says. The race, much like several of the 'blue wall' states, also depends on the margin at the top of the ticket, with Hovde likely needing Trump to win with a big enough margin to carry him across the line. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) left, and David McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania. (Associated Press) Defeating Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has been atop the wish list of Pennsylvania Republicans ever since he knocked off Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) nearly two decades ago, and they easily have their best chance this week. Casey has held a consistent margin over Republican David McCormick into September, but has seen his lead sliced and diced to where it is now — almost deadlocked. While Republicans routinely note that toppling Casey is by no means easy, they laud McCormick and his team for how they’ve been able to tie the Democrat to Harris. The perceived inability to create separation is giving Democrats anxiety as they near the end. 'I always thought Casey would do like 3 points better than the top of the ticket. But polling isn’t showing that. His numbers are the same as Kamala’s,' one senior Pennsylvania Democrat said. 'I’m surprised.' 'Even [Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.)], who isn’t an incumbent, is running better than Bob and has some separation with Harris,' the Democrat continued, saying if Trump wins Pennsylvania 'by 1 then the Senate race could definitely go Republican too.' According to Decision Desk HQ, Casey leads by more than 2 percentage points and has a 72 percent chance at nabbing a fourth term. Republicans are also putting more muscle behind their message in the final stretch as they spent $16.2 million last week compared to $11.9 million by Democrats in the second most expensive Senate race on the map this cycle. Michigan Michigan Senate candidate Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), left, and former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.). (Associated Press) For a time this fall, Republicans had believed that Michigan represented the party’s best chance at winning a non-Montana or non-Ohio race. Unlike races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, the contest between former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and Slotkin does not feature an incumbent after Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) decided against seeking a fifth term, theoretically giving the GOP an advantage not seen elsewhere. However, Slotkin and Michigan have proved a tough nut to crack. Operatives on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged in recent days that while the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan are all up for grabs, Michigan is probably the least likely of the three to flip as the other states have narrowed more in the final weeks. 'Democrats in Michigan can win just if they hit their numbers,' one GOP operative involved in Senate races said. 'We can be perfect in Michigan, but if they hit their numbers, we lose.' Slotkin holds a 3.2-percentage point lead over Rogers, with Harris performing better there than in either of the two other states, according to Decision Desk HQ. And no Republican has won a Senate race in the Wolverine State in 30 years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/final-senate-rankings-5-seats-most-likely-to-flip/	2024-11-03T09:27:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Senate-flip_110324_Illustration_Courtney-JonesScott-ApplewhiteJeff-Dean-and-Matthew-BrownAP.png?w=900
A tie in the Electoral College could have this unprecedented outc...	(NEXSTAR) – A tie in the Electoral College, while very unlikely, is still very much possible thanks to the even number of electoral votes (538) up for grabs in the upcoming presidential election. If neither candidate obtains the 270 votes needed to win — i.e., each candidate gets 269 votes apiece — then the elected members of Congress would decide the winner of the presidency and vice presidency in what’s called a contingent election. That process, in and of itself, would be 'disruptive' and 'problematic,' Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, previously told The Hill. But it could also result in a scenario that the American public hasn’t seen in over 200 years. Which states have the highest and lowest voter turnout in presidential elections? In a contingent election, the House of Representatives would meet to determine the president, with each state’s delegation allowed to cast one vote for the candidate of their choice. (Washington, D.C. would not participate.) The first candidate to receive 26 votes would then become president. But the Senate would be tasked with electing the vice president, with each Senator allowed to cast a single vote. (Again, D.C. would not participate in contingent elections.) The first candidate with 51 votes is then declared the winner. In a contingent election, therefore, it’s possible that the House selects a president from the majority’s preferred party, while the Senate chooses a vice president from the other. Such a scenario would be more likely if the House and Senate are controlled by different parties after the election. For example, a tie in the electoral college after the 2024 election could theoretically result in a Trump-Walz administration, if the Republicans and Democrats manage to retain their current majorities in the House and the Senate, respectively. Signs showing support for both Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump sit along a rural highway on September 26, 2024 near Traverse City, Michigan. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University and the author of 'The Presidents and the People: Five Leaders Who Threatened Democracy and the Citizens Who Fought to Defend It,' believes the chance of this happening in 2024 is 'low.' But that's largely because he believes there are 'vulnerabilities' in the Electoral College system that could allow one candidate — Trump, he named specifically — to unethically manipulate the electoral votes before a contingent election would ever need to take place. 'The system as a whole is very precarious,' Brettschneider said. 'It’s not as stable as it should be.' If indeed a contingent election were held, and a president and vice president from different parties were chosen to serve in the same administration, there would be constant 'undermining' of the other’s objectives, Brettschneider believes. The last time that two politicians from different political parties somewhat reluctantly served in the same administration was between 1797-1801, when President John Adams (a Federalist) and Vice President Thomas Jefferson (a Democratic-Republican) held the offices. '[With] the Adams Administration, you had a president who was intent in shutting down the opposition, and a vice president who was the leader of that opposition,' said Brettschneider, adding that the administration was 'a microcosm of the instability of the country as a whole.' But Adams and Jefferson didn’t end up together because of a contingent election: At the time, the candidate with the most electoral votes became president, and the runner-up became vice president. The 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, aimed to prevent this by overhauling the process to create a distinction between votes for the offices of president and vice president. There’s still nothing in the Constitution that would forbid a two-party presidential ticket. Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson had belonged to different parties (Republican and Democratic) before they successfully ran for the nation’s highest offices in 1864 — though, technically, they had both aligned prior to the election under the newly created National Union party. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had also revealed in his 2018 memoir that he nearly selected Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) as his running mate in the 2008 election, and even expressed regret that he hadn’t. McCain’s advisers, he said, steered him toward Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, fearing that Lieberman’s pro-choice stance on abortion would hurt his chances. 'It was sound advice that I could reason for myself,' McCain wrote. 'But my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.' Why doesn’t the popular vote determine the president? But even a potential McCain-Lieberman ticket would have been spearheaded by politicians who willingly chose to be running mates. A Trump-Walz administration, on the other hand, would not be built on as stable a foundation — and could result in both men trying to undermine each other, or oust the other from power. 'I don’t see it as a good thing,' said Brettschneider.

US officials warding off foreign interference in election	(NewsNation) — Cyber attacks, deepfake artificial intelligence images and online misinformation are some of the tactics foreign countries are using to attempt to influence the upcoming U.S. election.

Harris appears on 'Saturday Night Live' as mirror image of Maya R...	NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' in the final days before the election, playing herself as the mirror-image double of Maya Rudolph's version of her. The first lines the candidate spoke as she sat across from Rudolph was drowned out by cheers from the audience. 'It is nice to see you Kamala,' Harris told Rudolph, 'and I’m just here to remind you you got this.' In sync, the two said supporters need to 'Keep Kamala and carry-on-ala,' declared that they share each other's 'belief in the promise of America,' and delivered the signature 'Live from New York it's Saturday night!' Harris made the surprise trip to New York City with the election looming, briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she’s been furiously campaigning in favor of the iconic sketch comedy show, where she was hoping to generate buzz and appeal to a nationwide audience. Harris arrived in New York on Air Force Two after an early evening campaign stop Saturday on in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was scheduled to head to Detroit, but once in the air, aides said she'd be making an unscheduled stop and the plane landed at LaGuardia Airport. Harris arrived at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan, where SNL tapes, shortly after 8 p.m., enough time for a quick rehearsal before the show airs live at 11:30 p.m. It is the final SNL episode before Election Day on Tuesday. The visit wasn’t previously announced and an official familiar with Harris’ planning only officially confirmed it for reporters traveling with the vice president moments before the live airing began. The official insisted on anonymity to discuss plans before they were made public. Rudolph first played Harris on the show in 2019 and has reprised her role this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice president, including calling herself 'Momala' — a reference to the affectionate nickname her stepchildren gave her. Rudolph opened the show’s season premiere with the line: 'Well, well, well. Look who fell out of that coconut tree.' And she’s joked about keeping President Joe Biden in his place. Harris' husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, was played again by former cast member Andy Samberg and Dana Carvey appeared as President Joe Biden. Rudolph's performance has won critical and comedic acclaim — including from Harris herself. 'Maya Rudolph — I mean, she’s so good,' Harris said last month on ABC's 'The View.' 'She had the whole thing, the suit, the jewelry, everything!' Harris added that she was impressed with Rudolph’s 'mannerisms.' Jason Miller, a senior adviser to former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump, expressed surprise that Harris would appear on SNL given what he characterized as her unflattering portrayal on the show. Asked if Trump had been invited to appear, he said: 'I don’t know. Probably not.' Politicians nonetheless have a long history on SNL, including Trump, who hosted the show in 2015 — though appearing so close to Election Day is unusual. Hillary Clinton was running in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary when she appeared next to Amy Poehler, who played her on the show and was known for launching into a trademark, exaggerated cackle. The real Clinton wondered during her appearance, 'Do I really laugh like that?' Harris repeated that line in response to Rudolph's portrayal of her laugh in Saturday's episode. Clinton returned in 2016, while running against Trump in a race she ultimately lost. The first sitting president to appear on SNL was Republican Gerald Ford, who did so less than a year after the show debuted. Ford appeared in April 1976 on an episode hosted by his press secretary, Ron Nessen, and declared the show’s famous opening rejoinder, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday Night.' Then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama appeared alongside Poehler impersonating Clinton in 2007, and Republican Bob Dole was on the show in November 1996 -- a mere 11 days after losing that year’s election to Bill Clinton. Dole consoled Norm Macdonald, who played the Kansas senator. Then there was Tina Fey’s 2008 impression of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin — and in particular her joke that 'I can see Russia from my house.' It was so good that Fey eventually won an Emmy and Palin herself appeared on the show that October, in the weeks before the election. ___ Long, Miller and Weissert reported from Washington.

Trump's nephew warns of unchecked power in a second Trump term	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump's nephew Fred Trump III in an interview on 'NewsNation Prime' warned of what another presidency under his uncle would look like. Fred Trump also said that the former president reportedly told him to let his disabled son die. Fred Trump said his uncle had never met his son, William, now 25, who has complex disabilities. When he called Donald Trump to discuss his son's condition, the former president responded: 'Your son doesn't recognize you. Let him die and move down to Florida.' 'I just simply said 'Donald, he does recognize me, and he is to me … the most courageous and inspirational person I know,'' the younger Trump recalled during the Saturday interview. Harris takes lead over Trump in Iowa: Poll Fred Trump was promoting his new book, 'All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way,' which features 'never-before-told stories' about the Trump family and Fred Trump’s complex relationship with the former president. He said similar comments about disabled people were made by Donald Trump in the Oval Office in 2020. The former president's nephew also warned about a potential second Trump term, saying there would be no 'guardrails' to check his power. He criticized his uncle's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that 'tens of thousands' were dying daily during his administration. Fred Trump said he decided to publish the book after the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots, which he called 'an absolute turning point,' and after his son moved into a group home, ensuring his safety from potential harassment. Trump says it’s ‘tough’ for Republicans to win the popular vote Fred Trump and his sister, Mary, have been vocal critics of their uncle. Trump communications director Steven Cheung denied Fred Trump’s claims in a statement to NewsNation partner The Hill. 'This is completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order,' he said. 'It is appalling a lie so blatantly disgusting can be printed in media. Anyone who knows President Trump knows he would never use such language, and false stories like this have been thoroughly debunked.' 'This is nothing more than a cheap shot to sell copies of a book that belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section,' he added.

AP Sources: Kamala Harris will appear on SNL in last episode befo...	NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris has made an unannounced trip to New York to appear on ' Saturday Night Live,' briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she’s been campaigning with just three days to go before the election. Harris departed on Air Force Two after a campaign stop on Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was scheduled to head to Detroit, but once the aircraft was in the air, aides said it was actually going to New York. Her appearance on the show was confirmed by three people familiar with Harris' plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. It is the final SNL episode before Election Day on Tuesday.

Trump says it’s ‘tough’ for Republicans to win the popular vote	Former President Trump argued that Republicans winning the popular vote is 'tough' because of Democratic strength in certain strongholds ahead of Election Day on Tuesday. Trump said at a rally in Virginia that votes need to turn out on Tuesday because he wants to win 'everything,' including the popular vote. But he said states like California make winning the popular vote tough. 'When you have New York, Illinois and California, you have automatically, it’s like ridiculous, automatically goes to a Democrat, it’s tough to win the popular vote because they’re three big states,' he said. While Trump won the presidency in 2016, he was unsuccessful in winning the popular vote that year against Hillary Clinton or in 2020 against President Biden. Democrats have won the popular vote in the past five of six presidential elections going back to 2000, though Republicans have won in the Electoral College three of those times. Trump claimed that polls are showing him leading 'everything' and that he expects to win the popular vote. He also alluded to his false claims of voter fraud helping Democrats, as he has claimed cost him reelection in 2020. 'I’d love to win the popular vote with them cheating. Let them cheat because that’s what they do. They do it very well. They’re very professional, but I think we have a really good chance to win the popular vote, and I think things are going to be very interesting,' he said. Because the Electoral College requires candidates to win enough states to equal 270 electoral votes, winning the popular vote is not necessarily enough to get over the finish line. Democrats have more recently been the victim of this effect, as frequent winners of the popular vote recently but falling short in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by 2 points in 2016 but narrowly lost the electoral vote. Biden won the popular vote by 4.5 points but only narrowly pulled off an electoral win. Experts have said Vice President Harris may not have enough to win the popular vote by as much as past Democrats because of some shifts in the electorate giving Republicans an improvement in popular vote margins that don’t necessarily help in the Electoral College. Trump’s visit to Virginia is one of a couple of stops he’s making this weekend to states that have leaned Democratic and are expected to vote for Harris comfortably.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-its-tough-for-republicans-to-win-the-popular-vote/	2024-11-02T17:26:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trumpdonald_110224gn15_w.jpg?w=900
Harris takes lead over Trump in Iowa: Poll	Vice President Harris has taken a 3-point lead over her opponent, former President Trump, in red-leaning Iowa, according to a new poll released on Saturday. The new Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey found Harris outpacing Trump by 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent, among Iowa’s likely voters, jumping ahead of the former president who won the state in both 2016 and 2020. The result was just inside the survey’s margin of error. The September iteration of the poll had Trump leading the vice president by 4 points. 'It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,' pollster J. Ann Selzer told The Des Moines Register. 'She has clearly leaped into a leading position.' Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who remains on the Iowa ballot, got 3 percent support. Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver was at less than 1 percent. Some 3 percent said they were not sure about their choice, 2 percent did not share who they already voted for and 1 percent said they sided with someone else, according to the survey. Both White House candidates have heavily campaigned in the seven battleground states. Neither has campaigned in Iowa following the conclusion of the party’s primaries, the Register noted. The last time a Democratic nominee won Iowa was former President Obama in 2012. 'Age and gender are the two most dynamic factors that are explaining these numbers,' Selzer said. Harris leads Trump among women independent voters by 28 points, 57 percent to 29 percent, while the GOP nominee was ahead by 10 points among independent men voters, 47 percent to 37 percent, according to the poll. The vice president has an advantage among those aged 65 and above. She leads Trump by 35 points, 63 percent to 28 percent, among senior women. Her lead is significantly smaller among senior men, beating Trump 47 percent to 45 percent, according to the survey. The poll found a larger contingent of Trump supporters being enthusiastic about backing the former president compared to Harris’s supporters. Around 76 percent of the ex-president’s supporters are 'extremely or very enthusiastic' about their pick in this election, 5 points more than 71 percent that expressed the same about Harris. Approximately 91 percent of respondents said they were firm about the choice in his White House election. The poll was conducted Oct. 28-31 among 808 likely voters. The margin of error was 3.4 percentage points.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-takes-lead-over-trump-in-iowa-poll/	2024-11-02T17:25:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Top-Harris-and-Trump_102924_AP.jpg?w=900
Harrison Ford endorses Harris for president	Actor Harrison Ford announced his endorsement of Vice President Harris in the 2024 White House race three days before Election Day. Ford shared that he would be voting for the Democratic nominee in a video recorded for the Harris-Walz campaign. In them, he praised the Democratic ticket for believing in the 'rule of law' while slamming former President Trump for 'embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.' The 'Indiana Jones' star referenced former Trump administration officials who have spoken out against the GOP nominee in the video posted Saturday and added that Harris will protect the people’s 'right to disagree with her about policies or ideas.' 'You have to pay attention,' Ford said. 'They're telling us something important. These aren't soft people. They're governors, generals standing up against the leader of the party. They spent their lives advocating for many of them. This will be the first time they've ever voted for someone who doesn't have an R next to their name, because they know this really matters.' 'The other guy [Trump], he demands unquestioning loyalty, says he wants revenge,' Ford says in the video. 'I'm Harrison Ford. I've got one vote, same as anyone else, and I'm going to use it to move forward. I'm going to vote for, Kamala Harris.' Ford joins a group of other celebrities, artists and Hollywood stars that have endorsed the Democratic nominee, including Taylor Swift, Leonardo DiCaprio, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, and others. Some have appeared with Harris on the campaign trail. Ford, in another video that was released by Rolling Stone on Saturday, emphasized that he does not agree with every policy position the Democratic ticket holds, but said they would govern, if elected, for all Americans. 'But these two people believe in the rule of law,' the actor says in the video. 'They believe in science. They believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans, they believe that we are in this together. These are ideas I believe in. These are people I can get behind.' The actor, who endorsed President Biden in 2020, said he is displeased by 'a lot of things' in the U.S., but emphasized that the country needs to 'work together again.' 'Look, I'm frustrated about a lot of things in this country,' he said. 'I'm sure you are too. But the other guy, he spent four years turning us against each other while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world. That's not who we are. We don't need to make America great again. Come on. We are great, but we need is to work together again. All we need is a president who works for all of us, and again.' The Hill has reached out to the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign’s spokesperson for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/harrison-ford-endorses-harris-for-president/	2024-11-02T17:25:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24015081327606-2.jpg?w=900
Georgia surpasses 4 million votes on last day of early voting	The Georgia Secretary of State’s office announced 4,004,588 voters have cast ballots through early voting or absentee by mail in a Saturday release. 'This was the most successful Early Voting period in Georgia history because voters trust the process,' said Secretary Brad Raffensperger in a statement. 'Four years of progress brought us here. We’re battle-tested and ready, regardless of what the critics say. And we’re going to hold those who interfere in our elections accountable.' The Peach State's election official noted that 92 counties exceeded 50 percent turnout for the first time in state history. A total of 3,761,968 people voted in person early while 242,620 sent in ballots by mail. The Secretary of State’s office did flag that four individuals may have violated Georgia law by attempting to cast multiple ballots. They are investigating reports accordingly. This week, the state also was subject to false reports about immigrants casting multiple ballots in videos on social media. Raffensperger addressed the posts in a Thursday statement, casting blame on foreign election interference. 'Earlier today, our office became aware of a video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant with multiple Georgia ID’s claiming to have voted multiple times,' he wrote. 'This is false and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen in this and other elections. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election.' He said the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is investigating the matter and has asked Elon Musk to remove the post from the social media platform X in hopes of preventing false narratives. 'As Americans we can’t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine our faith in our institutions - or each other,' Raffensperger added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-surpasses-4-million-votes-on-last-day-of-early-voting/	2024-11-02T15:33:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/votesticker_100822_ap-ben-gray_georgia.jpeg?w=900
Swifties for Kamala launches fandom mail campaign in Pennsylvania	Swifties for Kamala launched a fandom mail program targeting low propensity voters in Pennsylvania.

'We are offering encouragement, information and a call to action all wrapped up in a welcoming, star-covered envelope.' According to the release from the group, more than 250,000 mail pieces have been sent to encourage voters in Pennsylvania to support Harris. Wu also made a post about the launch on the social platform X on Saturday, which included a screenshot of the press release and a photo of a 'VOTE' card and a 'Voting Era' friendship bracelet — a nod to the friendship bracelet exchange that happens among Taylor Swift fans oftentimes at her concerts. The press release said that the bracelets were included in 50,000 of the mailers. 'Potential voters across PA have started receiving these in their mailboxes over the past few weeks,' Annie Wu Henry wrote in the post. Swifties for Kamala sprung into action long before Taylor Swift endorsed Harris in September, with 35,000 helping to raise $130,000 during the course of a fundraising call earlier this year. Pennsylvania is a key battleground state for the candidates, with Trump narrowly leading Harris, 48.6 percent to 48.1 percent, according to a polling aggregate from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ).	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/swifties-for-kamala-launches-fandom-mail-campaign-in-pennsylvania/	2024-11-02T15:32:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/swift-harris-ap.jpg?w=900

Trump blasts 'insecure' Cuban for remarks on women voters	Former President Trump hammered down on his comments alleging Mark Cuban was 'insecure' after the billionaire claimed the Republican nominee was 'intimidated' by intelligent women. 'I know Mark very well. He’s a very insecure guy. He can’t hit a golf ball more than 50 yards,' Trump said during a Saturday call in to Fox and Friends. 'He’s weak physically and mentally as far as I’m concerned, but I’ve known him for a long time.' The former president also described Cuban’s retraction and apology as a 'weak' move. 'He’s totally retracted his statement like weak people always do, they restrict their statements,' Trump said. After Cuban’s comments, various Republican women hit back on the billionaire's claims while affirming Trump’s support of them and their leadership. 'I’m told @mcuban needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are,' senior Trump adviser Susan Wiles posted on X. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R ) also chimed in encouraging voters to cast their ballot for Trump. 'I’m proud to be the highest-ranking woman in the United States Congress. When I ran, I was the youngest woman ever elected. I’m the most senior woman on the House Arms Services Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and I proudly am voting and endorse President Trump,' Stefanik said in a video. 'Save America in five days, vote Trump.' During the former president's call in, he said Cuban was held accountable by 'strong people.' 'He was hit by the strongest people. It wasn’t men, it was women,' Trump said on air. 'He was hit women that make men look like babies because if you know many of the women that I deal with, that I have, and I could go over the list but the list is long, including the fact that I happen to be married to a rather strong woman who just right now happens to have the number one best seller in the whole wide world.' Trump has criticized Cuban regularly throughout the campaign cycle. Last month, he called the top Harris surrogate a 'loser' in a Truth Social post.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-blasts-insecure-cuban-for-remarks-on-women-voters/	2024-11-02T15:32:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24300854967845-e1730204775938.jpg?w=900
Harris planning to vote by mail to ‘model behavior’	Vice President Harris will vote by mail ahead of Election Day as a way to 'model' the different modes of voting for Americans, the campaign told reporters Saturday. The team, however, didn't provide an update on whether Harris had already sent her ballot. The vice president is from California, but she has not traveled back to the state recently. Instead, she has prioritized her travel on the swing states, as the White House race remains close with less than a week left until the election. 'She wants to model behavior for other voters to continue to take advantage of the various modes of voting that we have during the [Get Out the Vote] time period,' campaign officials said. The team added that by Tuesday, they will be focused on convincing low propensity voters after they’ve made the push for early voting. 'That is the effort that we are pushing to all voters right now so that on Tuesday, it will be a last call for those final low propensity voters that this campaign needs to turn out and continue to convince all the way through polls closing on Election Day,' the official said. President Biden voted in-person in Delaware Monday, while early voting was open in his home. Gov Tim Walz (D), Harris's running mate, also opted to vote early, casting a ballot last week in his home state of Minnesota. The vice president is expected to spend election night at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, a source familiar told The Hill earlier this week. The vice president’s campaign has prioritized outreach to Black voters in the weeks before Election Day, while polling has indicated former President Trump is making gains with that voting bloc. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's polling aggregate shows that the party nominees are within 0.1 points of each other nationally. Harris had a slight edge over Trump, garnering 48.2 percent to his 48.1 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-planning-to-vote-by-mail-to-model-behavior/	2024-11-02T15:32:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24307100310143-e1730567526699.jpg?w=900
Harris, Trump issue appeal to Americans abroad in bid for more vo...	Nearly 5 million Americans living abroad are eligible to vote from overseas, representing a small but unique group that could influence the results in key swing states. While participation among overseas voters is considered low at less than 8 percent, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump have sent out direct appeals to these voters. 'We know there's a lot of enthusiasm,' said Sharon Manitta, global press secretary for Democrats Abroad, an official arm of the Democratic Party for overseas voters. 'The thing is, really, until the election is settled, goodness knows when that will be, we don't really know how that enthusiasm turns into turnout,' said Manitta, who is based in the United Kingdom. In 2020, more than 27,000 overseas ballot requests were registered in the swing states of Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Trump, in an Oct. 12 video, called on Americans living abroad to make sure they are registered to vote. He also promised to end double-taxation — where, generally, Americans pay taxes in the country they live in and the U.S. There are exemptions, and policies can vary from country to country. 'It was an October surprise from our side, from Republicans Overseas,' Solomon Yeu, the chief executive of Republicans Overseas, a political advocacy group that worked with the Trump campaign on the video. It also represented an about-face for Trump, who had earlier criticized and raised doubt over the legality of Americans voting overseas. Trump attacked the 1986 law that established overseas voting as 'a program that emails ballots overseas without any citizenship check or verification of identity, whatsoever,' in a post on Truth Social. Requirements can vary among states but generally a Social Security number or a valid state driver's license, or passport number can be used for identification verification. Republicans in North Carolina, Michigan and Pennsylvania have pursued, unsuccessfully, efforts to challenge rights for Americans overseas and people born overseas to American parents to vote in the U.S. elections. And while the Democratic Party has an official arm dedicated to overseas voters, this group is also generally overlooked. In this presidential election, for the first time, the Democratic National Committee provided Democrats Abroad with about $300,000 to help register voters and carry out get-out-the vote campaigns. Ballot requests for overseas voters opens 45 days before the election, in September. But it wasn’t until Oct. 24 that Harris published an open letter to Americans voting overseas in which she promised to take seriously their concerns surrounding finances, like banking and taxes, as well as access to consular services and immigration and citizenship processes. 'We were pleased … that both candidates have acknowledged that something has to be done on taxation of Americans overseas, or acknowledge that there's an interest in addressing these issues and doing something,' said Marylouise Serrato, executive director of American Citizens Abroad, a nonpartisan and nonprofit advocacy group. 'That's, for us, a really positive sign.' That came alongside a stepped up effort by the Biden administration earlier this year, which for the first time conducted a survey of Americans abroad on issues they are concerned about, said Martha McDevitt-Pugh, the international chair of Democrats Abroad. 'There really isn’t a lot of data around us, so we were really encouraged by that survey,' she said, adding that it led to the first-ever White House call with overseas stakeholders to talk about increasing awareness around government resources for Americans abroad. An estimated 2.9 million Americans who live abroad are eligible to vote. Another 1.4 million uniformed services members and 600,000 military spouses and vote-age dependents also live abroad, according to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). It’s not clear how many voters overseas come from specific states; that data won’t be available until well after Election Day and will have to be checked among multiple sources. The number of Americans voting from abroad can fluctuate for a variety of reasons: the increase in people working remotely, people retiring abroad, students studying overseas, Peace Corps workers, and military voters. Americans voting from abroad request ballots from their last address in the United States, no matter if it was a rented apartment or home or if decades had passed since they last lived there. And while the Federal Voting Assistance Program counted the participation rate of voters from abroad as unchanged between 2016 and 2020 — at 7.8 percent — the EAC recorded a 39 percent increase in returned overseas ballots between 2016 and 2020 — 655,844 overseas ballots in 2016 and more than 900,000 in 2020. Still, there are barriers to participation. Slow postal services, access to printers, personal follow through and confusion over each state’s voting requirements — either the need to mail in a ballot, fax, or submit it online — can also play a role in low participation rates. Rejected ballots are rare, at about 2.1 percent according to EAC, but the most common reason is an absentee ballot received after a state's deadline. On Thursday, Military Times published a report that election officials in the state of Georgia said 13,000 ballots requested by overseas military and Americans abroad have yet to be returned. One of the core issues with increasing the overseas vote is education, said Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and CEO of Overseas Vote, a 20-year-old nonpartisan, nonprofit public charity that helps inform people of their right to vote overseas and provides resources to help people submit their ballots. 'The fundamental problem we have with people voting from abroad is they don't know they have the right,' she said. Dzieduszycka-Suinat, who is based in Germany, said misinformation also plays a role in discouraging people from voting, such as a fear that there’s a connection between voting and increased taxes among people who live overseas. A myth versus fact section of the Overseas Vote website addresses the connection between voting and taxes. 'That is terrible for us in terms of voter participation, because people think, if I vote, they'll run me down for taxes,' she said. Still, she welcomes the increased attention on voters overseas as an opportunity to work to improve participation rates, even if some of that attention comes from Republican lawsuits or criticisms over the authenticity of overseas votes. 'There may be a renewed opportunity after the election, depending on how it goes, to improve the program, even more with some reform,' she said.

Harris, Trump issue appeal to Americans abroad in bid for more vo...	Nearly 5 million Americans living abroad are eligible to vote from overseas, representing a small but unique group that could influence the results in key swing states. While participation among overseas voters is considered low at less than 8 percent, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump have sent out direct appeals to these voters. 'We know there's a lot of enthusiasm,' said Sharon Manitta, global press secretary for Democrats Abroad, an official arm of the Democratic Party for overseas voters. 'The thing is, really, until the election is settled, goodness knows when that will be, we don't really know how that enthusiasm turns into turnout,' said Manitta, who is based in the United Kingdom. In 2020, more than 27,000 overseas ballot requests were registered in the swing states of Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Trump, in an Oct. 12 video, called on Americans living abroad to make sure they are registered to vote. He also promised to end double-taxation — where, generally, Americans pay taxes in the country they live in and the U.S. There are exemptions, and policies can vary from country to country. 'It was an October surprise from our side, from Republicans Overseas,' Solomon Yeu, the chief executive of Republicans Overseas, a political advocacy group that worked with the Trump campaign on the video. It also represented an about-face for Trump, who had earlier criticized and raised doubt over the legality of Americans voting overseas. Trump attacked the 1986 law that established overseas voting as 'a program that emails ballots overseas without any citizenship check or verification of identity, whatsoever,' in a post on Truth Social.

FBI condemns fake election security videos	The FBI released a statement on Saturday addressing false claims about the election and reaffirming their intention to ensure voter security leading up to Election Day. 'The FBI is aware of two videos falsely claiming to be from the FBI relating to election security, one stating the FBI has apprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud and a second relating to the Second Gentleman,' the agency wrote in a post on X. 'These videos are not authentic, are not from the FBI, and the content they depict is false.' While voters headed to precincts to cast their ballots, the FBI warned individuals to be aware of election related fraud schemes using fake images and names. 'Election integrity is among our highest priorities, and the FBI is working closely with state and local law enforcement partners to respond to election threats and protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote,' the bureau said in their statement. 'Attempts to deceive the public with false content about FBI operations undermines our democratic process and aims to erode trust in the electoral system.' The state of Georgia reported an instance of Russian election interference on Friday falsely depicting a Haitian immigrant casting multiple ballots. The Secretary of State addressed the matter by asking Elon Musk to remove the post, labeling it 'disinformation.' 'This is false, and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen this election. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election,' Raffensperger said in a statement on Thursday night. Earlier this month, the FBI and CISA also claimed China was behind former President Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance’s (R-Ohio), phone hacks. The agency is encouraging voters to stay aware of potential schemes as Nov. 5 approaches. 'The FBI encourages everyone to seek election and voting information from reliable sources, such as your local election office,' they wrote. 'And if you suspect criminal activity, we ask that you report that information to state or local law enforcement or your local FBI field office.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/fbi-condemns-fake-election-security-videos/	2024-11-02T15:31:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Zoom-In-Georgia_052124_AP_Mike-Stewart.jpg?w=900

Raffensperger urges voters to ignore X ad purporting fraud: 'Don'...	Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensbegrer addresses a video falsely depicting a Haitian immigrant voting numerous times during a Friday CNN appearance. 'As we checked it out, came to a conclusion real quick. So we responded very quickly, you know, on Twitter and then also with a press release, just to let people know it's fake, don't fall for it,' Raffensperger said. 'Because in effect, what people want to do, these nation state actors, is really get us fighting among ourselves.' Earlier in the video, Raffensperger debunked the video by assuring voters that individuals cannot receive multiple state IDs with the same name. The leader attributed the video to 'bad actors' who are trying to divide the nation. 'We've got enough that splits us. We don't need to have the Russians or other bad actors try and split us further,' he said on air. 'So, you know, this was a week after the Intel community had said that a phony video showing fraud in Pennsylvania was just that, was phony, and that also had come from Russia.' The FBI has publicly addressed the uptick in fake videos by urging voters to be cautious of what they see on social media. The agency warned people that accounts using the name’s and images of candidates are being used to distribute false information.

Harris widens lead on Trump in Virginia: Poll	(The Hill) — Vice President Harris widened her lead over her opponent former President Trump in Virginia, with less than 3 days left before Election Day, according to a poll released on Friday. The survey, conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR) at Roanoke College, found the vice president leading Trump by 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent, among Virginia’s likely voters. Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both received 2 percent support while Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1 percent. Some 2 percent of respondents were undecided while another 2 percent said they would choose another candidate. The economy was the top issue for the likely voters at 43 percent. Abortion was second with 20 percent, followed by immigration at 12 percent. Foreign affairs was the fourth most important issue with 8 percent while crime was at 3 percent, according to the survey. Respondents trusted Harris more on both crime and foreign policy, 49 percent to Trump’s 45 percent. They favored Trump on the economy, 49 percent to 46 percent. On immigration, both White House contenders were tied at 48 percent. Likely voters had more faith in Harris on abortion, 57 percent to the Republican nominee’s 36 percent. Approximately 46 percent of the poll’s respondents said that Harris cares and understands people like them, nearly 10 points higher than Trump’s 37 percent. A Washington Post/Schar School, released just over a week ago, had Harris leading Trump by 6 points, 49 percent to 43 percent, in Virginia. The vice president is up by 5 percent over the GOP nominee, 50 percent to 45 percent, in Virginia, according to the latest The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s tally of surveys. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to 29 among 851 likely registered voters in the Old Dominion State. The margin of error was 4.6 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/polls/harris-widens-lead-on-trump-in-virginia-poll/	2024-11-02T15:00:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trumpdonald_harriskamala_110124gn01_w-e1730580140254.jpg?w=798
Ballot box fires stoke fears of election violence	Two ballot drop box fires in the Pacific Northwest this week have stoked concerns about election security and the risk of violence in the 2024 election days before voting concludes. Arson burned hundreds of ballots in what one official called 'a direct attack on democracy' in Vancouver, Wash., and harmed a small handful in nearby Portland, Ore. The pair of incidents mark rare disruptions to election administration, experts stressed, but they raise worries about whether more threats or attacks are to come amid a tense, polarized race — and whether the incidents could sow voter distrust in the systems. 'There’s this larger environment of distrust in our elections that has generated a set of security and safety concerns that ballot drop boxes are just one part of,' said Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California. 'These sorts of actions, like bombing these drop boxes, I think … are ultimately about increasing fear, increasing distrust and potentially discouraging people from voting.' Officials in Oregon and Washington have said the evidence suggests the two incidents this week, plus a third possible arson incident in the Evergreen State last month, are connected. A suspect description and vehicle have been identified, and the Portland Police Bureau said Wednesday that investigators believe 'it is possible that the suspect intends to continue these targeted attacks.' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been on alert in the run-up to Election Day that drop boxes could be targeted by 'domestic violent extremists' this cycle, according to internal bulletins, and experts are now concerned about continued or copycat attacks after the Pacific Northwest fires. 'Some social media users are discussing and encouraging various methods of sabotaging ballot drop boxes and avoiding detection, likely heightening the potential for targeting of this election infrastructure through the 2024 election cycle,' the DHS concluded in a September memo. The Vancouver drop box was notably in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, where incumbent Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D) faces a rematch against Republican Joe Kent in one of the cycle’s most competitive races. The Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman noted on social platform X, replying to the arson reports, that the Democrat beat Kent by just 2,629 votes in the midterms. The incidents also risk shaking voter confidence in an already fraught election cycle. Though a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Research Center found most voters have confidence their local and state officials will accurately count ballots, more than half of Republican voters in a YouGov survey last month said they’re worried poll workers could tamper with their ballots. Roughly three-quarters of voters in the AP polling also said that they’re at least somewhat concerned about violence over the election outcome. 'Sometimes the fear, the concern around it is enough to impact people’s sense of security. … People will see the headlines and wonder ‘Could this happen to my local drop box?’' Romero said. That’s why experts, who have been working overtime to debunk rumors and break through misinformation online ahead of Election Day, are pointing to how this week’s ballot drop box fires were handled as a positive sign of voting security for 2024. An incendiary device was placed inside the Portland ballot box, officials said, but fire suppressant inside protected 'virtually all' the ballots. Just three ballots were identified as damaged, and the affected voters were contacted for replacements. Hundreds of ballots were damaged at the Vancouver location, where a suspected incendiary device was found next to the drop box. It’s possible some ballots were completely burned, and a half-dozen were unidentifiable. But elections staff were able to identify 488 damaged ballots, according to the county. As of Tuesday evening, 345 of those voters had already contacted the Clark County office to request a replacement, and new ballots were mailed to the remaining identified voters on Thursday. 'This is certainly a threat that election officials have anticipated could happen in any given election from the moment we started installing drop boxes. So officials in Oregon and Washington really tried to make plans to respond to this, and prevent it from happening,' said Kim Wyman, a senior fellow with Bipartisan Policy Center's Elections Project and former Republican secretary of state in Washington. 'The good news is that election officials have really been preparing for this week for the last four years, and they’ve tried to build in as many security measures that they can for voters at polling places and early voting centers, [and] around mail-in ballots,' Wyman said, though she noted experts are bracing for 'a spike in activity' as Election Day nears. Oregon and Washington are both vote-by-mail states and have long used drop boxes to collect ballots. More states began embracing the tools last cycle to grapple with administration difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The boxes served as a way to avoid large crowds at polling places and have been seen as a more reliable delivery method than the U.S. Postal Service, due in part to confusion with postmarks and deadlines. The boxes have nevertheless drawn controversy amid an ongoing swirl of election conspiracies in recent years. Former President Trump, for one, has previously cast doubt on mail-in voting and argued the boxes opened ballots up to be tampered with. An Associated Press investigation in 2022 debunked those claims, finding that the expanded use of drop boxes in 2020 did not lead to fraud, theft or other issues that could have swayed the results. 'There’s almost no method of voting that’s invulnerable from somebody going to do something unexpected,' said Paul Gronke, director of the Elections &amp; Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland. But for the individual voter, he said, drop boxes are one of the safest methods of ensuring their votes are delivered on time. Still, other election security-related concerns loom over the 2024 homestretch. Threats and scrutiny often linked to false claims of voter fraud have contributed to a mass exodus of local election officials in recent years, raising alarms about understaffed and inexperienced teams left to handle the process — and to face potential new threats. Experts are also worried about misinformation, artificial intelligence and foreign influence on elections. And, as Trump and others continue to tout disproven claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 results, experts are on high alert for protests and violence postelection, nearly four years after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. The presidential race is on a razor’s edge as Election Day nears, and the latest polling averages from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill put Harris up by 0.3 points nationally, with similarly tight margins in key battlegrounds. Jim Messina, who served as a White House adviser to former President Obama, said last month that Trump 'is going to try to steal this.' Trump’s former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin has said the Biden administration 'needs to be ready to secure the Capitol and state capitols.' 'When you tell the population repeatedly, over and over again for years, that the election has been stolen and that election officials can't be trusted— that's inevitably going to lead to distrust of our election system and the risk of violence,' Ben Berwick, counsel at the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy, told The Hill in an interview last week. But even in the face of 'all this gloom and doom' around threats, conspiracies and potential violence, Wyman urged voters to remember that election officials have been readying to take on 2024 since 2020. 'A lot of planning has gone into this election by election officials across the country. They’ve been trying to think about those threats and have plans in place if something does materialize. They’ve been working with law enforcement and their federal partners to really vet those plans and be ready,' she said. 'People should feel safe going to their polling places on Election Day and participating in the election.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ballot-box-fires-stoke-fears-of-election-violence/	2024-11-02T14:59:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Ballot-box-fires_110224_AP_Greg-Kimsey.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump holds campaign event in Virginia	Former President Trump took a slight detour from his battleground state swing Saturday afternoon, giving remarks to supporters in Virginia. Trump is expected to target Vice President Harris over inflation, housing prices, and immigration, while arguing that the Biden administration has turned Virginia into a 'border state,' according to the campaign. The stop also comes as early voting is set to end in the state. The visit also follows a Supreme Court decision Wednesday that gave Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) and election officials the ability to cancel more than 1,600 voter registrations, which the state claimed were held by noncitizens. Youngkin endorsed the former president earlier this year. With just days left until the election, the GOP presidential nominee is trailing Harris by half a point — 45 percent to 50 percent — according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's polling index. Trump's remarks in Salem, Va., are scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. EDT.

Watch live: Harris, Bon Jovi rally voters in North Carolina	Vice President Harris will offer her closing remarks to voters in swing state North Carolina Saturday afternoon, just hours after early voting ended in the state. Harris will be joined in the battleground state by musical artists Bon Jovi and Khalid, as well as 'Scandal' actress Kerry Washington, among other guests. She has leaned heavily on celebrity endorsements as of late — including rallies in recent days with Cardi B and Jennifer Lopez. With 16 Electoral College votes up for grabs and just days until Election Day, both the vice president and former President Trump have spent significant time in the North Carolina. Trump is holding two campaign events in the state on Saturday. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling index shows that the race is still tight among Tar Heel State voters, with the former president garnering 49.1 percent support to Harris's 47.7 percent. The rally in Charlotte, N.C., is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

Trump will rally backers every day until the election in North Ca...	GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) — Donald Trump will rally supporters in North Carolina every day until Tuesday's election, a flurry of late activity in the only swing state that he won in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Even as Trump looks to expand the electoral map and project strength with trips to New Mexico and Virginia, two Democratic states not widely viewed as competitive, he is putting considerable time into North Carolina, which last backed a Democrat for president in 2008. The former president's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency gets significantly more complicated if he loses North Carolina. The fast-growing Southern state gave Trump his smallest margin of victory — 1.3 percentage points — over Democrat Joe Biden four years ago. Trump campaigned in Gastonia, west of Charlotte, on Saturday and was scheduled to be in Greensboro later in the day, with a stop in Salem, Virginia, in between. He will be in the eastern city of Kinston on Sunday and in Raleigh on Monday. Those four rallies will bring his total events in North Carolina since Oct. 1 to nine. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been in the state six times during the same period, most recently on Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, will also be in North Carolina on Saturday for a concert and rally in Charlotte. Her campaign has not announced any other travel to the state before Election Day. The extensive damage from Hurricane Helene across western North Carolina has created a dose of uncertainty about the state of play here. Flooding destroyed homes and displaced residents in several counties, including the liberal city of Asheville and the conservative rural areas surrounding it. Trump's team has said it is confident about his chances in North Carolina. Democrats see Trump's attention on the state as a signal of optimism for Harris. 'The repeat appearances may signal Trump’s campaign is in trouble,' said Democratic state Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham. 'If Trump continues with his dangerous, violent rhetoric these last few days, it may backfire. A campaign of personal retribution does not win votes from people.' Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump's late-campaign travels are not a signal of alarm. 'I'm not worried about anything,' Miller told reporters Friday. 'We have a smart strategy that's going to get President Trump across 270, maybe even a couple of states that surprise you, that slide in there. But we’re going to follow our strategy. Our strategy comes from our data and our targeting.' As he does at most of his events in North Carolina, Trump said in Gastonia that his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he installed as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, is from the state, and that Lara and Eric Trump named their daughter Carolina. 'It’s an amazing place. You’ve been through a lot,' Trump said, alluding to the hurricane before repeating a debunked claim that the Federal Emergency Management Agency prioritized people living in the country illegally over hurricane victims. 'Your government has not helped you too much, I can tell you. Your government, FEMA, has let you down because they wanted to spend the money on illegal migrants instead.' Roughly half of North Carolina's 7.8 million registered voters had already voted as of Friday, buoyed by early in-person voting, which ends on Saturday afternoon. North Carolina Republicans have been encouraged by early voter turnout among their supporters after national and state GOP leaders switched this year to a 'bank your vote' strategy, rather than focusing on Election Day turnout. Entering the final days of the campaign, over 50,000 more GOP registered voters than Democrats had voted early or by absentee ballot, even though there are over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans statewide, according to state elections data. It is unclear whether the Republicans' early vote surge will result in a higher overall turnout for Trump supporters. Independent voters now make up the largest group of registered voters in North Carolina. Trump lost ground with independents between 2016 and 2020. Harris supporter Gwen Garnett, 66, said Trump barnstorming North Carolina is 'just part of the process. It does not worry me at all.' She gave Harris’ candidacy a spiritual dimension. 'This is an anointed time for her to be in this role,' Garnett said. 'I just believe it’s God’s timing.' The state’s voters have shown a propensity to split their ticket over the years. That's why while Republicans have controlled the state legislature since 2011, Democrats have held the governor’s mansion for all but four years since 1993. The GOP's hopes to break that hold on Tuesday appeared to dwindle in recent weeks after the party’s nominee for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, received unwanted publicity from a CNN report that alleged he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago. While Robinson denied writing the messages and sued CNN for defamation last month, his campaign nearly imploded, raising fears that a large victory by Democrat Josh Stein, the state's attorney general, could harm GOP candidates in other races. ___ Robertson reported from Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Delphi murders: Jurors react to video of Richard Allen in custody	DELPHI, Ind. – Video of Richard Allen during his time at Westville Correctional Facility left some jurors 'aghast' and one defense attorney 'staring in horror.' Allen is charged with four counts of murder in the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge. Police arrested him in October 2022. On Day 13, the first portion of testimony focused on Allen’s mental health. He was kept in solitary confinement, which a defense witness testified could wear on a person, especially one with mental health issues. Further testimony from Friday included a witness who saw an 'out of place' car on the day of the murders and a photographer who didn’t recall seeing or hearing anything out of the ordinary on the trails. The defense also spoke to Delphi’s former fire chief about the search, grilled former Delphi police chief Steve Mullin about key testimony from witness Brad Weber and called former Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby to the stand. Videos at the center of Day 14 On Day 14, jurors watched a series of camcorder videos showing Allen in custody at Westville Correctional Facility. The videos were not played for the courtroom at large, meaning neither reporters nor media pool notes can shed any light on their actual content. The videos were at the center of objections and sidebars during Friday’s proceedings, with the state objecting to their admission. Special Judge Fran Gull allowed the defense to show them without audio. Allen’s defense team couldn’t play them Friday, however, because it didn’t know the exact dates of each clip. Gull said Allen’s lawyers couldn’t show the videos unless they could find out the exact dates. The defense shelved the videos for Friday and vowed to do additional research. By Saturday, it appeared the defense had figured things out, and Gull allowed the jury to watch the clips without audio. The prosecution objected to the showing of the 'rather explicit scenes,' but Gull replied, 'Obviously, the jury has to see this.' The monitor displaying the videos was turned away from the gallery so that only the jury could see it. The prosecution had to move in order to watch. Allen did not view the clips. The defense said the videos were being played only for the jury 'out of respect' for Allen. Some of the videos showed the defendant fully nude. They spanned from April 2023 through June 2023. Clips ranged between about two minutes to more than 50 minutes. Jurors react to videos Since court observers were unable to watch the videos, media pool notes relied on reactions from the jury, defense lawyers and prosecutor. As the first video played, one juror was 'aghast.' Jurors appeared 'tense' but not appalled at the second video. During the third video, one juror was seen biting her lower lip. Defense attorney Jennifer Auger shook her head and looked away from the screen. During video four, Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland stood by the jury box to watch. One of the jurors sighed while the video was ending. The jury took numerous notes during the fifth video, the pool report noted. There was no audio from any of the videos, meaning the courtroom was relatively silent for this portion of the proceedings. The sixth video was just under three minutes. The seventh video spanned 26 minutes, but defense attorney Bradley Rozzi sped it up. During the eighth video, the pool reporter indicated one juror had a 'look of disgust' while Auger looked 'horrified.' During the ninth video, Allen’s mother left the courtroom. It should be noted that his wife, Kathy Allen, wasn’t present for any of this. The tenth video was about an hour long. This one had an impact on McLeland, according to the pool notes, who appeared 'taken aback' and was 'cringing' at what he was seeing. Auger stood behind him, arms crossed and mouth open 'staring in horror.' After the jurors watched the videos, the court took a break. Five more videos were shown in court after the break, with the flow interrupted by brief testimony from Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter. The next five videos spanned from May 13, 2023, to June 20, 2023. Most were relatively short, with limited reactions available in the media pool notes. The 15th and final video spanned 34 minutes. One juror's eyes 'widened rapidly in surprise' at something that stunned her. The videos were finished by about 11:50 a.m. Court adjourned shortly after that, with the jury given time to visit with family and enjoy activities on Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Court will resume at 9 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 4. Carter's testimony Between video sessions, ISP Superintendent Doug Carter took the stand. Carter has been notably outspoken about the Delphi murders case and often appeared at press conferences to give updates on the investigation and the search for 'Bridge Guy.' Carter told the court that 'dozens' of agencies were involved in the investigation, including federal resources like the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals Service and ATF. He said the FBI was involved until 2021. This led to a sidebar involving Judge Gull and counsel. Carter later testified that he made the decision for the FBI to leave the case and turn over all materials in August 2021. He was on the stand for less than 10 minutes. Reaction from Libby German's family The media pool notes indicated that Becky Patty, Libby German's grandmother, was upset while talking to McLeland before Saturday's proceedings began. Pool notes speculated that Patty may have been angry that videos of Allen were withheld from the public while graphic crime scene and autopsy photos of Libby and her friend Abby Williams were displayed in court earlier in the proceedings. At one point after Saturday's break, Patty left the courtroom and appeared 'very upset.' She was later seen whispering to her husband.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/delphi-murders-jurors-react-to-video-of-richard-allen-in-custody/	2024-11-02T10:22:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Richard-Allen-close.jpg?w=900
Swing state spotlight: A look at the 7 battleground states	(NewsNation) — With just days to go, the 2024 election is wide open and voters in seven battleground states will ultimately decide the next president. Polls show a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. NewsNation and Nexstar affiliates across the country have been following the campaigns, highlighting the most important voter trends in the 'Swing State Spotlight' series. The current odds in every battleground state Here's what to know about the race in the seven swing states: Arizona, Georgian, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Here’s which counties will decide the 2024 election Arizona Arizona went blue in 2020 for the first time since Bill Clinton in 1996. Once considered a Republican stronghold, Arizona moderates have drifted away from the GOP and the Phoenix suburbs have swung left. With that said, more registered voters identify as Republicans (36%) than Democrats (29%) in Arizona, which means the 35% of people who identify as something else could ultimately decide the election. 'At this point, I think Arizona is going to be solidly purple. I think we are going to go back and forth,' Sarama Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona, told NewsNation in a recent interview. How Arizona’s purple-shaded electorate factors into 2024 election All eyes will be on Maricopa County on Election Night. It's one of the largest voting jurisdictions in the nation and accounts for over 60% of Arizona's registered voters. Georgia As recently as 2016, Georiga was not considered a key battleground state. That changed in 2020. After defeating Clinton by more than five points, Trump lost to Joe Biden by less than half a point in the Peach State. Democrats were able to turn Georgia blue thanks to a rapidly growing and increasingly diverse population in the suburbs around metro Atlanta. Swing State Spotlight: Trump, Georgia Gov. Kemp join forces for Helene Trump has recently tried to improve his relationship with the state's popular Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Earlier this month, Trump praised Kemp's response to Hurricane Helene and said the governor was 'doing a fantastic job.' Georgia will also provide insight into which way Black voters are leaning. Harris is expected to carry that group but recent polling suggests the margin could be closer than in recent elections. Michigan Part of the so-called 'blue wall,' Democrats won Michigan in every election from 1992 to 2012. Trump broke that streak in 2016 after Clinton failed to fully mobilize her party's base. Biden flipped the state blue back in 2020 thanks to improved turnout in heavily Democratic cities like Detroit and Ann Arbor — voters that will be key if Harris is to repeat in Michigan. The state's 200,000 Muslim registered voters could also play a key role in deciding the outcome. Over the past year, Muslims’ support for the Democratic Party has dropped, in part, due to the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war In Michigan's Democratic primary, more than 100,000 people voted 'uncommitted' — a potential warning sign for Democrats in November. Nevada Republicans haven't won Nevada since George W. Bush in 2004 but it has become closer in recent elections, particularly in Clark County, the main population center. Barack Obama carried the state by more than six points in 2012. Four years later, Hillary Clinton won by just over two points. Biden maintained that margin in 2020 but Trump shrank the gap in Clark County (metro Las Vegas), home to nearly three-quarters of the population. Are Nevada voters swayed by promises of ‘no tax on tips’? Both candidates have tried to appeal to the state's leisure and hospitality workers, promising to eliminate taxes on tips. According to recent polling, 71% of Nevada voters support that idea. Hispanic voters will also play a major role. They make up a third of the population in Clark County and polling suggests Trump has been gaining ground, particularly with Hispanic men. North Carolina North Carolina is the only swing state that Trump won in 2020 and polling shows him favored this time around. In fact, Democrats have only won the Tar Heel State once since 1980 — Obama in 2008. But population gains in blue areas like Mecklenburg and Wake Counties have changed the math in the state, giving Democrats their best chance in years. North Carolina election officials grapple with storm’s impact To put the shift in perspective: Obama won Mecklenburg County by roughly 100,000 votes in 2012. Eight years later, Biden won that same county by about 200,000 votes. The state is also reeling from Hurricane Helene, which hit western North Carolina especially hard. It remains to be seen what impact, if any, that will have on Election day. Pennsylvania The outcome in Pennsylvania tends to predict the eventual winner. In 10 of the last 12 elections, the winner of Pennsylvania has gone on to the presidency. Why fracking in Pennsylvania is a major campaign issue Part of that is because the state is a microcosm of the country as a whole — home to two major cities, dozens of rural counties and education levels that generally mirror the American electorate. Fracking — the process of extracting oil and natural gas from underground rock formations — has become a popular debate topic in the Keystone State as voters weigh the economic trade-offs versus the environmental concerns. Pennsylvania is the second-largest natural gas producer behind Texas. The state has become a central location for discussions about the nation's energy future. Wisconsin Wisconsin is another blue wall state that Trump was able to flip in 2016. Before that, no Republican had won there since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Wisconsin voters with higher education tend to vote Democrat: Poll director Biden flipped it back in 2020 and was able to improve on Clinton's performance in the red-leaning Milwaukee suburbs, known as the WOW counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington). Harris will try to run up the score in urban areas like Dane and Milwaukee counties, while Trump will try to do better with suburban moderates and maintain his advantage in rural parts of the state.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/swing-state-spotlight/	2024-11-02T09:57:28-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.08_c978ec.png?w=900
Julia Roberts ad sparks debate about gender gap, voting in marria...	(The Hill) — A pro-Harris campaign ad encouraging women to break with their Trump-supporting partners at the ballot box is striking a nerve amid signs of a growing national gender gap in the high-stakes presidential race. Vote Common Good, which encourages evangelical and Catholic voters to break from the GOP, aired an ad voiced by actress Julia Roberts reminding women 'you can vote any way you want and no one will ever know' — prompting pushback from several prominent conservatives who criticized it for calling on wives to lie to their husbands. Polls show a significant gap, with Vice President Harris winning over a large majority of female voters and former President Trump building up a huge advantage with male voters. This difference would get attention in any presidential cycle, but it feels all the more important in the first presidential contest to take place since the fall of Roe v. Wade. 'It's definitely significant and has the potential of being historic,' explained Jackie Payne, the founder and executive director of the nonpartisan, moderate women-focused group Galvanize Action. 'When I'm looking at the data, what I see is, if only men voted, Trump would win,' said Payne, adding that 'women are making this a competitive election.' In the 30-second ad featuring Roberts, a couple are at a polling place when a man prompts his female partner, presumably after voting, 'your turn honey.' The woman, wearing a hat with a bedazzled American flag on it, is seen walking to her voting booth where she weighs choosing between Harris and Trump. She looks up at another woman voting in front of her and the two exchange a knowing glance, before marking her ballot for Harris. In the background, Roberts invokes the issue of abortion rights in her voice-over. 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want, and no one will ever know.' Toward the end of the ad, her husband asks if she 'made the right choice,' to which she smiles and says 'sure did, honey.' Fox News host Jesse Watters mentioned his own spouse in discussing the ad, comparing a woman who doesn’t tell her husband who she is voting for to someone having an affair. 'If I found out Emma was going to the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that’s the same thing as having an affair,' Watters said on air Wednesday in response to the ad. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk called it 'gross' to suggest women would 'undermine their husbands.' The ad isn’t the only effort this cycle to remind voters that their ballots are private, or to suggest that women and men are casting different ballots this fall. NBC News reported pro-Harris sticky notes have been found in women’s bathroom stalls and on the backs of tampon boxes. And women are taking to a TikTok trend in which Harris-Walz voters share that they’ll 'cancel out' a pro-Trump husband or family member’s ballot. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who’s doing work for independent expenditure groups in the presidential election, suggested the Harris ad with Julia Roberts could be effective, even if it doesn’t completely capture the dynamic she’s found in some relationships when it comes to voting. 'When we're trying to interview them or if you’re canvassing these married women, they'll say, ‘Well, you should really be talking to my husband. He knows more about this, or he follows politics,’ or ‘I just get his opinion on politics,’' Lake explained. 'These women presume that he has greater expertise, and he presumes that he has greater expertise. And so the first part of moving these women is to say you have your own way of doing things. You have your own opinion,' she added. Polling the extent to which couples may vote differently from each other is challenging to accurately measure given votes are privately cast and respondents may not always offer that information to pollsters. Still, it raises questions over how men and women will cast their votes this cycle — and how big a split it could be. The gender gap was at 11 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, with 42 percent of women and 52 percent of men backing Trump, according to Edison Research compiled by the Center for American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. In 2020, the gap was 12 points, with 57 percent of women and 45 percent of men backing President Biden. In 2024, there are signs of a growing divide. An October USA Today/Suffolk University national poll found women decidedly behind Harris, 53 percent to 36 percent. Men were behind Trump 53 percent to 36 percent. If similar splits show up on Nov. 5, it could make for a historic gender gap. Payne of Galvanize Action explained that moderate white women were driving the gender gap. At the same time, Zachary Donnini, a data scientist at Decision Desk HQ, noted gaps were emerging among Black and Latino voters, too. Polls have also suggested a deepening split among young voters in particular. Motivated by threats to reproductive rights and turned off by GOP rhetoric, young women are tending more liberal, experts said — while young men are pulled in by Trump’s messaging around masculinity. Women, who have long outpaced men in voter turnout, are also dominating early voting, according to the latest data compiled by the University of Florida Election Lab, making up 54 percent of the 66 million early votes so far. Only Election Day will reveal how many female voters are actually part of the hesitant demographic depicted in the Vote Common Good ad, said Martha McKenna, a Democratic strategist and veteran of EMILY’s List, a group aimed at getting abortion-rights female candidates elected to office. But McKenna argued many moderate Republican and independent women are 'feeling squeezed' this cycle. Even the Republican 'outrage' at the new ad, she said, could make the case for the ad’s message. 'Republicans fell straight into the trap that the ad laid out for them,' McKenna said, pointing to the responses from right-wing talkers. 'They have so far overreacted to this discussion in the final days of the campaign that they've really exposed themselves ... It is, like, embarrassing almost — how upset these guys were at the thought that the women in their lives would not vote the way that they wanted them to, for Trump.' Still, there are nuances within measuring the gap between how women and men vote for the winning presidential candidate. Kelly Dittmar, director of research and scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics, noted it’s possible there could be a record in the gender gap this presidential cycle while noting women have been more likely to vote for the Democratic presidential candidate since 1980. 'Anybody is going to be able to argue that women are the key to this election. But I think the more interesting story and the trends to watch are going to be, which women, how do they trend,' she explained. 'What is the diversity among women voters?' Kim Wyman, a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and the former Republican secretary of state in Washington, said the dynamics in the Vote Common Good ad aren’t limited to the gender divide. 'I really do believe that this election, based on what we saw in 2016 and what we saw in 2020, saying to people how you voted, and it doesn't matter which side you say you voted, can get a very emotional response from friends and family and people you've known your whole life,' Wyman said. 'And I think that for many Americans, they just kind of want to avoid it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/julia-roberts-ad-sparks-debate-about-gender-gap-voting-in-marriages/	2024-11-02T09:35:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Women_110124_AP_Ross-Franklin-e1730500777639.png?w=800

Latino voters ready to emerge from 'garbage' fight	The Hispanic electorate has found its place at the center of national political discourse in an election marred by nativist rhetoric and punctuated by a 'garbage' war. In the final week of the election, the media tuned its radar on Puerto Ricans in swing states — particularly Pennsylvania and North Carolina — not because the campaigns elevated their concerns, but because of an ill-conceived joke that bashed the U.S. territory. Crude origins aside, the Puerto Rican electorate’s moment in the spotlight presents an opportunity for the Latino vote writ large. 'This helps us to battle the misinformation, and this helps us to sustain our message that, you know, communities that have large numbers of participation in elections are communities that have better resources, that [have] better schools, better hospitals, better parks,' said Frankie Miranda, president of the Hispanic Federation. Miranda said that despite the growth in Latino voter participation, 'still the headline is ‘Latinos are not participating enough,’ or it is Latinos — the one that, ‘because they are not participating enough that we lost a certain state’ like, for example, what happened with Florida in the past.' Whether Democrats’ past Florida recriminations — and the ensuing headlines — get replicated in 2024 will depend largely on election results in Pennsylvania. The state’s Latino Corridor stretches from the Maryland border along Highway 222 to Allentown, a majority-Hispanic city of 125,000 on the fringes of New York City’s commuter footprint. Before former President Trump’s Oct. 27 Madison Square Garden rally, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke about 'a floating island of garbage' got a mixed reception, the campaigns had already deployed significant resources to the corridor, and will continue to do so until the bitter end. Trump and Harris will hold dueling rallies in the Latino Corridor Monday afternoon: Harris will be in Allentown and Trump in Reading. But the unforced error of booking a shock comic for the New York rally is expected to energize low-propensity voters who the campaigns could not reach through conventional means. 'I mean Puerto Ricans, it's their moment. If they don't vote, come and show up and vote, you know what? … Puerto Ricans should be the new Cubans. It’s a swing state. They're the biggest bloc of Latinos in that state. They can all vote. Yeah, is your moment, guys. Don't f--- this up,' said Mike Madrid, a political consultant and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. The Trump campaign initially struggled to contain damage from Hinchcliffe’s joke, but on Tuesday, President Biden muddied the water with his own 'garbage' comments on a call hosted by Voto Latino. On the call, Biden appeared to refer to Trump supporters as 'garbage,' though the White House clarified the president was referring to Hitchcliffe, an account the Trump campaign did not buy. From that point, Trump took on the role of the aggrieved party, appearing in a Trump-branded garbage truck and reflective work vest. 'The problem with what Biden did is he f---ing stepped on the story. It could have gotten bigger and longer and been a stronger narrative. That's all. That's what happened. He f---ing stepped on her momentum,' said Madrid. By Friday, the story had lost steam on cable news, with outlets including CNN and MSNBC focused on Trump’s latest attack against former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Fox News dedicating some airtime to the White House’s cleanup of Biden’s comments. But anecdotal evidence suggests Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania are still energized against Hinchcliffe’s joke. 'There's nothing, nothing that you can do to a Puerto Rican that is going to move them in one way or another, [apart from] attacking Puerto Rico. You can be here for four generations, or you can just arrive yesterday: It’s the punch in the gut, your heart starts speeding every time you talk about our ancestral island, ancestral home,' said Miranda. With the back-and-forth so close to the election, polls are unlikely to shift significantly before Pennsylvania counts its official ballots. But the bet is that the 'garbage' war was a net negative for Trump. 'I think it absolutely hurts Trump more, because two of the groups that they need to anchor in the most important state — in Pennsylvania — are going to be motivated by that. Puerto Ricans are pissed. Like, quantifiably, that alone could cost them Pennsylvania,' said Madrid. '[This] freak show reminded a bunch of college-educated Republicans why they don't like the Republican Party in the first place, or why they're uneasy with it, why they don't like the GOP in the Trump era. It's a reminder that these guys — they're crass, there's a vulgarity they've never liked about Trump. They voted for Trump despite him, because they don't like the Democrats and they like Republican policies.' Still, the incident reflects a larger trend where parties prioritize the Latino vote, but don’t necessarily shift their broader pitch in doing so. For Republicans who seek to peel off only a fragment of the Latino vote, that approach can yield positive results. The Trump campaign, for instance, has been effective at identifying cultural divisions within Latino communities and targeting voters more likely to be responsive to their proposals, according to Ana Valdez, president of the Latino Donor Collaborative (LDC). 'Somebody [in the Trump campaign] understands how we tick, what makes us tick,' she said. LDC, a think tank founded by business leaders, last week released a report quantifying the political and economic size of the Latino electorate, seeking to drive home the idea that Hispanics can and will flip elections. 'What we expect from this report, we expect from this report is to bring some education, if you may, to bring some light into the real numbers of who Latinos are, into the impact that they are doing, and the potential of the impact if they are engaged again. You know, the Latino vote is for the parties to lose, not the other way around. And these are the numbers that show it,' said Valdez.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/latino-voters-ready-to-emerge-from-garbage-fight/	2024-11-02T09:11:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Joe-Biden-Donald-Trump-08.21.png?w=900
Trump, Harris camps prepare to 'go to the mattresses' in election...	Hours after Steve Bannon was released from prison Tuesday upon serving a four-month stint for evading a congressional subpoena, the onetime adviser to former President Trump sounded the alarm about the upcoming election. 'The Democrats are not going to give up,' he told reporters. 'They just hired Marc Elias. And you only hire Marc Elias — who I think is the toughest election lawyer in the country — you only hire Marc Elias when you want to go to the mattresses.' Elias, a leader of Vice President Harris’s election litigation efforts, hit back: 'My team of lawyers is better than the GOP's. And we're ready to beat them again in 2024.' The exchange came just days until the nation decides who will next occupy the White House — and the expectation that a dramatic legal standoff awaits, which both the Trump and Harris campaigns are preparing for. Already, there are more than 200 voting and election cases pending across the nation, according to Elias’s tally, with many in key battleground states that could alter the trajectory of the election's outcome. For weeks, lawyers for the Republican and Democratic parties have gone toe-to-toe in courtrooms on challenges to voter rolls, mail ballots and other election procedures. Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the former president's daughter-in-law, says the GOP’s election litigation operation is functioning 'as planned and as intended.' 'There were so many people in the wake of 2020 with a lot of questions,' she said on a press call Wednesday. 'And we hope that in 2024, we are going to ease any fears and any concerns that any American — regardless of if they're voting Republican, Democrat or third-party candidate — may have out there.' But Democrats have said the playbook is not so cut and dry. 'All of this is ‘cheating’ only in the mind of someone who wants to claim he was cheated, and it's yet another example of how Donald Trump tries to sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he's afraid he can't win,' a senior Harris-Walz campaign official said Thursday. 'He wants to lay the groundwork now to claim the election was stolen.' The Harris campaign has assembled a large legal team as they brace for a repeat of 2020, when former President Trump baselessly claimed mass election fraud in his narrow loss to President Biden. Beyond Elias, who runs an eponymous election law firm, Harris’s team includes former solicitors general Seth Waxman and Don Verrilli, as well as Biden’s personal counsel, Bob Bauer. The team has already drafted thousands of pages of legal briefs that respond to dozens of scenarios, according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Hill. 'The 2024 presidential election is already the most litigated in American history, but we are also the most prepared campaign in history for what we face,' Dana Remus, senior adviser and outside counsel to Harris’ campaign, and Democratic National Committee acting co-Executive Director Monica Guardiola wrote in the memo. 'We brought together the country’s best lawyers for each type of challenge we will face and expanded our footprint with national law firms and hundreds of lawyers on the ground across key states, monitoring closely and taking legal action wherever necessary,' it continued. Though the latest voter fraud claims overlap with the accusations made four years ago, some key attorneys on Trump’s 'elite strike force team' in 2020 aren’t expected to be involved this cycle. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who helped lead the 2020 push, has been disbarred and this week was forced to turn over most of his assets to two election workers he defamed. Two others involved, Jeff Clark and John Eastman, have also faced disciplinary proceedings. And attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis have pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from their post-2020 election work. Some are still fighting in the court of public opinion, however. Last week, Giuliani appeared at Trump’s rally in Madison Square Garden, and he hosts two daily shows where he talks extensively about the election. 'There’s a chance he can have a big win. There’s also a chance everything could go wrong, only because they did last time. And I’m sorry, you can torture me all you want, he was elected in 2020,' Giuliani said Thursday on his 'America’s Mayor Live' show. Trump himself has started planting seeds of election misconduct, claiming on his Truth Social social platform that his campaign caught Democrats 'CHEATING BIG' in Pennsylvania, a critical state for both campaigns to win. Authorities in several Pennsylvania counties have announced investigations into potential fraudulent voter registration applications caught during processing. But there is no indication that any fraudulent ballots have been counted. 'Must announce and PROSECUTE, NOW! This is a CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF THE LAW,' Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. 'STOP VOTER FRAUD! CHECK OUT KAMALA’S NEW SLEAZEBAG LAWYER. WE ARE ON THEM ALL THIS TIME! Who would have ever thought that our Country is so CORRUPT?' Much of Republicans’ legal efforts are being led by the RNC’s election integrity unit and outside law firms like Jones Day and Dhillon Law Group. Attorneys with prominent roles include Gineen Bresso, who previously chaired the U.S. Election Assistance Commission; Christina Bobb, a former One America News host who faces criminal charges in Arizona related to the 2020 election; and Bill McGinley, an attorney who served in the Trump administration. RNC co-Chair Michael Whatley told reporters Wednesday the party has also recruited over 230,000 volunteers who will be deployed as poll observers throughout the country. 'We have built the most expansive and experienced election integrity team in history,' Whatley said. The senior Harris-Walz campaign official asserted that Republicans are using the courts to 'try and sow their narratives,' but it could backfire. 'It is actually helpful when they do so in court, because they don't have evidence,' the official said. 'In a number of cases where they've been doing this, we're expediting those cases and winning, and that is an effective — to say the least — way of countering their misinformation.' It’s not just the campaigns and party committees getting involved, however. Many outside groups have formed or grown over the past few years in anticipation of a bombardment of litigation. 'We are working hard to make sure that it does NOT happen again this time,' Cleta Mitchell, a central figure in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 results who leads the Election Integrity Network, wrote on X this past week. 'We haven’t fixed everything in elections that the leftists spent billions of dollars breaking. But at least we know what to watch for in 2024. And we will be watching,' she wrote.

Politicians are reaching out to gamers ahead of the election – bu...	(NEXSTAR) — As the 2024 presidential election draws closer, both parties are pushing to secure as many votes as they can. One avenue the Harris-Walz campaign has been exploring is reaching out to gamers – a demographic that, according to a 2023 survey by the Entertainment Software Association, is largely made up of Gen Z and Millennials. This past weekend, vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went live on the official Kamala Harris Twitch channel to play some games and talk about the upcoming election. Twitch is a livestreaming website that specializes in video games, and averages around 2.3 million daily viewers. The two played Madden NFL '25 together, Ocasio-Cortez showed off her farm in the cozy indie farming simulator Stardew Valley, and Walz surprised viewers by showing off his driving skills in the 2000s Sega Dreamcast hit Crazy Taxi. See where abortion will be on the ballot in the 2024 election The campaign previously attempted another crossover event on Twitch in early October when they teamed up with World of Warcraft streamer Preheat, who showcased his gameplay on the page while a Harris rally played on the side of the screen. This event was largely panned by gamers on social media. Popular World of Warcraft streamer Maximum called it 'an insane thing to see' in a post on his X page. New England Institute of Technology eSports coordinator Brandon Eigenbrode thinks politicians may need to rethink their approach to leveraging Twitch. 'Stuff like that, where you just have a rally and a random game playing that’s completely unrelated, I think that’s the wrong way to do it,' Eigenbrode said. Both Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump also broadcast their rallies on Twitch, which Eigenbrode thinks may be missing the point of the platform. 'What’s the point of putting it on Twitch if it’s the same thing that’s on TV? That kind of defeats the purpose,' Eigenbrode said. This isn’t the first election cycle where campaigns are trying to leverage Twitch, either. In 2020, Ocasio-Cortez went live on her Twitch channel to play the breakout hit game Among Us, a multiplayer game of deception, with Rep. Ilhan Omar and a group of popular Twitch creators including Pokimane, Dr. Lupo and Hasanabi. According to eSports commentator Rod Breslau, the stream peaked at 439,000 concurrent viewers, at the time the third-highest concurrent viewer count in the platform’s history, with approximately 5.2 million total viewers over the course of the stream. Highlights of the stream were uploaded by various gaming websites and content creators on YouTube, racking up millions more in VOD views. Walz and Ocasio-Cortez’s Madden stream fell short of this success, however, peaking at just over 4,000 concurrent viewers, according to Twitchtracker.com. It’s difficult to quantify the effect these livestream events have on campaigns, but Eigenbrode suggests that if politicians want to successfully leverage Twitch as a platform, they need to focus on what makes it unique – the games. 'To people who do play games, you can kind of realize what [these politicans] are doing, and I think that might have been why AOC playing Among Us was so successful,' Eigenbrode said. 'She was just playing a game with other gamers.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/politicians-are-reaching-out-to-gamers-ahead-of-the-election-but-is-it-working/	2024-11-02T08:55:13-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1232609073.jpg?w=900
Ukraine's Zelenskyy urges allies to act before North Korean troop...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged its allies to stop 'watching' and take steps before North Koreans troops deployed in Russia reach the battlefield. Zelenskyy raised the prospect of a preemptive Ukrainian strike on camps where the North Korean troops are being trained, and said Kyiv knows their location. But he said Ukraine can’t do it without permission from allies to use Western-made long-range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. 'But instead … America is watching, Britain is watching, Germany is watching. Everyone is just waiting for the North Korean military to start attacking Ukrainians as well,' Zelenskyy said in a post late Friday on the Telegram messaging app. The Biden administration said Thursday that some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia’s Kursk region near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. On Saturday, Ukraine's military intelligence said that more than 7,000 North Koreans equipped with Russian gear and weapons had been transported to areas near Ukraine. The agency, known by its acronym GUR, said that North Korean troops were being trained at five locations in Russia's Far East. It did not specify its source of information. Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region, and open the door to technology transfers from Moscow to Pyongyang that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met with her Russian counterpart in Moscow in Friday. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to use Western weapons to strike arms depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. Moscow has also consistently signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. President Vladimir Putin warned on Sept. 12 that Russia would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them. Dozens injured in Russian strikes on Ukraine Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv overnight into Saturday, killing a policeman and injuring dozens, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. According to Syniehubov and Ukraine’s national police force, one missile slammed into a spot where a large group of police were gathered, killing a 40-year-old serviceman and injuring 36 more. In Ukraine’s southern Kherson province, Russian shelling on Saturday killed a 40-year-old woman and wounded three others, including two children, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Kyiv, air raid sirens wailed for over five hours early Saturday morning as Russian drones rained on the capital, sparking a fire in an office block downtown and injuring two people, according to the city’s military administration. Overall, Russian forces overnight attacked Ukraine with over 70 Iranian-made Shahed drones, the Ukrainian air force reported Saturday. It said most were shot down or sent off-course using GPS jamming. Falling debris damaged power networks and residential buildings in multiple provinces and injured an elderly woman near Kyiv, officials said. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry hinted that Russia’s drone campaign was slowing down, saying Moscow launched just over half as many in October as the month before. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-ukraines-zelenskyy-urges-allies-to-take-steps-before-north-korean-troops-reach-the-front/	2024-11-02T08:23:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672644bda88b58.95291194.jpeg?w=900
Supreme Court allows Pennsylvania to count contested provisional ...	DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans that could have led to thousands of provisional ballots not being counted in Pennsylvania as the presidential campaigns vie in the final days before the election in the nation’s biggest battleground state. The justices left in place a state Supreme Court ruling that elections officials must count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected. The ruling is a victory for voting-rights advocates, who had sought to force counties — primarily Republican-controlled counties — to let voters cast a provisional ballot on Election Day if their mail-in ballot was to be rejected for a garden-variety error. While the Supreme Court action was a setback for Republicans, the GOP separately claimed victory in a decision by Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court. That court rejected a last-ditch effort by voting rights advocates to ensure that mail-in ballots that lack an accurate, handwritten date on the exterior envelope will still count in this year’s presidential election. The rulings are the latest in four years of litigation over voting by mail in Pennsylvania, where every vote truly counts in presidential races. Republicans have sought in dozens of court cases to push the strictest possible interpretation for throwing out mail-in ballots, which are predominantly cast by Democrats. Taken together, Friday's near-simultaneous rulings will ensure a heavy emphasis on helping thousands of people vote provisionally on Election Day if their mail-in ballot was rejected — and potentially more litigation. As of Thursday, about 9,000 ballots out of more than 1.6 million returned have arrived at elections offices around Pennsylvania lacking a secrecy envelope, a signature or a handwritten date, according to state records. Pennsylvania is the biggest presidential election battleground this year, with 19 electoral votes, and is expected to play an outsized role in deciding the election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. It was decided by tens of thousands of votes in 2016 when Trump won it and again in 2020 when Democrat Joe Biden won it. A voting-rights lawyer in Pennsylvania who helped bring both cases said it is almost certain that another case over undated ballots will be back before the state Supreme Court within days after the presidential election if it is close. 'It’s almost certain that this is going to be raised again after the election, especially if it’s a close election,' Witold Walczak, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, said in an interview. In its unsigned, two-page order, the state’s highest court put a lower court ruling on hold that would have required counties to count the ballots. The high court said the case won’t apply to the presidential election being decided next week, but held out the possibility that it would still rule on the case at a later time. The rulings came as voters had their last chance Friday to apply for a mail-in ballot in a bellwether suburban Philadelphia county while a county clear across the state gave voters who didn't receive their ballot in the mail another chance to get one. A judge in Erie County, in Pennsylvania's northwestern corner, ruled Friday in a lawsuit brought by the Democratic Party that about 15,000 people who applied for a mail ballot but didn't receive it may go to the county elections office and get a replacement through Monday. The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot has passed in Pennsylvania. But the judge's ruling means that Erie County's elections office will be open every day through Monday for voters to go in, cancel the mail-in ballot they didn't receive in the mail, and get another one over the counter. In suburban Philadelphia's Bucks County, a court set a deadline of 5 p.m. for voters there to apply for and receive a mail-in ballot after a judge had ordered a three-day extension in response to a Trump campaign lawsuit that accused the county of breaking the law by turning voters from election offices that had struggled to keep up with demand. Lines outside the county's elections office in Doylestown were long throughout the day — snaking down the sidewalk — with the process taking about two hours by Friday afternoon. Nakesha McGuirk, 44, a Democrat from Bensalem, sized up the line and said: 'I did not expect the line to be this long. But I’m going to stick it out.' McGuirk, a Harris supporter, faces a long work commute next week and worried about her ability to make it to the polls on Election Day. 'I figured that rather than run into the risk of not getting home in time to go and vote, that it would be better to just do it this way early,' she said. Republican voter Patrick Lonieski, a Trump supporter from Buckingham, also found it more convenient with his work schedule to vote Friday in a county he called 'pivotal' to the outcome. 'I just want to make sure I get my ballot in and it’s counted,' said Lonieski, 62, who was joined by his 18-year-old son, voting for the first time. The line steadily dwindled as 5 p.m. approached. One last straggler broke into a run to make it by the deadline as elections workers cheerfully counted down the seconds. 'Let’s go! Hurry up! You can do it!' a bystander yelled. People broke into applause as she walked through the door — just in time. ___ Associated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.

Residents along southern border share concerns over crossings	(NewsNation) — Communities near the U.S.-Mexico border are caught in the middle of one of the biggest issues in the 2024 election: immigration. At the Del Rio, Texas, sector of the southern border, families say they are concerned about the number of migrants crossing the border. Those living there say they see people running through yards and hiding through docks, all with the aim of evading law enforcement. How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election One neighborhood in Eagle Pass has become a staging ground for law enforcement, as it is situated just below the Rio Grande. Migrants are crossing the hundreds daily there. Neighbors recognize the problem but say in interviews that they don't feel safe talking about it because they fear retaliation. One told NewsNation off-camera that he looked over his fence one day, and five men were actually leaning up against it, just waiting for law enforcement to leave. Another woman was followed into her home by migrants. Her husband said she locked herself inside of her car in the garage until police arrived. Gilberto Rodriguez has been living in a Texas border neighborhood since 1969. While he was initially hesitant to talk, Rodriguez said that, for the first time since coming there, he did not feel safe living in the area. Right in the background of the neighborhood is a part of the border wall. While some individuals say it's a bit of an eyesore, they also want to see extra reinforcements and law enforcement to deal with border issues. The Biden administration initially halted progress on the wall on his first day in office: Pausing work on it was one of 17 executive orders issued on his first day in office. However, he later decided to greenlight construction on it in Starr County, Texas, and an open area of southern Arizona near Yuma. The current odds in every key Senate race: Decision Desk HQ President Joe Biden explained that he did so because funds were already appropriated to build the wall in 2019 before he took office. Biden said he tried to get lawmakers to redirect the money, but Congress refused. 'The money was appropriated for the border wall,' Biden said at the time. 'I can’t stop that.' During the 2024 campaign season, Trump and Harris have both talked about plans to continue creating the wall. Texas is making its own moves to build the border wall. On Tuesday, the state's land commissioner, Dawn Buckingham, announced the Texas General Land Office acquired a 1,402-acre ranch in Starr County, as the property's frontage on the Rio Grande makes it the 'crucial location' for the barrier. 'Within 24 hours, we had the easement for the wall done,' Buckingham said. 'We expect construction to start in four to six weeks.' So far, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has built nearly 50 miles of wall in the Lone Star State. With the latest land acquisition, there'll be another 1 1/2 miles. When it comes to previous presidential administrations, Democratic former President Barack Obama built about 137 miles of border wall, Trump had about 452 miles, and Biden allowed for the construction of about 20 miles.

4 potential paths to victory in the 2024 election	(NewsNation) — It will take 270 electoral votes to win the 2024 presidential election, and both candidates have several paths to get there. Across the seven swing states, former President Donald Trump's best odds are in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, which means the Sun Belt could be key to a Republican victory. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris could get to 270 by winning the so-called 'blue wall' — specifically, the three northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. She's currently favored in Michigan and almost dead even in the other two. NewsNation’s election partner, Decision Desk HQ, shows Trump with a 54% chance of winning and Harris with a 46% chance as of Nov. 1. Here are four possible paths to victory on Election Day. Election odds in every 2024 swing state Trump: The sunbelt path to victory Swing state breakdown: Trump wins: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania Harris wins: Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin Electoral votes: Trump: 281 ✔ Harris: 257 How likely is it? This is Trump's most likely path to victory. The former president is currently favored in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina — three states that have tended to vote Republican since the 1980s. If Trump wins those, he would only have to take one of the blue wall states — either Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin — to get to 270. Current polling suggests his best bet is Pennsylvania, where Decision Desk HQ gives Trump a 53% chance of victory as of Nov. 1. If that happens, Trump could lose Arizona and still win the election. Here's which counties will decide the 2024 election Historically, Republicans have done well in Georgia and North Carolina, particularly among higher-income white voters, but the winning formula could look different this time. 'The coalition that Trump is building in these states is more of a multiracial working-class coalition versus the strongest area for him in these states used to be in affluent exurbs,' said Zachary Donnini, a data scientist at Decision Desk HQ. Harris: The blue wall holds Swing state breakdown: Harris wins: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin Trump wins: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina Electoral votes: Harris: 270 ✔ Trump: 268 How likely is it? For Harris, the clearest path to 270 is winning the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The three were reliably Democratic until Trump turned them red in 2016. Four years later, Joe Biden flipped them back, a sign Trump's win may have been an anomaly rather than the new norm. One reason for Democratic optimism: newcomers to the three northern battleground states. '[Those three states] are shifting to the left relative to the nation as a whole, and a lot of this comes down to migration patterns in the past four years,' Donnini said. A recent New York Times analysis underscores that point. It found that newcomers to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have tended to be more Democratic than their neighbors in recent years. Harris is currently favored in Michigan but is slightly behind in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Nov. 1). Trump: A crack in the blue wall Swing state breakdown: Trump wins: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin Harris wins: Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania Electoral votes: Trump: 272 ✔ Harris: 266 How likely is it? With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the top battleground prize, but if Trump wins in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina — where polls show him ahead — he can afford to lose the Keystone State by winning Wisconsin. In other words, it doesn't matter which northern battleground state he flips so long as he wins across the Sun Belt. 'For Trump, just winning Georgia and North Carolina gives him a lot of different options for how he can win the presidency,' Donnini said. A solid performance in the Milwaukee suburbs, the so-called WOW counties — Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington — could be all Trump needs to win Wisconsin. Those areas have remained more Republican than similar Midwestern suburbs but still moved leftwards in the Trump Era. Harris: The road through the South Electoral votes: Harris: 279 ✔ Trump: 259 Swing States: Harris wins: Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina Trump wins: Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin How likely is it? There's a 19% chance Harris wins Georgia and North Carolina, in which case she could afford to lose one, potentially two, blue wall states. For that to happen, Harris will likely have to perform better with Black voters than she's expected to. Another winning formula: Suburbanites around metro Atlanta and metro Charlotte continue to move left. While it's not the most likely scenario, a Harris win in North Carolina and Georgia would bode well for her chances in other swing states. 'If she's winning her weaker states, she's very likely to win the strong ones,' Donnini said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/paths-victory-2024-election/	2024-11-01T17:02:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-09.26-e1727818452392.png?w=800
Trump seeks to clarify Cheney 'shooting' comment: No 'guts to fig...	Former President Trump on Friday responded to criticism of his comments a day earlier, in which he attacked former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) by using violent imagery to chastise her foreign policy views. Trump sparked backlash after he told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that Cheney, an outspoken critic of the former president, was a 'radical war hawk' and suggested she should be put into a war zone 'with nine barrels shooting at her.' The former president sought to clarify those comments in a Truth Social post. 'All I’m saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a War Hawk, and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn’t have 'the guts' to fight herself,' Trump posted. 'It’s easy for her to talk, sitting far from where the death scenes take place, but put a gun in her hand, and let her go fight, and she’ll say, 'No thanks!'' 'Her father decimated the Middle East, and other places, and got rich by doing so. He’s caused plenty of DEATH, and probably never even gave it a thought,' Trump continued, referring to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has endorsed Vice President Harris in the 2024 election. Trump's critics lambasted him over his rhetoric toward Cheney, who has campaigned alongside Harris ahead of Election Day. 'This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death,' Cheney posted on X. Ian Sams, senior adviser for the Vice President Harris’s campaign, slammed Trump for 'dangerous, violent rhetoric.' 'You have Donald Trump, who’s talking about sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad. And you have Vice President Harris talking about sending one to her Cabinet,' Sams said Friday morning on MSNBC.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-seeks-to-clarify-cheney-shooting-comment-no-guts-to-fight/	2024-11-01T13:21:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Liz-Cheney-v-Trump.png?w=900
Swing states see gender gap in early voting numbers	(NewsNation) — With the election just days away, women are showing up big at the polls, especially in swing states. For instance, in Pennsylvania, 1,427,436 people have already cast their ballots, with data from TargetSmart showing 55.6% of these early voters are women and 43.2% are men. In Wisconsin, where 1,067,383 have voted early, 51.3% have been women, and 42.7% are men. Michigan has seen 2,187,896 early voters: 55.4% female and 44.5% male. This gender gap seems to be driven by a combination of a lot of things, especially key issues like reproductive rights, health care access and education. The current odds in every swing Senate race With this being the case, both candidates are intensifying their efforts to reach female voters. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign put out an ad voiced by actress Julia Roberts telling women they have the right to choose when it comes to their pick for president — even if their husbands disagree. 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,' Roberts says in the ad, NewsNation partner The Hill reports. Both campaigns are hosting rallies, phone banking and going door-to-door. The Harris campaign, in particular, is focusing on suburban areas where female voter turnout could make a really significant difference. Campaign surrogates like Lara Trump, meanwhile, are making stops for the former president's campaign.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/swing-states-gender-gap-early-voting/	2024-11-01T12:04:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Trump-Harris_092524_AP_Uncredited.jpg?w=900
Could Donald Trump, Kamala Harris tie in the Electoral College?	(NewsNation) — The race for the White House between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris remains in the too-close-to-call category, which has created scenarios in the minds of some political junkies about both presidential candidates receiving an identical number of Electoral College votes in next week’s election. The 12th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates win a majority of the votes of the 538 electors appointed to represent the 50 states and the District of Columbia. That puts the number of electoral votes required to win the election at 270. A tie of Electoral College votes has never taken place in modern history. However, some scenarios exist in which Trump and Harris could each finish with 269 Electoral College votes, although such a possibility is remote, according to NewsNation partner Decision Desk HQ. How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election As part of its forecasting models, Decision Desk HQ runs tens of thousands of simulations each day, the organization’s president, Drew McCoy, said. However, the outcome of a tie in the Electoral College happens 'incredibly infrequently,' McCoy told NewsNation. For example, for a tie to occur next week, in three of the simulations run by Decision Desk HQ, Harris would need to win Nevada in two of the scenarios, Arizona in all three of the scenarios, and could never win Michigan and Pennsylvania, McCoy said. NBC News reported that another scenario for a tie exists if Trump were to win all of Nebraska’s Electoral College votes. To do so, the former president would have to capture the state’s 2nd Congressional District, which many pundits say favors Harris. But McCoy said for that to happen, several other states would have to fall into place for the 269-269 scenario to play out. McCoy said that Trump could still reach 270 electoral votes by maintaining his 2020 map and then picking up Georgia and Pennsylvania. While Decision Desk HQ’s forecasting allows for the possibility of Trump and Harris each finishing with 269 Electoral College votes, the scenario remains highly improbable, he added. 'It’s like winning the lottery kind of a thing,' McCoy told NewsNation. 'It’s possible, but it’s probably nothing that you plan on.' He added: 'It's not a high probability event, but it's not an impossible one.' Images of Trump and Harris by the Associated Press If neither Trump nor Harris was to reach the necessary 270 Electoral College votes, the 12th Amendment calls on the U.S. House of Representatives to elect the new president while the U.S. Senate would appoint a new vice president. The procedure of a 'contingent election' has not taken place in the case of a U.S. president since 1825 (John Quincy Adams) and 1837 for the vice president. Yet in an election cycle that saw the presumptive Democratic nominee, President Joe Biden, drop out of the race in favor of Harris, questions of what could happen next have arisen. That includes the notion of an Electoral College tie, McCoy said. In a contingent election, the House of Representatives would choose between up to three candidates that won the most electoral votes, according to the Congressional Research Service. Each state would cast one vote for president regardless of its population. The agency said that in states where two or more U.S. Representatives are seated, that group would need to determine which candidate would receive that state’s voice. Trump, Harris separated by 1 point in Georgia, North Carolina: Polls Although such a scenario has piqued the interest of those who delve deeply into election night possibilities, McCoy said that Decision Desk HQ’s simulations very rarely land on a tie. Out of millions of simulations, an Electoral College tie comes up perhaps a handful of times, he added. On election night, Decision Desk HQ, the first organization to accurately call the past two presidential elections, works to understand the possibilities but deals much more in data that comes out of each state, McCoy said. As someone who digests the numbers his organization turns out daily, McCoy says he is intrigued by the idea of the Electoral College vote tie. But based on the way the numbers are pointing in a race that remains anyone’s with just days remaining, he prefers to deal with reality. 'It’s intriguing as a thought experiment, certainly,' McCoy said. 'But if (a tie) were to happen, I think we would all be very surprised.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/could-trump-harris-tie-electoral-college/	2024-11-01T11:19:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2172377704-e1729215616414.jpg?w=800
Daniel Penny trial opening arguments begin	(NewsNation) — Opening arguments in the Daniel Penny trial began Friday morning, with both prosecution and defense laying out their arguments in the case. It's also possible some witnesses will be called. Penny is accused of killing a mentally ill homeless man, Jordan Neely, while riding the New York City subway. Delphi murders: Allen’s mental health at center of Day 13 Jury selection in the trial took eight days, and of the jury, five are men, seven are women. During the selection process, the defense questioned them. All of the jurors ride the train, and many have seen outbursts before, which is important for the defense. Outside of the court, protesters gathered. Hawk Newsome, co-founder of New York's Black Lives Matter organization, spoke out against jury deliberations. 'The majority of the people who defense council struck from the jury were Black,' he said. 'Five Black people, two Latinos, and one Asian. In the whole island of Manhattan, you got one Black man who is on the jury, no more.' Penny said Neely was threatening to kill everyone on the train, according to court documents, and that he was willing to go to prison for the rest of his life. Penny said he sprang into action, pinning Neely to the ground and putting him in a chokehold for several minutes. The former Marine's lawyers argue he acted in self-defense. Florida police believe they caught ‘an undetected serial killer’ Prosecutors say Penny's intention was a good one, but he went too far and used excessive force. Penny's attorneys have said they want the jurors to understand, from his perspective, what it felt like to be in that stressful situation, confined in a small box with no ability to run away. They say they will introduce Neely's mental health issues and that he was high on the drug K2 at the time. They also say the video of the incident is their best piece of evidence. Penny has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of second-degree manslaughter and up to four years if convicted of criminally negligent homicide. The trial is expected to last at least a month.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/daniel-penny-opening-arguments/	2024-11-01T10:46:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180010129.jpg?w=900
Trump works to pick up Michigan voters days before election	(NewsNation) — With just days to go before the election, former President Donald Trump is heading to Michigan to talk to voters in the battleground state. Trump is in Michigan hoping to pick up voters in the 'blue wall' area that could prove critical in determining the next resident of the White House. Trump has been trailing in the latest polls, but the difference between the two candidates is well within the margin of error, making the race a toss-up. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters His team is trying to clarify comments the former president made about former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney during a hurricane relief benefit with Tucker Carlson in Arizona. 'She's a radical war hawk,' he said. 'Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting there; let's see how she feels about it when the guns are trained on her face.' The Trump campaign is pushing back against claims it was a threat, saying he was talking about people like her who advocate for wars they don't fight in. That was not how the comment was perceived, and Cheney herself responded on X. 'This is how dictators destroy free nations,' she said. 'They threaten those who speak against them with death.' In Michigan, Trump will be meeting with business owners in Dearborn, Michigan, an area with a large Arab American community. DC businesses board up before Election Day, blocks away from White House Many have objected to the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the war in Gaza, sparking a movement during the primary to vote for uncommitted delegates not committed to President Joe Biden. Though Biden later stepped down from the ticket and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, many in the Arab and Muslim communities have said they will not be voting or will be voting for third-party candidate Jill Stein instead. Trump will be hoping to try to pick up those voters, though he has expressed strong support for Israel and its military actions in the Middle East region.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-michigan-days-election/	2024-11-01T10:40:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181215235.jpg?w=900
Why can't you wear your political gear to the polls?	(NEXSTAR) – An outfit may not be the first thing most people think of before heading to the polls, but a misstep while dressing could jeopardize one’s vote. All states have some restrictions when it comes to voting in person, and most states have rules about actively campaigning within a certain distance of a polling place. Some states, however, have extended that rule to include a dress code. One of those states is New Jersey, where a reported incident between an early voter and a poll worker received national attention after vice-presidential candidate JD Vance commented on a post. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } A Reddit user posted a photo of a bra-clad woman purportedly voting shirtless after a poll worker told her the Trump shirt she was wearing violated electioneering prohibitions. According to the person who posted the image, the woman fired multiple expletives at the worker before taking off the shirt and saying 'this is why she votes Trump.' 'What a patriot' Vance wrote on X. The post he commented on has since been deleted, but as of Oct. 30 the original Reddit post was still live. According to New Jersey election law, campaign-related apparel and other accessories are not allowed within 100 ft. of the polling place. Another voter in Texas made headlines in late October after allegedly punching a 69-year-old election worker who asked him to remove his pro-Trump hat at a polling place. Electioneering rules are meant to keep people from feeling pressured or intimidated in any way while voting, said Quinn Yeargain, an associate professor of law at Michigan State University. 'This is not something that functions in any way to chill anybody's free speech,' Yeargain said. 'This is to keep polling places neutral locations.' Conflict over electioneering statues isn't new, and in one notable instance voters successfully challenged state law. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group of Minnesota Tea Party supporters who argued that the state's ill-defined ban on apparel with 'political' messages was too broad. How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election 'How much states can necessarily do is something we might see some Supreme Court cases on in the future,' Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, told Nexstar. 'But I think that maybe the Minnesota law was being interpreted in that state potentially a lot more broadly than in some other places.' Current Minnesota law bans 'campaign T-shirts, buttons or literature which relate to specific candidates, official political parties or b allot questions on the ballot that day.' There are 21 states that have statutes banning electioneering apparel at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Arkansas California Delaware Indiana Kansas Maine Michigan Minnesota Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Dakota Rhode Island South Carolina Tennessee Texas Vermont Banned apparel items vary depending on the state, but include buttons, hats, shirts, stickers and other articles of clothing. '…a person may not wear a badge, insignia, emblem, or other similar communicative device relating to a candidate, measure, or political party appearing on the ballot, or to the conduct of the election, in the polling place,' Texas law states. That’s right, in nearly half of U.S. states, those T-shirts emblazoned with candidates’ faces or campaign slogans could be considered electioneering, or an attempt to influence someone’s vote. State laws vary when it comes to how far someone needs to be from a polling place while electioneering – in Alabama it’s 30 feet from the door, while in Iowa it’s 300 feet – and also what apparel might cross the line. In California, for instance, a shirt bearing a 'candidate's name, likeness or logo' is prohibited, but campaign slogans such as Make America Great Again are not. Violating the rules may result in more than a wasted trip to the polls, depending on what state you live in. Trump, Harris separated by 1 point in Georgia, North Carolina: Polls In Kansas, for instance, prohibited electioneering is a class C misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or up to a $500 fine. It’s always a good idea to check your local voting guidelines before heading to the polls. Some states like Maine, where campaign apparel isn’t allowed, have exceptions – buttons that 'do not exceed 3 inches and are worn by people at the polling place solely for the purpose of voting' are allowed. 'My general advice is don't go to the polling place with campaign apparel, be respectful of the location and the process,' Yeargain said. 'You know, it's not difficult to just wear a different shirt and take your picture with your 'I Voted' sticker outside the polling place with whatever shirt you want.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/political-gear-polls-voting/	2024-11-01T09:15:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24304676689676.jpg?w=900
Kamala Harris aims to keep lead in Wisconsin	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both in Wisconsin Friday. Harris is hoping to keep her slight lead in the polls over Trump in the Badger State. Earlier this week, she did a swing through the Sun Belt, going to Arizona and Nevada on Thursday to talk about fighting for workers and raising the minimum wage. At an event in Nevada, actress and singer Jennifer Lopez spoke, criticizing a comedian from a Trump rally in New York's Madison Square Garden who on Sunday called Puerto Rico a 'floating pile of garbage.' 'You can't even spell American without Rican,' Lopez said. 'This is our country, too, and we must exercise our right to vote on Nov. 5' How ‘blue wall’ sweep could tilt election Speakers at Trump's weekend rally faced backlash for crude and racist comments, but the GOP presidential candidate defended the scene as a 'lovefest.' This was something Harris hit on in Nevada. 'Listen to what he's saying as his closing argument. It's all about hate and division. Jennifer talked about it,' Harris said. 'It's all about hate and division. And it's not just what he says, it's what he will do.' As of Friday morning, Harris was pulling two points ahead of Trump in Wisconsin overall, with 50% over his 48%, according to a survey from Marist College. Much of her support came from female voters. Harris leads Trump 55% to 43% among women in the Marist poll. For the rest of Friday, Harris has been going across Wisconsin, with an afternoon stop in Janesville before a rally in suburban Milwaukee. In a press call, senior campaign officials said internal data indicates Harris is winning battleground voters by double-digit margins. Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, focus group data shows, didn't just impact how Puerto Ricans and Latinos view the race — but also undecided voters at large, campaign officials said. So far, the campaign has knocked on over 13 million doors across battleground states, and made over 100 million to these kinds of voters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-wisconsin-lead/	2024-11-01T07:37:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP24305051934317.jpg?w=900
Liz Cheney wants to be deciding factor against Trump on Election ...	Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) has jumped head first into the election fight on behalf of her former political rivals, stumping for Vice President Harris and endorsing a handful of downballot Democrats in a bid to keep former President Trump and his congressional allies from winning power next year. Her impact, however, remains as nebulous as the election results themselves. And the parties are at odds over the breadth of her influence. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has national name recognition, model conservative credentials and a network of powerful GOP allies forged over the course of decades. Democrats consider her a potent ally in the late-campaign scramble to attract both independent and traditional Republican voters averse to Trump’s irreverent brand of populist nationalism. 'There are a lot of Republicans out there who feel like their party has just gone off the edge following Donald Trump,' Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said. 'And nobody speaks to them better than Liz Cheney.' Yet the GOP has changed dramatically in recent decades, shifting from a party championing free trade, immigration, muscular foreign policy and strong support for overseas allies — all ideas promoted by the Reagan and two Bush administrations — into a more isolationist mold embodied by Trump. With that in mind, GOP campaign operatives are brushing off Cheney’s messaging blitz, saying her brand of old-school conservatism is a stale relic of a bygone era — one that’s lost the power to sway voters in any significant numbers. 'We haven't lost a wink of sleep about it,' a House GOP strategist said. 'We know it's there, but it's really irrelevant. … Our coalitions have shifted so much. Now we're picking up these blue-collar, working class former Democrats, and they're all in for Trump. And now the Cheneys are known for this war-mongering effort, and that's kind of the Kamala Harris base, you know. They're pro-Ukraine. 'So it's just a different coalition these days.' Cheney endorsed Harris in September and has since thrown her weight behind four Democrats in tough races for Congress: Reps. Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Colin Allred (Texas), who are both vying for Senate seats in their respective states; Rep. Susan Wild, who’s running for a fifth term in a battleground Pennsylvania district; and John Avlon, a former CNN commentator who’s challenging Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) on Long Island. Cheney has been similarly selective in deciding where to take her anti-Trump message on the road, opting for a handful of counties with sizable populations of suburban GOP women — a key constituency that Harris is trying to siphon off from Trump — in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, three critical swing states that could make-or-break Harris’s bid for the presidency. The stops have overlapped with where former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley performed well during the GOP primary, a sign she’s targeting Republican voters with unfavorable views of Trump. Cheney, for example, has campaigned in Ripon, Wis., Waukesha County, Wis., Chester County, Pa., and Oakland County, Mich., all of which saw more than 10 percent of GOP voters cast primary ballots for Haley. In Oakland County, the second-largest county by population in Michigan as of 2023, per the state Senate, Haley drew 24 percent of GOP voters. 'A very natural voter base for Cheney to target are Nikki Haley voters, in the sense that they probably have conservative views, you know they’re voting for a conservative candidate, but they have some skepticism of Trump because they’ve broken with the rest of the party and actively chose to support a candidate who at times was voicing very anti-Trump and anti-big lie,' said Zachary Donnini, a data scientist at Decision Desk HQ, a nonpartisan election handicapper. 'These are the voters that Cheney thinks she can maybe flip,' he added. 'It’s people who might have a positive view of her but haven’t fully defected from the Republican Party yet.' Whether that effort is effective, however, remains the key question. Recent polls have found the presidential candidates separated by a razor-thin margin — making it anyone’s game less than a week out from Election Day. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Wednesday found Harris with a 6-point lead in Wisconsin among likely voters, a 5-point edge in Michigan, and a tied race in Pennsylvania, with the two candidates both drawing 48 percent support. The margin of error is 4.8 percentage points for Wisconsin and 4.7 percentage points for Michigan and Pennsylvania, making the states at a near statistical tie. The close nature of the race opens an opportunity for any voting bloc to tip the scales in one direction or another. Former GOP Rep. Charlie Dent (Pa.) — who revealed earlier this month that he voted for Harris — said Cheney’s impact may be marginal, but that could be enough to make a difference in this race. 'This game is gonna be won or lost on the margins and to the extent that Liz Cheney can help Kamala Harris with certain demographics like college educated, suburban, Republican and Independent women, well that’s all the better for Harris,' Dent, who left Congress in 2018 after more than a dozen years in the House, told The Hill in an interview. '[Do] I think it will be a dramatic impact? No. But do I think on the margins Liz Cheney helps? Absolutely,' Dent continued. 'And again, even a small movement can be enormously consequential. So I think overall it’s a net positive for her.' The marginal impact may remain silent until Election Day. On the trail, Cheney has reminded Republicans that their ballot is a 'secret vote,' a message designed to ease any concerns about retribution for supporting the opposite party. 'I think you're going to have, frankly, a lot of men and women who will go into the voting booth and will vote their conscience, will vote for Vice President Harris,' Cheney said on CBS’s 'Face the Nation' last month. 'They may not ever say anything publicly, but the results will speak for themselves.' Cheney wasn’t the most predictable figure to launch a crusade against her party’s presidential nominee. During her early years in the House, Cheney was a superstar of the right, rising quickly into the ranks of GOP leadership and siding with Trump on virtually every major policy fight while defending him through his first impeachment in 2019. The breaking point came after the 2020 election, when Trump refused to concede defeat and fought to remain in the White House by nullifying Joe Biden’s victory. That campaign led directly to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed into the building in a failed effort to block Congress from certifying the election results. Since then, Cheney has become Trump’s most prominent Republican critic, voting to impeach the president in the days after the rampage and later joining the House investigative committee that found him culpable of fomenting the violence. The castigations cost Cheney her seat in Congress — replaced by a Trump ally. But with Trump racing for a second term, Cheney has returned to the national stage with warnings that the former president poses a material threat to the country's foundational democratic traditions. Her criticisms have extended to those in her party — including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — who are supporting Trump’s reelection bid. But while Cheney is the most vocal anti-Trump Republican to emerge this campaign cycle, she also represents a much larger universe of conservatives who have declined to support the GOP nominee — not because they support Harris on the issues, but because they see Trump as a threat to democracy. Hardly fringe characters, the detractors embody a who's who of GOP leaders stretching back decades, including former President George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Mike Pence, who served as vice president in Trump's first term. Still, a large majority of Republicans on and off Capitol Hill have stuck by Trump amid the internal clash. And many say his appeal to former Democrats more than compensates for the erosion of support from conservative traditionalists. 'To tell you the truth, I think we've picked up more than we've lost,' the GOP campaign strategist said. Democrats have a different view, pointing to recent polls indicating that there are many more Republicans supporting Harris than there are Democrats supporting Trump. Some say Cheney is influencing that trend. 'I do think there is a subset of suburban Republican voters out there that feel left behind by today’s MAGA-fied Republican Party,' said a Democratic campaign strategist familiar with House races. 'So if Republicans for Democrats creates a permission structure for those individuals, then more power to 'em.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/liz-cheney-wants-to-be-deciding-factor-against-trump-on-election-day/	2024-11-01T06:59:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/cheneyliz_harriskamala_102124ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Democrats see hope for Harris in Trump controversies	A series of controversial statements from former President Trump and his allies in the final week of the campaign has opened the door for Democrats to potentially make gains with key voters. A comedian’s racist joke at a Sunday rally about Puerto Rico sparked outcry from the Latino community. Elon Musk, a top Trump supporter, acknowledged that Americans would face 'temporary hardship' under Trump’s economic proposals. A leading transition official indicated Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, would be handed data about immunizations to potentially pull them off the market. And Trump himself said he would be a protector for women 'whether the women like it or not.' Trump’s team has been optimistic about his chances next Tuesday, and the former president managed to seize back the news cycle on Wednesday after President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters 'garbage.' While Biden’s comments may serve to further galvanize Trump’s base — and provided Trump with a political stunt — Biden is no longer on the ballot and Vice President Harris has distanced herself from his comments. Instead, the string of high-profile comments from Trump and his allies has given Democrats fresh talking points to warn of the risks of electing the GOP nominee. 'Every day Trump has dropped a bit of poison in a different voting pool where people might be undecided,' said Jesse Lee, a former Biden and Obama White House official. 'Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics have learned that Trump has a problem with all of them, and not just new immigrants, lots of suburban moms will recoil in horror at the idea of ending childhood vaccinations, and Trump’s protector talk makes him sound like an abuser — women recognize that, and some men will, too,' Lee added. Harris has long framed herself as the underdog in the race. A victory Tuesday would likely be a result of a surge in turnout among women and college-educated voters, and a strong performance among Black and Latino voters. The Trump campaign first handed Harris a gift during a Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden that was intended to be a triumphant delivery of Trump’s closing message. Instead, it was overshadowed by racist and sexist comments by guest speakers, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who compared Puerto Rico to a 'floating island of garbage.' Hinchcliffe’s comments sparked backlash among some Latino voters and prompted Bad Bunny, a superstar Puerto Rican musician, to post on social media backing Harris. Days later, reggaeton star Nicky Jam walked back his endorsement of Trump over the controversy. Musk, the billionaire Trump supporter who has signaled he would lead a government efficiency commission to cut spending, said at a recent telephone town hall that the changes under a Trump administration would 'necessarily involve some temporary hardship.' Democrats jumped on those comments to warn that even Trump’s advisers are aware that his economic plans, which call for the imposition of tariffs on all foreign imports and a hodgepodge of proposed tax cuts, could adversely affect many Americans initially. Howard Lutnick, a co-chair of Trump’s transition team, made more waves Wednesday when he sparred with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about the efficacy of vaccines. He suggested a Trump administration would provide outspoken vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. with data about vaccine safety to show 'it’s not safe.' Meanwhile, Trump at a Wednesday night rally, doubled down on calling himself a 'protector' for women, saying he would do so 'whether the women like it or not.' The series of controversial comments could give Harris and her campaign an opening to appeal to the crucial voting blocs Democrats need to carry key battleground states on Tuesday. Polling has shown Harris lagging behind Biden’s 2020 mark with Latino voters, and Democratic campaign officials have launched ads and increased outreach to capitalize on the Puerto Rico remarks from Trump’s rally. Harris’s campaign is also hoping to drive up its advantage with women and college-educated voters, as it has centered its closing argument on protecting reproductive rights and the idea that Trump is 'unhinged' and only out for power. 'Each day, I think that there are also indications that we are receiving from my opponent that verify, validate and reinforce the fact that, one, he is not going to be fighting for women’s reproductive rights,' Harris told reporters. 'He does not prioritize the freedom of women and the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives and bodies. And health care for all Americans is on the line in this election, as well.' The former president and his campaign have expressed optimism about their position heading into Election Day. Republicans have turned out in strong numbers to vote early, polls have shown Trump in a stronger position than in previous elections, and aides have argued internal data shows Trump on track to win the election. A Decision Desk HQ forecast of the presidential election gives Trump a 53 percent chance of winning the White House, while polling averages show Trump and Harris are within 2 percentage points of each other in each of the seven key battleground states. The Trump team has also shown a knack for seizing control of the news cycle through photo ops, such as when the former president worked briefly behind the counter at a McDonald’s or when he climbed into a garbage truck to highlight Biden’s gaffe earlier this week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-see-hope-for-harris-in-trump-controversies/	2024-11-01T06:57:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/trump-controversy_samuels_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900
How 'blue wall' sweep could tilt election	(NewsNation) — Late-deciding voters could tip the scales for either presidential candidate this election year. Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will hit the 'blue wall' states just days before the election, hoping to tilt the race in those swing states their way. Recent history dictates that whoever wins the blue wall states wins the presidency. In 2016, that was Trump. In 2020, it was President Joe Biden. For this year's election, it remains a toss-up between candidates. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Where the candidates stand in blue wall states So far, Harris has increased the level of support in several key constituencies but is often trailing the levels in which Biden won them, a new Marist/NPR poll found. It also showed Trump's numbers in some of these categories trailing what his numbers were back in 2020. Harris has seen solid support among non-whites over Trump while he continues to have an advantage among white voters, according to the latest poll in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Marist survey showed Harris, however, trailing in support among nonwhites compared to what Biden had among this group in 2020 in all three states. The contests in all three states are dead heats. Harris currently has advantages in all three, but they are within the margin of error. Harris is doing much better with independents than in the last Marist survey of the blue wall states. In Pennsylvania, she now garners 55% versus 40% for Trump, according to the Marist survey. In September, he topped her. In Michigan and Wisconsin, she has slightly widened her previous lead over Trump in this important constituency. In the key gender gap, Harris' lead among women compared to Trump's with men has grown in two of the states but shrunk in Pennsylvania. The gap in Pennsylvania has narrowed to 12 points. In Michigan, the gender gap has grown to 17 points. In Wisconsin, a 21-point gender gap exists. DC businesses boarding up storefronts ahead of election Securing blue wall states is easy way to victory Securing the blue all states could be Harris' easiest way to victory because securing the blue wall means she likely secures the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. However, if she loses even just one of the blue wall states, Harris will have to bank on other battleground states such as North Carolina. Hoping to avoid that possibility, Harris will spend her last two days campaigning in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump will also make stops in those two states.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/blue-wall-sweep-tilt-election/	2024-11-01T05:27:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/undefined.png?w=900
DC businesses board up before Election Day, blocks away from Whit...	(NewsNation) — Heading into the final weekend before the election, some businesses in the nation's capital are boarding up their windows and doors in case of civil unrest. Friday morning in Washington D.C., multiple businesses blocks from the White House started boarding up their windows. While the D.C. Police Department said there are no known credible threats at the moment, the entire department will be deployed next week to ensure safety. Harris ‘strongly disagrees’ with Biden calling Trump supporters ‘garbage’ NewsNation saw firsthand workers boarding up some of the storefronts — including chains like McDonald's as well as small, locally-owned businesses — over concerns of possible protests or violence related to the election. 'We will not tolerate any violence of any kind,' said D.C. Police Chief Pamela A. Smith at a news conference. 'We will not tolerate the destruction of property.

Diddy court witness says he saw 8 sex tapes with at least 2 celeb...	This article mentions sexual assault. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673. (NewsNation) — Courtney Burgess, a Sean 'Diddy' Combs investigation court witness, exclusively told NewsNation's 'Banfield' he was given 11 flash drives containing at least eight sex tapes involving eight celebrities. Burgess testified before the Combs grand jury in the Southern District of New York on Thursday. Among the eight celebrities that were Combs' 'victims,' 'two to three' were minors, according to Burgess. Burgess said he was working in Atlanta when his former associate Kim Porter, Combs' ex-girlfriend, shared the flash drives with him. What’s happened since Diddy was indicted? Burgess also recieved a manuscript from Porter's alleged memoir titled 'Kim’s Lost Words: A journey for justice, from the other side.' The book details physical abuse, sexual coercion and other acts of violence Combs allegedly committed. The $22 paperback had a quiet release on Amazon but skyrocketed after the news of Combs’ arrest and the shocking details of the indictment against him. Ariel Mitchell, Burgess’ attorney, said the alleged tapes 'tell the story of what Diddy has done over the past 30 years. His deviant activities.' 'I would imagine that is what is encompased if said flash drives exist,' Mitchell said on 'Banfield.' Burgess says he's no longer in possession of the tapes. Chris Brown prevented fight between Diddy’s sons, Ray J: Sources Combs pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. New charges, evidence or additional defendants in his investigation could delay his court date. Combs has been at the center of a storm of controversy and legal troubles where multiple individuals have come forward with allegations of sexual assault against him, leading to a series of lawsuits.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/diddy-court-witness-says-he-saw-8-sex-tapes-with-at-least-2-celeb-minors/	2024-10-31T19:06:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/la-me-ln-sean-diddy-combs-arrested-at-ucla-201-001.jpg?w=750
Josh Hawley, Lucas Kunce face off in U.S Senate debate	ST. LOUIS - U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce agreed to a live televised debate on Oct. 31, 2024, just five days before the general election. The debate will be broadcast at 7 p.m. across Missouri on Nexstar stations, including KTVI/KPLR-St. Louis, WDAF-Kansas City, KRBK-Springfield, and KSN-Joplin, as well as their digital platforms. This event, titled 'Debate Night in Missouri, the Race for the U.S. Senate,' marks the only scheduled debate between the two candidates in one of the country's most closely watched Senate races. Viewers can tune in to see the candidates discuss their positions and address key issues facing Missouri voters. The debate agreement comes after months of public challenges and a face-to-face confrontation between Hawley and Kunce at the Missouri State Fair in August. Both campaigns have been actively engaging in media advertising, with each accusing the other of misrepresenting their positions on various issues. Recent polling by Emerson College, The Hill, and Nexstar shows Hawley with an 11-point lead, though the incumbent suggests the race may be closer. Key topics likely to be addressed during the debate include abortion exceptions, IVF, electric vehicle mandates, and potential presidential endorsements. Nexstar Media, Inc. aims to provide a balanced and accessible platform for the candidates to present their views, aligning with the company's commitment to informing voters, and fostering well-informed electoral choices.

California 13th Congressional District Debate: John Duarte and Ad...	With less than a week to go before Election Day on November 5, Republican incumbent Rep. John Duarte and Democratic challenger Adam Gray will debate live on Thursday night as they seek the 13th Congressional District, a race that could help determine which party controls the U.S. House. 'DEBATE NIGHT IN CALIFORNIA: 13th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,' will begin at 7 p.m. PST and will be moderated by FOX40 News anchor and co-host of Inside California Politics, Nikki Laurenzo, and KGPE CBS47 News anchor Brian Dorman. The debate will air in the Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto areas on FOX40, and in the Fresno and Visalia areas on CBS47. There will be a livestream of the debate at the top of this article, and the debate will also be livestreamed on YourCentralValley.com, and on the FOX40 and CBS47 mobile apps. The race for the 13th Congressional District is a rematch of the 2022 race, which Gray lost by 564 votes, the second-closest House race in that election. The district encompasses the communities between and along the I-5 and Highway 99, from the Tracy area in the north to the Coalinga area in the south. Freshman Rep. Duarte comes from a farming family in the Central Valley and owns one of the largest crop nurseries in the country, Duarte Nursery. As a farmer, Duarte clashed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over violations of the Clean Water Act related to the use of wetlands for farming. Duarte ultimately agreed to pay $1.1 million to settle the issue. In Congress, Duarte serves on various subcommittees, including the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit; the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials; and the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries. During the campaign, Duarte has framed himself as a more moderate Republican who is focused on bipartisanship. The congressman has occasionally voted out of step with his fellow Republicans on key bills such as the 2023 Secure Our Borders Act, which he said would hurt farmers and noted that it lacked support for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). According to his campaign, Gray was born and raised in Merced and worked at his family's farm supply store. Gray worked as a staff member for various California elected officials, including disgraced state Senator Ron Calderon, before becoming a State Assembly member in 2012. Gray held his Assembly seat for 10 years, during which he also at times went against his party. While in the Assembly, Gray fought an environmental effort by the state to restrict the use of water flowing through the region in order to help preserve the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/california-13th-congressional-district-debate-john-duarte-and-adam-gray/	2024-10-31T18:05:57-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Thursday-Push_BothStations.png?w=900
Trump sues CBS for $10B over Harris's '60 Minutes' interview	Former President Trump is suing CBS News over a '60 Minutes' interview it broadcast with Vice President Harris earlier this month that he and his allies have claimed was edited to cast her in a positive light. The lawsuit, which seeks $10 billion in damages and was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas alleges the network engaged in 'partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion.' Jimmy Kimmel appeals to Republicans to reject Trump in 19-minute monologue 'To paper over Kamala’s 'word salad' weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,' the lawsuit reads. CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump and his allies have railed against CBS for weeks over the wide-ranging interview with Harris, pointing to an answer the vice president gave to a question about the war in Gaza that was not included in the full broadcast and instead published by the outlet online. It is standard practice for broadcast outlets to edit questions and answers during interviews with major newsmakers for clarity, accuracy and time. Trump initially agreed to sit for a similar interview with '60 Minutes,' the network said at the time it broadcast its conversation with Harris, but the former president backed out after the program said it would fact-check him.

Conservatives in furor over Julia Roberts ad for Kamala Harris	A new Harris-Walz campaign ad voiced by actor Julia Roberts encourages women to vote for Vice President Harris in the presidential election, even if their husbands are backing former President Trump. The Roberts ad, put out by Vote Common Good, also alludes to abortion rights, which is seen as a pivotal issue in a race that has seen Trump with big polling leads among male voters and Harris with a large lead among female voters. Jimmy Kimmel appeals to Republicans to reject Trump in 19-minute monologue 'In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,' Roberts says in the ad as a woman on screen meets up with her husband after casting her ballot for Harris. The voter winks at a fellow female voter as her husband asks if she made the 'right choice.' Republicans have responded to the video with outrage, with some claiming that a wife lying about her vote is as bad as an affair. 'If I found out Emma was going to the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that’s the same thing as having an affair,' Fox News host Jesse Watters said on air Wednesday in a clip highlighted by Mediaite. Other GOP members including Charlie Kirk said the thought was 'nauseating.' In criticizing the ad, he discussed a husband working hard to afford his wife's lifestyle, and then said a wife who lied to her husband about whom she backed would amount to undermining her husband. 'I think it's so gross. I think it's so nauseating where this wife is wearing the American hat, she's coming in with her sweet husband who probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go you know and have a nice life and provide to the family, and then she lies to him saying, 'Oh, yeah, I'm gonna vote for Trump,' and then she votes for Kamala Harris as her little secret in the voting booth,' Kirk fumed to radio host Megyn Kelly.

In response to his statements, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) called Kirk a 'twit.' 'Listen to this twit make Donald Trump’s closing argument.

Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines off the market 'Our work is all about helping people do the thing in the voting booth that they know in their heart they want to do. We’ve traveled the country and met people all over who have a higher calling for their vote than just what their political party or friends demand of them,' he added. 'We know they’ll think about who they love the most when they vote and not just what their political party or religious community tells them to do.

Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines of...	(The Hill) - Howard Lutnick, co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team, said in a Tuesday interview that former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is backing former President Trump, is seeking the federal data to prove vaccines should be kept off the market. Lutnick added, however, that Kennedy will not get — nor does he want — the job of secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Georgia secretary of state: Election is secure, and here’s why 'He's not getting a job for HHS,' Lutnick told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, pushing back against the claim that Trump had promised Kennedy the job. 'He wants the data, so he can say, ‘These things are unsafe.’ He says, ‘If you give me the data, all I want is the data, and I'll take on the data and show that it's not safe. And then if you pull the product liability, the companies will yank these vaccines right off, off of the market.’' Former President Trump shakes hands with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a Turning Point Action campaign rally, Oct. 23, 2024, in Duluth, Ga. (Alex Brandon, Associated Press) 'So, that's his point. He's not trying to do anything, but things that made sense,' Lutnick added. He said he recently spent two-and-a-half hours with Kennedy, who explained to him several theories related to vaccines that Lutnick said made sense to him. Lutnick repeated several unsubstantiated claims in the interview with Collins, including that the government is withholding data about vaccines, that vaccines are linked to a rise in autism diagnoses and that scientists were paid to say that Kennedy is lying about vaccines. Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome Autism diagnoses have increased steadily in the last couple of decades, a trend many scientists attribute to a change in environmental factors, a broadening of criteria for the diagnosis and a wider awareness about the disease. Scientists also say that having an older father can increase one’s chance of autism. Kennedy has previously said that Trump has promised him 'control' of HHS and the related health agencies, leading to concern among some scientists about the consequences on vaccine access and research availability if Trump returns to the White House.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-rfk-jr-vaccines/	2024-10-31T15:05:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kennedyjrrober_trumpdonald_102324ap01_w_7103b7-e1730385094734.jpg?w=900
Georgia secretary of state: Election is secure, and here's why	(The Hill) -- Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) reassured the state’s voters that the upcoming election is secure and that voters' ballots will be counted. Raffensperger said that no matter which presidential candidate triumphs in the 2024 White House election, 'every voter in our state should know that the results will be valid because the election is secure.' Trump transition official says RFK Jr. wants to force vaccines off the market 'Election security begins with highly accurate voter registration lists — and to even get on that list Georgia verifies the U.S. citizenship of everyone attempting to register to vote,' Raffensperger wrote in an op-ed published Thursday in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'Noncitizens cannot vote in Georgia,' he continued, adding that the state cross-checks applications with a database administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 'Registering to vote or even attempting to register to vote as a noncitizen is a felony under both federal and state law and carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.' He wrote that voter roll maintenance is done 'daily,' and emphasized that voters are required to show government-issued identification and sign an oath. Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome Raffensperger said in the op-ed that ballots are printed on 'a special paper with security features built into the fibers of the ballot.' 'Election workers in Georgia can use a handheld scanner to detect the presence of security features woven into the fibers of the ballot itself to detect any counterfeit ballots,' he said, adding that this year’s ballots have a 'unique watermark to visually identify any attempt to create a phony ballot.' Earlier this month, the Republican election official shut down claims of voter fraud as the state saw a historic early-voting turnout. Days later, he also warned Republicans that vote integrity claims will 'really hurt' the turnout of the GOP. Raffensperger concluded the op-ed by backing election workers in the state, saying they are 'hardworking public servants who do their absolute best under intense public scrutiny and on tight deadlines.' 'They are people who live and work and worship in the very communities you live in,' he added. 'They have their eyes on the process, and, if something out of the ordinary happens, they notice.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-secretary-of-state-election-is-secure-and-heres-why/	2024-10-31T15:04:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/raffenspergerbrad_022524gn01_w-e1730398186829.jpg?w=800
The current odds in every swing Senate race	(NewsNation) — The 2024 presidential election is still anybody's game, but polling suggests Democrats are facing an uphill battle to maintain control of the U.S. Senate. Republicans have to win just one of two competitive races in red states — Montana or Ohio — to secure a surefire majority, assuming everything else goes as projected. NewsNation’s election partner, Decision Desk HQ, shows Republicans with a 71% chance of winning the Senate as of Oct. 31. The current odds in every battleground state Scott Tranter, the director of data science at DDHQ, recently explained what goes into that projection: 'We have over 20,000 polls in our database from this cycle, as well as past performance and voter registration [data].' Other variables, like fundraising amounts, also go into the model, Tranter said. In this election, GOP candidates are favored to flip blue seats in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia. Two other Democratic incumbents — Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin and Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania — are in closely contested races. Meanwhile, Democrats will try to pull off upsets in Missouri and Texas, hoping to unseat two prominent GOP senators — Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley — both of whom are in closer races than they'd prefer. Here are the current odds in 13 key Senate races. Arizona: Kari Lake vs. Rep. Ruben Gallego In this combination photo, Kari Lake speaks in Dallas, Aug. 5, 2022, left, and Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., is seen in the Capitol, July 14, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Gallego (D): 82% Lake (R): 18% GOP: Anything short of 52-seat Senate majority would be a ‘failure’ Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Gallego (D): 49.7% Lake (R): 43.5% What to know: Trump-backed former TV anchor Kari Lake is eyeing an Arizona Senate seat after coming up short in her 2022 bid for governor, but polling suggests she has a tough hill to climb. As recently as July, Lake and U.S. Rep Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., were within three points of each other, but since then, Gallego has widened the margin to more than six points. He's also raised considerably more money: over $56 million versus Lake's $21 million. Florida: Sen. Rick Scott vs. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), left, and former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.) are in a tight race for Florida's Senate seat. Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Scott (R): 75% Mucarsel-Powell (D): 25% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Scott (R): 49.5% Mucarsel-Powell (D): 44.8% What to know: Once a hotly contested swing state, Florida now leans Republican. That bodes well for GOP Senator Rick Scott, the incumbent, who won by a slim 10,000 vote margin in 2018. Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former representative from Miami, will have to overcome a roughly 5-point polling gap and a $10 million spending disadvantage to flip the seat blue.

(AP Photo) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Slotkin (D): 67% Rogers (R): 33% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Slotkin (D): 48.1% Rogers (R): 45.1% What to know: U.S. Rep Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., has outspent her GOP opponent, former Rep. Mike Rogers, by more than 5 to 1, yet the race remains tight. Rogers has narrowed the polling gap in recent weeks, but Slotkin still holds a three-point advantage, according to Decision Desk HQ. Missouri: Sen. Josh Hawley vs. Lucas Kunce Republican Sen. Josh Hawley and Democrat Lucas Kunce engaged in an impromptu showdown at the Missouri State Fair. The candidates have been fighting over a potential debate. (Kacen Bayless/The Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Hawley (R): 89% Kunce (D): 11% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Hawley (R): 51.5% Kunce (D): 45.2% What to know: Republican incumbent Josh Hawley has become one of the more recognizable figures on the new American right, but attorney Lucas Kunce, a Marine veteran, is trying to change that. To do so, Kunce will have to dramatically defy expectations in a state that backed Donald Trump by more than 15 points in 2020. The two are set to debate on Thursday, Oct. 31, hosted by NewsNation local affiliate KTVI in St. Louis. The debate is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. CT.

Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Sheehy (R): 74% Tester (D): 26% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Sheehy (R): 50.0% Tester (D): 45.2% What to know: Senator Jon Tester, the incumbent, is the most vulnerable Democrat this cycle and is now considered an underdog against GOP challenger Tim Sheehy. The reason is fairly straightforward: Montana is a solidly red state that Trump won by more than 16 points in 2020. '[Tester's] reputation as a straight-shooting, authentic, and deeply rooted rural Montanan arguably matters less than ever in a highly nationalized electoral environment and in a Montana that has changed dramatically since his last run in 2018,' Kal Munis, a political scientist and Montana native, wrote in a recent Brookings article. Nevada: Sen. Jacky Rosen vs. Sam Brown US Senate candidate Sam Brown, left, and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Rosen (D): 80% Brown (R): 20% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Rosen (D): 48.9% Brown (R): 43.3% What to watch: Republican presidential candidates have been gaining ground in Nevada in recent elections, so much so that it has become a legitimate swing state. But losing by less and winning are two different things. Republican Adam Laxalt came up short in his 2022 Senate bid, losing to Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. Now, polling suggests Democratic incumbent Jacky Rosen is heavily favored to retain her seat against Republican challenger Sam Brown. The net worth of richest Congress members New Mexico: Nella Domenici vs. Sen. Martin Heinrich Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich (left) and Republican challenger Nella Domenici (right) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Heinrich (D): 94% Domenici (R): 6% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Heinrich (D): 50.5% Domenici (R): 39.2% What to watch: Democratic incumbent Martin Heinrich has raised more than twice as much as GOP challenger Nella Domenici, the daughter of the last New Mexico Republican elected to the Senate. Domenici will have to pull off a major upset to get elected in a state that Joe Biden carried by more than 10 points in 2020. Ohio: Sen. Sherrod Brown vs. Bernie Moreno This combination photo shows Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Oct. 26, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington, left, and Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno, a Republican candidate for Senate, in Westlake, Ohio, March 19, 2024. (AP Photo) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Moreno (R): 54% Brown (D): 46% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Moreno (R): 47.7% Brown (D): 46.9% What to know: Polls suggest Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown could be in trouble against Republican businessman Bernie Moreno. A few elections ago, Ohio was a key battleground state, but since then, it's grown increasingly red. 'There's been several polls over the last week that have [Moreno] anywhere from one to three points ahead, on top of the fact it looks like Donald Trump's going to probably win the state by five to seven points,' Tranter told NewsNation's Markie Martin on Monday. What time do the polls close in my state? Pennsylvania: Sen. Bob Casey vs. David McCormick This combination of photos taken in Pennsylvania shows Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., left, at a campaign event, Sept. 13, 2024, in Wilkes-Barre, and David McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania, at a campaign event, April 25, 2024, in Harrisburg. (AP Photo) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Casey (D): 72% McCormick (R): 28% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Casey (D): 48.0% McCormick (R): 45.5% What to know: Businessman David McCormick is back after narrowly losing to Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Republican primary election for the Senate back in 2022. McCormick was trailing by about seven points in early September but has since cut Democratic incumbent Bob Casey's lead to less than three points. Casey's war chest is almost twice as big, and he's outraised McCormick $52 million to $27 million. Texas: Sen. Ted Cruz vs. Rep. Colin Allred (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File/J. Scott Applewhite) Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Cruz (R): 75% Allred (D): 25% Decision Desk HQ polling averages (as of Oct. 31): Cruz (R): 49.1% Allred (D): 45.9% What to watch: Former presidential hopeful and current Senator Ted Cruz is facing a tough battle for his seat in the Lone Star State. If Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred can pull it off, it would be a major upset. Current polls suggest that's unlikely, though not impossible. 'Ted Cruz won his last race by 2.6% against Beto O'Rourke six years ago, and right now, he's polling better than that,' Tranter said. West Virginia: Jim Justice vs. Glenn Elliott West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice and Glenn Elliott are facing off for the Senate seat in West Virginia. Chance of winning, according to Decision Desk HQ (as of Oct. 31): Justice (R): &gt;99% Elliott (D): &lt;1% What to know: Republicans are all but guaranteed to pick up outgoing Senator Joe Manchin's seat. Trump carried the state by roughly 30 points in 2020, meaning the Senate candidate with 'R' by their name has a pretty good shot.

Trump, Harris separated by 1 point in Georgia, North Carolina: Po...	Former President Trump and Vice President Harris are separated by only 1 point in the battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina, according to polling released Thursday. The surveys from CNN, which were conducted by SSRS, found that Trump leads Harris by 1 point — with 48 percent support to her 47 percent — among likely voters in Georgia, while Harris sports the same margin among North Carolina’s likely voters, with 48 percent support to 47 percent. Both leads are within the margin of error, meaning the candidates are statistically tied. Little has changed since CNN’s polls of both states came out in the past two months. More than half of the respondents in both Georgia, 59 percent, and North Carolina, 52 percent, said they already voted, according to the survey. The Democratic nominee leads Trump among Black likely voters in both North Carolina, 78 percent to 19 percent, and Georgia, 84 percent to 13 percent. She also has an advantage with white college-educated voters in both states: with 55 percent support to Trump's 39 percent in Georgia and 53 percent to 42 percent in the Tar Heel State, according to the poll. Trump outpaced Harris among white voters without college degrees in the Peach State, with 81 percent support to Harris's 15 percent, but he had a smaller advantage in North Carolina, with 65 percent support to 31 percent, the survey found. Voters in both states said they trust Trump more than Harris on immigration, foreign policy and the economy. They had more faith in Harris when it came to abortion, but were split on the issue of democracy. The new polls come just a day after another set of CNN polls had Harris outpacing Trump by 6 points, with 51 percent support to his 45 percent, among likely Wisconsin voters. She also led by 5 points in Michigan, with 48 percent support to 43 percent. Nationally, Harris leads the former president by 0.8 percentage points, with 48.2 percent support to Trump's 47.4 percent, in the latest The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate of polls. The CNN surveys were conducted Oct. 23-28 among 732 registered voters in Georgia and 750 registered voters in North Carolina. The margin of error was 4.7 percentage points in Georgia and 4.5 points in North Carolina.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-separated-by-1-point-in-georgia-north-carolina-polls/	2024-10-31T15:03:42-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Trump-Harris-Emerson-Hill-10.26.png?w=900
How a 2022 law speeds up the presidential transition process	(NewsNation) — A winner in next week’s presidential race may not be determined for days, but the clock for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to begin moving toward a transition of power will begin ticking in the days immediately after the election, according to rules passed by Congress The Presidential Transition Improvement Act, which was enacted in late 2022, mandates the transition process will begin five days after the election — even if a presidential candidate has not conceded the race. According to the Center For Presidential Transition, if a 'sole apparent successful candidate' is not determined within the five days after election day, transition assistance is provided 'on an equitable basis' to both candidates until a lone successful candidate emerges. Elon Musk $1M giveaway case moved to federal court by PA judge Under the 2022 act, every federal agency will be required to provide access to the Harris and Trump campaigns beginning November 11. The provision allows both candidates’ teams to begin assembling their respective administrative Cabinets. The Washington Post reported that each federal agency is currently seeking out office space, preferably on two different floors, for each campaign to begin moving forward. Trump and Harris remain virtually deadlocked in the national polls and in several swing states. Political experts have told NewsNation that election outcomes in several states could delay the presidential race being called. Four years after Trump mounted legal challenges over state results that led to President Joe Biden’s victory, the congressional action paved the way for the transition process to begin in a timelier fashion. That transition includes access to sensitive materials and key government agencies for both campaigns, even if the election results are being challenged as they were by Trump in 2020. The race wasn’t called for Biden until the Saturday following the election, setting off claims by Trump the election had been taken from him. But even if there is a delay in the race being called in Harris’ or Trump’s favor next week, the revised version of the presidential transition act will treat both candidates equally in their planning efforts, Trump: Advisers told him not to say he would be ‘protector’ of women The Post reported Trump’s campaign has begun vetting potential Cabinet candidates inside a Washington hotel. However, the newspaper reported that the former president has yet to sign an ethics pledge and agreements involving transition fundraising disclosures and limits. A Biden administration official who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity said that Trump is expected to eventually sign the documents that grant his staff access to government computer equipment and email systems. Harris has signed the necessary documentation that would allow her to begin building a team, the Post report indicated. In 2020, Trump’s false claims of voter fraud delayed the beginning of the presidential transition process until November 23, 20 days after the election, The Associated Press reported. Emily Murphy, the administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration, determined that she had no legal right to determine a winner according to the 1963 transition laws, the AP reported. Murphy eventually did so, but only after Trump had exhausted all of his legal challenges over election results. However, the 2022 congressional actions changed the GSA’s role in the transition process, the AP reported, creating a roadblock for lengthy delays to take place. The Presidential Transition Improvement Act provides for federal cooperation for both candidates to begin the process of building a team even if legal challenges continue and until they have been 'substantially resolved.' That could continue until December, when members of the Electoral College from each state meet to certify election results and choose an Electoral College winner, the AP reported. That meeting takes place about a month before the inauguration.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/2022-law-presidential-transition-process/	2024-10-31T14:42:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-10.14.png?w=900
Republican Virginia House candidate defends 'fake family' photos	(NewsNation) — A Republican candidate for Virginia's 7th Congressional District is going viral after posing for photos with what critics say is a fake family. The New York Times was first to report about Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret in the Army, posting footage of himself with a woman and her three daughters on his official YouTube page and on a website paid for by the National Republican Campaign Committee. This footage was not used in a specific ad, the Times wrote. Democrat Eugene Vindman, who is running against Anderson, ran an ad calling Anderson out for this, saying that 'he's trying to hide that he's another extreme MAGA politician' using a 'fake wife and kids.' Anderson is not married and does not have children, but he announced earlier this year that he's engaged. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters On 'NewsNation Now' Thursday, Anderson said it's 'pretty unbelievable' that his opponent is focused on what he called 'B-roll footage that every single candidate in the nation takes.' The people in the picture, Anderson said, are good friends of his. He served with the woman in them and her husband in the military. 'This is the kind of stuff that my opponent is focused on because it's a distraction' from the issues, Anderson said, also mentioning allegations that he didn't tell the truth about his military background. Both candidates have been accused of inauthenticity, The Washington Post writes. Vindman has fielded questions over his military rank and combat record, while Anderson faces allegations he does not live in the 7th District. 'We are five days away from an election, and we're talking about this rather than the issues,' Anderson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/republican-virginia-house-candidate-family-photo/	2024-10-31T14:26:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24297605438072.jpg?w=900
Michigan secretary of state flags Dominion ballot machine program...	LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) — Split-ticket voters using a Dominion ICX Voter Assist Terminal (VAT) on Election Day should be prepared for straight-ticket/split-ticket programming issues when marking their ballot, according to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. A VAT is a special type of device that people with disabilities may use to assist with marking their ballot, which is then printed from the machine and put through the tabulator—but the machine has issues with properly processing certain types of ballots. Election worker fired after completed ballots fell off truck in Florida Benson stresses that this is a nationwide issue and is not only affecting Michigan. 'Yeah, this is a nationwide issue with Dominion voter access terminals in, in the counties that use them in the voter access terminals,' says Benson. 'Of course, not all the machines, just the ones that are accessible, have an issue. With the straight-party voting and a programming issue, that’s again affected the machines nationwide.' Voters using a VAT this Election Day will have to either vote straight-ticket or manually split their ballot—unlike how Michigan voters usually have the option to select the straight party option and then override their party selection for certain races. Benson also says this issue has frustrated officials in places where these machines are used. 'I think all of us who used Dominion machines were unhappy to learn about this during the testing period and as early voting began, so we’re working with Dominion to seek accountability on that front, and also are working with our clerks to ensure voters are aware of this programming issue that will require them to ensure they are voting every section on the ballot,' says Benson. ‘Get out there and vote:’ 102-year-old casts ballot in her 21st presidential election If a VAT user votes straight party and then splits their ticket, they will receive an error message—but will have the chance to fix it and still cast a ballot. While this does not change who or what a voter would cast their ballot for, it will make the process more inconvenient for VAT users who vote split-ticket. The Department of State says the issue can not be fixed in time for Election Day next week—but will be corrected for future elections—and only affects VATS in certain counties. Check here to see which type of VAT your county uses.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dominion-ballot-voting-machine-issue/	2024-10-31T13:51:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/vlcsnap-2024-10-31-14h34m53s497.png?w=900
Elon Musk $1M giveaway case moved to federal court by PA judge	(NewsNation) — A court case filed against billionaire Elon Musk over his $1 million daily giveaways to registered voters is on hold after a Pennsylvania judge heard arguments from the Tesla CEO's legal team and the Philadelphia district attorney Thursday morning. Lawyers for Musk's super PAC on Wednesday night put in a last-minute request to have the whole case bumped up to federal court. District Attorney Larry Krasner argued the issue belongs in state court because this is affecting their border voters. Judge Angelo Foglietta ultimately agreed to kick the matter up to federal court, but the lawyer representing Krasner, John Summers, said they are going to seek to have the matter remanded back to state court. Musk did not show up to Thursday's hearing. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters This all began after Musk's America PAC launched what they say is a 'petition in favor of free speech and the right to bear arms.' The world's richest man is giving $1 million a day to registered voters in battleground states. Some campaign finance experts and Democrats argue that this amounts to paying people to register to vote, which is illegal. Musk's defenders say it is merely a contest that's open to voters. In the 2024 presidential election, Musk is backing Trump, who took to Truth Social on Wednesday to tell his 8 million followers that 'Pennsylvania is cheating and getting caught at large-scale levels rarely seen before.' Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, responded on X to this claim by saying that Republican and Democratic clerks of elections are making sure only eligible voters are able to register and cast ballots. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, third from right, arrives for a hearing at a City Hall courtroom, Thursday, Oct. 31, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) 'We will again have a free and fair, safe and secure election — and the will of the people will be respected,' Shapiro wrote. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said on NewsNation's 'The Hill' that the organization is going to 'continue to be very aggressive in our monitoring and our engagement with the voters across Pennsylvania and every other battleground state.' 'If we need to go to the courts, then we will go to the court,' Whatley said. Pennsylvania is a very important state for presidential candidates, with 19 electoral votes. Polls in the state show Trump and Harris are neck and neck. Joe Biden won the state by one percentage point in the last election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-1-million-giveaway-case/	2024-10-31T12:52:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24291821306487.jpg?w=900
Michigan county clerk race resurrects 2020 election conspiracies	(NewsNation) — The race for county clerk in a Michigan community has ignited familiar arguments over election denial and alleged fraud. Years after the Republican-leaning Antrim County incorrectly announced a landslide victory for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, concerns about election integrity haven’t quieted. RFK Jr. says Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies Now, the sitting county clerk, who oversees the area’s election procedures, hopes to defeat one of her biggest skeptics who’s campaigning for the same role. The race, happening against the backdrop of another Trump presidential campaign, has garnered widespread attention for its ties to the 2020 election. Sheryl Guy has worked for Antrim County for more than 40 years, and she’d like to retire. But she has concerns about 'those seeking to replace her' as county clerk. That’s the pitch the Antrim County Democratic Party outlines in its plea for voters to reelect Guy as a write-in candidate. Campaigning for Guy’s position is Victoria Bishop, a woman whom The Associated Press described as a 'vocal proponent of election conspiracy theories' and the wife of a conservative radio host. BELLAIRE, MI - September 9: A campaign sign for Victoria Bishop next to an American flag in Bellaire, Michigan on Sept. 9, 2024. (Photo by Nic Antaya for The Washington Post via Getty Images) If elected, Bishop has promised to 'clean up the Qualified Voter Files (QVF),' 'remove ‘Dead People’ and Names who no longer live in (Antrim County)' and 'Hand Count every ballot' to make sure they match the machine’s tape. Her victory in the primary election prompted Guy to delay her retirement and seek reelection via a write-in campaign. Guy, backed by the local Democratic Party, said she voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. But her role overseeing that same election drew national attention and positioned Guy as the target of unfounded conspiracy theories. 'In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country,' Trump told his supporters during his Jan. 6, 2021, speech on the Ellipse. The county in question was Antrim — a Republican-leaning area near the resort town of Traverse City. Shortly after the presidential election in 2020, the county reported a landslide win for Biden. Bill O’Reilly: American divide split between progressive values, tradition The problem was attributed to human error, not any issue with voting machines, and the results were quickly corrected to show that Trump won the county. That did nothing to calm the speculation. Those who questioned Trump’s loss in Michigan quickly latched on to the reporting error to suggest that voting machines were responsible for widespread fraud, even though there has been no such evidence. 'I feel that [Trump’s] goal at that time was to use Antrim County to open up other jurisdictions with problems,' Guy told NBC News. BELLAIRE, MI - September 9: Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy works in her office at the Antrim County Government Building in Bellaire, Michigan on Sept. 9, 2024. (Photo by Nic Antaya for The Washington Post via Getty Images) An analysis of the incident cited 'vulnerabilities' and 'human errors that directly led to inaccurate results.' Still, there was 'no evidence that any of these problems was ever exploited in Antrim County,' and the errors were not the product of a security breach, the March 2021 analysis stated. Michigan’s concerns about election integrity mirror those playing out on the national stage. This year’s election is the first presidential contest since Trump began spreading lies about widespread voter fraud costing him reelection in 2020. The false claims, which he continues to repeat, have undermined public confidence in elections and in the people who oversee them among a broad swath of Republican voters. Investigations have found no widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines four years ago, and each of the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss has affirmed Democrat Joe Biden’s win.

Trump: Advisers told him not to say he would be ‘protector’ of wo...	(The Hill) -- Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his advisers had counseled him against describing himself as a 'protector' for women, a phrase he used in late September as he sought to make up ground with female voters and repeated again at a Wisconsin rally. 'My people told me about four weeks ago, I would say, 'No, I want to protect the people; I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women,'' Trump said at a Green Bay, Wisconsin, rally. 'They said, 'Sir, I just think it's inappropriate for you to say.' I pay these guys a lot of money; can you believe it?' Trump continued. 'I said, 'Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them. I'm going to protect them from migrants coming in. I'm going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things.'' FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign aides were quick to highlight the remarks, arguing it showed Trump did not care about women voters. 'Defining line of this campaign? Trump: 'I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not,'' Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer posted on X. 'Saying the quiet part out loud there,' Lauren Hitt, another Harris campaign aide, posted on X. Trump at a late September rally sought to directly address the women in the crowd, telling them, 'I am your protector. I want to be your protector. As president, I have to be your protector. I hope you don't make too much of it. I hope the fake news doesn't go, 'Oh, he wants to be their protector.' Well, I am. As president, I have to be your protector.' RFK Jr. says Trump promised him ‘control’ of public health agencies Trump has had trouble winning over female voters in his past two presidential campaigns, and polls have shown that he once again trails Harris, who has rapidly consolidated support among female voters since she replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket. Harris has made reproductive rights central to her campaign, blaming Trump for the end of Roe v. Wade and the restrictive abortion bans subsequently passed by states across the country. But Trump has led Harris among male voters, setting up a significant gender gap ahead of Election Day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-protector-of-women/	2024-10-31T11:09:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24300854967845-e1730204775938_77fa0f-e1730377793913.jpg?w=800
Jimmy Kimmel appeals to Republicans to reject Trump in 19-minute ...	(The Hill) - Comedian Jimmy Kimmel, who is known for criticizing Donald Trump, made an appeal to Republicans to reject the former president in his 19-minute opening monologue on Tuesday evening, one week before Election Day. 'Tonight’s monologue is for Republicans. So, if you have someone in your life who is either planning to vote for Trump or thinking about it, I would like you to send this to a Republican you love and respect with a request: Ask them to watch this whole thing as a personal favor to you. And I promise I won’t make you regret it, because it’s not going to be our usual roast of Trump or some kind of liberal virtual signaling, none of that,' Kimmel said. FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes 'We’re a week away from an election, and we are very divided, and not just because of Donald Trump, because of people like, if I’m being honest, me. I do a lot of mocking and belittling and it isn’t always productive,' the host of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' admitted. 'Am I biased against Donald Trump? Yes. Do I think I have good reasons for being biased against him? Yes.' In his monologue, Kimmel then went on to show clips of the former president, saying he believes some Republicans are so busy they might not really take in the 'words that come out of his mouth.' He included clips dating back to 2015 of Trump saying he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a new plan. The clips sifted through the years as no GOP alternative to ObamaCare ever emerged, going up through the recent presidential debate against Vice President Harris, when Trump said he has 'concepts of a plan' for health care in the country. Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, left, and former President Trump (Chris Pizzello, Associated Press; and Greg Nash) Kimmel then went on to talk about Trump’s baseless claims of transgender children undergoing sex change surgeries at school. 'Parents can’t send their kids to school with peanut butter, OK?' Kimmel said. 'This is a lie, you have to know this.' Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome The late night host then pointed out that most presidents and former presidents don't try to brand themselves for personal gain, though Trump has hawked everything from sneakers to Bibles to NFTs. 'Listen, politics, in a lot of ways, is like sports. You probably just root for the team your Dad roots for. Maybe you’ve been a Republican your whole life, that’s your team, and it feels wrong not to root for them, or to vote for them, but this time around, you wouldn’t be alone,' Kimmel said. He later added that he saw someone wearing a t-shirt that said they support Trump because Trump angers the same people who anger them. RFK Jr. says Trump promised him ‘control’ of public health agencies 'It’s funny, I get it. Sometimes it feels like no one has a sense of humor anymore. But is that really all we want for America? To piss each other off? I don’t want that, away,' Kimmel said. 'If you made it this far, thank you for listening, and whoever wins, once the votes are counted, if Trump has more of those votes, we are going to accept that, even if it doesn’t go our way. We won’t like it, but we’ll accept it, because that’s how it has to go.' 'We vote, we count the votes, winner wins, loser goes away. That’s the only way this country can work, and it’s up to you to do whatever you think is the right thing to do,' he concluded.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-monologue/	2024-10-31T11:08:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/jimmy-kimmell-trump-split_014298-e1730368827531.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. says Trump promised him 'control' of public health agenci...	(The Hill) - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Monday that former President Trump has promised him 'control' of public health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, should he win a second term next week, according to a video viewed by The Hill. 'The key that ... President Trump has promised me is — is control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH and a few others, and then also the USDA, which is ... key to making America healthy,' Kennedy said in the video. 'Because we’ve got to get off of seed oils, and we’ve got to get off of pesticide intensive agriculture.' FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes Kennedy suspended his own long-shot presidential campaign in August and endorsed Trump. During his endorsement, Kennedy pledged that if he were 'given the chance to fix the chronic disease crisis and reform our food production … within two years, we will watch chronic disease burden lift dramatically.' Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks as he endorses Republican presidential nominee former President Trump at a campaign rally at the Desert Diamond Arena, Aug. 23, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (Evan Vucci, Associated Press) Kennedy now serves on Trump’s transition team and has become a campaign surrogate. He has been telling voters that the 45th president will 'make America healthy again.' Kennedy, a longtime purveyor of anti-vaccine messaging who founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, has been speaking more insistently in recent months about children’s health and solving the problems of chronic childhood diseases. Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome The Democrat-turned-independent has been lobbying Trump for a role in his possible next administration. HHS oversees 13 separate agencies, and Kennedy has long argued they are in desperate need of reform. Trump has said he would put Kennedy on a panel that would investigate 'the decades-long increase in chronic health problems, including autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity, infertility and many more.' During a campaign rally in New York City on Sunday, Trump said he would let Kennedy 'go wild on food' and 'go wild on medicines' if he wins in November. RFK Jr. says Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies The Trump campaign did not deny that the former president promised Kennedy control. Trump has pledged Kennedy would have a role in his administration but has not been specific. 'No formal decisions about Cabinet and personnel have been made, however, President Trump has said he will work alongside passionate voices like RFK Jr. to Make America Healthy Again by providing families with safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic plaguing our children,' Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, said in a statement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-trump-public-health-agencies/	2024-10-31T11:03:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/RFK-HHS_090624_AP_Evan-Vucci_e93ed6-e1730368358641.jpg?w=900
Billionaires have business interests hinging on election outcome	Billionaires who have funneled tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 election or who have made key decisions affecting the race have a lot riding on the outcome. Two of the biggest names to get attention this fall are Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post. Also in the mix are Bill Gates, the former CEO of Microsoft who donated $50 million to a nonprofit that supports Vice President Harris, and Reid Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, who is also backing Harris. These titans of industries have major economic stakes in federal policy ranging from subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) to lucrative military contracts and antitrust actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice. Musk, who has endorsed former President Trump, has been a critic of the Biden-Harris administration’s tax credits for electric vehicles, which he says help his competitors more than Tesla. He said in July that a rollback of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which would be a top priority of a new Trump administration, might hurt Tesla 'slightly' but would be 'devastating for our competitors.' Joe Sacks, the executive director of the EV Politics Project, said Tesla is 'losing market share to companies that are subject to the $7,500 tax credit to cars that are being manufactured here in North America.' 'Tesla is not subject to the same tax credit and so there are certainly incentives there,' he added. 'That’s at play.' 'He stands to benefit from eliminating the kind of key EV provisions from the IRA,' he said. Sacks said Musk 'also has a role to play in getting the former president to stop EV bashing,' noting that Trump has softened his attacks on electric vehicles since Musk endorsed his candidacy. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk’s other major business venture, SpaceX, has more than $15 billion in contracts with the Department of Defense and NASA. The New York Times reported this month that Musk’s companies have been the targets of at least 20 government investigations or reviews related to issues ranging from consumer safety to environmental concerns. Trump hasn’t said what position Musk might have in his administration, but the South African-born entrepreneur is expected to wield a lot of influence if Trump returns to the Oval Office. Bezos has also come under scrutiny in recent days after it was widely reported that he decided to end The Washington Post’s tradition dating to 1976 of endorsing presidential candidates. Bezos explained in an essay published by the Post that such endorsements 'create a perception of bias' and 'non-independence.' 'Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one,' he said. The last-minute decision to kill the pending endorsement of Vice President Harris, however, sparked outrage and raised questions about whether Bezos’s financial interests weigh on a decision not to pick a fight with Trump given his strong chance of being reelected president. Dan Froomkin, a former Washington Post staffer wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review in 2022 that Bezos’s businesses interests posed a 'conflict of interest.' Amazon, the company Bezos founded and in which he retains a large financial interest, has a significant amount of business with the federal government and will likely be in the mix for major federal contracts in the future. Amazon Web Services was awarded a 10-year, $10 billion contract with the National Security Agency in 2021 and a contract with the Defense Department to work on its Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability in 2022. It was one of five companies, along with Google, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, to provide products and services to the Central Intelligence Agency over 15 years. And the Navy signed a blanket purchasing agreement worth $724 million with Amazon Web Services in 2022. Amazon once claimed that it had been blocked from government contracting because of Trump’s complaints about The Washington Post’s coverage of his administration. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy tried to establish a better relationship with Trump by reaching out to him in August, after he formally became the Republican Party’s nominee for president. Amazon and Amazon Web Services did not respond to a request for comment. Bezos also founded a space-exploration company, Blue Horizon, that has significant business interests that could be impacted by federal policymaking. It has a $3.4 billion contract with NASA to build a lunar lander, and advocates for the company sought a $10 billion funding provision for it in Endless Frontier Act in 2021. Senior officials with the company met with Trump briefly after he gave a speech in Austin, Texas, last week, soon after The Washington Post spiked its endorsement. Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and Harris supporter, meanwhile, sits on the board of another company with major financial interests in doing business with the federal government. Microsoft split a big cloud-computing contract from the Defense Department with several competitors including Amazon, Google and Oracle in 2022. Microsoft also faces an antitrust investigation from the FTC related to OpenAI, in which Microsoft is a major investor. Hoffman accused FTC Chair Lina Khan of 'waging war on American business' and said he wants Harris to replace her if elected. He has donated $7 million to help the Biden-Harris campaign and has organized a fundraising effort for Harris in Silicon Valley. Beyond that, Harris has voiced support for a billionaire minimum tax and raising the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. 'Nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations and I plan on making that fair,' Harris told '60 Minutes' earlier this month. But Harris hasn’t said whether she would support one of President Biden’s most controversial proposals — taxes on unrealized capital gains — which would inflict a big financial hit on the nation’s wealthiest individuals and families. 'The billionaires, what they know about Trump is he’ll lower taxes and he’ll deregulate. … He’ll shut down antitrust and they see that has a huge benefit,' said Bob Borosage, co-director of Campaign for America’s Future, a progressive advocacy group. 'They’ve got antitrust problems in Europe so they really want an American president who’s not going to go down that route,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/billionaires-have-business-interests-hinging-on-election-outcome/	2024-10-31T10:39:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Billionaires_103124_AP_Sean-Simmers-and-Evan-Agostini.png?w=900
He'll never know': 1 in 4 people lie about who they vote for	(NewsNation) — What happens in the voting booth stays in the voting booth, a new Harris campaign ad reminds women. Meanwhile, a new survey found that people lie to loved ones about who they vote for. Half of Gen Z voters and a quarter of U.S. voters have lied about their voting selections, a survey from The Harris Poll found. The Harris Poll, unaffiliated with the Kamala Harris campaign, is a global consulting and market research firm. According to that same poll, conducted in partnership with Axios, 33% responded saying political differences have created distance in their families. Texas Republicans and Democrats spar in ‘Billboard War’ The younger the voter, the more likely this statement is true, with experts saying younger Americans raised on smartphones are conflict-averse. The Harris campaign seized the opportunity with a controversial ad targeting women they believe will be afraid to vote differently than their significant others, reminding them that the choice for president is theirs alone. 'You still voting for him?' one man asks another in the ad. 'Hell yeah. What about your wife?' the other man responds. 'She doesn't like him, but she's voting for him.' Here’s why millions of Americans in Puerto Rico, other territories can’t vote for president 'Same with mine.' The women vote for a different candidate without their husbands knowing. The Lincoln Project, a self-described 'pro-democracy organization,' published the ad titled, 'Secret.' Democrats hope to capitalize on the female vote. 'Your vote is your secret,' the ad says. 'He'll never know.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/1-in-4-people-lie-vote-choice/	2024-10-31T10:36:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2172377704-e1729215616414.jpg?w=800
Musk shares election misinformation: Michigan official	(NewsNation) — Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says she's fighting misinformation being spread online by Elon Musk. 'I hope to debunk some of the agenda-driven misinformation that's out there by simply providing the data for everyone to see,' Benson told NewsNation's Markie Martin on 'Morning in America' on Thursday. Musk has frequently shared misleading and false claims about the 2024 election, going as far as to pick a fight with Benson. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night Social media feud over misinformation The two have had a series of exchanges on Musk's platform, X. Musk accused Michigan of having more registered voters than eligible citizens. Benson shot back clarifying federal laws and not to 'feed the trolls.' In response to all the misinformation, Benson and other Michigan officials have set up a website for people to fact-check all of the different conspiracy theories they might come across. 'Transparency is our front and so we are posting the data, the raw numbers, every day,' Benson said. 'People can see the actual numbers for themselves from the very data file that is at the forefront of our elections in our state.': Benson said she hopes that this information helps debunk some of the misinformation being spread. FBI warns of election-related fraud schemes Full confidence in election system The secretary of state said she has full confidence in the election system, saying it has time-tested security layers in place to ensure the integrity of the voting process. 'We really want everyone, no matter who you're voting for or where or how you choose to participate to have faith in the process and participate,' Benson said. So far, over two million Michigan citizens have voted in this year's election, and Benson said she is hopeful to see that number double, if not more.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/musk-election-misinformation-michigan-jocelyn-benson/	2024-10-31T09:58:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Musk.png?w=900
Harris appeals to voters in Arizona, Nevada	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will make stops Thursday in Arizona and Nevada, continuing her series of star-studded rallies and concerts with less than one week until Election Day. Election results could further splinter US: Luntz Harris and Walz will attend a rally featuring musical guest Los Tigres del Norte at 10 a.m. MT in Phoenix, Arizona. In the afternoon, the vice president will host a rally at 4:30 p.m. PT in Reno, Nevada, and close her day with a 9 p.m. PT rally and concert in Las Vegas. The event will feature a performance by the band Maná and remarks by Jennifer Lopez. The packed schedule reflects Harris' efforts to reach voters in key battleground areas. Arizona and Nevada are among the six 'toss-up' states that could make or break Harris' presidential bid in a race that could be won in the margins. Why Arizona matters Republicans have carried Arizona in 16 out of 17 presidential elections, but the state has slowly shifted toward the center. Arizona was called for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Decided by 10,000 votes, it was the slimmest margin in the country. About 60% of the state's population lives in Maricopa County, which generally decides the outcome in Arizona. Biden's margin in Maricopa during the 2020 election was 50.3% to 48.1%, according to DDHQ data. A raw vote lead of 45,000 was enough for Biden to overcome the Republican lead in the rest of the state and win 49.4% to 49.1%. As for early voter turnout, election officials say Republicans have an advantage of more than 89,000 ballots. Those numbers, however, only confirm which party voters are registered with — not how they voted. Here’s why millions of Americans in Puerto Rico, other territories can’t vote for president More than 1.6 million voters — about 28% of the electorate — have cast their ballots in Phoenix, Arizona. Trump has a 60% chance of winning the state, NewsNation’s partner Decision Desk HQ forecasts suggested Thursday morning. Supporters on both sides say they’re optimistic as current polling points to a close race. Election officials warn it could take them as many as two weeks to tabulate ballots as they adhere to new voting laws passed after the contested 2020 election. More than 130,000 volunteers have signed up to help with canvassing across the state, according to the Harris campaign. Why Nevada matters No Republican presidential candidate has won Nevada since George W. Bush's narrow 2004 victory. Historically, in every election that flipped the White House, the winning candidate also flipped at least one state. That's most likely to be Nevada in this election, DDHQ anticipates. Harris had a clear lead over Trump earlier this month, but a neck-and-neck race developed as the weeks went by. Both candidates had a 50% chance of winning Nevada as of Saturday. Trump now holds a slight lead at 51%, according to DDHQ. About 187,000 voters had cast early ballots in Nevada as of Wednesday, according to state election data. Republicans submitted most of those ballots, with a 43% early voter-turnout rate, compared to Democrats' 28%.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-appeals-to-voters-in-arizona-nevada/	2024-10-31T07:45:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
RFK Jr. says Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencie...	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Republican nominee Donald Trump asked him to reorganize federal health agencies like the Food and Drug Administration or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if he wins the 2024 presidential election. 'He's asked me to clean up the corruption number one,' Kennedy said during a town hall Wednesday with NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. 'Number two, end the conflicts of interest, return those agencies to their rich tradition of gold standard, empirically-based, evidence-based science, evidence-based medicine, and to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country.' Kennedy ran as an Independent in the election before dropping out and endorsing Trump. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Trump said Sunday at a rally that he would let Kennedy 'go wild' on issues related to food, medicine and health if elected to another term. The event, which took place at New York's Madison Square Garden, was widely criticized for racist and crude comments made by some speakers. Kennedy in the past has disseminated false information about health topics such as vaccines, and is known for spreading conspiracy theories as well. Because of this, NewsNation partner The Hill reports that medical experts have raised concerns about Kennedy’s potential influence in a future Trump administration. Noting that some people call Kennedy an 'extremist,' Cuomo asked him about those who say they are concerned about what the former presidential candidate would do when given the power of a government position. 'I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist,' Kennedy answered, though added that he's written 'five best-selling books on public health' and, as a lawyer, 'litigated on health issues for 40 years.' What his job would be in the Trump administration, Kennedy said, is to address corruption, not impose his personal beliefs on the American people. 'I've sued almost all of these agencies. I've sued FDA, CDC, NIH, FCC, USDA, almost all these agencies,' Kennedy said. 'When you litigate against these agencies, you get a PhD in in in corporate capture and how to unravel it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rfk-jr-health-agencies/	2024-10-31T07:42:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/RFK_041024_Photo_Getty-e1719968339331.png?w=800
Trump takes his campaign out west	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump is heading to New Mexico and Nevada on Thursday to secure support out west before the last weekend of the 2024 election. Trump will also make a stop in Arizona on Thursday for a live interview with Tucker Carlson. The proceeds from the event will be donated to relief efforts for those impacted by Hurricane Milton and Helene. The latest poll by The Hill/Decision Desk HQ shows that Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris by less than two points in Nevada but is trailing the vice president by 8.3 percent in New Mexico. While New Mexico is not considered a swing state, Trump is heading to Albuquerque in a last effort to win over voters. Republicans have won in the state only once over the last eight presidential elections. Election results could further splinter US: Luntz Dead-even presidential race As of Thursday morning, the race between Trump and Harris remained a toss-up with Harris leading Trump nationally by just 0.6%, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling. The polling average is based on 312 national polls. In New Mexico, the former president is expected to address the border crisis during his rally, blaming Harris for her part in the Biden administration policies that Trump's campaign said 'wreaked havoc' on the state's residents. He is also expected to address inflation in the state and the unaffordable cost of living. According to New Mexico's inflation update, as of September, the average household is paying more than $1,000 more on basic essentials and reeling with a 22.1% inflation rate compared to prices in January 2021. In Nevada, Trump is expected to discuss housing costs and the economy, promoting Harris' 'failed economic agenda.' He is also expected to vow to make housing more affordable, especially in Nevada where it is short by over 78,000 affordable renting units and inflation has left residents unable to afford the cost of living. Mark Cuban, Dana White butt heads about inflation at town hall Trump's garbage truck ride On Wednesday, Trump stumped in North Carolina and Wisconsin, to shore up voters in the two swing states. It was in Wisconsin that Trump climbed into a Trump-themed garbage truck in his motorcade to draw attention to comments from President Joe Biden where he seemingly called Trump supporters 'garbage.' 'How do you like my garbage truck? This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,' Trump said from the passenger seat of the truck, which was adorned with a Trump campaign sticker and Trump flag. Trump campaign staff widely shared photos of the truck and the former president in the passenger seat as photographers snapped pictures. The campaign has tried to capitalize on outrage among Trump supporters over Biden’s remark, even as Vice President Harris has distanced herself from the comment. 'First of all, he clarified his comments but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,' Harris told reporters earlier Wednesday. Biden sparked backlash Tuesday night when he appeared to compare Trump’s supporters to garbage while commenting on a racist joke a comedian made at a Trump rally days earlier likening Puerto Rico to an 'island of garbage.' The White House, in a statement, argued that the president was being misinterpreted and had been referring to the rhetoric at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally Sunday as 'garbage,' not the Republican’s supporters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-campaign-west-nevada-new-mexico/	2024-10-31T04:38:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24304843561867.jpg?w=900
Sarah Palin supports Trump's stance on abortion	(NewsNation) — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she '100%' supports Trump's stance on abortion because he's not 'forcing anyone's opportunity to end a pregnancy.' During NewsNation's town hall on Wednesday, panelists discussed women's reproductive rights ahead of the 2024 election. Palin said she's supportive of the former president making abortions 'a states issue via the court.' Town Hall: Cuban and White disagree on who will deliver for economy 'He (Trump) is supportive of the Supreme Court deciding Roe v. Wade, which should have been reversed a long time ago, to allow the state to have the people vote on it,' Palin said. Stephen A. Smith challenged Palin to consider that 'federal rights are being stripped.' Smith referenced Michelle Obama's recent speech at a rally in Michigan, where she said women’s lives would be at risk if Donald Trump returned to the White House. The former first lady described dangerous limitations on healthcare for women. Palin responded by saying she believed Obama was 'trying to paint a picture of women not having as many rights as men. .. America is a land of equal opportunity.' American divide split between progressive values, tradition: O’Reilly Sarah Palin: Gender impacts election polling Palin also discussed how gender impacts polling ahead of the election. Polls show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are currently neck and neck. 'I personally don't feel that gender is a big darn deal in this race,' Palin said. However, she does have an issue when men are arguing about abortion. Harris widens advantage over Trump among women in new survey 'When men talk about a woman's feelings and what they go through to make the decision, I say, you guys, you don't know, you haven't been there,' Palin said. 'That's when gender does become an issue.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/sarah-palin-donald-trump-abortion/	2024-10-30T19:29:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/430DF437394ADDE337592B2607C5A85C.jpg?w=900
Mark Cuban: High inflation 'started with Donald Trump'	(NewsNation) — Mark Cuban, a major backer of Vice President Kamala Harris, sparred with Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO and noted Donald Trump supporter Dana White on NewsNation's preelection town hall Wednesday. The two businessman bickered over their candidates' impact on the economy and America's current inflation rate, with White saying Harris has 'done nothing' during her tenure and Cuban advocating for Harris' future plans. American divide split between progressive values, tradition: O’Reilly Cuban said he 'can’t deny that there’s inflation,' but there are more nuanced concerns at hand, including the cost of health care. Referencing Trump’s 'concept of a plan' about replacing Medicare, Cuban pointed to Harris’ proposed medical changes. 'Under Trump … the inflation rate will only continue at the same rate or go up, which means you’re going to keep on going backwards if anybody in your family gets sick at all,' Cuban said. Mark Cuban: Harris inherited economic problems The former 'Shark Tank' investor also pointed out that the Biden-Harris administration inherited their economic problems from Trump. 'I'll tell you exactly when the very first kernel of inflation was set, and that was in April of 2020. It was right at the early days of the pandemic,' Cuban said, going on to explain that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump chose 'his oil company cronies' over keeping gas prices low. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters 'You can take all you want and blame it on the Biden administration, but it started with Donald Trump,' Cuban said, later admonishing the businessman's tariffs and their impact on the Obama economy he inherited. 2020 saw the lowest inflation rate in years at 1.4%, followed by a massive spike in 2021, when rates hit 7%. Inflation peaked at a four-decade high of 9% in the summer of 2022, under Biden and Harris. It has since dwindled back down to 2.4% in 2024, according to US Inflation Calculator. Dana White: Trump 'proven' on strong economy White pushed the blame back to Biden, honing in on what he sees as Harris' pitfalls compared to the GOP nominee. 'Trump has already proven he can build a strong economy, he can secure the borders, and he is somebody that allies and adversaries respect. Those are all very important things. What has she proven?' White asked. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night During his presidency, federal debt held by the public rose from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion, influenced by Trump’s tax cuts, particularly his slashes to the corporate tax rate, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center’s FactCheck project. While White didn't directly address the economy or Trump's impact on inflation, he doubled down on his criticism of Harris, saying: 'She is the sitting vice president of the United States right now. She's proven nothing. She's done nothing. I think she's in over her head. She knows she's in over her head.' 'Nobody voted her there. Nobody voted Kamala Harris. If she went up against other Democrats, she would not be in the position she's in right now,' White added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/mark-cuban-dana-white-inflation-economy/	2024-10-30T18:30:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/AP24064765648905-e1709644840419.jpg?w=900
American divide split between progressive values, tradition: O'Re...	(NewsNation) — As former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris head into the final stretch of a neck-and-neck presidential election, a recent poll shows that the vast majority of Americans believe the country is more divided than united. An Ipsos Poll, conducted on behalf of the 'With Honor' organization, shows that 81% of U.S. residents believe the country is more divided and that 69% believe most Americans want the same things. Bill O’Reilly: Trump’s ‘dunderhead’ staff should’ve vetted comedian 'I think everybody wants a nice life and a pursuit of happiness and opportunity,' Bill O’Reilly said during a televised town hall on Wednesday night. O’Reilly said the nation finds itself the most divided it has been in history only behind the Civil War. Yet, while the nation is split in its support of Trump and Harris, O’Reilly said that instead, the battle is over the progressive values that Harris promotes and the tradition trumpeted by the former president. 'That’s what people are going to vote on,' O’Reilly said. Bill O’Reilly: 'People know what they’re paying' The bigger priority, O’Reilly said, is the economy – an issue that he said will force Harris to enter Election Day facing a deficit because of the cost Americans are paying for basic necessities compared to four years ago when President Joe Biden took office, he added. 'People know what they’re paying – and they don’t like it,' O’Reilly said. 'That’s going to work against Harris.' Driving the Vote: California sees growing number of Asian Republicans Stephen A. Smith: Roe v. Wade could 'bite' Trump However, Stephen A. Smith, the former ESPN personality who has delved more into politics, said during the NewsNation town hall that he believes reproductive rights will play a huge factor in Tuesday’s election. With women representing 53% of the electorate, the overturning of Roe v. Wade is something, Smith said, that 'potentially could comeback back to bite Donald Trump.' Bill O’Reilly: Cuomo made ‘big mistake’ while questioning Vance But Smith said there is also a 'white issue' with white voters making up 57.4% of the population – the lowest it has been in recent history, Smith said. That, Smith added, could potentially be a deciding factor in how a certain population of Americans vote in Tuesday's election. 'When you have a former president that was speaking about immigration, closing the borders, not letting people in illegally, and eluding – if not flat-out saying – that to some degree, they are costing you, you have to remember that you once considered that you’re a very powerful entity,' Smith said. 'And you believe that power is dissipating before your very eyes and somebody comes along, and they are literally transfixing your attention on that as the issue and that is the reason why, it not only builds fear, it builds grievance, When people go to the polls, the first thing that serves as a motivational factor is grievance.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/bill-oreilly-politics-progressive-values-tradition/	2024-10-30T18:17:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180700408.jpg?w=900
Who is Dana White, UFC CEO and Donald Trump supporter?	(NewsNation) — Dana White may be best known among UFC fans, but the face of the popular mixed martial arts brand has climbed the ranks of those promoting Donald Trump as their choice to win the White House in next week’s election against Vice President Kamala Harris. White’s relationship with Trump dates back 25 years to his early ties with UFC. His support for the former president has put him front and center at campaign rallies as Trump and Harris remain nearly deadlocked in the presidential race with just days remaining. Schwarzenegger endorses Harris: Trump would only make us ‘angrier, more divided’ As White has become more publicly connected to the political arena, who is he, and why has the former amateur boxer turned mixed martial arts executive become so politically active? Dana White is the UFC president and CEO White, 55, acquired a minority stake in UFC in 2002 after breaking into the fight game near Boston, where he was boxing, training and managing fighters. However, after he said he was threatened by men who claimed White owed them $2,500, he abruptly left the East Coast for Las Vegas, according to Forbes. White began training MMA fighters in Las Vegas, including some who were featured in UFC events. He told Forbes he began attending UFC events. 'I ended up finding that out, that they're in trouble and they're probably going to go out of business,' White told Forbes. 'And I'd been to a (UFC) event, and I was looking around and thinking, 'Imagine if they did this, and imagine if they did that. This thing could actually be really big.'' Serving as the president of Zuffa LLC, White became part of a group that acquired UFC when it was on the verge of bankruptcy and began sanctioning fights out of Las Vegas. More than two decades later, Forbes valued UFC at $11.3 billion, the highest combat sports promotion in the county, well ahead of World Westling Entertainment, which was valued at $6.8 billion by Forbes earlier this year. Dana White is a staunch Donald Trump supporter Long before Trump first sought the presidency in 2016, he helped to get White’s UFC brand off the ground. Due to the brutality of the sport, many critics — including late U.S. Sen. John McCain — helped get UFC events banned from cable television. McCain referred to MMA as 'human cockfighting' and was among those hoping to have events banished. Kamala, Trump both in North Carolina for final pitches to voters However, after the sport was legalized in New Jersey, Trump allowed UFC fights to be held at Trump-owned properties. Former President Donald Trump, right, talks to Dana White while attending the UFC 302 mixed martial arts event Saturday, June 1, 2024, in Newark, N.J. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) 'Nobody took us serious then, except Donald Trump,' White said in a 2018 interview. 'I would never say anything negative about Donald Trump because he was there when other people weren’t.' White is now the one supporting Trump and promoting his brand, beginning in 2016 when the UFC executive spoke at the Republican National Convention when Trump was named the Republican nominee for president. 'I know fighters,' White said in his speech. 'Donald Trump is a fighter, and I know he will fight for this country.' White rallied for Trump again in 2020 and called the then-president’s reelection 'critically important,' according to the BBC. White introduced Trump at this year’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and has since been featured at several high-profile campaign events, including a recent rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Outside of his support for Trump, White maintains that he attempts to stay out of the political spotlight, he told Yahoo Sports. He said that when he does appear on political programming, he is trying to appeal to everyone — not just conservatives. 'I don't care what side you're on. We're all Americans,' White said in the interview. 'We all want the same things. We want to make a good living. We want to get a house, we want a car. We want to feel safe in our hometown and definitely in our houses, and we want to take care of our families. No matter what walk of life you’re from, what you want, we all want the same things.' However, in appearing in support of Trump, White has become more partisan in his commentary. 'The stakes have never been higher, and the choice has never been clearer,' White said at the New York City rally. Donald Trump has appeared at many UFC events Since attending many of the UFC fight cards that took place at his properties, Trump has become a prominent figure at several of White’s events. That includes one in New Jersey just days after Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in his high-profile hush money trial. At the event, Trump was ushered to his seat to blaring music and fanfare, escorted by White.

Trump has spent less time campaigning in early-voting states than many of his Republican primary rivals. But his campaign has been bolstering his schedule with appearances at major sporting events, including this weekend’s Edwards vs. Covington UFC fight in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) White said that his friendship with Trump dates back two decades and took shape just because of their common love of combat sports and fighting. 'This guy is a fight fan,' White said, according to NJ.com. 'He’s been a fight fan.' Judge extends early voting option in a suburban Philadelphia county after Trump’s campaign sued According to White, he would treat any American president with the same attention at his events as he does for the Republican candidate for president. 'If (Joe) Biden came to a UFC event, I would treat Biden the same way,' White told Yahoo Sports. 'I probably wouldn't walk, but if Biden was there, we would cover the fact that the president of the United States — or if (Barack) Obama or (George) Bush or any of those guys ever came to an event — we would treat them with the same respect.' Donald Trump was shocked at UFC’s merger with WWE After White helped to broker a merger this year between UFC and WWE, Trump expressed surprise after White once bristled at the two combat sports companies coming together in 2016. But after the deal was finalized in 2023, creating TKO Holdings, which is valued at $21.4 billion, Trump credited White for making it happen, 'He is the greatest guy,' Trump said of White on the 'Joe Rogan Experience.' 'You know, I always say, everybody, nobody is indispensable, you know. Everybody can be replaced. Maybe you can’t be. You might not be. But Dana White truly, I don’t think, you know, the things he sold for $4 billion. I said, ‘What the hell! Who the hell is gonna pay $4 billion?’ And they made like a great deal. I mean, because of him.

Who is Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty?	(NewsNation) — Moms for Liberty is a 'parental rights' nonprofit that reported $2.1 million in total revenue in 2022. Since its founding in 2021, Moms for Liberty has amassed vigorous support from some conservatives who support its efforts to target references to race and LGBTQ+ identity in schools across the country. At the same time, the group has generated forceful backlash from grassroots groups and anti-hate organizations who argue its activism stirs extremist ideas and harms minority and LGBTQ+ students. Their stated mission according to the Mom’s for Liberty website reads: 'Moms for Liberty is dedicated to fighting for the survival of America by unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.'

How did town halls become a staple of American politics?	(NewsNation) — The 2024 election is just days away, and on Wednesday night, voters will have an opportunity to have their voices heard during a town hall with NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. The preelection town hall is on Wednesday, Oct. 30, at 8 p.m. ET and will feature guests from across the political spectrum. Bill O'Reilly, Stephen A. Smith, Mark Cuban, former candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others will talk with voters about the main issues heading into the 2024 election. To find out how to watch NewsNation, visit JoinNN.com. Last week, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance took questions from Michigan voters during a separate NewsNation town hall. Republicans, Democrats and independents asked about a range of issues, including border security, housing costs and political polarization. Unlike a campaign rally or a moderated debate, town halls allow everyday Americans to engage with candidates directly. The entire event is meant to feel less scripted and informal. Here's how town halls became a staple of American politics. How to watch NewsNation Oct. 30 town hall with Bill O’Reilly and more When did town halls begin? The very first town hall in the United States was established in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1633, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Back then, it was a physical place where townspeople held meetings and gathered to make decisions. The meeting format soon spread throughout New England and gave locals a way to have their say in local affairs and decide on important issues. Over time, the community forum became distinct from the structure, evolving into a core feature of American democracy. Nowadays, town hall meetings often refer to any forum where community participation is allowed on a given topic. These meetings can be held in a variety of venues like churches, schools and libraries. Town halls are not just a way for community members to convene with each other — they're also a format for local and national politicians to talk with constituents or even debate with their opponents. American lawmakers held 23,000 town hall meetings over eight years from Aug. 2013 to Dec. 2021, according to research by the Center for Effective Lawmaking. The study found that representatives and senators who engage with town halls can enhance their lawmaking effectiveness in Congress. JD Vance town hall: Here's the transcript When did town halls become part of presidential politics? Though the meeting format has been around for hundreds of years — when it comes to presidents — town halls are a relatively modern development. In the past, presidential hopefuls didn't participate in town halls; in fact, back in George Washington's day, they didn't even campaign for votes. 'On-the-sly politicking and newspaper editorials were expected to do the campaign work for them — no debates needed,' Smithsonian Magazine said. Quite a bit later, in March 1977, then-President Jimmy Carter conducted a town hall, and in doing so, 'innovated a new form of presidential communication,' media professor David Michael Ryfe wrote. Trump asks Vance in town hall: ‘How brilliant is Donald J. Trump?’ Before that, 'no sitting president had ever engaged in a televised forum so spontaneous, informal and intimate,' Ryfe wrote. Fifteen years later, in 1992, Bill Clinton took the format to the next level when he hosted televised town halls and answered questions from a studio audience while on the campaign trail. That same year, 1992, saw the first 'town hall-style' presidential debate between Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot. What's the difference between a regular debate and town hall debate? Since the inaugural town hall debate in 1992, the format has become a regular part of the presidential debate schedule. 'The principle difference between a regular debate and a town hall debate is that instead of questions from a panel of journalists, questions come from 'real people,' specifically undecided voters,' professor Jonathan Beecher Field wrote in 'Town Hall Meetings and the Death of Deliberation.' Town hall debates have produced some memorable moments over the years because personal character tends to take center stage rather than policy. 'Instead of simply asking about a candidate’s policies or legislation they want to enact, questions are more likely to touch on understanding why the candidates hold certain beliefs,' authors noted in a Columbia Journalism Review article. Clinton scored points over Perot and Bush in 1992 when he adeptly answered a question about how the national debt had affected him personally. The former president walked toward the woman and spoke directly to her, coming off personable and concerned. This year's presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, did not have a town-hall style debate, instead opting for a single moderated debate without an audience. However, both candidates have held separate televised town halls.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/town-halls-staple-american-politics/	2024-10-30T16:30:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-576822696.jpg?w=900
Who is Mark Cuban, the billionaire backing Kamala Harris?	(NewsNation) — Entrepreneur Mark Cuban has made headlines this election cycle over his disdain for Elon Musk and support of Vice President Kamala Harris. Whether the billionaire is on the campaign trail with Harris or making cable news appearances to back her, Cuban's involvement in the election cycle has been notable. Who is Mark Cuban? Cuban is a businessman and television personality known for ABC's 'Shark Tank,' the show where aspiring entrepreneurs pitched their ideas to a panel of industry titans. The former principal and minority owner of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, Cuban's business ventures include founding IT corporation MicroSolutions and video portal Broadcast.com, which he sold for major profits. Schwarzenegger endorses Harris: Trump would only make us ‘angrier, more divided’ His investments are varied — with some coming from his time as a 'shark' on TV — and have banked him a whopping $5.7 billion net worth, according to Forbes. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native is also an author of one book, 'How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It.' Mark Cuban backs Kamala Harris Cuban backed President Joe Biden prior to his exit from the 2024 presidential race, specifically defending his handling of the economy. He has since tweeted in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris multiple times, emerging as one of her most visible surrogates on the campaign trail. Cuban told The Hill Harris has been 'very transparent' about being open-minded, suggesting 'she will listen to Republicans, independents like me and others.' 'She doesn’t base who she speaks to on loyalty,' he said. 'She looks for diverse feedback before making a pragmatic decision.' What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night The 66-year-old is an outspoken critic of the Biden administration’s aggressive approach to antitrust and cryptocurrency, two issues with which Democratic donors and some moderates who could be persuaded to choose Harris may still have concerns. Despite these concerns, Cuban — alongside other billionaires, like avid Donald Trump supporter Elon Musk — has gone all in on this election cycle. Another billionaire, fellow 'Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary told NewsNation, 'I really don’t show for politicians, I show for politics.'

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) Mark Cuban outspoken against Elon Musk In September, Cuban said X, the former Twitter, is 'only as free as Elon [Musk] wants it to be,' adding that the Tesla owner is the 'ultimate arbiter of everything on here.' It’s not the first time Cuban has called Musk out for his approach to running X. During an interview with 'The Daily Show' in August, he accused the South African entrepreneur of tailoring the platform to his own preferences via algorithm design. Cuban has also spoken about AI and social media’s influence on the upcoming election, arguing that the current election cycle is being 'driven' by artificial intelligence and algorithms. Trump on rally speaker’s Puerto Rico comments: ‘I can’t imagine it’s a big deal’ 'This seems to be to be a race where everyone’s frame of reference is influenced more by the narratives delivered by the algorithms we consume than the actual events themselves,' Cuban wrote Monday in a post on X. 'Those algorithms evolve as new information, accurate or not, are posted. So none of us really have any idea how any event or reality will impact the Presidential and other important races this cycle.' Mark Cuban joins NewsNation town hall NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo will host a preelection town hall Wednesday, giving voters a chance to have their say just days before the election. Cuomo, along with guests Bill O’Reilly and Stephen A. Smith, will lead the conversation. Special guests include Cuban, Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice; Dana White, the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship; and former candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now works with the Trump transition team. NewsNation Senior Correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera will join the town hall as well, along with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a Republican, and Democratic Congressmen Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Jared Moskowitz.

Judge extends early voting option in a suburban Philadelphia coun...	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Donald Trump's campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disenfranchised by an unprepared election office. Judge Jeffrey Trauger said in a one-page order that Bucks County voters who want to apply for an early mail ballot now have until Friday. The Trump campaign's lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday morning, comes amid a flurry of litigation and complaints over voting in a battleground state that is expected to play a central role in helping select the next president in 2024's election. The lawsuit sought a one-day extension, through Wednesday at 5 p.m., for voters to apply in-person for a mail-in ballot. The judge's order permits applications through the close of business on Friday. A message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Bucks County government. Neighboring Lehigh County on Tuesday asked a judge to extend the deadline there by one day, through Wednesday, because road closures in downtown Allentown around Trump's rally blocked access to the elections office. The judge agreed. In Bucks County, the Trump campaign lawsuit said people who were in line by Tuesday's 5 p.m. deadline to apply in-person for a mail ballot should have been allowed to get a ballot, even after the deadline. However, Bucks County's election office denied voters that right and ordered them to leave, the lawsuit said. 'This is a direct violation of Pennsylvanians’ rights to cast their ballot — and all voters have a right to STAY in line,' the Trump campaign said in a statement. The Republican National Committee and the campaign of Republican Senate nominee David McCormick joined the lawsuit against Bucks County, where Democrats control the government in a closely politically divided county often seen as a political bellwether. Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration had urged counties to allow every voter who was in line by the 5 p.m. deadline to submit a mail-in ballot application. Responding to criticism and misinformation on social media Tuesday, Bucks County had said every voter in line by 5 p.m. Tuesday would be allowed to apply for a mail ballot. Bucks County officials did not immediately comment Wednesday. Pennsylvania does not allow early voting on voting machines in polling places, as some states do. But Bucks County, like other counties in Pennsylvania, allows voters to apply for a mail-in ballot in-person at the elections office and receive it there, a time-consuming process strained to the limit by Trump's exhortations to his supporters to get out and vote before Tuesday's deadline. Voters can also fill it out and hand it in at the office. Voters waited up to three hours on Tuesday. Those still in line at 5 p.m. were told to go home, the lawsuit said. In neighboring Lehigh County, a steady stream of voters took advantage of the one-day extension Wednesday, descending to the basement office of the voter registration office in Allentown to apply for a mail-in ballot, fill it out and turn it in. County elections workers explained the process as voters stepped off the elevator into a crowded hallway. 'There are wonderful reps here who are telling everybody what to do, how to do it. It’s moving smoothly. I’m excited to be here,' Jeanne Birosik, a Republican voter, said as she waited for elections workers to prepare her mail ballot. Birosik typically votes on Election Day, but in 2020, she said, she showed up to her polling place and was incorrectly told she’d already voted. She filled out a provisional ballot that time, but didn’t want to leave anything to chance for this election. 'This just seemed like a safer way to go about it,' she said. Her husband, Chris Birosik, 62, who was also there to vote, said they didn’t consider dropping their ballots in the mail weeks ago — too risky, in his view. 'I just feel more confident that we get it in and do it this way,' he said. The early voting angst in Bucks County is the latest dustup over voting in Pennsylvania, which has the largest trove of electoral votes of any battleground state and is by far the state most visited by the Democratic and Republican presidential tickets this year. The runup to Election Day in the state has been marked by numerous battles over mail ballots, some landing on the doorstep of the U.S. Supreme Court.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/philadelphia-early-voting-trump-lawsuit/	2024-10-30T13:04:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24303827563284.jpg?w=900
Trump vows to seize money from migrant gangs, cartels	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump vowed to seize money and assets from criminal migrant gangs and the cartels, saying he would give it to the victims of crimes committed by people in the U.S. illegally. 'We're going to get them out fast. We're going to get them out,' Trump said. 'I'm announcing that for the first time under my administration, we are seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartelsand we will use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime, and the government will help in the restoration.' The former president announced his plan as the cartels continued to get richer. Tren de Aragua’s footprint increasing in the US 'Something had to be done,' Trump said. Cartels: A $13 billion industry The deputy director of ICE testified to Congress that back in 2018, the criminal cartels were making roughly $500 million annually. The primary funding source was moving drugs illegally into the U.S. Now, as they smuggle drugs and people, the cartels are reportedly a $13 billion industry annually, according to Congress. That is a 2,500 percent increase from 2018. Every person who is smuggled has to pay a fee to the cartels, and because of President Joe Biden's executive action, it is tougher to get people into the country. Because of this, the cartel makes sure every single person pays. Groups coming across in the Eagle Pass area right are being found with color-coordinated bracelets for the first time in this sector. It's something the border has only historically seen in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Law enforcement believes the cartels are using the bracelets to identify people who have paid. No bracelet means no crossing. Alabama governor deploys over 100 soldiers to southern border Most migrants reportedly pay about $3,000 to $5,000 to the cartels for help in crossing the border. Some undocumented migrants from special interest countries have reportedly paid upwards of $15,000. What happens to seized funds, assets? The DEA claims the cartels are present in all 50 states and are not flying under the radar. When cartels are caught, any funds seized are deposited into the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, an account with the Department of Treasury. The Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture administers the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which was established in 1992, according to a 2023 report from the Treasury Department. Money deposited into this fund is used for several initiatives, including to pay state and local law enforcement agencies that helped seize the funds, compensate victims where the seized assets represent the proceeds of fraud schemes and cover the operating costs of maintaining the fund, according to the report. In 2023, over $800 million was in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Last year, CBP seized more than $53 million in undeclared or illicit currency, which can be proceeds from alleged illicit activity or currency that funds transnational criminal organizations, federal data showed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/trump-seize-money-migrant-gangs-cartels/	2024-10-30T08:36:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181215235.jpg?w=900

Her comments come one day after President Joe Biden called former President Donald Trump’s supporters 'garbage.' 'I believe the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not,' Harris told reporters before reporters before heading to North Carolina for a campaign event. 'And as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. That’s my responsibility and that’s the kind of work that I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously.' The back-and-forth name-calling began during a weekend Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, where a comedian and guest speaker called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden responded Tuesday saying: 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.' He later clarified the statement on social media. 'Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,' Biden said. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.' This story is developing.

Harris to visit three battleground states where Trump has slight ...	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is campaigning Wednesday in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — key states where Trump maintains a narrow lead with less than a week left until Election Day. Latest poll numbers have the candidates nearly deadlocked in Pennsylvania, where Harris’ ground campaign has been highly organized, well-funded and thorough. A Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) national forecast Wednesday morning predicts that former President Donald Trump has a 54% chance of winning. Harris makes closing argument to voters on National Mall Harris on the campaign trail She’ll begin her day in North Carolina before heading to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and ending her day in Wisconsin. All three are strategic swing states and Pennsylvania is the most crucial for both campaigns. Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes — the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican presidential candidate by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Wednesday marks the vice president’s first trip to Harrisburg. So far, she’s spent much time in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the state and visited Philadelphia earlier this week. How is Harris performing in key swing states? Trump maintained a slight lead over Harris Tuesday in Pennsylvania. That’s according to the latest forecasts from NewsNation’s partners Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and The Hill, which predict Trump has a 52% chance of winning in the Keystone State.

(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris head to North Carolina Wednesday to share their final arguments with voters in the Tar Heel State during dueling rallies ahead of the 2024 election. Trump is expected to spotlight the nation's economy and housing crisis while Harris is anticipated to encourage residents to vote early and keep the enthusiasm surrounding her campaign electric. As of Monday morning, the race between Trump and Harris remained a toss-up with the former president leading Harris by just 1.4 points, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling. Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris: How policies compare Democrats have a chance to flip the Republican-leaning state blue even though North Carolina has voted red in 10 of the last 11 races. Former President Barack Obama won the Tar Heel State in 2008 and was the first Democrat to do so in nearly three decades. Dead-even presidential race in NC A dead-heat race and an opportunity for Democrats is leading to dueling rallies on Wednesday as Harris is also expected to stump in North Carolina. The two rallies are scheduled at roughly the same time, just located about an hour from each other. The Harris campaign said it believes it has the enthusiasm on its side, while Trump's team said it's looking to cut through that and solidify Trump's lead in the battleground state. North Carolina is one of seven swing states that could sway this year's election. It's another state that has seen another record turnout from early voting. Preliminary data reveals about 3.2 million people in the state have already voted, which is over one-third of the state's registered voters. 475 ballots retrieved from burned drop box in Washington state: Auditor Helene influencing election turnout A new survey found that Hurricane Helene is also playing a role for some voters as they head to the ballot box. The survey released this week by Elon University found that Helene galvanized them, and many voters were motivated to get out to polling sites in part by the federal response to the state's widespread damage. Trump and some Republicans have looked to sow frustration with the response, falsely claiming that nobody from the federal government was helping residents after the storm. FEMA and the White House pushed back on those comments, reassuring there were boots on the ground helping those affected by Helene. Still, the poll found that 20% of voters said they were more likely to vote because of Helene.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-rallies-north-carolina/	2024-10-30T04:47:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6712f380747eb4.31583800.jpeg?w=900

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden took a swipe against Donald Trump's supporters on Tuesday as he reacted to the Republican presidential nominee's weekend rally at Madison Square Garden, which was overshadowed by crude and racist rhetoric. In a call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino, Biden responded to a comic at Trump's rally who called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden's initial comments were garbled. 'Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something, I don’t, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know, the Puerto Rico where I’m fr -- in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent honorable people,' he said. The president then added: 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.' White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden 'referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’' Biden then took to social media to personally clarify what he said. 'Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,' he posted on X. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.' In referring to Trump's supporters as 'garbage,' however, Biden's tone was at odds with the message that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is seeking to present as she aims to cast a broad appeal, including to disaffected Republicans. Shortly after Biden's comments, Harris spoke from the Ellipse in Washington, vowing to be a president who would unite the country. 'I pledge to be a president for all Americans,' said Harris, who is Biden's vice president. Republicans quickly highlighted Biden's remark. Trump called up Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during his rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to recount what happened. 'Moments ago Joe Biden stated that our supporters, our patriots, are garbage,' Rubio said. 'He’s talking about everyday Americans who love their country.' Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a subsequent statement, 'There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him.' A Trump campaign fundraising text declared, 'KAMALA’S BOSS JOE BIDEN JUST CALLED ALL MY SUPPORTERS GARBAGE!' before ensuring recipients that Trump himself thinks, 'YOU ARE AMAZING!' Even some prominent Democrats began distancing themselves from Biden's comments. Speaking on CNN, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he would 'never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn't support.' The comments recalled then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton dismissing Trump supporters during a 2016 fundraiser in New York by saying that half would fit into a ' basket of deplorables.' Clinton later called that characterization 'grossly generalistic.' But it became a defiant rallying cry for many Trump backers who said the insult encapsulated the elitist attitudes of Clinton and the Democrats. As reactions to Biden's reaction began to fly, meanwhile, Trump was asked in an interview Tuesday night with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity about the racist and vulgar joke at his New York rally. He responded: 'Somebody said there was a comedian that joked about Puerto Rico or something. And I have no idea who he is.' The former president added, 'I can’t imagine it’s a big deal.' At a rally Tuesday in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a city with a large Hispanic population, Trump repeated his claim that Biden's immigration policies have allowed other countries to treat the U.S. like 'a giant garbage can.' With Election Day now just a week off, Biden has worked to maintain relevance, furiously promoting his administration’s accomplishments while Harris in her race against Trump. But his efforts to remain in the political spotlight might not always be so helpful for the top of the Democratic ticket he’s now promoting. That’s because, while Harris has been sharply critical of Trump for months, repeatedly calling him 'unstable' and 'unhinged' and even suggesting that he was ' fascist,' she has been careful not to decry his supporters. In fact, the vice president has campaigned extensively with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and other former GOP elected officials — hoping to woo conservative crossover voters. The Democratic convention — and Harris ads — have highlighted the stories of everyday Americans who talked about having voted for Trump in the past but now say they are supporting the vice president. On Tuesday’s call, Biden also said that Trump 'doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community' and urged rejection of the former president even as Trump’s campaign says its support is rising among Hispanics, particularly men. 'Vote to keep Donald Trump out of the White House,' Biden said. 'He’s a true danger to, not just Latinos but to all people. Particularly those who are in a minority in this country.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-biden-suggests-trump-supporters-are-garbage-after-comics-insult-of-puerto-rico/	2024-10-29T20:04:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6721a07f63ff80.82837425.jpeg?w=900
North Carolina on Election Day: What to expect	(NewsNation) — Donald Trump has won North Carolina in each of the last two elections, but Democrats have been gaining ground, particularly in the major population centers: Mecklenburg and Wake counties. If Harris can improve in those areas, Democrats have a chance to win the state for the first time since Barack Obama in 2008. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout How votes will be counted In North Carolina, the polls close at 7:30 p.m. Counties can start processing mail-in ballots at 5:00 p.m., while some counties with passed measures can begin processing mail-in ballots at 2:00 p.m. on Election Day. While the North Carolina Board of Elections allows for same-day voter registration for early voting — which runs through November 2 — the state does not allow residents to register to vote if they are casting ballots on the day of the general election. To register to vote the same day during early voting, residents must have a state identification number from their state-issued driver’s license or must have proof of the last four digits of their Social Security number. North Carolina Senate race in 2022 In the 2022 U.S. Senate race, Democrat Cheri Beasley took a 20-point lead over Ted Budd when the first batches of votes were released after polls closed. That lead disappeared after about 90 minutes when Budd overtook Beasley in the vote count and went on to win the seat. Mail and early in-person votes accounted for about 59% of all ballots in that election. In statewide elections, the Democratic strongholds are in the Raleigh, Charlotte, Greensboro and Fayetteville areas, while Republicans tend to perform best in the western, eastern and southeastern areas of the state. When Obama carried North Carolina in 2008, he won beyond the safe Democratic areas and picked up an additional 11 counties in what were moderate Republican areas. More than half of those counties may have moved out of reach for Democrats today, as Trump outperformed Biden by double-digit margins in 2020. But that same year, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper picked up Granville, Pasquotank and Scotland counties in his successful reelection bid and reduced the margin in others.

Bill O'Reilly: Trump's 'dunderhead' staff should've vetted comedi...	(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly criticized former President Donald Trump's campaign staff as 'dunderheads' for not vetting a comedian who called Puerto Rico an 'island of garbage' during a Sunday rally. O'Reilly, while discussing the Madison Square Garden rally, revealed that Trump 'didn't know that comedian who disparaged all Puerto Ricans' and blamed the incident on poor campaign management. 'He's got a lot of people working for him that are dunderheads. … They're only there because they kiss his butt, and that's not what you want,' O'Reilly said on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' However, O'Reilly noted exceptions to his criticism, praising Lara Trump and campaign executive Susie White as 'very powerful' and 'very smart' members of the team. Megyn Kelly: Trump speakers alienating key voters at MSG not ‘smart’ O'Reilly also characterized Vice President Kamala Harris as a 'machine candidate' who 'does what the machine tells her to do' and criticized her campaign's performance, particularly noting that 'she can't answer a question.' 'You think she's got a bunch of geniuses running her campaign? ... You think PhDs are running that operation?' O'Reilly said. What happened at Trump's MSG rally? The event was a surreal spectacle that included former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, billionaire Elon Musk, TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, politicians including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik and an artist who painted a picture of Trump hugging the Empire State Building. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, one of the featured guests at Trump’s New York City event, sparked a furor after referring to Puerto Rico as 'a floating island of garbage,' prompting some members of the GOP, like Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, R-N.Y., who is Puerto Rican, to come out against the remarks. GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally In addition to his remark about Puerto Rico, Hinchcliffe also made a crude joke about Latinos in which he said, 'They love making babies too. Just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They c-- inside. Just like they did to our country.' Hinchcliffe wasn’t the only one who made controversial remarks about different racial and ethnic groups during the rally. Carlson referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as a 'Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor' even though Harris is neither Samoan nor Malaysian but rather Black and Indian American. Sid Rosenberg, a New York City radio host whose show Trump calls into periodically, blasted Democrats in derogatory and explicit terms. 'She is some sick b------, that Hillary Clinton. What a sick son of a b----,' he said of the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee. 'The whole fucking party. A bunch of degenerates.'

Businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris 'and her pimp handlers will destroy our country. Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement that Hinchcliffe’s 'joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.'

Megyn Kelly: Trump speakers alienating key voters at MSG not 'sma...	(NewsNation) — Megyn Kelly tells 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' she found former President Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally speakers alienated female and Hispanic voters rather than uplifting them. Kelly, a noted Trump supporter who told NewsNation she finds Vice President Kamala Harris 'empty-headed,' thinks that 'there is zero point in offering man after man after man to call her the devil.' She said she doesn't think the rally or its explosive backlash will have an impact on Trump's chances of winning, but there was 'no point' in insulting two major voter pools. What to expect on the NewsNation website and app on election night 'Trump has not won this thing, not by a long shot. You've got to get as many votes as humanly possible.' Kelly said Tuesday. 'And there is absolutely no point in doing or saying anything that would alienate these key voting blocks, including Hispanics and Blacks and women.' NewsNation’s election partner, Decision Desk HQ, shows Trump with a 54% chance of winning and Harris with a 46% chance as of Oct. 29. Kelly expressed disappointment in the speakers chosen for the rally, saying that the Republican men in her life were 'not motivated by, like, racist jokes about Hispanics and Blacks and sexist comments about women.' 'They are capable of so much more than this, and the No. 1 goal was to serve Trump, which they didn't. So whoever actually did screen these remarks, if indeed that's true, ought to be removed from the campaign for the next seven days and just let a grown-up handle this,' she said. What are the swing states for the 2024 election? Kelly clarified that while she believes the GOP nominee will still win the presidential election, the event did him no favors. 'At something like this, you want to be inspired, you might want to laugh, but you don't want to hit below the belt,' she said. 'And above all, do nothing to make your stupid joke, whether you're the comic or one of the supporting acts, the story. Trump needs to be the story.' What happened at Trump's MSG rally? The event was a surreal spectacle that included former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, billionaire Elon Musk, TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, politicians including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps.

Driving the vote: Hispanic voters in Nevada crucial in election	(NewsNation) — The road to the White House in Nevada must include the growing Hispanic vote. In Nevada, as well as bordering Arizona, Latinos make up about 25% of registered voters, who hit the ballot box with a swirl of backgrounds, issues and traditions. To emerge as the successor in the 2024 election, Republican former President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris need to gain approval from the nearly 1 in 4 voters in Nevada who are Hispanic. For example, take Alina Gardner, a realtor who moved to the United States from Cuba as a young girl. She's able to show her listings in English and Spanish. The current odds in every battleground Senate race Gardner is what's called a 'persuadable,' meaning that even though she’s a registered Republican, her vote is not set in stone. 'I get a lot of texts and emails from the Democrats, so I listen to both,' Gardner told NewsNation. 'I'm open to both.' At the same time, while she's willing to vote for a Republican, Gardner doesn't believe Trump should be president 'at his age.' 'As of right now, it's going to be Kamala Harris,' Gardner said. Ivet Aldaba will have her daughters top of mind as she votes this November. The college professor is among the estimated 36 million Latinos eligible to vote this time around nationwide. That’s up from 14 million in the year 2000 — an increase of 153%. 'Having immigrant parents and them not being able to vote — at the time, I felt that civic responsibility even more,' Aldaba said. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout For Aldaba, her reason for voting Democrat is reproductive rights. 'I want my daughters to have a voice, to be able to decide what they can do with their own bodies,' Aldaba said. Meanwhile, retired blackjack dealer David Mendez says when he started showing support for Trump, he lost a lot of friends. He's voting for Trump because of what he says are the culture wars playing out in his casino. Rudy Zamora, of the nonpartisan voter engagement group Chicanos Por La Causa, serves a community that mirrors the country as a whole. There's young voter apathy he sees as well as distrust in election integrity. 'I've heard conversations from my aunts and uncles saying, ‘Oh, back in my country, my vote doesn't really matter,' or 'The election was already bought,'' Zamora said. 'That's not the case here. Every single vote is one vote, one voice, and we have to ensure that our voice is being represented at the polls.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-vote-hispanic-voters-nevada/	2024-10-29T15:59:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/6521e49f957f28.91693881.jpeg?w=900
Pennsylvania on Election Day: What to expect	(NewsNation) — Pennsylvania voters should prepare for potential swings in reported results on election night due to the state's complex vote-counting procedures. With polls closing at 8 p.m. ET, initial results could show significant shifts between candidates as counties report mail-in ballots and Election Day votes at different times throughout the night. State law prohibits counties from processing mail-in ballots before 7 a.m. on Election Day, and results cannot be published until after polls close. This restriction, combined with county-by-county reporting autonomy, means early results may not reflect the outcome. Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout Philadelphia election officials have invested in new technology to speed up the count. The city plans to deploy six new mail-in ballot processing machines capable of opening 40,000 envelopes per hour — a significant upgrade from older machines that handled just 3,600 hourly. The 2020 presidential election illustrates the potential for early result fluctuations. President Joe Biden initially led when early votes were counted before former President Donald Trump pulled ahead as Election Day votes were tallied. After all mail-in ballots were counted, Biden ultimately won the state by approximately 80,000 votes. Trump narrowly leads Harris in Pennsylvania: DDHQ Trump maintained a narrow lead over Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday in Pennsylvania. That’s according to the latest forecasts from NewsNation’s partners Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) and The Hill, which predict Trump has a 51% chance of winning in the Keystone State. The opposite was true as recently as Oct. 17. The candidates were tied until Trump gained a slight lead on Oct. 21. Where Trump and Harris stand on issues that matter to voters Nearly twice as many Democrats than Republicans have voted early in Pennsylvania. Tuesday marks Pennsylvania residents’ last chance to request mail-in or absentee ballots. With more than 1.4 million early ballots cast, Trump and Harris are in a close race that could flip the state. Registered Democrats had returned 849,849 ballots as of Tuesday, compared to the 468,067 that registered Republicans have returned so far, according to state election data. Early voting data, however, only shows a person’s party affiliation — not how they voted. The current odds in every swing state Election officials need to process mail ballots before they can count them — an undertaking that varies by state. It often takes several days or weeks to finalize election results and certify a winner. Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Trump narrowly carried the state by 0.7% in 2016 but lost his hold on Pennsylvania to Biden in the 2020 election. NewsNation's Katie Smith contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/pennsylvania-election-day/	2024-10-29T15:55:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-1-3.jpg?w=900
Maricopa County has 'zero tolerance' for election crimes	(NewsNation) — The sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County has ensured they are ready for Election Day. The Phoenix-area county came under scrutiny during the 2020 presidential election, as the Arizona Senate launched a publicly-funded investigation into election fraud after President Joe Biden won the state. The claims made by former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters were unfounded. More recently, ballots were damaged in the area — some even destroyed — by an arsonist last Thursday. 'We want to make sure that security is for democracy in this election campaign,' Maricopa County Sheriff Russ Skinner told 'NewsNation Now.' 'We want to make sure that our community feels safe and secure,' he added. When will we know the results of the presidential election? Ballot box arson also occurred in the Pacific Northwest, with votes destroyed in Washington and Oregon on Monday. As for a repeat of 2020, Skinner says they hope it is not the case, but the county is prepared for any possible circumstances. 'This is a process for democracy, and we want to make sure that everybody respects each other, and hopefully nobody's out there doing criminal activity,' Skinner said. 'Are we prepared? Absolutely so. Again, we know that there is some divide amongst the politics involved in this, but I want to make sure that we keep our community safe and secure.' According to Decision Desk HQ polling averages, Trump has a 1.9% lead on Harris in Arizona based on 62 polls.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/maricopa-county-zero-tolerance-election-crimes/	2024-10-29T14:41:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2179768105.jpg?w=900

Harris to make closing argument to voters on National Mall	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris is delivering her closing message of the campaign, asking Americans to 'turn the page' on the era of former President Donald Trump. Her appearance on the National Mall will be the culmination of messages she's delivered over the course of her campaign. She'll be making the case to voters with a focus on Republican voters who are on the fence about voting for Trump and supporters of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley who aren't sure how to vote. A senior campaign official told NewsNation Harris will be focusing on two very different visions of America. The event is being held in a strategic place in front of the White House for two reasons. When will we know the results of the presidential election? One is to paint a picture of the choice in front of Americans. The second is a reminder of 2021, as she will be giving her speech from the very same spot Trump spoke to his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, just before the riots at the U.S. Capitol. The latest polling from Decision Desk HQ shows the race still neck and neck. As of Tuesday morning, Harris held a 0.8% lead based on 305 polls. Yesterday, it was Harris at 48.5% and Trump at 48%, still well within the margin of error. Some Democratic lawmakers and strategists have said they are concerned that Harris is focusing so much on Trump, taking time away from other major campaign issues like the economy, immigration, health care and abortion. A pro-Harris super PAC called Future Forward has warned that attacking Trump's character or stamina is less effective than Harris highlighting her own policy proposals. Joe Rogan: ‘Hope we can make’ Kamala Harris interview happen Voters have also said they want to hear more about her specific policy plans. Others have said they don't like the fear-mongering and feel it contrasts with her vision of a positive, bright outlook on America. However, the campaign said Harris is choosing to make her closing argument on the National Mall to draw a stark contrast between her and her opponent. 'One of the things I love about the American people is we can hold many thoughts at once,' Harris said on Friday, adding that bringing down costs is a priority in her agenda along with fighting for democracy and the freedom to make decisions about one's own body.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-closing-argument-national-mall/	2024-10-29T11:22:41-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2180022822-1.jpg?w=900
Race for Pennsylvania: Democrats dominate early voter turnout	(NewsNation) — Nearly twice as many Democrats than Republicans have voted early in Pennsylvania — a swing state that played a pivotal role in the outcomes of the past two presidential elections. Tuesday marks Pennsylvania residents’ last chance to request mail-in or absentee ballots. With more than 1.4 million early ballots cast, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a close race that could flip the state. Swing state counties to watch on election night Registered Democrats had returned 849,849 ballots as of Tuesday, compared to the 468,067 that registered Republicans have returned so far, according to state election data. ON EARLY VOTING: The Harris campaign says they are feeling &quot;very good about what we&#39;re seeing. &quot;We&#39;re confident we&#39;re going to win&quot; a close election.

Pennsylvania is home to 19 electoral votes — the most of any battleground state this election cycle, DDHQ noted. Pennsylvania hasn’t backed a Republican presidential candidate by double digits since Richard Nixon in 1972. Trump narrowly carried the state by 0.7% in 2016 but lost his hold on Pennsylvania to Biden in the 2020 election. Ronald Raegan was the last Republican to win the state’s electoral votes twice. Here’s a closer look at Pennsylvania’s early voter turnout as of Tuesday morning: Total ballots returned: 1,473,825 Democratic: 849,849 Republican: 468,067 Other: 155,909 Total mail-in ballots returned: 1,435,280 Democratic: 831,501 Republican: 452,875 Other: 150,904 Total absentee ballots returned: 38,545 Democratic: 18,348 Republican: 15,192 Other: 5,005	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/pennsylvania-2024-electoin-early-voting-democrats-republicans-harris-trump/	2024-10-29T10:44:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/01/88a19c102c7b470d9a85e26b74bfef24.jpg?w=900
Joe Rogan: 'Hope we can make' Kamala Harris interview happen	(NewsNation) — Podcaster Joe Rogan says he wants to interview Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris after Republican former president Donald Trump appeared on his show, though he rejected requests her team made for conducting one. 'For the record, the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast,' Rogan wrote on X. 'They offered a date for Tuesday, but I would have had to travel to her and they only wanted to do an hour. I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin. My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being. I really hope we can make it happen.' Last week, Reuters reported that Harris was considering talking to Rogan as she tried to garner support with male voters and his audience leans heavily toward young men. 'The Joe Rogan Experience' has millions of followers on Spotify, and the Trump interview had 174,000 likes on X as of Tuesday morning. The current odds in every battleground Senate race However, the news outlet said at the time that while Harris campaign officials met with Rogan's team, an interview had not been confirmed yet. On MSNBC Thursday, Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams said the vice president going on Rogan's podcast 'isn't going to work out right now because of the scheduling of this... period of the campaign.' NewsNation has reached out to Harris' campaign for comment. In his three-hour interview with Rogan, Trump repeated lies about voting, election fraud and his loss in the 2020 presidential election. Trump's running mate, GOP Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is set to sit down for an interview with Rogan on Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the vice presidential nominee's spokesperson told NewsNation.

Here are the states where you can register to vote on Election Da...	(NewsNation) — Americans hoping to cast ballots in next week's general election but have not yet registered to vote can do so on Election Day depending on where they live, although others may be locked out because they missed their state's registration deadline. Twenty-three U.S. states and the District of Columbia provide for same-day voter registration, according to state election guidelines. Yet, in places where residents can wait until November 5 to cast their ballot for former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, state and federal offices, and a host of ballot initiatives after registering to vote when they arrived, the rules vary. Meanwhile, 26 states, including several swing states like Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania still prevent unregistered voters from casting last-minute ballots despite calls to give unregistered voters more time.

Oklahoma governor encourages residents to vote: 'Absolutely safe'	(NewsNation) — The 2024 election is just one week away, and polling site safety is at the top of voters' minds. Cities across the U.S. have been working to beef up security at polling places, which has been driven by a troubling increase in violent threats toward election workers. Local governments have coordinated with law enforcement to ensure safe voting and implement new security measures at polling locations. Trump boasts about rally amid Puerto Rico joke furor A visible police presence, installing cameras and training poll workers on how to handle disruptive individuals are just a few steps being taken. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt told NewsNation's Markie Martin on 'Morning in America' Tuesday that his state is doing everything possible to keep polling sites safe this upcoming election. ISIS-K orchestrated foiled Election Day terror plot Just weeks ago, an Afghani national was arrested in Oklahoma City, suspected of plotting an Election Day terror attack. Afghan native Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was arrested in early October and accused of planning to target large groups of people on Nov. 5. He told investigators he and a co-conspirator — whose identity has not been released — planned to die as martyrs. Tawhedi first arrived in the United States in September 2021. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, the Oklahoma City resident bought AK-47 rifles, liquidated his family’s assets and purchased one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan, charging documents revealed. His younger brother-in-law was also arrested in connection to the potential attack. Since the arrests, some Senate Republicans have called on the Department of Homeland Security to release more information on the suspects. Stitt told NewsNation he was grateful that law enforcement caught the plot early, saying he had been briefly back in July and August on the potential of their ill intent for the country. 'They don't love America. We need to make sure we know who's coming into our country,' he said, making this situation a border problem and encouraging former President Donald Trump's policies. 'There are people who don't like us very much, and we need to find out who they are,' Stitt continued. Regardless, Stitt said he's grateful they were able to thwart the attack. 5 things to watch for in Harris's speech at the Ellipse Oklahoma election day safety measures Despite the recent election day threat in Oklahoma, Stitt said the state is prepared for voters to go out to the polls safely. '100% you're absolutely safe,' he said. 'We have all law enforcement, all my troopers, all the state law enforcement, are in all 77 counties.' Stitt explained that he has law enforcement agents monitoring all the polling locations and working with the election board to ensure voter safety. 'We'll make sure that all Oklahomans are safe,' Stitt said. However, Stitt warned that enemies of the U.S. want to cause fear and chaos within the country. Stitt encouraged voters to get out and vote and to not let the fear get to them and prevent them from doing their national duty. 'Let's not let someone make us afraid to get out of our homes and go vote,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/oklahoma-voter-safety/	2024-10-29T08:46:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1728615622.jpg?w=900
When will we know the results of the presidential election?	(NewsNation) — Voters will likely not know the outcome of the presidential election come election night or even for days depending on how close the race gets in critical swing states, political experts say. It took nearly five days before the race was called by major news organizations for President Joe Biden in 2020 due in part to states being overwhelmed with increased mail in ballots during the pandemic. Some states have updated laws to help expedite that process to avoid a 2020 repeat, but many others remain on the same timeline, which could still stretch final tallies. 13 Senate races that will determine the balance of power 'While we have a national election, it’s not administered nationally,' Shawn Donahue, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, told NewsNation. 'Elections are run or conducted at the state and local levels, so that means that we have a lot of variation.' How long before we know the results of the presidential election? Several variables will affect the timeframe on an apparent winner, including how close the race is, the amount of mail-in ballots and how quickly electors can start counting, Donahue said. The biggest factor is how close the election is because if it’s tight, we will need to wait for every vote to be counted. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been polling neck-and-neck according to Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecasts. States have moved up timelines Delays during the 2020 election occurred due to higher mail-in ballots which took time to tally but since then, several states including Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan and Georgia have moved up timelines to start counting. In 2020, more than 43% of votes were mailed in as the coronavirus pandemic led states to greatly expand mail-in balloting and early voting, according to a federal report. This took days and as a result, most states updated or changed laws to allow for a head start on preparing mail-in or absentee ballots before election day, according to the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. In Michigan, lawmakers passed rules to allow absentee ballot counting up to eight days before the election and in Nevada officials can begin counting mail ballots on Oct. 21. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Pennsylvania doesn’t allow offices to begin opening mail-in ballots until 7am on Election Day so it could take a longer time to finish. But Donahue says there likely won't be as many mail-in ballots this time around which means results will be quicker than they were in 2020. Some states where early numbers could emerge are North Carolina, Michigan, and potentially Wisconsin where officials can get a head start, Donahue said. 'But we'll have to see what the volumes are and if counties actually start doing that in the morning, or do they wait till the polls close,' he added. Delays may happen in Nevada and Arizona which typically don’t move as fast on counting, he said. 'It's nothing particularly nefarious. A lot of the states in the West don't have that much in-person Election Day voting, and it just takes them a while to get through the ballots.' Election officials publish unofficial results after the polls close on Election Day. Those results will fluctuate as in-person, mail-in, provisional, overseas and military ballots are counted. Could candidates cause delays in election counting process? Legal challenges by either candidate would not delay the counting process, but it could take the certification process closer to its deadline, Donahue said. Under the Election Reform Act of 2022, each state must issue a certificate of ascertainment, which contains a final certified vote tally, no later than Dec. 11, six days before the Electoral College meets. As election day draws closer, Trump has revved up claims that if he loses the election, it’s due to cheating, and has vowed to mount legal challenges. Abortion measures on ballots in record number of states 'They’re going to cheat. They cheat. That’s all they want to do is cheat, and when you see this, it’s the only way they’re going to win,' Trump said during a rally in Wisconsin, reported The New York Times. 'And we can’t let that happen and we can’t let it happen again.' During the 2020 election, delays in counting due to mail-in ballots were used by Trump to fuel false claims that the election was stolen. As a result, counting will be even more careful this year, John Mark Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said in an email to NewsNation. 'This year, there may be a tendency to do the count even more carefully because of all the misinformation Trump is spreading about fraud. Caution means there could be more widespread delays - but not because anything nefarious is happening.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/results-presidential-election-trump-harris-potential-timeline/	2024-10-29T08:28:00-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2181411771.jpg?w=900
Puerto Rican voters rise as key bloc in 2024	Puerto Rican voters have shot to center stage in national elections, marking a major shift for an electorate that was largely overlooked for a century. The voting bloc is at the center of national attention following a series of crude jokes told by Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday at former President Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, in which the comedian equated Puerto Rico to oceanic garbage patches. Though the Trump campaign and many individual Republicans have disavowed Hinchcliffe’s set, the fracas opened a window for Vice President Harris to make a last-minute pitch to low-propensity voters who could help decide the election. 'I think there is a significant number of people who will not be turned off and will make excuses for Trump,' said Federico de Jesús, a Washington-based consultant and former deputy director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. 'But I think that this can and could make a big difference with Puerto Ricans who were already anti-Trump but were not sold yet or were soft on Kamala. They might be voting for her, but they weren't enthusiastic. I think that this will create rage, anger and motivate people to go out and maybe volunteer. Maybe take their relatives to vote. Maybe take a second look at Kamala if they were undecided, and really shore that vote up.' Hinchcliffe’s garbage joke struck at the most sensitive of soft spots for Puerto Ricans across the political spectrum: their homeland. 'The young and the old, their heart is in Puerto Rico — even the ones who were born here in Pennsylvania, in New York, in Nevada, in Georgia, where you have a Puerto Rican population who can decide an election,' said Javier Llano, a D.C.-based Puerto Rican political consultant. Hinchcliffe's segment also included a crass line about Hispanic reproductive habits, as well as anti-Black and antisemitic punchlines that drew a mixed reception from the audience. Republicans including Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.), Reps. María Elvira Salazar (Fla.) and Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.) and Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón, who is running for governor, all disavowed the comedy set, which Hinchcliffe defended Monday, saying it was taken out of context and 'made fun of everyone.' 'This is also, I think, an opportunity for every single American to pay real close attention to what was said at that rally, because no group went unscathed. He talked about Latinos, he talked about Puerto Ricans, he talked about African Americans, he talked about women. The only group that was safe was literally white men — cis white males, to be very specific,' said María Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino. Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement, 'this joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Yet the timing of the Madison Square Garden rally played in favor of Harris, who on the same day released a set of policy proposals for the U.S. territory. 'I will create a new Puerto Rico opportunity economy task force, where the federal government will work with the private sector, with nonprofits and community leaders to foster economic growth and create thousands of new, good-paying jobs in Puerto Rico, including for our young people. And I know that Puerto Rico's economic future depends on urgently rebuilding and modernizing the island's energy grid,' Harris said in a video posted on social media Sunday. That contrast also drew support from top Puerto Rican celebrities, including Ricky Martin, Jennifer López and Bad Bunny. Bad Bunny reposted Harris’s economic pledge to his Instagram account, which is followed by 45.6 million people, highlighting her line, 'I will never forget what Donald Trump did when Puerto Rico needed a caring and competent leader.' Bad Bunny’s jump into national politics is especially significant not only for his worldwide fame, but because he has historically focused his attention on internal Puerto Rican issues, rather than national ones. 'The reason that getting a Bad Bunny — the reason that getting a Ricky Martin and getting a Jennifer Lopez to endorse, is that it allows them to use their information on their feeds to talk to low-propensity information voters,' Kumar said. The Harris campaign quickly cut an ad with footage of the 'garbage' joke, including Trump's unorthodox pronunciation of the island's name in 2017 and Harris's economic pitch. Still, Trump has pulled in his own Puerto Rican celebrity support, most notably from reggaeton stars Anuel AA and Nicky Jam, a sign that both campaigns understand the outsize role Puerto Rican voters could play in this election. 'The fact that both of them and Trump referred to Puerto Rico as a country, which for some Democrats might be a surprise, but to anybody who's spoken to Puerto Ricans in Spanish knows that's how we refer to the island. It resonated with some people, right? And again, he doesn't need to win the majority of Puerto Ricans, but there's a swath of Puerto Rican men with which that resonated,' de Jesús said. 'And Kamala Harris was yesterday in Pennsylvania rolling out a plan on Puerto Rico. So Puerto Ricans on the island may not vote for president, but Puerto Ricans in the states obviously do, and there's a large number of us that have the island in our hearts when we go out to vote.' Puerto Ricans are at the center of the fight for Pennsylvania — the essential swing state — and Florida, a once-swing state with a potentially competitive Senate race. Puerto Rican voters are also expected to play a key role in Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina. That's a far cry from the group's historical clout in safe blue strongholds such as New York and Illinois, and from the electoral marginalization of Puerto Rico's territorial status. Puerto Ricans on the island have been statutory U.S. citizens since 1917, but only Puerto Ricans with residence in D.C. or one of the 50 states can vote in federal elections. Though the Jones Act, the law that conferred citizenship in 1917, spurred migration to the mainland, most Puerto Ricans originally settled in nonbattleground liberal states. For the next century, the Puerto Rican vote was crucial in some local elections but never at the presidential level. 'This time, we could be the decisive vote. In 2020 we were one of several groups, but this time around we could be the decisive swing vote,' de Jesús said. 'We didn't really matter per se in the presidential races until Florida became such a heavy state, with more than 1 million Puerto Ricans. And you know what's happened since, obviously, for local races, statewide races in New York and in Pennsylvania and other states, Puerto Ricans have mattered. But the fact that there's so many Puerto Ricans, more than 100,000 in Georgia, for example, more than that in North Carolina and obviously in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin, that changes things.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/puerto-rican-voters-rise-as-key-bloc-in-2024/	2024-10-29T04:37:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/puerto_rico_voters_091724ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump ally Steve Bannon is released after serving 4 months in pri...	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He’s also expected to resume his podcast Tuesday. Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his conviction. A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race. When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a 'political prisoner.' 'I am proud of going to prison,' he said at the time, adding that he was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a 'corrupt' Justice Department. Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next week's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's convictions in May. Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee. Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court, alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

5 things to watch for in Harris's speech at the Ellipse	(The Hill) - Vice President Harris will solidify her closing argument that Donald Trump is a danger to democracy by delivering a speech on Tuesday at the Ellipse — the very site where the former president spoke just before a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Harris’s speech a week before Election Day is expected to be a further plea to voters to turn the page on Trump and highlight his role in the events of that day. She will focus on the two different visions of America that voters are given in this election and after the speech, she will take that closing message on the road and visit every battleground state over the next week, a senior Harris campaign official previewed. Vice President Harris speaks with reporters after attending a service at the Church of Christian Compassion on Oct. 27, 2024, in Philadelphia. (Susan Walsh, Associated Press) Here are five things to watch. Harris to emphasize Trump’s threat to democracy Harris will keep up her plea to voters that Trump is a threat to democracy, which has become a major part of her closing message. The Harris campaign official described the tone of the speech as 'optimistic' and 'hopeful' but said it will center on her and Trump’s different visions of America. Harris will argue that Trump as president would focus on a supposed 'enemies list.' Harris will reiterate that she, instead, has a 'to-do list.' She is set to warn voters that Trump is all-consumed by his grievances and desire for retribution and will argue that tens of millions of Americans are frustrated by the division in politics, according to the campaign official. The vice president has increasingly been leaning into labeling Trump as a threat to democracy and talking about his role in the riots on Jan. 6 during her rallies. But as polling tightens and shifts towards Trump’s favor, Democrats have expressed concerns that she has made her campaign a rebuke of the former president instead of about her own plans. When questioned on Friday about those concerns, the vice president said the American people 'can hold many thoughts at once.' 'One of the highest priorities for the American people right now is bringing down cost… and will be the priority of my work when I'm elected president United States,' she said. 'My priority includes fighting for our democracy… and I will continue to speak on all of them.' Ellipse turnout The Harris campaign expects about 20,000 people to be in the audience at the Ellipse, according to an updated permit from the National Park Service that was expanded from an initial 7,500 people. The campaign is expecting attendees near the site with crowd overflow on the northeast quadrant of the Washington Monument grounds for the program slated to be from 7:15 p.m. to 8:15 p.m.ET on Tuesday night. The site opens to the public starting at 3 p.m., which will allow for a large crowd to accumulate before it begins, according to the permit. Harris’s largest rally to date was in Houston on Friday, when the crowd size was 30,000 people. That rally included Beyonce and Willie Nelson, which added to the draw. Similarly, the speech at the Ellipse could include appearances from celebrities and could bring out a large crowd considering Washington, D.C., neighboring Maryland and northern Virginia are all areas where Harris has wide support. Harris to invoke Jan. 6, Trump contesting election results Harris’s decision to use the Ellipse is twofold, according to the campaign official, one, because it is within view of the White House and two, because it is the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 speech. The vice president will likely warn that history may repeat itself. Trump has not committed to accepting the 2024 election results outright - only if he deems them 'free and fair,' similar to sentiments he declared just before the 2020 election that led to his contesting the results. The vice president will likely warn in her remarks that Trump could declare a victory prematurely, like he did in 2020 before a winner was projected, or refuse to accept the results of the election, which is what led to supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. 'Of course. This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo … a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people,' Harris told NBC last week. 'The American people… are being presented with a very, very serious decision about what will be the future of our country.' A CNN/SSRS poll released Monday found that 69 percent of registered voters nationally think Trump would not accept the election results, and 30 percent think he would. Will she call Trump a fascist? Despite being asked multiple times, Harris has never outright labeled her political opponent a 'fascist.' Harris has agreed in two separate interviews on the notion that Trump’s campaign runs on 'fascism' and agreed with John Kelly’s assessment that Trump is a 'fascist' but she’s never used the word herself. The conversation over whether Trump should be labeled as such was sparked last week when Kelly, Trump’s ex-White House chief of staff, said the 45th president 'certainly falls into the general definition of fascist' in an interview in The New York Times. Harris, at the town hall, would not agree when she was asked if she believes Trump is antisemitic, but instead called him 'dangerous' and 'a danger to the well-being and security of America.' Harris’s Ellipse remarks could be an opportunity for her to take that one step further. Despite Trump labeling Harris a plethora of personal and offensive names, Republicans suggest her name-calling is too harsh following the two assassination attempts on Trump’s life in recent months. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) issued a joint statement on Friday condemning Harris for saying she believes Trump is a fascist, arguing that it could invite another assassination attempt. Possible pro-Trump or pro-Palestine protests Harris has faced pro-Palestine protesters at campaign stops more often than pro-Trump protesters, but she could see both during her speech in Washington given the importance of the location to Jan. 6. The vice president was interrupted by Gaza demonstrators as recently as during her rally in Houston, Texas on Friday. She responded to yelling by quipping that the protesters are at the wrong venue. 'Just send them to the small rally down the street,' she said to protesters, referring to a rally Trump hosted earlier in Austin. 'Some people don’t have a great sense of direction but that’s okay, we’ll show them the way.' Harris has maintained her pro-Israel stance and stuck to her talking points when pressed last week on what she would say to voters who are thinking about supporting a third-party candidate because of the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. 'Far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It’s unconscionable,' she said, adding that she thinks there is a current opportunity to end the war and bring the hostages held by Hamas home given the recent killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The Biden administration’s support for Israel throughout the war has led to protests from pro-Palestinian Americans, raising concerns among Democrats about whether anger on the issue will hurt Harris’s support among Arab and Muslim Americans and young voters in critical swing states like Michigan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/5-things-to-watch-for-in-harriss-speech-at-the-ellipse/	2024-10-29T04:31:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Harris-Ellipse-five-things_102924_AP_Susan-Walsh-e1730196649227.png?w=900

Swing state counties to watch on election night	(NewsNation) — NewsNation political editor Chris Stirewalt breaks down the battleground state counties that will count the most during Election Day.

When will we know the results of the presidential election?	Voters may not have to wait quite as long after Election Day as four years ago to know whom the next president will be. The public needed to wait almost five days in 2020 before most major news outlets could issue a projection, the longest they had to wait since the infamous 2000 election. One main reason was a historic increase in mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic that several key states weren’t prepared to handle quickly. But experts say some changes in state policies since then and an expected drop in mail-ins this year should speed the process up, even if the final result isn’t known on election night. 'Things will be different this year,' said Quinn Yeargain, an associate professor of law at Michigan State University. 'It may not be as quick as 2022. Famous last words I suppose, but I would be surprised if the process took as long as it did in 2020.' 'At the same time, the ultimate outcome in 2020 was quite clear before the networks called it on that Saturday,' Yeargain added. 'There was no real question as to what was going to happen probably after Wednesday afternoon or Thursday.' Up until 2020, Americans had broadly gotten used to relatively quick race calls for elections, usually no later than late Tuesday or early Wednesday after the election. Of the races of the past few decades, all of them had been called by major media outlets by early the following morning, except for 2000 when a recount in Florida caused weeks of delays. But four years ago marked a sharp difference, with the pandemic yielding health guidelines to minimize in-person, indoor interactions as much as possible. With the election approaching, many voters turned to mail-in voting to avoid voting in-person, and several states altered their policies to allow more voters to cast their ballots through that method. That caused a historic amount of mail-in voting, making up more than 43 percent of all votes cast, as opposed to just a quarter of all votes in 2016 and 2018, according to a federal report released after the election evaluating voting methods used in 2020. But that caused an issue with states being able to process and count all the ballots with the speed that many have gotten used to. Yeargain said state laws vary, but many did not allow mail-in ballots to be opened or checked for signatures until Election Day. 'The volume was so high that it took a significant amount of time to fully deal with that, which is what opened up the possibility of more conspiracy theories about the election to proliferate,' they said. Chris Mann, the research director for the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, also emphasized the closeness of the race, which made the task for media outlets to call races more difficult. Biden only carried the key states that clinched him victory by about a percentage point at most, and that could repeat itself with this year's winner, with polls showing a neck and neck race. 'The process that the news media decision desk could go through is trying to get to a point where the remaining uncounted ballots are not enough to potentially make a difference, and given that the polls show things to be essentially a tie, and if they prove to be correct and these elections are going to be decided by very narrow margins, it will again take quite a while,' Mann said. But some states have altered their policies for processing ballots ahead of Election Day in ways could speed up the process, reducing the chance for a delay as long as in 2020. The center, which works with election officials to build trust in elections, released a report this month gathering vote processing policies for all 50 states. Almost all states allow envelopes for mail-in ballots to be processed ahead of Election Day itself, according to the report. That includes processes such as verifying signatures and other information on the outside of the ballot, sorting envelopes, rejecting improperly filled-out ballots and preparing them for a machine to scan. 'The important part that takes time is that processing to verify every ballot, to make sure that it is valid and completed, has all the information to verify the voters identity,' Mann said. 'Tabulation is the technical term that the election officials use that is separate — much faster, much easier — in that process.' Time is needed to know if the mail-in ballots this year will resemble the total from 2020, though it may be less now that the pandemic is not dominating daily life. But millions of mail-ins have already been cast, and Republicans appear to be embracing the method more than in the past. About half of all states also allow machines to scan ballots before Election Day as long as the results aren’t aggregated, the report states. The current rules for two of the main battlegrounds, Michigan and Nevada, include changes from their policies for the 2020 election, allowing their ballots to be processed in advance. This could be especially critical in Nevada, a state where most voters cast their ballots by mail. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina will also allow processing ahead of Election Day, though North Carolina’s may be complicated by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Georgia in particular seems likely to be quicker among the battlegrounds. But a quick race call might be impossible if the election is particularly close and comes down to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — both states do not allow envelope processing to start until Election Day. Mann underscored that the rules for how the process works were set well in advance of the election but are susceptible to misinformation and disinformation affecting how the public views them. 'The same process that's used in Pennsylvania is used in other states. The same process that's used in Wisconsin is used in other states,' he said. 'The states where the doubt is cast is being passed by people spreading mis- and disinformation about it. The same system isn't causing doubts in other places because it's not being attacked, and there isn’t disinformation being spread about it.' And the closer the race is, the more likely for temperatures to be heightened on both sides around the process, said Pete Seat, an instructor for the University of Arizona’s School of Government and Public Policy and a former George W. Bush White House spokesperson. 'The closer the election is and the longer it takes to find out — particularly if you get into a situation where you're going to the courts to have the result adjudicated in some way — half the country is going to be displeased,' he said. 'It's just a matter of which half it is.' Analysts widely expect the race to be close even if one candidate wins most of the key swing states, but just how close and in which states may decide how long the country is holding its breath. Seat argued people should remember to be patient, even as impatience is a 'function' of society. 'I know a lot of people who just want the election to be over so we can move on, but we're going to have to be patient, because it may not be as over as quickly as we want it to be,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/when-will-we-know-the-results-of-the-presidential-election/	2024-10-28T15:18:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/when-will-we-know_gans_AssociatedPress.jpeg?w=900
The Washington Post endorsement controversy sparks staff resignat...	(The Hill) -- A decision by The Washington Post to not endorse a candidate for president in next week's election is sparking vocal protests and resignations from some staffers. Post publisher and CEO William Lewis announced Friday that the Post would not be making an endorsement, a move that has angered staffers and stoked fears about the newspaper's editorial independence. GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally The Post itself reported hours later that Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon who owns the newspaper, personally made the decision not to run an endorsement after the Post's editorial board had already drafted its endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The first protest was from Post editor Robert Kagan, who told the news outlet Semafor he would step down from the publication. On Monday, Molly Roberts, a member of the Post's editorial board, said she was also stepping down because 'the imperative to endorse Kamala Harris over Donald Trump is about as morally clear as it gets.' 'Worse, our silence is exactly what Donald Trump wants,' Roberts wrote in a statement. 'For the media, for us, to keep quiet.' A third staffer, David Hoffman, a Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist, wrote in a note to his editors obtained by The New York Times that he was stepping down from the Post's editorial board but would remain at the newspaper. Elon Musk sued by Philadelphia district attorney over $1M giveaway 'While leaving the board, I refuse to give up on The Post, where I have spent 42 years,' he wrote. In his announcement on Friday, Lewis acknowledged the decision to not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in more than 30 years was likely to receive blowback. 'We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility,' the newspaper's publisher wrote. 'That is inevitable. We don’t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/the-washington-post-endorsement-controversy-sparks-staff-resignations/	2024-10-28T15:16:16-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP070803011330-e1718977519545_238212.jpg?w=900
GOP voices frustration, disgust over Trump MSG rally	Republicans are expressing frustration about controversial remarks made at former President Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, worrying it could complicate the party’s outreach to Hispanic, Latino and Black voters. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, one of the featured guests at Trump’s New York City event, sparked a furor after referring to Puerto Rico as a 'a floating island of garbage,' prompting some members of the GOP, like Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-N.Y.), who is Puerto Rican, to come out against the remarks. And Tucker Carlson mocked Vice President Harris’s racial identity. The controversy comes as Republicans have looked to expand their reach with different voting cohorts, which could hold the keys to another Trump reelection. 'This is just a big punch in the gut for Republicans who have sincerely and over a period of time been working to grow strong relationships and roots in Puerto Rican communities, particularly here in the state of Florida,' said former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.). Although recent polls show Harris holding the majority of support among Latino voters — with a 40-point favorability gap among women — one-third of Latino voters remain undecided. For that reason, Trump and his allies have been working hard to shore up support among Latino voters in the closing stretch of the election — though Hinchcliffe’s comments could complicate those efforts. In addition to his remark about Puerto Rico, the comedian also made a crude joke about Latinos in which he said 'they love making babies too. Just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside. Just like they did to our country.' Hinchcliffe’s remarks prompted several sitting GOP members of Congress to push back against the derogatory remarks. 'I’m proud to be Puerto Rican. My mom was born and raised in Puerto Rico,' D’Esposito wrote on the social platform X. 'It’s a beautiful island with a rich culture and an integral part of the USA. The only thing that’s ‘garbage’ was a bad comedy set. Stay on message.' Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), who was born in Cuba but raised in part in Puerto Rico, said on X that she was 'disgusted' by Hinchcliffe’s remarks. 'This rhetoric does not reflect GOP values,' she said. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), whose successful 2018 election was won with the help of Puerto Rican voters, also said on X that the joke 'bombed,' calling it 'not funny and not true.' The Trump campaign, too, has distanced itself from the comedian’s rhetoric. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said on 'Fox &amp; Friends' on Monday that 'it was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste.' 'Obviously, that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign, and I think it is sad that the media will pick up on one joke that was made by a comedian, rather than the truths that were shared by the phenomenal list of speakers that we had,' she said. Hinchcliffe, for his part, defended his remarks, responding to criticism from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). 'These people have no sense of humor,' he wrote. 'Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his ‘busy schedule’ to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone … watch the whole set. I’m a comedian Tim … might be time to change your tampon.' Hinchcliffe wasn’t the only one who made controversial remarks about different racial and ethic groups during the rally. Carlson referred to Vice President Harris as a 'Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor' despite the fact that Harris is neither Samoan nor Malaysian, but rather Black and Indian American. Trump ally Rudy Giuliani used racist stereotypes about Palestinians in his address at the rally, claiming, 'They may have good people. I’m sorry, I don’t take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2.' Democrats have used the speakers’ comments to double down on their criticism of Trump. Talking to reporters on Monday, Harris criticized Trump's New York City rally, calling it 'nonsense.' 'Donald Trump spends full-time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hate and division, and that’s why people are exhausted with him. … People are literally ready to turn the page. They’re tired of it,' Harris said. The incendiary remarks came just more than a week out from the election, and polling across the battleground states suggests a nail-biter of a presidential race. Pennsylvania, New York and Florida are some of the states home to large Puerto Rican communities, and some Republicans say the comments at the rally could impact the GOP presidential campaign and competitive congressional bids. 'With over 456k Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania, one guy’s abhorrent jokes are like a gift wrapped in ribbon for the Harris campaign,' Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton wrote on X. 'At this stage, no campaign can afford negative press — not a single word, not a single action that could alienate or disillusion potential voters.' Curbelo suggested that Hinchcliffe’s remarks could sway Puerto Rican voters in Florida not as familiar with Scott to vote for downballot Democrats. 'What tends to happen is that there's a lot of times a sense of solidarity amongst Hispanic communities. We certainly see that here in South Florida, with Cuban Americans, Venezuelan Americans, Nicaraguan Americans,' said Curbelo, who is Cuban. 'So some, non-Puerto Rican Hispanics could also feel offended by this.' Other Republicans, meanwhile, are skeptical the rhetoric could negatively impact the party in November. Giancarlo Sopo, who led Hispanic media for Trump during his 2020 campaign, called Hinchcliffe’s joke 'stupid' in a text message to The Hill, while adding 'it’s a mistake to assume it will offend all Hispanics.' 'It’s certainly not going to matter to Mexican-Americans in the Southwest. And let’s be real—Hispanic culture isn’t exactly politically correct. Was it in poor taste? Sure, but it’s tame compared to what you hear around lonchera trucks and nail salons,' Sopo wrote. 'At the end of the day, you know what really offends Hispanics? The prices they’re paying at the grocery store.' Brian Seitchik, a Republican strategist and Trump campaign alum, dismissed worries that the comments could reflect on Trump. Voters, he said, are well aware of Trump’s controversial rhetoric and those around him. 'Latino voters, Black voters, white voters, whomever, millions of Americans are choosing Donald Trump not because they love all of his rhetoric or his friends, it’s because they support his policies,' Seitchik said. While Democrats have tried to highlight Trump’s history of controversial — and sometimes racist — comments to deter voters of color from supporting him, Seitchik argued it didn’t work in 2020 and won’t work this year. 'They’re playing identity politics that so offends minority voters these days,' Seitchik said. 'They're Americans. They're not Black Americans or Latino Americans. They're Americans. They want a strong economy, they want to buy a home, they want to send their children to college. They want what every other American wants. And this identity politics approach is simply not working anymore.' Nonetheless, the controversy swirling around the rally isn’t helpful for Trump. Erin Perrine, who served as the Trump campaign’s 2020 communications director, said the real test will come from Democrats and how far they highlight those speakers’ comments. 'Are Democrats going to be putting money behind this message to put it out via text message or on digital ads or a way to get to [a] persuadable voter?' Perrine said. 'Because then they're going to have to make a dollar decision, whatever other message they were driving with that dollar, are they going to pull that and recategorize it?' Cheyanne M. Daniels contributed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/gop-voices-frustration-disgust-over-trump-msg-rally/	2024-10-28T15:10:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hinchcliffetony_102724ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Ballot drop boxes set on fire in Oregon and Washington: police	PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Investigations are underway after authorities say incendiary devices were placed near two ballot boxes in Portland, Oregon, and a third in Vancouver, Washington, and used to start the fires in the early morning hours on Monday. Portland Police Bureau says the incidents were possibly connected to each other as well as another incident that took place on Oct. 8. 'We got a call that indicated one of the ballot boxes was smoking. We found a device there next to the ballot box,' Vancouver police officials said of the previous October incident. 'Today’s incident was very similar.' According to Portland police, at around 3:30 a.m. Monday, officers responded to reports of a fire at a ballot box on Southeast Morrison Street, near the Multnomah County Elections Division office. By the time officers arrived, they said the fire had already been put out by security employees who work in the area. Woman found dead near Bridgeport Village parking structure Authorities said they found that an incendiary device had been placed in the ballot box and used to start the fire. Information about the incident is still limited and authorities are asking anyone with information to contact Portland police or Portland Fire &amp; Rescue. Just half an hour later, Vancouver police said a Clark County ballot box was also found to be on fire. When officers arrived, they said the ballot box at 3510 SE 164th Ave. was smoking and on fire, and the Metro Explosive Disposal Unit arrived to collect the explosive device.

Texas police investigating 'Klan' flyers threatening Kamala Harri...	AUSTIN (KXAN) — The San Marcos Police Department (SMPD) said Saturday it's investigating threatening flyers found throughout San Marcos that target supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a social media post. SMPD chief Stan Standridge said his department has found at least five flyers, with reports about the flyers starting on Friday. Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts 'We're trying to identify the scope of how many flyers have been disseminated across San Marcos,' Standridge said. 'We have already notified the FBI, and that we've also notified the regional fusion centers—both Southwest [Texas] Fusion center and the Austin Regional Intelligence Center.' The flyers, found on residents' campaign signs, state that the resident is now in a 'national database.' It also threatens that the resident 'will be IRS tax audited.' Picture of a flyer found threatening Harris supporters (Courtesy San Marcos Police Department) 'It's a crime in the state of Texas to try to influence or coerce or even prevent a voter from voting,' Standridge said. 'When we identify the suspect or suspects, then we will present that to the district attorney's office for consideration of applicable charges.' How are presidential election votes counted? SMPD said that people who find one of these flyers should not remove it, and should call the agency's non-emergency number, 512-753-2108. An officer will come to investigate the scene and remove the flyer, it said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-klan-flyers-kamala-harris-supporters/	2024-10-28T14:53:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/SMPD-Facebook-Post-Picture.jpg?w=900
Latino vote in the limelight as the electorate shifts	(NewsNation) — Both the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns are acutely aware the Latino vote could sway the presidential election. Long-term trends indicate Latino men may be shifting to the right as Latina women remain more firmly in the Democratic camp. However, short-term missteps, like last night’s insult by a comedian about Puerto Rico at former President Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, could prove decisive. Long-term trends Based on polling, there’s good reason to believe that a shift in the Latino vote may be underway, although we won’t know if it actually materializes until we get the election results. In 2020, President Joe Biden got 60% of the Latino vote, while Trump got 37%. In Cook’s national polling average, Vice President Kamala Harris is currently garnering 52.7% to Trump’s 42.1%. With about 36 million Latinos eligible to vote in this election, those five additional points for Trump could make a difference. How are presidential electoral votes counted? Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who has worked on Latino voter issues for 30 years and is a co-founder of The Lincoln Project, explains the shift. 'Latino voters are quickly moving away from being a racially and ethnically motivated voter to becoming an economic populist and pocketbook voter. That, in a nutshell, is what's happening,' he said. The base voters of both parties are shifting. College-educated voters are moving toward Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are leaning toward the Republican Party. Madrid says that Latinos are the largest entrants into the non-college-educated workforce, and their voting behaviors match those of their white peers in jobs like ones on an assembly line or in construction. Education level and its impact can also be witnessed in the widening gender gap that is emerging with all voters, including Latinos. Women are becoming more Democratic, and men are turning toward the Republican Party. In the Latino community, more women are earning degrees than men. Given Trump’s previous negative statements about immigrants in this country, including his saying that they are 'poisoning the blood of our country,' many question how some Latinos could vote for him. Madrid explains that many Latinos just don’t think Trump is talking about them. They believe 'he's talking about the undocumented migrant, which they're certainly not,' Madrid said. He says the increase in third and even fourth-generation Latino voters means that many are more likely to identify as 'typically American.' This multigenerational status impacts how Latinos view immigration as well. Madrid believes that Democrats failed to understand that the Latino community sees immigration reform and border security as two different issues, not one large problem to address. Harris, Trump make final pleas to voters ahead of election In a recent New York Times/Siena poll, 43% of Latinos support building a wall, and Madrid said that 69% supported Biden's executive actions on asylum and shutting down the border. While Latinos have more sensitivity to immigration solutions like a pathway to citizenship, they are still concerned with border security. Policy for Latino voters Last week, Harris shared policy proposals highlighting how her plans for the economy and jobs will benefit Latinos, and in particular, Latino men. The proposals include doubling the number of apprenticeships, eliminating unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, offering forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to entrepreneurs and doubling the number of Latino homeowners. While the Trump campaign did not share any Latino-specific policy proposals, last week, he held a Latino roundtable. The campaign said that 'President Trump's successful record and common-sense policies resonate with all voters, including Hispanics' and that the shift towards Trump is undeniable. Short-term optics Just yesterday, Harris also unveiled specific policy proposals for Puerto Rico while campaigning in Pennsylvania. If elected president, she said she would create a Puerto Rico Opportunity Economy Task Force to create thousands of jobs on the island, foster economic growth and rebuild and modernize their electric grid. High-profile Puerto Rican artists like Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin all praised her plans. Collectively, they have over 300 million followers on social media. Later in the evening, at the Trump rally in New York, one of the speakers, a comedian, called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said, 'This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' Several Republican politicians denounced the comments as well, further evidence that this could cause trouble with voters. There are almost six million Puerto Ricans in the United States, and nearly 500,000 live in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. In an election that is expected to be won with razor-thin margins, antagonizing any group of voters could be problematic. Ultimately, Madrid believes that the answer to this question will determine the winner. 'Can the Democrats hold on to their U.S.-born Hispanic male base to a greater extent than Republicans can hold on to their white, college-educated female, suburban voter base? That's the whole race,' he said. There is just one week left to find out.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-latino-vote/	2024-10-28T11:35:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
Trump better for stocks, Harris better for housing: Survey	(NewsNation) — A Donald Trump victory is seen as better for the stock market and gold while a Kamala Harris win is expected to be better for housing costs, according to a new Bloomberg survey. Respondents to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey think American wealth will grow regardless of who takes the White House but their confidence varies across different investments. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 22% year to date and more respondents (38%) see stock market gains accelerating under Trump, compared to Harris (13%). Current election odds in every 2024 swing state With that said, research shows there isn't a clear connection between the outcome of a presidential election and stock market performance over the long term. 'The historical data suggests that economic and inflation trends, more so than election outcomes, tend to have a stronger, more consistent relationship with market returns,' a recent U.S. Bank analysis noted. Earlier this year, the value of a gold bar hit $1 million for the first time and 57% of survey respondents expect the price of gold to be higher a year from now if Trump wins versus 45% who felt the same about Harris. For potential homebuyers, however, a Harris victory is seen more positively. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.54% last week, according to Freddie Mac. By the end of a Harris term, the median estimate for that rate is 5.5% according to respondents, compared to 5.9% under Trump. Donald Trump's and Kamala Harris' views on the economy Housing affordability has become a major topic on the campaign trail and both candidates have put forward different plans to address the issue. Meanwhile, former President Trump is also expected to be better for Bitcoin, respondents said. Bloomberg's weekly MLIV Pulse survey was conducted from Oct. 21 to Oct. 25 and included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors. Respondents were Bloomberg News terminal and online readers worldwide who chose to engage with the survey. What do other polls show? The economy has consistently ranked as the top issue in this year's election and Trump has generally polled better on that topic but on specifics, voters are mixed. The latest Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of swing state voters shows more people trust Trump (50%) than Harris (46%) on the economy overall. Specifically, respondents trusted Trump more than Harris on stock market performance (49% to 37%), interest rates (47% to 42%) and gas prices (50% to 41%). However, swing state voters trusted Harris more than Trump on housing costs (48% to 43%), pay raises (44% to 42%) and health care costs (51% to 42%). They also think Harris will be better at helping the middle class (50% to 41%). The two candidates were deadlocked on taxes and unemployment, according to the poll which was conducted online from Oct. 16 to Oct. 20 and surveyed 5,308 registered voters in seven swing states. Here's what other surveys show about voters' views on the candidates and the economy: New York Times/Siena Poll (Oct. 20 to Oct. 23) Expected to do a better job at handling the economy Trump: 52% Harris: 45% Financial Times/University of Michigan Ross School of Business survey (Oct. 17 to Oct. 21) Trust more to handle the economy Trump: 44% Harris: 43% Polling across the seven battleground states, shows Trump and Harris are roughly tied overall. The former president is narrowly favored in Georgia and North Carolina, while the vice president has a slight polling advantage in Michigan and Wisconsin.

Harris, Trump make final pleas to voters ahead of election	(NewsNation) — With just eight days until the election, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s campaigns are making one last push to win over voters. The race is still neck and neck, with Harris gaining a slight edge over Trump in the latest Decision Desk HQ polling. Virginia asks Supreme Court to greenlight 1,600 voter roll removals Pollsters say the campaigns’ ability to rally voters in this final stretch — particularly in the swing states — could decide the election. Harris is driving home her plans for health care and the economy, while Trump is focusing on immigration and economic issues. Mobilizing voters With the election just more than a week away, candidates are encouraging Americans to register and vote early or show up at the polls Nov. 5. Harris and Trump have been visiting battleground states. The vice president was in Michigan Monday after campaigning in Texas. Meanwhile, Trump had two appearances scheduled Monday in Georgia on the heels of his rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Trump says he’ll let RFK Jr. ‘go wild’ on health and food in potential second term Will Biden campaign with Harris? President Joe Biden cast his ballot on Monday in Delaware, but it’s unclear whether he’ll appear alongside his vice president as she makes her final pleas to voters this week. Some analysts say Biden’s presence would be an advantage to Harris’ campaign in places like Scranton or Erie, Pennsylvania. Others say Biden could be a disadvantage to Harris on the campaign trail. What are Harris, Trump’s messages at this stage? Both candidates tried to spread messages of joy over the weekend. Harris has tried to paint Trump as a dark force while positioning herself as a positive, new light. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'For the next nine days, no one can sit on the sidelines,' Harris said at a weekend rally. 'There is too much on the line and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days.' Trump similarly framed his potential win as an optimistic outcome for the country. 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' Trump asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden. 'I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-final-campaign-visits/	2024-10-28T11:06:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Top-Harris-Trump.png?w=900
Trump says he'll let RFK Jr. 'go wild' on health and food in pote...	(The Hill) - Former President Trump said Sunday that he would let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 'go wild' in dealing with issues related to food, medicine and health in a potential second administration. 'I’m going to let him go wild on health. I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines,' Trump told supporters at Madison Square Garden. RFK Jr.’s presence on Michigan, Wisconsin ballots raises concerns for Trump 'The only thing I don’t think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,' he added, referring to oil. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a campaign rally for former President Trump on Aug. 23, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (Ross Franklin, Associated Press) Kennedy ran an independent White House campaign before dropping out in August and and endorsing Trump. Kennedy, who has led an initiative for the Trump campaign dubbed 'Make America Healthy Again,' has long drawn criticism for his anti-vaccine comments. He has spoken about the proliferation of processed foods and additives, and he has worked as an environmental lawyer. 5 takeaways from Trump’s 3-hour interview with Joe Rogan Medical experts have raised concerns about Kennedy's potential influence in a future Trump administration. Kennedy has denied being against vaccines outright but has long peddled debunked conspiracy theories about them. At a congressional hearing last year, he denied telling people to avoid getting vaccinated, but two years earlier he said on a podcast that he regularly tells strangers not to vaccinate their babies. And on CNN in December, he denied saying no vaccines are 'safe and effective,' despite having said exactly that in an interview last July.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rfk-jr-second-term/	2024-10-28T09:57:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/RFK-dangerous_083124_AP_Ross-Franklin-e1730125705257.png?w=900

The DA is also charged with protecting the public from interference with the integrity of elections,' Krasner said in a statement. 'Today, the Philadelphia DA filed a civil legal action under Pennsylvania law,' he continued.

Virginia asks Supreme Court to greenlight 1,600 voter roll remova...	Virginia asked the Supreme Court on Monday to greenlight the removals of more than 1,600 people from the state’s voter rolls. State officials say the individuals are noncitizens, but the Justice Department challenged that assertion and convinced a district judge to reinstate the voters because the removals took place too close to the election. Virginia now seeks emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause that ruling after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to do so in a rare Sunday decision. 'Not only will the Commonwealth of Virginia be irreparably harmed absent a stay, so will its voters and the public at large,' the state wrote in its emergency application. Though research indicates noncitizen voting is rare, Republicans have latched on to the issue as the election approaches. Former President Trump at a Friday campaign event brought up the court-ordered restoration of the registrations in Virginia, calling it 'outrageous.' The Justice Department and a group of private plaintiffs claim Virginia violated the federal National Voter Registration Act’s prohibition on systematic voter roll removals within 90 days of an election. The Justice Department has similarly sued Alabama. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), exactly 90 days before Election Day, issued an executive order formalizing a program to remove potential noncitizens from the state’s rolls — more than 1,600 people have been removed as a result, court filings show. Virginia election officials say the individuals were identified as noncitizens based on a federal database or Department of Motor Vehicles forms. But when blocking the removals Friday, U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles noted the challengers quickly found citizens among the list and that some of the discrepancies could be explained by user error. Giles was appointed by President Biden. A three-judge 4th Circuit panel, all appointed by Democratic presidents, largely refused Virginia’s emergency request to pause the ruling. In a rare occurrence, the decision was handed down during the weekend. The 4th Circuit kept Giles’s ruling in place except for a provision ordering Virginia to educate poll workers and the public about the voters’ restoration. The panel said that requirement was 'not sufficiently clear.' Virginia officials 'remain able to prevent noncitizens from voting by canceling registrations on an individualized basis or prosecuting any noncitizen who votes,' the panel wrote in its ruling.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/virginia-asks-supreme-court-to-greenlight-1600-voter-roll-removals/	2024-10-28T07:28:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Quiz-SCOTUS_102124_AP_Susan-Walsh.jpg?w=900
7 House seats Democrats think they can flip	Democrats are battling to flip control of the House at the polls next week, eyeing gains in battleground districts from coast to coast in an effort to win back the Speaker’s gavel after two years in the minority wilderness. The fight for control of the lower chamber remains neck and neck, and campaign handicappers say the gavel is still up for grabs with just eight days left before Election Day. Both parties concede the contest could tip either way. Democrats got a big boost over the summer, when Vice President Harris replaced President Biden at the top of the ticket, bringing a surge in fundraising, volunteerism and general enthusiasm among base voters who had been deflated by Biden’s dismal approval ratings. Party leaders are also animated by the fact 18 incumbent Republicans represent districts won by Biden in 2020, and many of them are vulnerable. Indeed, there are 14 Republican incumbents in 'toss-up' races, representing the most competitive contests in the country, according to the latest tally from the Cook Political Report, and another is in the 'lean Democrat' column. But Democrats lost a bit of ground during the redistricting process, which is expected to net the Republicans one additional seat. And Democrats have 11 'toss-up' races to defend themselves, including three contests where Democratic retirements have put the seats in play. Still, Democratic candidates have vastly outraised their GOP opponents in races across the country, and party leaders are voicing confidence they’ll seize control of the House next year. Here are seven seats where Democrats are most confident they can pick off sitting GOP lawmakers in their quest for the House majority. New York-22: Brandon Williams Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.), a first-term conservative, is among the most vulnerable GOP incumbents this cycle. Although he swept into office in 2022 on New York’s red wave, his margin was only 1 percentage point — roughly 2,600 votes — and Biden won the district by roughly 7 points two years earlier. Since then, state redistricting changes have shifted the 22nd District even further toward the Democrats — Biden’s margin in the new district would have been 11.4 points — and handicappers at the Cook Political Report have the race 'leaning' in favor of Williams’s Democratic challenger, John Mannion, a moderate state senator. Democratic campaign operatives say that shift — combined with Williams’s conservative policy record, especially on abortion — make the seat ripe for flipping next week. 'Unlike some of the other vulnerable Republicans in New York — who are desperately trying to hide their anti-abortion extremism in a desperate attempt to sound moderate — he will openly run as a far-right conservative,' a Democratic strategist familiar with House races said. 'He's unapologetic about it.' The fundraising numbers also favor the Democrats. While outside groups have spent $4.2 million on behalf of Williams, they’ve spent $6.6 million favoring Mannion, according to OpenSecrets. Nebraska-2: Don Bacon Democrats have been trying unsuccessfully for years to pick off Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a moderate district centered around Omaha. This year, they think they have their best shot to date. Not only did Biden carry the district by 6.3 percentage points in 2020, but independent polling shows that Tony Vargas, the Democratic state senator challenging Bacon, is performing better than he did two years ago, when he lost to the incumbent Republican by roughly 6,000 votes. In this year’s rematch, the analysts at Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan handicapper based at the University of Virginia, have rated the race 'lean Democrat.' On top of that, the Harris campaign has focused squarely on the district in the final weeks of the race, sending vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife to stump in the region. That’s because Nebraska is one of only two states, along with Maine, to award presidential electoral votes by congressional district — in contrast to the winner-take-all system adopted by every other state. House political operatives say the additional campaigning and spending at the presidential level marks a break from the 2016 and 2020 cycles — when Democratic contenders for the White House largely ignored the district — and will benefit Vargas downballot. 'This is the year,' the strategist said. 'Unlike other years where many didn't think the presidential race would come down to maybe one electoral vote, I think everyone realizes it’s a possibility and is acting accordingly. And as a consequence of that, you're seeing a lot of Dem investments out there.' Election handicappers say the ascension of Harris to the top of the ticket is also a factor, since it’s likely to boost turnout of Black and other minority voters in Omaha. Outside spending has poured in to try to boost the Republican, with $10.7 million spent to either promote Bacon or oppose Vargas, according to OpenSecrets. On the other side, $6.8 million has been spent to support Vargas or oppose Bacon. New York-4: Anthony D’Esposito Rep. Anthony D'Esposito is another of the first-term New York Republicans at the top of the Democrats’ target list. Not only did Biden win the district by a whopping 14.5 percentage points in 2020, but D’Esposito has found himself embroiled in a late-campaign scandal after The New York Times reported in September he had an affair with a woman while engaged to his longtime fiancee, and then put the mistress on his congressional payroll. Such episodes are not unheard of on Capitol Hill. But in a region of New York where many voters are still humiliated by the numerous ethics and legal troubles surrounding former GOP Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from Congress last year, Democrats think the scandal will spark a voter backlash that will only help propel D’Esposito’s challenger, Laura Gillen, into Congress. 'It is a factor,' the strategist said. 'On Long Island, there is Santos scandal fatigue, and now D’Esposito is being dogged by his own scandals.' The race is a rematch of the 2022 contest, when D’Esposito defeated Gillen, an attorney and former town supervisor, by almost 4 percentage points. This time around, she’ll have Harris at the top of the ticket — a dynamic that’s expected to increase turnout among Black and other minority voters on Long Island to the benefit of Democrats. Gillen is also better funded this cycle. Democrats have flooded the district with outside spending, pouring $13 million into efforts opposing D'Esposito or supporting Gillen, according to OpenSecrets. Republicans have spent more than $5.7 million to oppose Gillen or boost the Republican congressman. Oregon-5: Lori Chavez-DeRemer Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the first GOP woman to represent Oregon in the House, has spent her two years on Capitol Hill fighting to build a reputation as a moderate voice within the heavily conservative GOP conference. Democrats, however, see her as particularly vulnerable on an issue of outsize prominence this cycle: abortion, where she’s wavered between vows to oppose any bans on federal funding for the procedure, and voting to do just that when legislation hit the floor. Democrats are hoping that track record will repel voters in Oregon’s 5th District, which includes the suburbs of both Portland and Salem, while boosting the Democratic challenger, Janelle Bynum, an Oregon state House member. Fueling their optimism, Biden won the district in 2020 by 8.9 points. Fueling it further, 2024 is the first presidential cycle since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. With that in mind, Democratic operatives maintain the abortion issue will overwhelm the GOP efforts to tie Democrats, including Bynum, to Portland’s controversial liberal policies related to crime and immigration. 'This district is overwhelmingly, without question, pro-choice. And it is absolutely a huge deal in that part of the country — unequivocally so,' the strategist said. 'You cannot get elected in Oregon unless you're pro-choice. Which is why Chavez-DeRemer is trying so, so, so, so hard to cover up her anti-abortion views and her anti-abortion history and her anti-abortion votes.' Outside spending is relatively even in the race, with $10.8 million spent to support Bynum or oppose Chavez-DeRemer, and $10.4 million to support the Republican or oppose Bynum, according to OpenSecrets. California-13: John Duarte To know that first-term Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) is one of the most vulnerable members of the House GOP in the cycle, look back to the 2022 election, which he won by just 564 votes. Democrats believe Duarte will fare worse in a presidential year, particularly in a district where Biden had a nearly 11-point edge with voters in 2020. Democrats have the advantage in outside spending, with $11.4 million spent to oppose Duarte or support Democratic nominee Adam Gray, and $8.3 million spent to support Duarte or oppose Gray, according to OpenSecrets. Duarte has struck one of the most moderate tones in the House GOP on abortion, even saying he is 'pro-choice' despite not supporting codifying protections for abortion. But his Democratic opponent, a former member of the California State Assembly, has heavily attacked Duarte on abortion rights. Another major theme from Democrats is that in the agricultural district, Duarte has nothing to show on immigration reform — an issue that resonates loudly in a region where migrant workers are a crucial part of the economy. Democrats also think the chaotic House GOP majority, which endured two drawn-out battles for Speaker and numerous intraparty fights, helped Duarte from getting meaningful wins. Arizona-1: David Schweikert Democrats have long been hoping to capture Rep. David Schweikert’s (R-Ariz.) district that includes the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, which has been trending blue. Biden won the district by 1.5 percentage points in 2020. This year might be the one where it catches up to the unapologetically conservative Schweikert, who was first elected to Congress as part of the 2010 Tea Party wave. Outside spending on the Democratic side has topped $11.6 million to either oppose Schweikert or support his Democratic challenger, Amish Shah, compared to more than $9.6 million to support the Republican or oppose Shah, according to OpenSecrets. Democrats hope the extra efforts being put into Arizona due to the competitive open Senate seat, and the fact it is a swing state, will also make a difference in the House race, running up the score to help Shah, a physician and former state representative. 'The district is trending blue and fast growing with a lot of new residents,' the strategist said. 'And eventually, all these new folks who are coming in who are blue-leaning are realizing, 'Wait a minute, I don't really want to vote for an anti-choice Republican who's been there 14 years.'' California-27: Mike Garcia Second-term Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) represents a district north of Los Angeles that swung for Biden by 12.4 points in 2020, making him a prime target for Democrats. His Democratic challenger, George Whitesides, was the first CEO of Virgin Galactic and was chief of staff of NASA during the Obama administration — a business-friendly resume that could blunt some of the GOP attacks on Biden and Democrats as the drivers of inflation. The broader political environment within the Golden State could also work to Whitesides’s favor. Because California is solidly Democratic statewide, much of the grassroots and donor enthusiasm has been directed at the handful of competitive congressional races, the Democratic strategist said. 'There are no other competitive races other than these congressional seats,' the strategist said. '[Democratic Senate candidate Adam] Schiff doesn't have a competitive seat. It's California, it's going to go Harris. Volunteers are looking at their local House race to engage, because that's where the action is right now.' Republicans have put about $11 million into outside spending to support Garcia or tear down Whitesides, while outside Democratic groups have spent $10.5 million to support the challenger or oppose Garcia, according to OpenSecrets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/7-house-seats-democrats-think-they-can-flip/	2024-10-28T06:41:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/7-possible-flips-dems_brooks-lillis_illo_SamanthaWong-GregNash.jpg?w=900
Michigan could play pivotal role in presidential election	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris has her eyes on Michigan as she and former president Donald Trump blitz swing states in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign cycle. The race is poised for a tossup in six states, Decision Desk HQ data suggests. Michigan — part of a so-called blue wall along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — could be especially important. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters The midwestern state is home to 15 electoral votes and has favored Democrats in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. Trump, however, led the state by 0.2%, in 2016, contributing to the Electoral College victory that carried him to the White House. Decision Desk HQ models as of Monday predict Harris has a 57% chance of winning the key state. How has Michigan voted in previous elections? Nov. 5 will mark Trump’s third presidential election as the GOP nominee. The presidential race was close in both of his previous bids in 2016 and 2020. Trump garnered 47.5% of Michigan votes and narrowly defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, who claimed 47.3% of votes. President Joe Biden flipped the script in 2020 and defeated Trump by about 150,000 votes. Comedian calls Puerto Rico ‘island of garbage’ at Trump rally Key Michigan counties Washtenaw County is home to the University of Michigan just west of Detroit in Anabor, where Harris is campaigning Monday. The Harris campaign has invested significant time and money visiting college campuses to energize younger voters. Washtenaw County voters overwhelmingly favored Democratic presidential candidates in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Wayne County, where Detroit is located, also encompasses Dearborn. The city of about 110,000 people is home to the country’s largest Arab American population. Most voters in Wayne County also favored Biden and Clinton in the previous two presidential elections.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/michigan-2024-presidential-race-kamala-harris-donald-trump/	2024-10-28T06:08:30-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-10.10.png?w=900
Violent threats against poll workers increasing ahead of election	(NewsNation) — With just one week until the 2024 election, cities across the U.S. are beefing up security at polling places, driven by a troubling increase in threats directed toward election workers. Local governments have coordinated with law enforcement to ensure safe voting and implement new security measures at polling locations. A visible police presence, installing cameras and training poll workers on how to handle disruptive individuals are just a few steps being taken. The 2024 election is major source of stress: Survey Poll workers face violence, threats The violence and threats against poll workers have already begun. Jesse Lutzenberger, 63, was arrested last Thursday after he was accused of assaulting a 69-year-old election worker in San Antonio, Texas. Lutzenberger was asked to remove his cap, which showed support for former President Donald Trump, while walking through a polling place. He cast his vote and then put his hat on before leaving the place, according to Bexar’s County Sheriff Javier Salazar. As Lutzenberger was leaving, the voting clerk told him to take off his hat as it is illegal to sport clothing supporting a candidate inside a polling area under Texas law. Lutzenberger then allegedly threw an arm or elbow back at the clerk, and then turned and threw several punches right at the victim's face, Salazar said. The 69-year-old election worker suffered some 'marks' on his face but no life-threatening injuries, Salazar said Friday. The sheriff said that Lutzenberger was arrested following the incident and taken to Bexar County jail. Incidents such as this are what have the safety of polling places around the country on the top of voters' minds. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Increasing election security measures In Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, election workers installed a bullet-proof protective covering inside the polling site windows. People can see outside the building, but cannot see inside. They said the move was taken after recommendations made to the county by federal security experts. 'We invited Homeland Security to come in and access the building. They did, and this is one of the suggestions,' County manager Romilda Crocamo said about the bulletproof protector. Luzerne County, where Wilkes-Barre is located, has implemented several other security measures, including adding a low barrier of large rocks surrounding the county building. The county has faced multiple threats during past elections and has taken extra security measures to ensure voter safety. Emily Cook, the director of the Luzerne County's Bureau of Elections, has also reportedly received several threats through social media and in person. The county voted in favor of Trump during the 2016 and 2020 elections, facing election controversy in the past when several absentee ballots were discarded in 2020. Those ballots were eventually recovered and counted.

Trump's Madison Square Garden rally: 5 takeaways	Former President Trump on Sunday held a rally at Madison Square Garden, kicking off the final full week of campaigning in the heart of Manhattan. The Trump campaign trotted out a number of high profile speakers to excite the crowd. And while Trump is unlikely to be competitive in New York on Election Day, the event served as a way to generate significant media attention and deliver something akin to a closing message to voters. But some of the earlier speakers overshadowed the event with their incendiary rhetoric. Here are five takeaways. Trump’s closing message sounds familiar The former president’s Madison Square Garden rally was billed as the opening salvo of his closing argument to voters just nine days before Election Day. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters There were signs of a closing message scattered throughout Trump’s speech. He opened his remarks by asking attendees if they were better off than they were four years ago. 'On issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it. And we’re going to fix it,' Trump said later as supporters seated behind the stage waved signs that read, 'Trump Will Fix It.' But those looking for a clearer, more concise message heard more of the same from Trump as he repeated many of his same attacks on Vice President Harris’s intelligence, described the U.S. as an 'occupied country' because of the surge in immigration at the southern border and emphasized his plans to impose tariffs on foreign imports and companies that outsource production. The former president repeated many of the same anecdotes he tells at other rallies, including one about watching a SpaceX launch and another claiming New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges for speaking out about the surge in migrants in the city. Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City rally Trump brings out high profile allies Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, billionaire Elon Musk, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), Donald Trump Jr., Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Hulk Hogan and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) were among those who took the stage ahead of the former president. Former first lady Melania Trump made an extremely rare campaign appearance, delivering brief remarks and introducing her husband. The slew of speakers are unlikely to win over voters on the fence, but their presence on the trail could boost enthusiasm among Trump’s base and among less reliable voting blocs, such as young men. Musk and Carlson in particular have become popular with Trump’s base and have had a more active role on the trail in the closing weeks of the campaign. 'This is a real election battle. So you need to get friends and families to vote. Make sure they vote. Vote early. This is important,' said Musk, who basked in the adoration of the crowd. Carlson spoke at a Trump rally in Georgia last week and will host an event with the former president in Arizona on Thursday. Musk has backed a major super PAC working on get out the vote efforts for the Trump campaign, spending millions on the effort. He has also campaigned in the key battleground of Pennsylvania, even as some of his efforts to register swing state voters have drawn legal scrutiny. Harris stumps in Philadelphia 9 days out from Election Day Guest speakers stir controversy The parade of guest speakers who preceded Trump seemed intent on creating controversial headlines for the party, hurling racist and sexist insults. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by Kill Tony, delivered a set that included inflammatory attacks on Puerto Ricans. 'There’s a lot going on. Like I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,' Hinchcliffe said, eliciting mixed reactions from the crowd. Harris campaign aides noted that Hinchcliffe's remarks came as the vice president was in Philadelphia speaking at a Puerto Rican restaurant, where she detailed her plans to assist the island and bolster its electrical grid. Others noted the key battleground of Pennsylvania is home to hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans. Carlson mocked Harris’s racial identity. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters Sid Rosenberg, a New York City radio host whose show Trump calls into periodically, blasted Democrats in derogatory and explicit terms. 'She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton. What a sick son of a bitch,' he said of the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee. 'The whole fucking party. A bunch of degenerates.' One speaker described Harris as 'the devil' and 'the antichrist.' Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani spent a portion of his remarks fear-mongering about Palestinians, saying they are taught to 'kill us at 2 years old' and are 'on the side of the terrorists.' 'Usually pre-game speeches matter little. Pretty remarkable Trump’s MSG warm up acts are all creating controversy and content that will hurt him,' senior Harris campaign aide David Plouffe posted on X. 'And that’s before his Soviet style speech that will generate much material of concern to the remaining undecided voters.' When will next COVID surge start? Experts weigh in Trump repeats ‘enemy from within’ attack The former president has drawn backlash from Democrats in recent weeks as he has repeatedly labeled his political rivals the 'enemy from within' and suggested his opponents are worse than foreign adversaries. On Sunday, Trump defended and repeated that line. 'When I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy. Becomes a soundbite – ‘Oh how can he say…,’' Trump said. 'No, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we’re fighting.' He later disparaged the press as the 'enemy of the people.' Trump has used the line repeatedly in recent weeks, including in an interview with Fox News when he suggested the military could be used to quell protests from his critics. Those comments have been at the center of criticism from some of his former top White House aides and from the Harris campaign. The former president’s insistence on using such harsh attacks against his critics come as some Republicans have claimed Democrats are going too far with their rhetoric by labeling Trump a fascist. DOD lacked paperwork for $1.1B in Ukraine aid: Inspector general Another tax proposal Trump rolled out one new policy, and it is one that echoed something first proposed by his opponent. 'I am announcing a new policy today that I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one. It's about time that they were recognized,' Trump said. Harris earlier this month introduced a new plan to expand Medicare benefits so that the program covers the costs of long-term home care for older Americans. The plan is aimed at helping the 'sandwich generation' who are caring for both their own children and their aging parents. Trump has previously called for eliminating taxes on tipped wages, overtime and Social Security benefits, though some experts have questioned how Trump would pay for those tax cuts without expanding the deficit.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-madison-square-garden-rally/	2024-10-27T18:49:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/donald-melania-trump-nyc-ap.jpg?w=900
Harris stumps in Philadelphia 9 days out from Election Day	Vice President Harris rallied voters in Philadelphia on Sunday as the race between her and former President Trump grows tighter nine days out from Election Day. Harris largely stuck to her stump speech in nearly 15 minute remarks from downtown Philadelphia, urging voters in battleground Pennsylvania to head to the polls. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'There is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days,' Harris told the crowd. Harris gave a special shoutout to young voters, in particular, praising them for their political activism on climate, gun control and abortion access. 'Is Gen Z in the house?' the vice president said. 'You are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient. You, who have only known the climate crisis — you are leaders in what we need to do to protect our planet.' 'You, who grew up with active shooter drills,' she continued. 'You, who right now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, understand the importance of fighting for the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.' Harris spent Sunday campaigning throughout the city, which will play a critical role in Democratic turnout within the battleground state. Earlier in the day, Harris visited West Philadelphia where she spoke at the Church of Christian Compassion, a Black church in the neighborhood, and visited a local barbershop. The vice president also made stops at a bookstore specializing in Black history, and a Puerto Rican restaurant. Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City rally 'Philadelphia is a very important part of our path to victory,' Harris told reporters. 'It’s the reason I have been spending time here.' Pennsylvania will likely play a consequential role in the election with its 19 Electoral College votes. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average shows a razor thin race, with Trump narrowly leading nationally, 48.5 percent to 48.3 percent. While Harris spent Sunday in Philadelphia, Trump was preparing to stump at Manhattan’s Madison Square Garden. The event is expected to draw thousands of supporters in deep blue New York City, including a number of Republican lawmakers. While New York City is considered a Democratic stronghold, it is home to a massive media market and in relatively close proximity to a handful of competitive House races.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-philadelphia/	2024-10-27T17:51:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/kamala-harris-philadelphia-rally-oct-27-ap.jpg?w=900
Melania Trump makes rare campaign appearance at New York City ral...	Former first lady Melania Trump made an exceedingly rare appearance Sunday on the campaign trail when she delivered remarks at her husband's rally in New York City. The former first lady was not listed among the expected speakers publicized by the Trump campaign, but she introduced her husband at the Madison Square Garden event. She spoke for less than 5 minutes, arguing the country was dealing with a decline in quality of life. Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'Let us charge together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let’s seize this moment and create a country for tomorrow — the future that we deserve,' Melania Trump said. She stood on stage and embraced former President Trump as he arrived for his speech. The former first lady has hardly attended any public campaign events with her husband. The Madison Square Garden event was the first rally she has appeared at during this cycle, and she attended the Republican National Convention in July, though she did not speak. The first lady hosted two fundraisers for the LGBTQ group Log Cabin Republicans this year: one at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and another in New York City. The former model made waves earlier this month when she wrote in her memoir about her support for abortion access and for women to make choices about their bodies 'based on their own convictions.' Democrats have hammered the 45th president on the issue of abortion, blaming him and his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices for the end of Roe v. Wade. Donald Trump said he told his wife that she should follow her heart when writing about the topic in her memoir.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/melania-trump-new-york-city-rally-msg/	2024-10-27T17:49:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/melania-trump-nyc-ap.jpg?w=900
Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled a new policy platform for Puerto Rico on Sunday, targeting the Latino vote ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election through promises of economic development and improved disaster response. While residents of Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections despite being American citizens, the message was aimed at more than 5.8 million people of Puerto Rican origin living on the mainland who can vote, according to Pew Research Center. The announcement gained additional visibility when Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny shared Harris' video message on Instagram, highlighting her criticism of former President Donald Trump's response to Hurricane Maria in 2017. Couple recounts surviving Hurricane Helene on floating couch 'Throughout my career, I've always fought for the people of Puerto Rico,' Harris said in the video. 'Every chance he got, Donald Trump abandoned and insulted them.' Harris outlined several initiatives, including creating a Puerto Rico Opportunity Economy Task Force to foster economic growth and create thousands of new jobs. She also promised to accelerate disaster recovery funds and modernize the island's electrical grid, which still experiences daily outages. 'I will cut red tape to ensure disaster recovery funds are used quickly and effectively, and work with leaders across the island to ensure all Puerto Ricans have access to reliable, affordable electricity,' Harris said. The video release follows Harris' March 22 visit to Puerto Rico, where she toured hurricane recovery efforts. During the five-hour visit, Harris visited a rebuilt home in Canovanas that Hurricane Maria had destroyed. Driving the vote: Nebraska’s electoral system divides voters 'I see we are making a difference. There is still more work to do,' Harris said during the visit, noting that the federal government has provided about $3 billion for reliable energy sources, including rooftop solar panels. The visit wasn't without controversy. A small group of protesters gathered in San Juan to demonstrate against Puerto Rico's territorial status and demand a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanted 'Yankee, go home!' while supporters responded with chants of 'U.S.A.!'

New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ imm...	New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) on Sunday defended Vice President Harris’s support for the bipartisan border legislation and pushed back on the suggestion that she was upsetting both poles of the party by sidestepping difficult issues on the topic. In an interview on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday,' Chris Stirewalt asked Grisham whether Harris's lack of response on whether she would continue building a border wall—coupled with her push for a conservative bipartisan border bill—has managed to push away voters from both extremes of the party. Michigan Republican: Trump ‘has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community’ 'I don't think that she is stuck. I think we've gotten stuck largely driven, frankly, by the Republican Party, and when the Republicans were in the majority,' Grisham said about whether Harris is stuck between these two dissatisfied groups. The border governor, also a Harris surrogate, said the vice president is not ruling out the possibility of doing more to improve immigration and border security by supporting the bill that never made it through Congress this past term. 'She is not eliminating the possibility that it could be bolder and bigger on either side of that equation,' Grisham said, 'protecting the people who are here, the folks who have followed the laws of this country once they got here, kids who knew no other country other than this one, than their own and their families, and also curbing illegal immigration at the border by creating upstream opportunities for getting visas and asylum protections.' 'That's smart, and I want the border security smart border security,' she said. 'That's what every border state governor wants.' New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority Grisham was asked about Harris’s response to reporters, who pushed the Democratic nominee to answer whether construction of a southern border wall would continue in her administration. 'I will tell you that my highest priority is to put the resources into ensuring that our border is secure, which is why I've been very clear I'm going to bring back up as president that bipartisan border security bill and make sure that it is brought to my desk so I can sign it into law,' Harris said in response this past week, in a clip that Stirewalt played on the show.

Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) said on Sunday the Muslim community in Michigan trusts former President Trump over Vice President Harris to guide Middle East policy. 'For the people of the state of Michigan, actions speak louder than words. I was just at a rally yesterday with former President Trump, and I can share with you, he has got a tremendous support from the Muslim community, and it's because they want peace in the Middle East,' McClain said in an interview on NewsNation’s 'The Hill Sunday' with Chris Stirewalt. New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority 'And they trust him much more as a leader than they ever would under Vice President Harris,' she continued. Stirewalt noted Trump has supported military action by Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem during his administration. He asked McClain whether she thinks the issue 'comes down to' whether 'they like his leadership vibe better.' 'I think they like the fact that under President Trump, there was peace in the Middle East. There weren't wars that were raging. We didn't have any Americans held hostage in the Middle East like we do now under this Harris and Biden administration,' she responded. 'That's what they liked.' New Mexico gov says Harris not opposed to ‘bolder and bigger’ immigration legislation Muslim and Arab Americans have pushed the Democratic ticket to take further steps to hold Israel accountable for Palestinian deaths stemming from its war with Hamas and other Iranian proxy groups in the region. A recent poll showed Trump leading Harris nationally among Arab American and Muslim voters, by 4 points, amid criticism of the Biden administration’s support for Israel.

Comedian calls Puerto Rico ‘island of garbage’ at Trump rally	(The Hill, NewsNation) — A speaker at former President Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday spent a portion of his time attacking Puerto Rico, drawing backlash from Democrats and the Harris campaign. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by Kill Tony, delivered a set to the crowd ahead of the former president’s speech. 'There’s a lot going on. Like, I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,' Hinchcliffe said, eliciting mixed reactions from the crowd. At another point, Hinchcliffe said Latinos 'love making babies.' Harris announces Puerto Rico policy targeting mainland voters 'They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They c** inside. Just like they did to our country,' he said. Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement that Hinchcliffe’s 'joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.' The remarks, particularly about Puerto Rico, were swiftly condemned by Democrats, as well as some Republicans. 'As a Puerto Rican, I am tempted to call Hinchcliffe racist garbage but doing so would be an insult to garbage,' Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) posted on the social platform X. 'When casting their ballots at the voting booth, Latinos should never forget the racism that Donald Trump seems all too willing to platform.' Harris campaign aides noted Hinchcliffe’s remarks came as Vice President Harris was in Philadelphia speaking at a Puerto Rican restaurant, where she detailed her plans to assist the island and bolster its electrical grid. Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally: 5 takeaways Other Democrats pointed out that hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans live in Pennsylvania, which is shaping up to be one of the most critical battlegrounds on Election Day. 'Who wants to tell these guys there are ~ HALF A MILLION Puerto Ricans living in Battleground PA, whose votes are up for grabs?' Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House official who is an outspoken critic of the former president, posted on the social platform X. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who is up for reelection in November, said Hinchcliffe’s comments were 'not funny' and 'not true.' 'Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans! I’ve been to the island many times. It’s a beautiful place. Everyone should visit!' Scott posted on X. 'I will always do whatever I can to help any Puerto Rican in Florida or on the island.' Former Puerto Rico governor demands Trump denounce comments Former Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló on 'NewsNation Prime' called on Trump to denounce 'egregious' and 'insulting' comments made by the comedian. 'We were just called garbage in Madison Square Garden, no less, the home state of over a million Puerto Ricans,' said Rosselló, who currently serves as a congressional delegate. 'This is egregious. It's insulting, and it will cost President Trump if he does not address this.' Rosselló emphasized Puerto Rico's contributions to the United States, noting the territory has one of the highest per capita military participation rates in the nation. He called the island 'an incubator that generates innovation and art' with a legacy of patriotism. 'If you do not denounce this strongly, this is what you're saying, this is what you're supporting,' Rosselló said, urging Trump to use his social media platforms to 'reject the statement of a comedian then recall his love for the people of Puerto Rico.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-rally-puerto-rico-garbage/	2024-10-27T14:35:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/puertorico_051922_ap_ricardoarguengo.jpg?w=900
Watch live: Trump, Vance rally New Yorkers at Madison Square Gard...	Former President Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) are campaigning in New York City on Sunday, holding an event at the iconic Madison Square Garden. The event is expected to draw thousands to the arena at the center of deep-blue Manhattan. Others expected to make an appearance include the former president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr., former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, billionaire Elon Musk, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), New York Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.). It’s extremely unlikely Trump will win the state, which hasn’t backed a GOP presidential candidate since 1984. With just over a week until Election Day, The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of early polls shows Vice President Harris with a sizable lead over the GOP nominee — 58 percent to 40.2 percent — in the Empire State. The rally is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT.

New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House maj...	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Democrats are going all-in on efforts to flip New York’s 4th Congressional District blue, funneling big names and money into the Long Island locale with hopes that a victory could help usher in a Democratic House majority next year. The district, which sits on the South Shore of Long Island, holds the title of most Democratic-leaning district currently represented by a Republican. The area broke for President Biden by 14.6 percentage points in 2020. But in 2022, Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito beat Democrat Laura Gillen for the district’s open House seat by 3.6 points, putting the liberal bastion in GOP hands for the first time in more than two decades. This year's race — one of the most competitive this cycle — is a rematch between D’Esposito and Gillen, a take-two showdown that has drawn outsize attention, and fundraising, on the national stage. In a sign of its importance, the top three House Democrats — Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — have visited to campaign with Gillen this month, while House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) recently made a stop for D’Esposito. Democrats need to net four seats to take control of the chamber next year, and Jeffries — speaking at a rally for Gillen in a packed Hempstead gymnasium — said the race is key to that effort. Early voting began Saturday in New York. 'No pressure on y'all,' Jeffries said. 'But one of four seats that we need to win.' Gillen is leading D’Esposito 53 percent to 41 percent among likely voters in a new Newsday/Siena College poll, with less than a month to go until Election Day. The margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. Money and turnout could swing race The race is one of 75 House rematches from 2022, according to Ballotpedia. And this time around, both candidates say the contest is different. Gillen, a former Hempstead town supervisor, told The Hill during a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office that additional resources, an earlier campaign launch and reverberations from the 2022 Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade are fueling her optimism this cycle. 'I didn’t have the resources to communicate at the level I’d like to to talk to women about what the Dobbs decision really meant, even if you live in a blue state. And also to talk about other issues that people care about,' said Gillen, seated next to Clark. 'In this race, I worked really hard, I got in early, I got the runway I needed to raise the resources to communicate to all the folks in this district at the levels I’d like,' she added. Gillen has also significantly outraised D’Esposito throughout the race: The Democrat has raked in nearly $5.69 million thus far, with D’Esposito trailing at $4.24 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The numbers mark a staggering increase from 2020, when Gillen brought in $1.83 million to D’Esposito’s $1.33 million. D’Esposito’s fundraising deficit is even larger when assessing outside spending. House Majority PAC, the fund associated with Jeffries, has spent $5.43 million on the race, while the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is endorsed by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), has funneled just $3.35 million into the rematch. In an interview with The Hill at Hempstead Town Hall, D’Esposito — after an hour-plus town hall with roughly a dozen veterans — pointed to his cash disadvantage when asked if this year’s race feels different from his 2022 match-up, and attributed it to the national Democratic Party. 'It’s the fact that Hakeem Jeffries wants to be Speaker of the House, and he wants it to run through New York,' D’Esposito said. 'And quite frankly, he should have chose someone else, because Nassau County is not gonna allow a liberal Laura Gillen to take this seat.' While the candidates cited the money game when discussing the difference between now and 2022, Jeffries had a different theory in mind: voter turnout. Republicans crushed Democrats in turnout in 2022. Of the 250,142 registered Democrats in the district, only 130,871 cast a ballot for Gillen — a 52.32 percent turnout. In contrast, of the 168,934 registered Republicans in the district, 140,622 came out in support of D’Esposito — an 83.24 percent turnout. Jeffries — during his gaggle with reporters after Gillen’s rally — said he is focused on turning out the Democratic vote this cycle, which will lead the party to victory in November. 'There were 100,000 Democrats who stayed home during the midterm elections in 2022,' Jeffries said, standing below a scoreboard in the gymnasium with the home score set to 11, the guest score at 5, and 20:24 as the time — an homage to Election Day. 'We’re going to make sure that those Democrats come out to vote, and when they do, it’ll ensure that Laura Gillen is elected the next congressperson from the 4th Congressional district.' Candidates moderate on immigration, abortion The purple nature of the district — Cook Political Report rates the race a 'toss-up' — has encouraged both candidates to moderate their stances on a number of hot-button issues. Gillen has taken the issue of immigration head-on, sending a letter to President Biden recommending executive action pertaining to the border and cutting an ad that directly addresses the matter. D’Esposito, meanwhile, has worked to present himself as a moderate on the issue of reproductive rights. Gillen’s immigration strategy mimics that of Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who leaned into the issue during his successful campaign to replace ousted Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.). 'I’m Laura Gillen, and I’m here at the border — of Nassau County,' she says in the ad. 'We’re 2,000 miles from Mexico, but we’re feeling the migrant crisis almost every day. So I want you to hear me loud and clear: You send me to Congress, I will work with anyone in any party to secure our southern border, lock up criminals pushing fentanyl and stop the migrant crisis.' Gillen told The Hill the issue of immigration is 'an issue that people in my district care about very much' before criticizing both parties for the 'lack of political will' to tackle it. Colleen Ryan, a D’Esposito supporter, mentioned immigration when asking a question at the incumbent’s town hall focused on veterans' issues. Afterward, she called the influx of migrants a 'problem.' 'I support immigration,' Ryan told The Hill. 'It is the problem with illegal immigration, and they are being transported around the country and they have a disregard for the law of the land. And that’s demoralizing. … I’m absolutely for Anthony D’Esposito stopping the lawbreaking.' If immigration has been a leading issue for Republicans, women’s reproductive rights has been a top issue for Democrats, with the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022 continuing to motivate liberal voters across the country. During a women’s reproductive rights roundtable at her campaign office, Gillen and Clark sought to paint D’Esposito as extreme when it comes to the issue of abortion, arguing he would sign a nationwide ban on the procedure and knocking him for calling it a 'state issue.' D’Esposito, however, has strongly rejected that interpretation. He told The Hill that he would never sign a nationwide abortion ban, touted his part in keeping an appropriations bill off the House floor that would have restricted access to the abortion pill mifepristone, and named bills he has co-sponsored that protect in vitro fertilization. 'When it comes to abortion, I have been a champion of women’s rights,' he said. Helene Spierman, a Gillen supporter who has lived in the district for 25 years, listed women’s reproductive rights as a top issue for her this cycle. 'That everybody has a voice and that people are created equal and that the government has got to trust that,' she said. 'I could say that it’s abortion, I could say that it’s the Constitution, I could say that it’s not going back to the 17th century, the 18th century, when the Constitution was written.' September surprise threatens to shake up race While those issues — and others — have dominated the campaign, a September surprise is threatening to shake up the race. The New York Times published a bombshell report last month alleging D’Esposito, shortly after being sworn into the House, hired his longtime fiancée’s daughter and a woman he was having an affair with. D’Esposito has repeatedly denied engaging in any wrongdoing and claimed he has abided by ethical standards throughout his tenure in Congress. He told The Hill the story was 'a political hit piece' and said he is 'absolutely not' concerned about backlash from the report on Election Day. That response, however, is not putting the story to bed. The Times report was the subject of the first question at the N.Y.-4 debate earlier this month, putting D’Esposito on the defensive out of the gate. He reiterated his denial, before reading off a number of headlines from right-leaning outlets calling Gillen’s ethics into question. Gillen, for her part, has leaned into the allegations against D’Esposito in the final stretch of the election. She referenced the report during her rally in Hempstead alongside Jeffries, and she tore into his alleged 'abuse of power' during an interview with The Hill. The Times report is likely to be a mainstay of Gillen’s final pitch to voters, in addition to her message on the economy, state and local taxes, immigration and women’s reproductive rights — an all-encompassing campaign trail blitz as Democrats look to reclaim the coveted seat after the crushing loss last cycle. 'A setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback,' Jeffries said at his rally with Gillen. 'We had a setback in 2022. Are we ready for a comeback?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/new-york-rematch-could-hold-key-to-democratic-quest-for-house-majority/	2024-10-27T14:02:47-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GillenLaura_102424ap.jpg?w=900
Crowd waits outside Madison Square Garden hours ahead of Donald T...	MANHATTAN, N.Y. (PIX11) -- Around eight hours before Donald Trump's campaign rally starts, a crowd has already amassed outside Madison Square Garden Sunday morning. The rally is expected to kick off around 5 p.m., but roads were already closed around the stadium early Sunday morning, and security was in place. The crowd was allowed into Madison Square Garden starting around 12 p.m. Yamamoto, Freeman lead Dodgers to 4-2 win over Yankees, 2-0 Series lead A crowd waiting outside Madison Square Garden hours ahead of a Donald Trump campaign rally. (PIX11 News) Before 8 a.m. Sunday, huge crowds of supporters in American flag and Trump merch lined the block around the venue. 'There's a lot of energy, people are very sleep-deprived, everyone woke up really early, but it doesn't matter people are so hyped up,' said Greenpoint resident Anthony Filipelli. 'Regardless if you support him or not, this event is just an iconic American event.' Trump will be accompanied by a host of high-profile speakers at Sunday's rally, including his running mate Sen. JD Vance, Rudy Giuliani, former presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his kids. Elon Musk is also expected to appear at Sunday's rally. One person, Michael Barbuzze told PIX11 News he had been at the venue since 5 a.m. 'I definitely am excited, I really wanted to see him,' one person in line told PIX11 News. 'I'm here to show solidarity. ... He calls it like he sees it.' Counter-protesters are expected to demonstrate at Sunday's rally, including billboard trucks and a town hall organized by the Lincoln Project. Organizers with Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice also planned to protest the event. When the rally was announced, local elected official Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal called for it to be canceled. 'This is a disastrous decision by Madison Square Garden that will endanger the public safety of New Yorkers and has the potential to incite widespread violence,' Hoylman-Sigal said in a post to X. Other elected officials, like Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, celebrated the rally. 'The Garden is the world’s biggest stage and the perfect forum for President Trump,' she said. A rally for Trump on Long Island in September drew huge crowds that camped out overnight and throughout the day of the rally. The following streets are expected to be closed Sunday for the Donald Trump rally: 33rd Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 32nd Street between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue 31st Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue 30th Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue Seventh Avenue will be closed to pedestrians from 34th to 29th Street This is a developing story.

Walz, AOC to play Madden on Twitch in an appeal to young men	Vice President Harris's running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) are set to play Madden NFL together on the live-streaming platform Twitch on Sunday. The announcement comes as the Harris campaign seeks to court young male voters, a voting bloc that former President Trump seems to be leading with in the polls. The Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll found that the gender gap among youth supporters of Harris and Trump more than doubled since the spring, growing from 8 percentage points in the spring, when President Biden was the Democratic nominee, to 20 points now, with Harris as the party’s candidate. Polling has also shown the Democratic nominee trailing behind Trump among male voters in key swing states. A CNN/SSRS poll from September showed Trump leading Harris among likely male voters in Pennsylvania by 15 points — 55 percent to 40 percent — and Harris leading Trump among female voters in the state by 11 points — 53 percent to 42 percent. The survey of likely voters in Nevada showed Trump with an 18-point lead among male voters, 57 percent to 39 percent, while Harris had a 16-point lead among female voters, 55 percent to 39 percent. The campaign has used Twitch to attract younger voters in the past, even using the platform, along with TikTok, YouTube and more than a dozen digital services, to stream the Democratic National Convention in August. This announcement also comes amid a series of ads on Yahoo Sports and DraftKings — platforms with predominantly male audiences — launched by the Harris campaign last week specifically aimed at winning over young male voters. Earlier this month, some Democrats expressed worry that Harris is struggling to engage men in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. 'She has a problem with men for the same reason Hillary Clinton did: because misogyny exists, as do outdated ideas about who should hold the presidency,' Democratic strategist Christy Setzer told The Hill earlier this month. 'Meanwhile, Trump has doubled down on this ‘strongman’ machismo and dictator’s act, playing ‘It’s a Man’s World’ at his rallies.' Clinton lost the male vote to Trump in 2016 by 11 points, 41 percent to 52 percent, while she won the female vote by 13 points, 54 percent to 41 percent.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/walz-aoc-to-play-madden-on-twitch-in-an-appeal-to-young-men/	2024-10-27T13:06:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/OcasioCortezAlexandria_AOC.jpg?w=900
Tropical disturbance 'likely to develop' this week, NHC says	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Although we're nearing the end of hurricane season next month, the tropics are still active and popping up with disturbances. A new system has formed in the Caribbean that is 'likely to develop' sometime this week, according to the National Hurricane Center. All hands on deck as Florida recovers abandoned boats after Helene and Milton In the 8 a.m. ET update on Sunday, the disturbance shows a 30% chance for development over the next seven days. The NHC said gradual development is possible through the end of the week, as it moves northward or northeastward over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The system first popped up on Saturday afternoon with a 20% chance over the course of seven days. Earlier this month, the Caribbean region was impacted by Tropical Storm Oscar, which made landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane before disintegrating as it headed toward the Bahamas.

Driving the vote: Nebraska's electoral system divides voters	(NewsNation) — Omaha, Nebraska, is punching far above its weight class politically thanks to a unique way of assigning electoral votes that could play a key role in the upcoming election. Omaha is the home of Kool-Aid, the frozen TV dinner and Marlon Brando, the epicenter of baseball and a city with history. During World War II, a Japanese balloon bomb exploded in the air just a few miles from what is now Charles Schwab Field. Driving the vote: Ohio voters swapping parties Nebraska has an unorthodox way of awarding presidential electors, departing from the winner-take-all model used by almost all states. Two of the state's electoral votes go to the statewide winner and the winner in each congressional district gets one elector. Now, Nebraska is a reliably red state, but its 2nd Congressional District, which includes Omaha, can and does go blue. That's earned it the nickname the 'blue dot.' The importance of Omaha isn't lost on the campaigns, with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on the ground in the area early, a clue they both feel that it could be crucial in what is shaping up to be a nail-biter election. The oversized role of Nebraska's 2nd District has put the home of the College World Series in the spotlight for a very different reason. NewsNation brought together voters from the diverse district, where party lines prevailed when it came to how people felt about the system. Republicans want the state to go back to a winner-take-all system. 'I think it's us and Maine are the only two states that give up the congressional districts to separate them,' said Tony Connor. 'I think there should be consistency in every state. So I would like to see some consistency.' Driving the Vote: Will Black voters swing Pennsylvania for Trump? On the other side of the aisle, many Democrats like that the state legislature has stood up to GOP efforts to roll back Nebraska's system of awarding electors. 'I don't believe in winner-take-all. I don't think it matches the people's choice as well as it should,' said Jean Couchey. 'I think there's too many enclaves within the state that are not represented by that.' The district is not defined by being a blue dot alone. Where Interstate 80 runs just south of downtown, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats. 'We're on I-80. We're right in the middle of the country, and there's a lot of trafficking that comes right through her,' said Colleen Brennan. 'Human trafficking is a big problem. Drug trafficking is a huge problem.' One issue that sparks debate? Immigration. '[My] first language was Spanish,' said Dulce Sherman. 'I learned English. I'm successful. I mean, I'm the example that not all people that come from immigrants are bad people.' The diverse opinions reflect the bigger conversations across the nation. 'In many respects, this district becomes a microcosm of society,' said Randy Adkins. Adkins is a professor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, where he teaches campaigns and elections. He's happy to see the nation learning about how the Cornhusker State handles the race for the White House. Driving the vote: Illinois farmers feel forgotten in blue state 'I think it is unique. I think it is more democratic, with a small 'D,' in the sense that even the minority is represented somehow in the state, in the Electoral College vote, which doesn't happen in 48 out of 50 states,' he said. 'Or at least there's a possibility of that.' Like the rest of the nation, diverse views can, at times, result in heated debate, especially on controversial issues like abortion. 'My grandchildren, I want the ability for them to have a say in my body, my right to decide what I do with my body,' Dulce Sherman said. Another voter disagreed. 'It's not their body, it's not their choice,' said William Duerr. 'That body is a separate entity, a separate human being.' Still, the state has a strong sense of community bolstered by smart, civil discussion as voters cast their ballots to see exactly how Nebraska's unique electoral system will play out in 2024.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/driving-vote-nebraska-electoral/	2024-10-27T10:26:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/Nebraska_2nddistrict_BidenTrump.jpg?w=900
Trump and Harris pledged to save Social Security. Here's what the...	(The Hill) — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both vowed to protect Social Security, but experts say both of their campaign platforms fall short of specific solutions for a program that faces threats to funding in roughly a decade. Recent estimates show not only would neither candidate’s agenda stave off the threat of insolvency — but that one’s proposals could worsen its budget outlook, absent ideas to tax or spending reforms to extend the lifetime of the program. Here’s some of what the candidates have said so far. Trump’s Social Security plans Trump drew attention during the summer by proposing eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits — one of a list of proposals aimed at providing tax relief to some Americans. However, experts have raised concerns about the costs of scrapping income taxes on Social Security checks and how it would impact the program’s finances. 'His proposal would have a significant financial impact on Social Security, because now, those income taxes that some beneficiaries pay account for about 4 percent of Social Security's revenues,' said Richard Johnson, senior fellow for the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Here’s what to do if you lose an absentee ballot before Election Day The combined trust funds for Social Security retirement and disability benefits are currently projected by the program’s trustees to run out in 2035, a year later than previously expected, after economic growth exceeded expectations last year. But under what Trump has proposed thus far, a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimated the program’s funds could run out by 2031 while increasing Social Security’s cash deficit by $2.3 trillion between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2035. A chunk of the cost comes from what the group identified as a roughly $950 billion price tag to eliminate income taxation of Social Security benefits. Trump’s campaign has come out strongly against the analysis, with its national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accusing the 'so-called experts' of being 'consistently wrong throughout the years.' 'President Trump delivered on his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare in his first term, and President Trump will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term,' Leavitt said. Leavitt said a second Trump administration would shore up Social Security funding by 'unleashing a new economic boom.' IRS unveils 2025 income tax brackets: Where do you fall? Still, Trump’s agenda leaves experts guessing as to what changes he would support to shore up solvency for the program. In the official 2024 GOP policy platform highlighted on Trump’s campaign site, the plan calls for 'no cuts' to Social Security and Medicare, as well as 'no changes to the retirement age.' Harris on Social Security Harris’s online campaign page has vowed she will protect Social Security and 'strengthen' the program by 'making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes.' As part of the rollout for the proposed fiscal 2025 federal budget earlier this year, the Biden-Harris administration additionally outlined a pitch to extend solvency for the program by focusing on higher earners, noting that 'middle-class and lower-income Americans pay Social Security taxes on all of their earnings, but higher-income Americans do not.' Extra check coming to some Social Security recipients in November: Here’s why At the time, the White House said the president also opposed benefit cuts and proposals to privatize Social Security. But experts and budget hawks say the vice president’s agenda is still missing key details about her plans to shore up the program’s finances. In a statement Tuesday, Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said 'neither presidential candidate has addressed this challenge, and every year we fail to take action it only becomes more difficult to fix.' 'Overwhelming majorities of voters want candidates to prioritize solutions to strengthen Social Security, and the good news is that there are many available options to do just that,' he said, while also noting the program is 'less than a decade away from automatic, across-the-board cuts, putting many millions of current retirees at financial risk.' In the latest analysis by the CRFB, the group said Harris’s proposals 'would not have large effects on Social Security trust fund solvency.' Is this year’s COVID booster a good match for new variants? But polling has shown the program’s solvency is still one of importance for voters, with a recent poll out of the Peterson Foundation showing a vast majority of voters, 96 percent, say it’s important for 'candidates to have a plan to prevent automatic cuts to Social Security.' In their latest report over the summer, trustees projected the depletion date for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund, which pays out Social Security benefits to retirees, and the program’s smaller Disability Insurance Trust Fund, will be in 2035. Once the reserves of the OASI trust fund are depleted, the report projected that account income will only be able to cover roughly 80 percent of scheduled benefits for recipients. Experts say lawmakers will likely need to either agree to reductions on the benefits side, raising taxes, or both, to prevent automatic cuts to benefits for seniors if funds run out. Social Security announces 2.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2025 'The Social Security date has not changed much in probably the past decade, and yet, what we have seen is, with each presidential election, we’re getting closer and closer to that day of reckoning. And so we should become more and more urgent,' Johnson said. 'So, it's a little bit surprising that we haven't seen more specific proposals.' 'On the other hand, these proposals would involve some pain — either more taxes or lower benefits. And pain doesn't always win you votes,' he added. The Hill has reached out to Harris’s campaign for further comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-and-harris-pledged-to-save-social-security-heres-what-theyll-do/	2024-10-27T07:31:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24295819243226-e1729602526227_09e742-e1729713450753.jpg?w=800
Scrutiny over Sheehy’s military record grows in Montana Senate ra...	Intensifying scrutiny over businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy’s military record could shake up the Senate race in Montana, where Sheehy, the GOP candidate, is pulling away from Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in the polls. Sheehy, a decorated combat veteran, has been dogged for months by questions about a bullet wound he claimed he received during a firefight in Afghanistan after it came to light that a park ranger reported in 2015 that he shot himself accidentally in a parking lot at Glacier National Park. Sheehy now claims that he fabricated the story that he shot himself in the parking lot to explain to cover up for a fellow soldier whose bullet ricocheted into his arm during a skirmish in Afghanistan. Longtime observers of Montana politics say the late-breaking controversy of Sheehy’s military record could impact voters, though they question whether it’s enough to help Tester save his seat. 'It goes to credibility and from that standpoint it has the potential to impact the race,' said David McCumber, the former editor of The Montana Standard and the former regional editor for Lee Enterprises in central Montana. 'From what I hear and from reading accounts and ads, it’s clearly the topic of conversation,' he said, explaining that the question of credibility is 'where Sheehy is vulnerable with it.' 'He gets big points for being a decorated veteran. There’s no question about that,' he added, noting that Montana is home to many veterans who served in war. 'The default is that Sheehy is a veteran and deserves a lot of credit for that but I think this has the potential to undercut. It does deal with his military service and it doesn’t pass the smell test.' Sheehy served as a Navy SEAL officer in Iraq, Afghanistan, South America and the Pacific, earning a Bronze Star with Valor and a Purple Heart across dozens of engagements with enemy forces, according to his campaign website. Sheehy’s conflicting accounts of his arm injury was the subject of stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times earlier this month, but the issue is now getting more attention in Montana, where a group of military veterans supporting Tester this week demanded that Sheehy release his medical records. The Washington Post first broke the story that Sheehy told a park ranger in 2015 that he shot himself after dropping his revolver in a parking lot. The ranger, Kim Peach, told The New York Times in an interview: 'I am 100 percent sure he shot himself that day,' referring to the October 2015 incident that he responded to in Glacier. Peach says Sheehy told him at a hospital outside the park that his .45 caliber revolver discharged accidently after he dropped it, hitting him in the arm. Peach investigated the incident after a someone reported a shot being fired in a parking lot to the ranger station. In a written statement to the park service, Sheehy testified that 'while reloading our vehicle an improperly placed firearm kept in the vehicle for bear protection fell out and discharged into my right forearm.' Sheehy paid a $525 fine to settle the matter, as discharging a firearm in a national park is illegal. Sheehy’s lawyers told The Times that Sheehy did indeed sustain the wound in Afghanistan, but did not initially report the wound because he suspected it was caused by friendly fire. But when Sheehy went to the hospital nine years for an unrelated injury, doctors told him he needed to explain the bullet still embedded in his arm to law enforcement. The attorney said Sheehy made up the story of accidentally shooting himself to protect his former platoonmates and that any attempt to dispute his claim of being wounded in combat is 'tantamount to falsely accusing him of stolen valor.' Katie Martin, a spokesperson for the Sheehy campaign, said he 'served our nation with honor' and said attempts to raise questions about his character and military record were 'appalling.' 'Tim Sheehy humbly served our nation with honor and served alongside many heroes. Many of them never came home. Full stop. The bullet in Tim’s arm was a result of his service in Afghanistan. Tim never reported it because he didn’t want to trigger an investigation of his team, be pulled from the battlefield, and see a fellow teammate be punished,' Martin said. 'It was always about protecting a fellow team member of his unit he thought could have been responsible due to friendly fire ricochet in the heat of an engagement with the enemy,' the spokesperson added. 'To witness the media in cahoots with Jon Tester and his allies attempting to tear down a combat veteran’s record is appalling, and they should be ashamed of themselves. It shows just how desperate they are to win this U.S. Senate race. Jon Tester doesn’t care about veterans and their sacrifices; he only cares about another term in office.' Now Tester is pressing the issue in a new television ad highlighting skepticism about Sheehy’s claim that he was wounded in combat as he has described on the campaign trail. Tester ad shows a clip of Sheehy claiming 'I have a bullet stuck in this arm still from Afghanistan' juxtaposed with media reports that a national park ranger, Kim Peach, is certain Sheehy instead shot himself accidently. A new television ad was also launched this week by Senate Majority PAC, the Senate Democrats’ biggest super PAC, features a video clip of a former SEAL who trained with Sheehy contesting his one-time friend’s claim that he was shot in Afghanistan. 'Tim and I had about as close a working relationship in the platoon as possible. So when he says he took a bullet in the arm in Afghanistan, we all know it’s not true. We would have seen it, we would have heard about it,' said Dave Madden, the former SEAL who also shared his skepticism about Sheehy’s claim in an interview with The New York Times. NBC Montana, MTN News and other local media outlets have picked up on the story in recent days. Several military veterans supporting Tester held a press conference in Missoula Tuesday demanding that Sheehy release his medical records to help clear up the controversy. 'If Tim Sheehy really wants to tell Montanans the truth, he could come clean and release his medical records from the Kalispell hospital from that day in Glacier,' Jonas Rides At The Door, a Marine Corps combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served in Iraq, told The Daily Montanan. The Sheehy campaign responded Friday with its own television ad pushing back on Tester and others questioning his story of being shot in the arm during combat. 'Jon Tester is desperate and losing. Seen these Democrat lies?' the ad’s narrator says at the start of the ad, which labels the park ranger who blew the whistle on Sheehy 'a never Trumper.' Sheehy tells viewers 'I joined the Navy at 18, I met my wife in the military' and shares more details about his military service. He said he received the Purple Heart after 'being wounded by an IED' and a Bronze Star with Valor 'after carrying a wounded brother out of enemy fire.' He makes no mention of the bullet lodged in his arm, however. Martin said Sheehy got into the race 'to put our country first and won’t ever let any of this slander stop him from fighting every day as your next U.S. senator.' 'What Montanans know is that Tim Sheehy is an American Warrior who fought for our country and laid his life on the line for our freedoms. Anyone trying to take away from the fact that he signed up for war as a young man and spent most of his 20s in some of the most dangerous places in the world is either a partisan hack, a journalist with an agenda, or outright a disgusting person,' she said. Political handicappers have said that Sheehy, who is leading Tester in recent polls, is likely to win the race in a state that former President Trump carried by 16 points in 2020. But Democrats want to change the dynamics of the race in the final week by raising questions about his credibility and character. A group called Republicans for Tester has taken out full-page newspaper ads statewide next week accusing Sheehy of 'dishonesty about his service.' It features a blown-up image of the park ranger’s report of the shooting at Glacier and quotes from veterans criticizing the Republican candidate.
