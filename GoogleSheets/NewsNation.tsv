Hurricane Milton strikes Florida, officials warn of hurricane rel...	RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) -- Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida Wednesday night, following the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene roughly two weeks prior, which resulted in over 200 deaths and extensive property damage. As relief efforts continue, the United States Department of Justice is alerting the public to a rise in scams aimed at exploiting victims of these disasters. Milton started its destruction in California Wednesday, Oct. 9 as a Category 3 storm but has since weakened to a Category 1 as it travels across Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Thursday morning, the storm has cut off power to more than 3 million people, spawned a number of tornadoes and killed four people. According to the Justice Department, scammers are quick to exploit weather disasters and the people affected by them. Milton live updates: At least 10 dead, 2.8M without power in Florida The Justice Department, including the NCDF, stands ready to prevent these bad actors from fraudulent activity. We are here to support victims of natural disasters during these difficult times together with our state, local and federal partners, and agencies. In an effort to assist the most vulnerable neighbors who are susceptible to these types of fraudulent schemes, we encourage you to be diligent in reporting suspicious activity on their behalf. U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Gathe Jr. for the Middle District of Louisiana, Executive Director of the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) According to the department, the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, scammers will often use the following kinds of scams to take advantage: Fraudulent charities soliciting donations for disaster victims that often imitate the names of charities linked to the disaster. Scammers impersonating government officials, offering disaster relief in exchange for personal information or money. Scammers promoting non-existent businesses or investment opportunities related to disaster recovery, such as rebuilding or flood-proofing. Price gouging for essential goods and services needed by disaster victims. Businesses using supply chain disruptions as a cover for collusion to overcharge customers. The department encourages people to exercise caution before giving money or personal information to someone on the phone, and reminds people of the following: Only scammers will insist that you pay for services by wire transfer, gift card, payment app, cryptocurrency or in cash. If they promise to help you qualify for relief for a fee, it is a scam. You should never sign your insurance check over to someone else. Make sure you research contractors and get estimates from more than one before signing a work contract. Get a written contract for repairs and read it carefully before signing. Jonathan McNamara with the American Red Cross emphasized to 8News that the organization will never request money or personal information through phone calls. As Florida grapples with the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, officials urge residents to stay informed and cautious, ensuring that their donations reach legitimate organizations working to aid those in need. If you do get a scam call like this, you can report it to the National Center for Disaster Fraud by completing a Disaster Complaint Form or by calling 866-720-5721, which is a hotline staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/hurricane-milton-strikes-florida-officials-warn-of-hurricane-relief-scams/	2024-10-10T17:15:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hurricane-_1530463789233_47339741_ver1.0.jpg?w=900
Tampa sees 5x the usual October rainfall due to Hurricane Milton	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton's landfall as a Category 3 hurricane didn't just bring devastating storm surge and extremely dangerous wind speeds, it also left Tampa Bay soaked with historic rainfall. Tampa Bay faced a potential threat of catastrophic 15-foot storm surge, but this was averted when the hurricane swerved into Sarasota County near Siesta Key. How to help Helene and Milton survivors However, this meant that the counties north of Milton's eye were hit by heavy rainfall. St. Petersburg saw 15 to 18 inches of rainfall, while areas in and around Tampa saw 12 to 13 inches of rain. Even counties further inland saw historic levels of rain, well after the hurricane hit land. 'In fact, in some areas, it's about a once-in-a-500-year event, believe it or not,' said Jeff Berardelli, Max Defender 8 chief meteorologist. 'Very, very rare event in parts of our area.' In Tampa, Milton produced 12 inches of rain, more than five times the normal amount of rain for October. The normal amount for the entire month is usually 2.3 inches of rain. At times, people think of hurricanes as more of a threat when it comes to storm surge or winds, but with rain like this, Tampa Bay residents saw unprecedented flooding that struck their neighborhoods and homes, even outside the evacuation zones. Video: Hurricane Milton sucks water out of Tampa Bay 'We're talking a foot and a half of rainfall, and now that is what is leading to those lower-lying areas where you hear people say, 'Well we don't normally flood. We're not in an evacuation zone,'' Max Defender 8 Meteorologist Amanda Holly said. 'Well, when you get 18 inches of rain over a big area, yeah, you will see abnormally high water levels get into areas that don't normally flood.' With the heavy rainfall brought by hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton, 2024 has become the wettest year on record for the Tampa Bay area. After Milton, Tampa saw 77.11' inches of rain, more than 32.93 inches more than the normal yearly amount. 'Even if we don't get another drop of rain for the entire rest of the year, we will end the wettest year on record in Tampa,' Holly said. While the rains are out of our area, there is a fear of river flooding as they crest after the hurricane. The Anclote River, the Hillsborough River, the Little Manatee River, the Alafia River, and the Manatee River are all areas of concern. However, Tampa Bay will now experience some dry northern air that will reduce the humidity. 'It couldn't take the rain chance out completely, but I really think that outside of getting a quick little sprinkle, the day is going to feel comfortable,' Max Defender 8 meteorologist Leigh Spann said. 'And it's going to stick around with nice dry conditions all the way through the weekend.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/tampa-october-rainfall-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-10T16:59:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177054224-e1728604536853.jpg?w=800
TikToker Morgan Roos on riding out Milton: ‘It got dicey’	(NewsNation) — TikToker Morgan Roos updated her fans Thursday morning on what happened overnight as she rode out Hurricane Milton from her high-rise apartment on Tampa’s Riverwalk. 'It got dicey,' she said. 'I’m so grateful and so blessed to be OK.' Roos, a new Tampa resident, recounted spending the night in the hallway of her apartment building. 'I could hear on the upper floors a banging, like a window had popped. That was, like, getting my anxiety all high,' she said. At least 10 dead following Milton landfall in Florida 'Then at about 4:30 in the morning, I hear, like, this huge bang noise? And I can hear rushing water. And I hear, like, down the hallway, and I see water droplets. And I look down, and there’s like f------ water coming out of a light.' Roos said she then decided to go back inside her apartment, where the windows were intact, but water was everywhere. She also apologized for not taking video of the damage in real time. After getting back to sleep after 5 a.m., then waking up late Thursday morning, Roos reflected on sustaining a little water damage and losing her Wi-Fi connection for a while. 'You know like when you finally feel safe after a really stressful situation? Your body like kinda collapses? That’s how I felt,' she said. Floridian who rode out Milton ‘wouldn’t stay’ if he had do-over On Wednesday afternoon, as Milton approached the Florida Gulf Coast, Roos told 'NewsNation Now' she was having second thoughts about staying. 'I think I really, really, really underestimated this,' she said at the time.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/tiktoker-morgan-roos-milton/	2024-10-10T15:45:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/morgan.png?w=589
Are more hurricanes heading for Florida? Not at the moment	(NewsNation) — As Hurricane Milton exits Florida, the National Hurricane Center is continuing to monitor another system in the Atlantic, which is not expected to make landfall or come close to the U.S. According to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. Thursday advisory, Tropical Storm Leslie was about 1,710 miles west-southwest of the Azores, a group of islands in the mid-Atlantic. The storm is expected to turn north tonight and veer away from the U.S. over the next few days. Photos: First look at Siesta Key after Hurricane Milton 'Rapid weakening is forecast to continue during the next day or so, and Leslie is forecast to lose tropical characteristics in a few days,' the NHC said in its latest update. There have also been false rumors on social media of a 'Hurricane Nadine' heading toward Central Florida. Nadine is indeed the next name on the list of tropical storms for 2024, but as of right now, nothing has developed. Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA's plan for aid? 'I don't see anything that's coming our way anytime soon,' said Justin Mosley, a meteorologist at NewsNation affiliate Suncoast News Network. So far, there have been 13 named storms in the 2024 hurricane season, which lasts until the end of November. Two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene hit the Big Bend region of Florida as a Category 4 storm, killing more than 200 people and leaving a wake of destruction in its path. Now, at least 10 people are dead after Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night. More than 3 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida on Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/storms-heading-florida/	2024-10-10T15:30:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177012789.jpg?w=900
‘Gators, stingrays, snakes’: Floridians urged to avoid floodwater...	TAMPA, Fla. (NewsNation) — Florida officials are warning the public to avoid floodwaters caused by Hurricane Milton, saying a myriad of dangers are lurking in murky water. Frank Robb, an alligator expert and founder of the nonprofit group Environmental Education Awareness Research Support and Services (EEARSS), told NewsNation the dangers you face largely depend on where you live. 'If you're coastal, you have to worry about everything from stingrays to alligators, you know. If you're in South Florida, you gotta think about crocodiles, snakes — of course,' Robb said. 'It's definitely something to be aware of and keep on your mind.' Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment The worst storm surge appeared to be in Sarasota County, where it was 8 to 10 feet — lower than in the worst place during Helene. The storm also dumped up to 18 inches of rain in some areas. Robb recommends avoiding floodwaters at all costs but has advice for those who need to venture outside. 'Obviously, if it's not water you can see through, you probably shouldn't be wading through it,' he said. 'If you have to walk through it, carry a walking stick, something to put in front of you to feel where you're going.' Robb cautioned, however, that the most dangerous things dwelling in the depths of the dark water aren’t likely to be animals. 'You should be worried about microscopic organisms and bacteria. Those are the things to be really concerned about,' he said. 'Wildlife is going to be wildlife no matter what. The last thing they want to do is have an interaction with you. Again, it's the bacteria, pathogens and things of that nature that should really be on people's mind.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/floridians-urged-to-avoid-floodwaters/	2024-10-10T14:11:20-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2177829552.jpg?w=900
14-year-old found floating on fence in Tampa floodwaters after Hu...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – A 14-year-old was rescued after Hurricane Milton's floodwaters trapped him on a floating piece of a fence in the middle of Tampa, Florida. Video published by the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office showed Sheriff Chad Chronister and a deputy finding the boy floating on a street in front of a small grocery store. How to help Helene and Milton survivors 'Stay right there,' the rescue crew told the boy as they spun their boat around to grab him. Speaking with Melissa Marino of NewsNation affiliate WFLA, Chronister explained that the boy had evacuated from Hurricane Milton and was staying at a friend's house. However, when the boy tried to walk back home after the storm, he underestimated how deep the water was and could not swim well enough to get through. 'It was literally out of a castaway movie, him laying on top of a fence, waving at us,' Chronister said. 'Out of breath, gasping for air as we pulled him up.' Once the boy was pulled out of the floodwater, he was helped to solid ground before continuing home safely. Over 135 rescued from Tampa assisted living facility amid Milton flood That particular neighborhood was not in an evacuation zone, Chronister acknowledged. Still, it suffered what he had referred to as 'unprecedented' flooding. Hillsborough County Fire Rescue reported that 350 911 calls were made between 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and 3:30 a.m. Thursday. However, it is not known exactly how many people have been rescued yet.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/hurricane-milton-tampa-floodwaters/	2024-10-10T12:10:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/HCSO-RESCUES-14-YEAR-OLD-BOY.00_00_00_12.Still001.jpg?w=640
Here’s how to qualify for FEMA aid — including the $750 payment	(NewsNation) — Once an emergency is declared — like in the case of Hurricanes Milton and Helene — the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can unleash various types of aid. Much of what the agency does is give out money in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. That can include assistance to individuals affected by disasters, such as payments of $750 to pay for their immediate needs — like medicine or diapers — after a storm or earthquake hits. It can also mean additional money to rent an apartment because their home is destroyed or to pay for a storage unit. That $750, however, has been mischaracterized by several high-profile politicians, including former President Donald Trump. Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA’s plan for aid? He, and others, have claimed that the $750 payment is a loan and that is the only form of assistance FEMA is providing. The initial $750 is the first payment FEMA will make to storm survivors. They are also who eligible for other forms of assistance.

Tampa residents credit Native American legend for Helene, Milton ...	(NewsNation) — For more than a week, Hurricane Milton was forecasted to make direct landfall over the Tampa Bay area. Yet, in a last-minute wobble, the Category 3 storm veered away from the city Wednesday and spared locals from an anticipated massive storm surge. Instead, the hurricane made landfall in Siesta Key as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night. Now, Pinellas County residents are thanking a benevolent spirit they say guards them from storms and other hazards. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat The Tocobaga Tribe lore Local legend has it that mounds built by the Tocobaga tribe hundreds of years ago protected the area from major storms for centuries. The tribe lived in small villages between what is now Safety Harbor and the Gandy area, from 900 to the 1500s, but died out from disease and violence from Spanish settlers in the 17th century, according to Pinellas County’s website. In those villages, the tribe would build mounds made of layers of shells and sand. The mounds were used as temples, homes and burial grounds. The oldest remaining one is located near Old Tampa Bay. Some locals claim the tribe blessed the mounds for protection from hurricanes and other hazards, but we have yet to confirm the validity of their story. 'The Tocobaga tribe legend is big down here. People feel it keeps us safe,' Largo resident Denise Walenter-Just told NewsNation. Helene survivor says he had ‘guardian angel’ before rescue Locals praise Tocobaga for averting Milton Milton tracked to the south in the final hours and landed as a Category 3 storm Wednesday night in Siesta Key, about 70 miles south of Tampa. While it caused a lot of damage and water levels may continue to rise for days, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said it was not 'the worst-case scenario.' The deadly storm surge feared for Tampa appears not to have materialized, though the situation in the area was still a major emergency. The storm brought up to 18 inches of rain to spots in the Tampa and St. Petersburg areas. DeSantis said that the worst storm surge appeared to be in Sarasota County, where it was 8 to 10 feet — less than in the worst place during Helene. 'Everyone is thanking the Tocobaga for not getting a direct hit,' Walenter-Just said. Tampa City Councilman Bill Carlson said Thursday he and his neighbors were relieved when Milton took a last-minute turn away from their hometown. Carlson attributed the hurricane's southern wobble to the Native American spirit. 'Many people in the area believe there's a Native American spirit there that protects us from storms because it seems like every time a storm comes it either turns left or turns right,' Carlson said. The region didn’t escape the hurricane entirely. Carlson lives in a mandatory evacuation zone and spoke to NewsNation remotely from a hotel. Many people are still without power, and the city is asking residents not to venture out yet, cautioning about flooding and downed power lines. How to help Helene and Milton survivors Did Tocobaga legend cost lives? While locals thank the Tocobaga spirit, the legend has the potential to cause more harm than good in the Tampa Bay area. When Hurricane Helene dragged along Florida's western coast, residents refused to evacuate thinking the hit wouldn't do much damage to their area. However, local officials warned Floridians to evacuate ahead of the storm, saying Helene's storm surge could be deadly. It was. At least 12 people died in Pinellas County from the Category 4 storm. Helene hit the Tampa Bay area harder than any other hurricane in 103 years. While the property damage was mostly unavoidable, there didn’t have to be any deaths — the National Hurricane Center issued its first storm surge warning two days before Helene arrived, telling the barrier islands’ residents they should pack up and get out. Helene's devastation shocked locals. Walenter-Just said Pinellas County doesn't normally flood that bad before, so people don't evacuate, even though the news was stressing that Helene was going to be bad. 'People have had water before but four feet inside your home is just unimaginable,' she said. For Helene, most of Walenter-Just's neighbors and friends decided to stay put. She was also going to stay at her home just over the Indian Rocks Causeway Bridge but decided when Helene approached to retreat further inland to her daughter's place. For Milton, Walenter-Just boarded up her home and planned to stay with her daughter from the beginning. She wasn't taking any chances. United Cajun Navy deploys for 2nd time in 2 weeks for Milton Helene's devastation prevented additional casualties Seminole, Florida, resident Harry Berg rode out Hurricane Milton with his family instead of evacuating. He told NewsNation on Thursday morning that if he had to make that decision all over again, he wouldn't stay. 'I’ve never seen anything like this,' he said. After a very long night and lots of flooding, Berg concluded that he was grateful for Helene's initial impact. He explained that Helene gave the Tampa Bay area a 'little kiss' on its way by, leaving some destruction in its wake along the Pinellas County coastline. By doing so, it instilled a bit of fear within the locals. 'Everybody thinks that the Tampa Bay area is always going to be spared because of the Tocobago Indian lore,' he said. He said that because Helene hit just under two weeks ago, millions of people evacuated from the western coastline out of fear that what could happen with Milton would be worse than Helene. Berg ultimately believes the evacuations lowered Milton's casualty count.

Watch: Hurricane Milton sends massive crane crashing into office ...	(NewsNation) —A St. Petersburg, Florida, resident said he was 'terrified' the moment he heard a massive crane crash into a nearby building, fearing another would come down on him as fierce winds from Hurricane Milton pummeled the area Wednesday. The crane rammed into the side of a large office building Wednesday night, causing severe damage and partial collapse. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat Resident John Silling lives across from the building that was hit and told NewsNation he ran for cover after the crash. 'We heard a massive explosion. We heard glass shatter. We were pretty, pretty terrified,' he said. 'I ran into the stairwell of the building next to it in hopes that the other crane wouldn't come down,' he said. 'We kept looking out the window to see if the other one was coming.' Silling said he had gone through Hurricane Ian in 2022, but 'it was nothing compared to this.' The crane came down on a building previously occupied by the Tampa Bay Times newspaper.

Hurricane Milton: What is FEMA's plan for aid?	(NewsNation) — Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) leaders say about $11 billion is available for Hurricane Milton response efforts. So far, those efforts include urban and Coast Guard search-and-rescue teams, millions of meals and about 5,000 tons of water, among other aid. The FEMA relief process generally requires states to conduct individual assessments and calculations of the damages and then submit that information to federal government. Post-Milton gas in Florida will be a challenge: GasBuddy founder What aid is available for Hurricane Milton recovery? As of Thursday, FEMA said it has enough to help the most immediate emergency needs of people affected by Hurricanes Milton and Helene. FEMA can also tap into other funds that would divert resources for some longer-term projects to immediate needs. The response includes about 1,200 federal search-and-rescue personnel, three Coast Guard swift water rescue teams, tens of billions of meals and several tons of water to help storm survivors. More than 8,000 federal personnel, including FEMA disaster survivor assistance teams, have been deployed to neighborhoods across affected states, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Nearly 300 emergency calls pending in Sarasota County after Milton What future plans are in store? President Joe Biden spoke overnight with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan for the latest storm updates. He also spoke over the phone with mayors of Orlando and Sarasota. The Army Corps of Engineers, health care groups and debris removal experts also traveled to affected areas to aid with recovery. Hundreds of ambulances will be made available to medical crews and 5,000 Florida National Guard members were placed on standby ahead of the storm, according to the Pentagon. Biden’s schedule remained relatively clear Thursday morning. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are expected to receive updates throughout the day.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/fema-hurricane-milton-recovery/	2024-10-10T08:22:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175616737-1-1.jpg?w=900
Helene survivor says he had 'guardian angel' before rescue	GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (WJHL) - David Boutin was stuck in flood waters for six hours before being rescued when Hurricane Helene swept through the region. Tragically, one of the rescuers, Boone McCrary, lost his life while attempting to save Boutin. On Sept. 27, the Nolichucky River flooded into Boutin's home. He described seeing the water rise up his driveway. That's when he went outside to pull his van to safety. Then, he went back inside to retrieve his dog 'Buddy,' cell phone and wallet. 'When I went in the bedroom to get him [Buddy], it was ankle deep,' Boutin said. 'Within a minute, it was up to my waist. And I went outside the house to try to get to a ladder to get on the roof. And the river just took us, took Buddy from my arms. I just went pinning along trees. Every time I hold on to a tree, it'd break and I'd just go downriver even further.' Tennessee nurse and his dog died trying to save a man from floods driven by Hurricane Helene Boutin was stranded in floodwaters for six hours before rescuers reached him. 'I didn't think I was gonna get rescued,' Boutin said. 'I couldn't see where I was at. I didn't know. All I knew is hold on to trees. And if I went out to the middle of the river, I wouldn't have made it.' The following day, Boutin learned that Boone McCrary, a rescuer, had gone missing while trying to save him. McCrary's family knew he was out saving people when they heard his boat had hit a bridge and capsized. McCrary's mother, Debbie Fisher, heard he was being rescued, so she went to check at Bird's Bridge. 'They came up and I asked, 'are you going to have to carry Boone up?' So I thought maybe he was injured,' Fisher said. 'They said this was Boone. But I said, 'no, that's not my Boone.' And that's when the nightmare really started because I thought he was being rescued.' It was actually Boutin who was rescued, while McCrary's body was discovered days later. Boutin attended McCrary's funeral service to pay his respects. How to help Helene and Milton survivors 'It lifted a big weight off my shoulder, you know, walked up to his casket, put my hand on there and thanked him for risking his life for me,' Boutin said. Boutin said he is praying for McCrary's family and friends. 'I'm blessed,' Boutin said. 'He's my guardian angel. I wish it didn't go down how it did.'

McCrary's mother and sister said that's just how courageous he was. 'My brother lived life to the fullest,' Laura Harville, McCrary's sister, said. 'He always put himself last and put others first. And I think that if you were to look on social media, you can see that from what others have said. One of his friends that would come and hunt with him, made a story on Tik-Tok and it was true. He's just a good old boy. He'd give you the shirt off his back.' Fisher agrees. She said all of the devastation, plus losing her son, is very traumatizing. 'It did my heart good to see all the people that he had touched and changed their lives and how much love and support he had showed them and kindness,' Fisher said. 'It does my heart good, but I still would love to have Boone here with me. I woke up this morning, I decided it was going to be a better day because Boone would not be happy if I was just not together at all. I could see him saying to me Mom...' 'Don't embarrass me,' Harville added. 'Don't be crying and embarrassing me,' Fisher said. 'And he'd also tell me [he would] say, 'Mom, you better suck it up.'' Fisher recounted her liver transplant last year and how much her son was there for her during that time. Boone McCrary and his dog 'Moss' (Photo: Laura Harville) Both McCrary's mother and sister are grateful that Boutin is alive and was able to be rescued. 'His life is precious and I told him that we're happy that he made it out because he was in dire straits, too,' Fisher said. 'And I seen him rescued, and I'm thankful that he was saved. So Boone made these decisions, but I know without a doubt if he knew the outcome, he would make that decision again to help somebody.' 'No doubt, there's no doubt in my mind that he would do it,' Harville added. Harville said she is starting a non-profit in the memory of her brother called 'Boone's Brigade.' The aim will be to help others learn outdoor skills, like hunting, fishing and boating. Activities that Boone McCrary enjoyed. McCrary was also an emergency room nurse at Greeneville Community East Hospital. Harville and Fisher are thankful for all of the community's support. Fisher also believes it would be helpful if local law enforcement had a liaison to help families of missing people. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

His property on Little Indian Creek Road consisted of three houses on a compound that belonged to him, his brother and his father. All three houses no longer stand. Belongings are scattered around the property, and many were washed away in the river. Eight vehicles are a total loss. Boutin spent 10 years, building his own home. He also never found his dog, Buddy. 'For four years, he was my best friend,' Boutin said. 'And he was just ripped from my arms and I couldn't do [anything].' David Boutin and his dog 'Buddy' (Photo: David Boutin) Boutin sustained physical injuries from the night he was stuck in flood waters. 'I went to the hospital the next day because I was getting headaches real bad,' Boutin said. 'And they said I had a concussion. I had a bruised chest and I also had a respiratory infection from the river. Still right now, I got migraines that won't go away. No medical insurance, so I can't go back to the doctor and get a follow-up.' Boutin has also been grappling with the mental toll of the devastation. 'I have nightmares of that night,' Boutin said. 'It’s hard, especially when the migraines wake [me] up in the morning. With bad migraines, but I still go to work. I have to, it’s the only way I’m going to rebuild. I just have to keep going one day at a time.' Boutin expressed his desire to return to his property in some way, perhaps in a camper, houseboat or any kind of home. However, he's still not sure. 'I love this place. It means everything to me,' Boutin said. 'I did everything I could to make this place nice. And just within minutes, everything got torn away. A lot of years of work.' Boutin is currently staying at his son's house in Morristown. He has a donation page set up to help rebuild his life.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/helene-survivor-guardian-angel/	2024-10-10T07:40:56-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/David-2.png?w=745

Floridian who rode out Milton 'wouldn't stay' if he had do-over	(NewsNation) — Seminole, Florida, resident Harry Berg rode out Hurricane Milton with his family instead of evacuating. However, he told NewsNation's Markie Martin that if he had to make that decision all over again, he wouldn't stay. 'I've never seen anything like this,' he said. Berg has lived in Seminole since 1975. His home is 26 feet above sea level yet Milton caused flash flooding through his neighborhood.

Nearly 300 emergency calls pending in Sarasota County after Milto...	(NewsNation) — Nearly 300 emergency calls were pending Thursday morning in Sarasota County, Florida, as first responders prepared to begin search-and-rescue efforts in the hours after Hurricane Milton’s landfall. Strong winds whipped by police headquarters and the area’s emergency center as workers fielded hundreds of calls related to the Category 3 hurricane, Sarasota County Sheriff Kurt Hoffman said. ‘I’m fine’: Tampa’s ‘Lt. Dan’ survives Hurricane Milton on his boat 'I’ve lived here over 40 years and 30 years in law enforcement in this community,' Hoffman told NewsNation on 'Morning in America.' 'This is the first time I’ve seen a mass exodus during a storm like this. You could tell from our interstate being backed up and, frankly, our roads were vacant of any traffic early on before the storm.' The county sent teams out at about 3 a.m. to check the streets. The main roadways were clear as of Thursday morning, despite some downed trees and power lines throughout the area, he said. Hoffman spoke with NewsNation before sunrise. Once daylight comes, crews will begin door-to-door outreach and search-and-rescue efforts, he said. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

The time for cleanup between Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton was limited. Officials moved fast to clear what they could, but it’s unclear how much damage may have been caused by the significant amount of debris that collected on nearby barrier islands, Hoffman said. 'Certainly, with Helene and with (Hurricane) Debby, the folks here on this coast are just very tired of hurricanes, for sure,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-florida-sarasota-county/	2024-10-10T06:20:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176987645.jpg?w=900

Dan' and who went viral on social media for refusing to evacuate his boat ahead of Hurricane Milton has survived the storm. NewsNation's Brian Entin went to check on him late Wednesday night after the storm had swept through. 'I'm fine,' he told Entin. Video: Wind tears roof off Tropicana Field, home of the Rays Lt. Dan, whose real name is Joseph Malinowski, went viral from videos posted by TikTok user Tampa Terrence, which gained a large following of people who were worried because he refused to evacuate the sailboat where he was living. Like the popular character from 'Forrest Gump' who refused to leave his boat during a massive storm, Tampa's Lt. Dan is missing a leg. 'I'm not going anywhere because the safest place to be is on a boat in a flood,' he said ahead of the storm. 'We learned that with Noah. Everyone who stayed on land drowned. Noah and the animals lived.'

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Days before the hurricane, Malinowski rejected offers of help from people and was even visited by Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw, who asked him to leave. However, the man continued to refuse to evacuate hours before Hurricane Milton was supposed to make landfall. 'You're all robots,' Malinowski said. 'You're all sheep, following the masses.' At a Wednesday midday press conference, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said Tampa police rescued 'Lt. Dan' and took him to a shelter that morning. However, he made it back to his boat by afternoon. 'He is here,' Entin said. 'He is definitely on the boat. We can see him. He keeps popping his head out, and I just saw his hand.' Milton barreled into the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after plowing across Florida, pounding cities with ferocious winds and rain, and whipping up a barrage of tornadoes. It compounded the misery wrought by Helene while sparing Tampa a direct hit.

Video: Hurricane Milton sucks water out of Tampa Bay	(NewsNation) — Tampa Bay experienced a rare reverse storm surge as Hurricane Milton made landfall Wednesday evening, temporarily drawing water out of the bay and exposing parts of the bay floor that are typically submerged. Video taken by NewsNation's Brian Entin showed the seawater heavily receding by Bayshore Boulevard. 'All the water has run out of the bay,' Entin said. This phenomenon occurs when strong winds blow offshore, forcing water out of coastal bays, as explained by Peter Stempel, an associate professor in landscape architecture at Penn State, in a 2022 blog post. But, the effect is temporary. Video: Massive 28-foot wave captured inside Hurricane Milton The Florida Division of Emergency Management warned people not to walk on the exposed bay floor because the water would eventually rush back in, posing life-threatening risks. Due to how dark it was Wednesday night, it was not known how much the water receded. Milton made landfall as a powerful Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, Florida, at about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Meteorologists feared that if Milton had hit Pinellas County directly, it would bring a life-threatening storm surge of up to 12 feet to the area. However, storm surge warnings remained in effect for several parts of Florida Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/video-hurricane-milton-sucks-water-out-of-tampa-bay/	2024-10-10T00:46:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/bay.jpg?w=900
Video: Wind tears roof off Tropicana Field, home of the Rays	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton made landfall in Siesta Key, south of St. Petersburg late Wednesday, and while the city avoided some of the worst storm surges, the local Major League ballpark took some damage. City officials confirmed high wind gusts from Hurricane Milton tore multiple panels off the roof of Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays.The field was not in use as a storm shelter but functioned as a staging area for storm response crews, according to the Associated Press. It was not clear Wednesday night how much damage the interior of the building had suffered. The stadium opened in 1990 and initially cost $138 million. It was due to be replaced in time for the 2026 season with a $1.3 billion ballpark, according to AP. Additionally, the city confirmed a crane collapsed onto an office building near Central Avenue. No injuries have been reported due to either incident, according to city officials as of midnight. Officials urged the public to stay sheltered in place overnight and avoid both areas until further notice. According to WFLA Chief Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli, St. Pete saw peak wind gusts of 91 MPH, among the highest in the Tampa Bay area after Milton made landfall. Other areas seeing peak wind gusts include Sarasota Bradenton International Airport (102 MPH), Egmont Channel (105 MPH), and Clearwater Beach (90 MPH), according to Berardelli.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/video-wind-tears-roof-off-tropicana-field-home-of-the-rays/	2024-10-10T00:36:39-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/hailey_img_2024-10-09_11-24-44.jpeg?w=589
Live Updates: Milton pummels Florida as Cat 1 Hurricane	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton has brought vast amounts of flooding, damage and debris to much of the Florida peninsula Thursday morning after it made landfall as a Category 3 Hurricane Wednesday evening. As of 11 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said a 'large area of life-threatening storm surge' was occurring along portions of the West-Central coast of the state and that heavy rainfall throughout Thursday would continue to bring the risk of 'catastrophic and life-threatening flash and urban flooding.' A couple hours later, Milton was downgraded to a Category 1 Hurricane as it continued to slam its way across the state.

Hurricanes’ potentially deadly legacy: Flesh-eating bacteria	(NewsNation) — The water that Hurricane Milton leaves behind may be just as deadly as the winds and storm surge, according to infectious disease experts. Flesh-eating bacteria is out there and looking for a way into your body. 'Within the waters, we find this vibrio ... it’s actually a bacteria. And bacteria can be ingested in the water,' said Dr. Norman Beatty, with the infectious diseases division at the University of Florida. 'Most of the time, what we see after a hurricane is we have volunteers or homeowners are out, and they are cleaning up the mess. They’re out in the storm surge waters. And that vibrio bacteria is penetrating through the skin. You step on a nail, slice your leg, you get an open wound and the bacteria gets in,' Beatty said. Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage Beatty told NewsNation’s 'Banfield' that flesh-eating bacteria took quite a toll two years ago after Hurricane Ian. 'There were 38 confirmed cases right after the storm, and at least 11 people died,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/hurricanes-legacy-flesh-eating-bacteria/	2024-10-09T21:48:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2174887918.jpg?w=900
Post-Milton gas in Florida will be a challenge: GasBuddy founder	(NewsNation) — A lot of gas stations in western Florida have run out of gas and getting them restocked once Hurricane Milton passes won’t happen overnight, said an expert who tracks gasoline prices nationwide. 'Almost a quarter of gas stations in Florida don’t have gasoline,' said Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at the gasoline analysis site GasBuddy. 'In Tampa … 63% of stations don’t have gasoline right now,' he told NewsNation’s 'CUOMO.' Once the storm passes, De Haan said it could be a few days, or it could be two or three weeks, before every gas station in western Florida can fill up. ‘Multiple fatalities’ at senior community after tornado outbreak in Florida: reports 'It’s not like these outages are going to just magically going to solve themselves. There are still a lot of complications from this storm.' He said that those complications involve the main gasoline gateway for most of the Gulf side of Florida, he said. 'A lot of it’s going to be contingent on the Port of Tampa and Port Manatee. Potentially, there could be damage. The Coast Guard’s going to have to do assessments to see if those ports can accept shipments of barges from Texas and Louisiana refineries,' said De Haan. Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage He added that, in the rest of the U.S., gas prices are beginning to stabilize following four years of downs and ups, starting with demand plunging during the COVID pandemic then surging in the first months of the Russia-Ukraine war. 'Now, a couple of years into this, we’ve seen a little bit of normalization happening. The U.S. is still producing a record level of crude oil. The U.S. is still the world’s largest energy producer, and that’s part of the reason why gas prices have gotten closer to what many Americans consider normal,' said De Haan.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/post-milton-florida-gas-challenge-gasbuddy-founder/	2024-10-09T21:22:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176921951.jpg?w=900
Multiple fatalities' at senior community after tornado outbreak ...	Related video: St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office facility damaged by tornado FORT PIERCE, Fla. (WFLA) — Multiple people were killed at a senior community as Hurricane Milton spawned tornadoes in Florida, according to local reports. The fatalities occurred at the Spanish Lakes Country Club in Fort Pierce, the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office confirmed to NBC affiliate WPTV and ABC affiliate WPBF. However, it's unclear how many people were killed. Dozens of agencies, including the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, responded to the community where dozens of homes are being searched as search and rescue operations are currently underway. Flash flood warnings issued for coastal areas in Milton’s path 'We have dozens of homes in St. Lucie County that have been damaged, some catastrophic damage,' St. Lucie County spokesman Erick Gill told WPTV. 'We are working with the St. Lucie County Fire District ... National Guard, as well as units from the sheriff's office and even first responders from surrounding counties to help with search and rescue.' Gill said the goal is to help survivors and do damage assessment. TikToker ‘Lieutenant Dan’ says he’s riding out Milton on his boat 'We have three shelters that were already open, but we're looking at converting another school to a fourth shelter to take care of those who may have been displaced by the tornadoes that ripped through our area this afternoon,' Gill said. Gov. Ron DeSantis said there have been 116 tornado warnings with 19 confirmed touch downs. Kevin Guthrie, the director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said about 125 homes were destroyed statewide, mostly mobile homes in senior communities. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Siesta Key as a Category 3 storm around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/multiple-fatalities-at-senior-community-after-tornado-outbreak-in-florida-reports/	2024-10-09T20:27:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-1889004791-e1709502647468_d84f8c.jpg?w=800
Hurricane Milton could cause $175B in damage	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton could result in losses of up to $100 billion for the global insurance industry, creating a surge in 2025 reinsurance prices that could boost some insurance companies' shares, analysts said on Wednesday. The hurricane is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida late on Wednesday or early Thursday. It is potentially one of the most destructive to hit the region, which is recovering from Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago. Analysts at Jefferies estimated a mid-double-digit billion-dollar insured loss would follow a major hurricane impact in one of Florida's most heavily populated regions. ‘Not so confident in my decision’: Tampa woman to ride out Milton 'A 1-in-100-year event is estimated by some to result in $175 billion in losses for landfall in the Tampa region and $70 billion in losses in the Fort Myers region,' they wrote in a note, outlining an extreme scenario. Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics, told NewsNation that Milton could cause damage similar to that of Hurricane Katrina. 'Just for context, do you remember Hurricane Katrina, that was the 2005 Category 5 that hit Louisiana? That cost $160 billion in today's dollars, and that includes the property damage — both insured and uninsured.' Zandi said that the federal government will ultimately step in and help those impacted by the storm. 'The insured loss is ultimately covered by the federal government,' he said. 'So the federal government has been coming in and making everyone whole — ultimately whole. I mean, obviously, what the damage this creates is enormous to people, but the economic damage is made whole by the federal government.'

Milton has a ‘really bad feel to it,’ says Florida man riding out...	PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla., (NewsNation) — A Pinellas County man tells NewsNation that while he’s lived in Florida for many years, Hurricane Milton has a particularly ominous feeling about it. 'We're starting to get some of the outer bands,' said Harry Berg, a local resident and uncle of NewsNation meteorologist Max Tsaparis. 'This storm has got a really bad feel to it — and I've been here for many years.' Berg said his decision not to evacuate the area doesn’t mean he isn’t taking the storm seriously. But it’s part of 'being a Floridian.' Floridians told to shelter in place as Milton approaches 'You have to prepare for this. What we're getting ready to face is something that we've never seen before, the likes of this … to make a long story short, you just have to make sure you're repaired.' Berg said his primary concern at the moment is wind. He added that if conditions become too dangerous by Wednesday afternoon they will 'seek shelter.' 'We have hurricane-proof windows, we’re boarded up correctly, we have enough rations, we have generators, we have everything,' he said. The National Hurricane Center has predicted Milton will likely weaken, but remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/pinellas-county-man-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-09T13:44:53-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176991288.jpg?w=724
‘Not so confident in my decision’: Tampa woman to ride out Milton	TAMPA, Fla. (NewsNation) — Morgan Roos, a Tampa resident who has decided not to evacuate the area ahead of Hurricane Milton, tells NewsNation she is having second thoughts about staying. Roos, who has 650,000 followers on TikTok and nearly 10,000 on Instagram, said she’s only recently moved to the area from Colorado. 'I am directly on the riverfront,' Roos told NewsNation. 'I am standing in front of my windows right now, and I would say, maybe 200 feet away is the Hillsborough River. I was here during Helene. I decided to wait that one out, and I watched the water rise, but it only came up on the Riverwalk. And now I am not feeling so confident in my decision.' ‘You are going to die’: Tampa mayor warns against ignoring Milton evacuation orders Roos said she’s not currently looking for a shelter for a variety of reasons. 'Truthfully, no,' she said. 'And the reason I say no is because I've got two dogs with me; got my mom here. The only sense of community I have here in Florida are people who live in my building, and they're all hunkering in together. So we're going to pull resources and go that way.' Roos said while she believes the city is prepared and that Gov. Ron DeSantis has been doing a 'great job,' she’s concerned about how the community will fare following back-to-back crises with Helene and Milton. 'The thing that scares me the most is just the fact that Helene hit two weeks ago,' she said. 'When I've been driving like, up and down the residential neighborhoods, there's debris stacked like eight feet high. I know that the governor has been doing a great job ... but it does scare me.' Hurricane Milton: Where will zoo animals go? Despite not being a native Floridian, Roos thinks she’s as prepared as can be expected. 'I think I really, really, really underestimated this,' she said. 'But I have four cases of water. My neighbors told me they have a bunch of flashlights. I have food, I've got a propane tank. I did everything that the internet told me to do. I just didn't get a flashlight in time.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/morgan-roos-hurricane-milton/	2024-10-09T11:56:05-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-5.jpg?w=900

Hurricane Milton dropped to a Category 4 early Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center had predicted it would likely weaken but remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday. The Tampa Bay area, home to more than 3.3 million people, faced the possibility of widespread destruction after avoiding direct hits from major hurricanes for more than a century. 'I know everybody is worried about me. Everyone wants me to get off the boat … I have a secured anchor point. If the tide goes up, I go up. As long as the water stays out of the boat, I’ll be fine,' Malinowski said. 'It’s not a tornado; it’s not going to be thrown up into Kansas. I’m not suicidal.' ‘You are going to die’: Tampa mayor warns against ignoring Milton evacuation orders Malinowski previously rode out Hurricane Helene from the same boat. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor previously said Wednesday that Malinowski had been rescued by local officials and was in a shelter. 'The Tampa Police Department, this morning, just saved Lieutenant Dan,' Castor said at a press conference Wednesday. 'He has been rescued, and he is now in a shelter as well. If we can get Lieutenant Dan to go to a shelter, we can get anybody to do that.' Entin noted on X, formerly Twitter, that Castor is wrong, and Malinowski is still on his boat.

Milton evacuations spark traffic jams, fuel shortages	MIAMI (NewsNation) — As hundreds of thousands of Floridians flee the Gulf Coast, some are finding themselves in traffic backups and gas stations with empty fuel pumps. It’s estimated that nearly 25% of the state’s gas stations are out of fuel ahead of Hurricane Milton. Some of Florida's major highways, including Interstate 75 and Interstate Four have been seeing major backups and delays on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Florida Department of Transportation, in some instances, has opened up shoulder lanes of some of those major highways to try and speed up evacuations. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has assured people that his administration is working to bring emergency supplies into the state, with some fuel trucks even being escorted by law enforcement. The time to evacuate and get that fuel to people who need it is running out. LOOK: Tornado crosses Florida interstate as Hurricane Milton churns closer 'It's been, I would say, a tremendous task to get gas,' said Ralph Douglas, a resident of Ruskin, Florida. 'Because right now, if you drive from different areas, like during the course of the day, it was difficult because when you drive by, people don't have any gas.' Some hotels across the state are also filling up with evacuees. Booking.com says 98% of the hotels in Tallahassee are booked through next Wednesday. The mayor of Jacksonville said hotels in their downtown are full. Those who have been able to find a room say they were especially concerned about a life-threatening storm surge, the expected widespread power outages, and of course, this back-to-back hit from hurricanes. Hurricane Milton: Where will zoo animals go? Hurricane Milton dropped to a Category 4 early Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center had predicted it would likely weaken, but remain a major hurricane when it makes landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday. The Tampa Bay area, home to more than 3.3 million people, faced the possibility of widespread destruction after avoiding direct hits from major hurricanes for more than a century.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/milton-evacuations-fuel-shortages/	2024-10-09T11:01:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176725936.jpg?w=900
Speaker Johnson to discuss Helene damage in North Carolina	(NewsNation) —Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is in Western North Carolina touring the damage done by Hurricane Helene. Johnson is expected to criticize the federal response to the disaster when he speaks in the Biltmore Village neighborhood of Asheville, one of the hardest-hit areas of the city. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved through the Southeast, but heavy rains and winds downed trees and brought massive flooding to towns in the Blue Ridge mountains. When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida? Many in the area remain without power or water more than a week after the storm, with smaller communities cut off thanks to damaged or washed-out roads. The damage to the region is extensive, with homes and businesses demolished and entire towns like Chimney Rock and Hot Springs virtually destroyed. Areas along the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers fared the worst, including the historic Biltmore Village, a popular tourist area located near the Biltmore Estate, which remains closed to visitors. Residents Jacqueline Twohig and Doug Frieders saw the river rising and got out just in time. Their neighbors were not so fortunate, and videos showed their condo floating down the flooded river. 'All of your memories, your whole life, everything you’ve built, just crashing in the blink of an eye,' Twohig said. 'Thinking, we could have been in there, like if I didn’t get up because I was feeling hot and going to turn on the fan, we could have been in there until it was too late. Just like the others were.' As Hurricane Milton heads toward the U.S., the coast is gearing up for another devastating storm, impacting recovery efforts for an area where people are still reeling from Helene. Volunteer groups have organized relief efforts, including the self-described 'Redneck Air Force' made up of volunteers who are mostly former military. Sheriff condemns ‘sightseers’ visiting Helene flood-torn areas Many of them were in special operations and are now using helicopters to deliver aid to people in need in remote areas. Some in the group have said they haven't seen enough federal help on the ground. Local officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have pushed back on what they have called misleading claims about the response to Helene, saying there are hundreds of people on the ground and millions of assistance already approved. Former Green Beret Adam Smith leads a team of hundreds and fears the Appalachian region will be forgotten after Milton hits. 'All the news interest is going to go to Florida and it’s going to disappear from this location,' he said. 'As soon as that happens, the people of Western North Carolina are going to be standing here holding the bag because we haven’t had federal assistance, because we haven’t had federal funding, because that money’s not moving.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/johnson-speak-helene-nc/	2024-10-09T10:36:06-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2174585773.jpg?w=900
Honda recalls about 1.7 million vehicles over steering issue	(WJET/WFXP) – Honda is recalling nearly 1.7 million vehicles in the U.S. over a steering issue that could result in a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Wednesday. The automobile company found that the assembly of the steering gearbox — which contains gears that help turn the vehicle's tires — may have been manufactured improperly, which could lead to excessive friction and difficulty steering. Warning signs include an unusual noise and/or a momentary 'sticky' feeling when turning the steering wheel while driving. Over 129K newer Ram trucks recalled over faulty turn signals The affected vehicles include: 2023-2025 Acura Integra 2024-2025 Acura Integra Type S 2022-2025 Honda Civic and Honda Civic Hatchback 2025 Honda Civic Hatchback Hybrid 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid 2023-2025 Honda Civic Type-R 2023-2025 CR-V 2025 Honda CR-V Fuel Cell EV 2023-2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid 2023-2025 Honda HR-V If your vehicle is affected by the recall, an authorized Honda dealer will replace the worm gear spring free of charge, and either 'redistribute or add grease' as needed. Owners will also receive a mailed notification expected to be sent out on Nov. 18. To check if your car is affected by the recall, you can search the NHTSA website using your VIN or the year, make and model of your vehicle.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/recalls/honda-recall/	2024-10-09T08:53:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6620396287ef70.43116672-e1728474222395.jpeg?w=800

Sheriff condemns 'sightseers' visiting Helene flood-torn areas	UNICOI, Tenn. (WJHL) — Unicoi County Sheriff Mike Hensley told NewsNation affiliate WJHL this week that visitors coming to the flood-torn county in Tennessee to sightsee have complicated recovery efforts and are beginning to endanger workers and themselves. 'I know everybody wants to look and I understand that,' he said. 'But we're doing work. We're still in the recovery process. We've got power lines down, gas lines, fiber optic cable. We got a multitude of utilities working.' Hensley said he was near Yancey County, North Carolina Tuesday morning, where he had to escort people to the state line who were not from the area and looking around to 'see what they could pick up.'

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'They had some people up there [Yancey Co.] that wasn't from there. They [were] not related to anyone over there, more or less just looking around to see what they could pick up, and there was no criminal charges placed, but they did escort them to the state line.' Sheriff Hensley said he and his deputies are going to speak with people they see out and ask them to state their business to try to control the overwhelming amount of people entering the county for non-essential reasons. 'We're going to talk to these folks and see if they have relatives here in Unicoi County. If they have no business here, we're going to escort them on their way. We're not going to put up with looting and stealing of these flood victims, not for one second.' Hensley said one reason his office is trying to remove sightseers is because many different types of crews are hard at work restoring utilities and providing emergency services. He said many wires, poles, debris and more potentially dangerous items are still scattered around the flood area. 'If they don't have no business in these areas, not related, not help and not with any organization, they need to leave. And that's what I stand on up here.' Another reason is that it's causing unnecessary traffic, backing up already-narrowed roadways that are locals' only option right now.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/helene-flooding-sheriff-condemns-sightseers-tennessee/	2024-10-09T08:34:33-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-08-164619.png?w=900
Cruz leading Allred by 3 points in Texas Senate race: poll	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, holds a 3-point lead over his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, according to a new poll. The Florida Atlantic University (FAU) survey, conducted by Mainstreet Research, shows that among registered voters in the state, Cruz garners 46% support compared to Allred's 43%. About 11% of respondents also said they were undecided. When asked which candidate respondents would vote for if the election were held today, the incumbent maintained his 3-point lead over Allred, 47% to 44%, the data shows. The number of undecided voters dipped, however, to 9%. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } The numbers were released after Allred's team announced Tuesday that he has raised more than $30 million over the past three months in his battle against Cruz, reflecting broad desire among Democratic donors to defeat one of the Senate’s most prominent conservatives. The Texas Republican raked in $21 million in the same time period, according to his campaign. It also comes less than a week before the two take to the debate stage. In The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's aggregate of polls, Cruz has a 2.8-point edge on Allred, bringing in 47.9% support to the Democratic hopeful's 45.1%. The FAU poll was conducted from Oct. 2 to Oct. 6 among 811 registered voters in the Lone Star State.

Hurricane Milton: Where will zoo animals go?	(NewsNation) — Florida residents aren’t the only ones bracing for Hurricane Milton — penguins, flamingos, rhinos and other Zoo animals across the must also find shelter to weather the storm. Ron Magill, director of communications for Zoo Miami, joined 'Morning in America' on Wednesday to explain how those decisions are made and which animals, if any, zoo staff may evacuate. Milton’s intensity has gone back and forth throughout the week. It’s expected to make landfall either Wednesday night or Thursday morning as a Category 5 hurricane, according to National Hurricane Center forecasts. When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida? 'I’m deeply worried,' Magill said. 'When you talk about Tampa Zoo, the Florida aquarium — these are places that are so exposed right now to this monstrous storm. Having lived through Andrew and Wilma here in Miami when we were devastated by those storms, I can only just imagine what’s going to happen up there.'

The storm’s high winds and surging water could put smaller animals who are usually in outdoor settings at the greatest risk. Aquariums also face potential challenges. The hurricane could disable tank filtration systems, which Magill called the 'life-support' for fish and other aquatic animals. 'A misconception people have about zoos and aquariums is that we evacuate animals (and) that we send them to another location,' Magill said. 'That rarely — if ever — happens. What we do in zoos and aquariums is we take the more susceptible animals like birds and smaller mammals and we will take them and put them in small sky kennels, like what you transport them in on an airplane, and then put those kennels in fortified buildings within the zoo property.' 'When you move animals, the stress you put on them sometimes is more dangerous than the storm itself,' Magill said. Live: Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall The animals won’t be left alone. All accredited zoos have a team that stays on the grounds 24/7, Magill said. Some attractions like Zoo Miami also have what’s called a lethal response team — a group that, armed with rifles, would sweep the park after the storm to make sure every animal is where it should be, Magill said. 'The No. 1 priority is safety for the public by ensuring that these animals are still secure and then afterwards, clearing a way to get to them to take care of them,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-where-zoo-animals-go/	2024-10-09T08:00:03-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/11/4535f8b9858e41fc90a7814df93853ce.jpg?w=900
Helene spurs IV fluid shortage. Milton could make it worse	(The Hill) -- Hospitals across the U.S. are feeling the impact of Hurricane Helene as experts warn of an imminent intravenous (IV) solution shortage due to the temporary shutdown of a facility in North Carolina. And Hurricane Milton’s approach could worsen the problem, with another key IV fluid manufacturing facility located along its potential path in Florida. Baxter International’s IV fluid manufacturing facility in Marion, North Carolina, supplied roughly 60 percent of the IV solution used by hospitals in the U.S. every day until Helene temporarily halted operations. Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall While what remained at Baxter’s facility has begun to be shipped out, production may not restart for another week or two. The company says its global plants are ramping up production in response. Just a week after Helene dissipated, hospitals say they’re already beginning to feel the strain of Baxter’s temporary halt in production. Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA), told The Hill that hospitals nationwide that rely on Baxter have been told to expect 40 percent of their normal shipments of IV solution. 'And that's all that will be available to them until the situation begins to improve,' she said. According to Foster, this means that hospitals will have to think conservatively in terms of how they use IV fluids, prioritizing certain patients who 'absolutely need' those solutions and utilizing alternative methods for others. She noted 17 different products were manufactured at the North Carolina plant, mostly different types of saline but also products like ringer’s lactate, which support patients’ bodily function. The AHA has called on the Biden administration to declare a shortage of IV solutions, both so that hospitals can prepare IV solutions in their own pharmacies and to signal to health care providers that they must conserve their supply. Concerns are culminating just as Milton is set to make landfall in Florida this week. B. Braun, another top IV solution manufacturer in the U.S., has a facility in Daytona Beach, Florida. Both federal officials and the company are well aware that the plant is within Milton’s expected path. A spokesperson for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) said it is coordinating with B. Braun 'to move their product out of the path of the storm and facilitate other activities that will mitigate potential impacts on future distribution.' B. Braun’s Daytona Beach facility was not affected by Hurricane Helene. It is closing its Florida manufacturing plant and distribution center Wednesday morning in anticipation of Milton, with plans to resume operations on Friday, Oct. 11. Alli Longenhagen, director of corporate communications at B. Braun, confirmed her company is working with ASPR to transfer its Florida inventory to a 'secure, temperature-controlled facility, north of Florida.' 'Once the storm passes, the product will return to the distribution center,' said Longenhagen. 'The Daytona Beach facility is a key part of our plan to help address the shutdown of Baxter’s IV solutions manufacturing facility in North Carolina,' Longenhagen added. 'In partnership with ASPR, we are taking immediate steps to increase production of critical IV fluids at our plant in Irvine, CA, and will resume this plan at Daytona Beach following Hurricane Milton’s departure.' Report names ‘Immaculate Constellation’ UAP program: Journalist Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., has called on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to further strengthen supply chains to prevent an IV fluid shortage. 'Natural disasters often have effects beyond the horrific destruction and loss of life throughout the southeastern part of our country,' Dingell said in a letter to HHS. 'This supply chain disruption is a grave reminder of the interconnection of our government and society — maintaining communication and cooperating through these adversities is the best solution to care for our communities.' According to a senior Biden administration official, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering potential options to address the issue, including temporary imports and expedited reviews. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) said in a statement Tuesday that it backed the plan for expedited importation from foreign plants. The ASHP had a meeting with the FDA and the White House to discuss the looming issue in which the organization said it called for 'temporary flexibility' on FDA requirements like inspections, limits on compounding and an extension on expiration dates for IV fluids and peritoneal dialysis solutions. In cases of IV solution shortage, hospitals have contingency plans in place, but Foster noted that the traditional course of action is usually to ask other hospitals to share their supplies. This plan doesn’t work when the supplier is out of commission. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'It's this taking out of the source that’s created the real challenge for hospitals and others regarding the use of these IV solutions right now,' said Foster. Another measure being considered to mitigate a shortage is to have other manufacturers ramp up production. ICU Medical, a major IV solutions manufacturer, said it was unaffected by Helene and continues to operate as normal. 'We are continuing to collaborate with government agencies while actively monitoring potential increases in demand for IV solutions and have already taken necessary steps to increase production to help meet market needs while continuing to support our existing customers,' it said in an emailed statement. The incoming respiratory viral season adds an additional layer of pressure on hospitals. Hospitalizations go up as flu, RSV and COVID spread, and ensuring that hospitalized patients remain sufficiently hydrated is a key part of treatment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-iv-fluid-shortage-milton-helene/	2024-10-09T07:02:54-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/IV_drip_AP-e1728479561815.jpg?w=800
Final preparations underway as Milton nears landfall	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton was reclassified a Category 4 storm Wednesday morning but remained two miles per hour of wind gust away from Category 5 status. Millions along the coast remain under evacuation orders, packing roads, draining gas stations and getting out of town before Milton's anticipated landfall Wednesday night. Milton threatens to deliver storm surges up to 15 feet on the Gulf Coast, catastrophic flooding and destructive winds. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged Florida residents in danger zones to leave ahead of Hurricane Milton’s arrival, especially since the National Hurricane Center said it could be one of the most destructive storms to ever hit the area. How Waffle House helps Southerners judge a storm's severity President Joe Biden on Tuesday noted the rapid intensification of the storm earlier this week when it went from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in a day. It was downgraded to a Category 4 early Tuesday before ramping back up to a Category 5 later in the afternoon. It is expected to be powerful when it makes landfall in Florida near the Tampa Bay area. 'Get out now while you can,' National Hurricane Center Director Dr. Michael Brennan said in a live update streamed by the organization. Brennan emphasized that you need to only travel tens of miles rather than hundreds to find safety, and that attempting to evacuate too late has led to deaths in previous hurricanes. The latest National Hurricane Center forecast has the storm crossing over the entire state of Florida and entering the Atlantic Ocean by Thursday evening. Tracking Hurricane Milton The hurricane was about 300 miles southwest of Tampa as of 7:30 a.m. ET Wednesday moving at 14 mph. With Milton, forecasters warned of a possible 10- to 15-foot storm surge in Tampa Bay. It is the highest surge ever predicted for that location and has led to evacuation orders for communities all along the coast. Communities hit hard by Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago have been working day and night to remove the debris from their homes before Milton makes landfall with the potential to turn wrecked furniture into projectiles. 'I went through Katrina, and that was mainly winds that destroyed everything. And everything's a projectile out here right now because everybody's house is in the front yard, and so all of this is going to be pretty much missiles coming through if it's the amount of wind that's going through with this hurricane coming in,' New Port Richey resident Scott Pepperman said. Milton remains on track to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in over a century, the National Weather Service in Tampa Bay said. The region has become home to more than 3 million people and is one of the most vulnerable metropolitan areas in the U.S. to storm surge. New Zillow feature: Climate risk data added to home listings DeSantis has warned Floridians that the hurricane could 'wobble,' meaning it could hit at any point whether it is north of Tampa, Tampa, or south of Tampa. 'Wherever it makes landfall, there’s going to be impacts far beyond what the cone actually shows,' DeSantis said. It reached an incredibly low pressure Tuesday night, which generally correlates with a storm’s strength. The lower a system’s pressure, the stronger the hurricane. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains. Why should you fill your bathtub before a hurricane?

Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills dozens and thre...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed and wounded dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday. Heavy fighting is underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces have carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year. The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, comes as Israel expands a weeklong ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran. Residents of Jabaliya, a refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle militants in the streets. 'It’s like hell. We can’t get out,' said Mohamed Awda, who lives with his parents and six siblings. He said there were three bodies in the street outside his home that could not be retrieved because of the fighting. 'The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,' he told The Associated Press by phone, speaking over the sound of explosions. Dozens have been killed and survivors fear displacement Gaza's Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. There are likely more bodies under rubble and in areas that can't be accessed, it said. An airstrike in Jabaliya early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Residents of Jabaliya fear Israel’s aim is to depopulate the north and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement. Israel has blocked all roads except for the main highway leading from Jabaliya to the south, according to residents. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it was evacuating seven schools that were being used as shelters and that only two of eight water wells in the camp are still functioning. 'We are concerned about the displacement to the south,' Ahmed Qamar, who lives in Jabaliya with his wife, children and parents, said in a text message. 'People here say clearly that they will die here in northern Gaza and and won’t go to southern Gaza.' Hospitals are under threat Fadel Naeem, the director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it had received dozens of wounded people and bodies from the north. 'We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable,' told AP in a text message. Israel’s offensive has gutted Gaza’s health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning. Naeem said three hospitals farther north — Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to 'prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts' and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions over the weekend, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps. The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They are still holding around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel warns Lebanon that it could end up like Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of all the captives. On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet the same fate as Gaza if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,' Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people. An Israeli strike killed four people and wounded another 10 at a hotel sheltering displaced people in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyeh on Wednesday, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms from Israeli jets before the strike. Plumes of smoke rose from the building after the explosion. In recent weeks Israel has waged a heavy air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. A series of strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. So far, ground operations appear to be focused on a narrow strip along the border, but Israel has warned people to evacuate dozens of cities and towns, many of them north of a buffer zone declared by the United Nations after the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Hezbollah's acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Tuesday that the group has replaced its slain commanders and was preventing Israeli ground forces from advancing. The militants have extended their rocket fire deeper into Israel, disrupting life but causing few casualties. The Israeli military said Wednesday that Hezbollah has fired more than 12,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since the start of the hostilities last year. Israel is meanwhile considering options for a strike on Iran that could potentially escalate the war on yet another front. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a wave of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for the killing of top militants from both groups. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

WATCH: Las Vegas bids farewell to the Tropicana with a spectacula...	LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The seconds ticked away early Wednesday morning until the husk of the Tropicana Las Vegas resort, deserted since its April 2024 closing date, would meet a final and spectacular end, bringing to a close the era of the 67-year-old structure once a bastion for visitors from across the country. The Las Vegas classic was set to come down in style with a seven-minute celebration involving 550 drones and 150 'pyrodrones' counting down to the controlled demolition of the resort originally erected in 1957. Phil Grucci, CEO and president of Fireworks by Grucci, previewed the celebration ahead of the demolition, revealing that the show will feature images of the Tropicana logo, the iconic 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign, and a tribute to the Athletics franchise, whose proposed $1.5 billion, 33,000-seat ballpark could open in the footprint of the former Tropicana in time for the 2028 season.

In July, Bally's, the company that controlled most of the site, entered into a merger agreement with its top stockholder, Standard General. A total of 917,400 square feet will be imploded with the use of nearly 2,200 pounds of explosives. The demolition sequence will begin with the implosion of the 23-story Paradise Tower and end with the implosion of the 23-story Club Tower. It’s expected both buildings will collapse within 22 seconds after the implosion button is pressed, according to the Bally’s Corporation news release. Tropicana Las Vegas opened in 1957.

Report names 'Immaculate Constellation' UAP program: Journalist	(NewsNation) — A leaked whistleblower report says the Pentagon is operating a secret UFO retrieval program called 'Immaculate Constellation,' according to independent journalist Michael Shellenberger. The report revealed for the first time the name of an alleged UAP program, stating that the executive branch has been managing UAP issues without congressional knowledge or oversight, possibly for decades. Shellenberger told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart he has been in touch with the whistleblower, whose exact role and other identifying details, including gender, he has withheld because they fear what could happen if they were publicly known. Earth’s temporary 2nd moon has arrived: What you need to know 'I don't think that they're faking it or that they're lying about their fear,' he said. 'This person discovered this material accidentally. This was not something they had expected to encounter.' That fear is why Shellenberger said the whistleblower did not share intelligence imagery showing UAPs. The unnamed whistleblower said the Department of Defense created 'Immaculate Constellation' in 2017 after a New York Times report revealed another program known as the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The whistleblower report cites evidence, including allegations about UAP sightings collected by the Pentagon and intelligence documenting firsthand encounters with UAPs or UFOs that are kept in a database used by the intelligence community. The report is also said to describe various UAPs in detail, including one where orbs surrounded an F-22 and forced it out of its patrol area and one where the crew of a Navy aircraft saw an orange-red sphere descend from a high altitude, after which they described a sense of unease and feeling as if they'd snapped out of a trance. Pentagon historically denies reports of UAP programs The Pentagon has long denied claims that there is any evidence to indicate any nonhuman, alien or extraterrestrial intelligence has visited Earth. In a May report, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) said reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) are the result of mistaken identification of drones, top-secret projects or other known aerial objects. AARO said longstanding claims that the Pentagon is secretly studying UAPs are a result of 'circular reporting' from a group of people who believe the rumor to be true despite a lack of evidence. Could a drug used in organ transplants slow aging? Rumors about the government and unidentified objects have existed since the end of World War II and the famed Roswell incident of 1947. Believers pointed to errors in the report and cast doubt on the validity of the claims. Skeptics, on the other hand, have said persistent rumors about government UFO programs are a result of government disinformation and social contagion like the 'Satanic Panic' of the 1980s. 'This new whistleblower is not part of that circular reporting,' Shellenberger said. 'I am confident of that. This person did not know the other individuals who verified the name of this program. It does not fit the theory of social contagion.' Those who have suggested we need to look more closely at UAPs include high-ranking officials like former Assistant Secretary of Defense Christopher Mellon and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, even if they stop short of saying UAPs are alien in nature. Recent UAP reports In 2023, former Air Force officer David Grusch reignited interest in UAPs by claiming a secret UAP retrieval program was being operated by the Pentagon without the public or Congress being aware. His statements sparked a congressional hearing on the subject and a bipartisan UAP Caucus formed in the House of Representatives, with lawmakers seeking to understand what programs exist and how the Pentagon would be funding alleged UAP efforts. How can I protect my social security number from hackers and scams? Others have since come forward with their own stories, including former military intelligence officer Luis Elizondo and retired Army Col. Karl Nell. Lawmakers from both parties have come forward to press the Defense Department for more transparency and have said the earlier hearing was not the last the public can expect to see on UAPs. 'No justification has been given for this level of secrecy,' Shellenberger said, noting that efforts to discredit those who have come forward to speak about UAPs have ruined people's lives. He also recommended whistleblowers approach journalists or congressional staffers, saying that protections for whistleblowers who go to AARO or the inspector generals for defense or intelligence are not adequate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/report-immaculate-constellation-uap-journalist/	2024-10-08T11:51:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/AARO-UAPS-sighting-Nexstar-4212023.png?w=900
Redneck Air Force' delivers aid to North Carolina mountains	(NewsNation) — In Swannanoa, North Carolina, a group calling themselves the 'Redneck Air Force' is helping deliver aid to mountain areas affected by Hurricane Helene. The home base for the group looks like a central command for disaster relief, but it’s all being run by volunteers, mostly retired special ops. They are choppering aid into the mountains, and volunteers with the group said they haven’t seen FEMA or federal help. Milton ‘could be the worst storm to hit Florida in over a century’: Biden After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene weakened as it traveled up the southeast. Western North Carolina was particularly hit hard by the storm, which dumped record amounts of rain on communities built in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains. The region surrounding Asheville, North Carolina, was virtually cut off, with hundreds of roads washed out or impassable and cell phone service down. More than a week after the storm hit, thousands are still without power or water with no firm timeline given for restoration. NewsNation’s Rich McHugh went up with the group, flying over the popular tourist destination of Chimney Rock, which has been almost completely devastated by Helene. Helicopters come into the volunteer group’s headquarters to load up with supplies and fly aid in to those still in the area. FEMA held a press conference on the disaster response, with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushing back against what the agency has characterized as misinformation about the response. Brother of missing Tennessee man still searching for answers Officials in the area have said it’s making it more difficult for the agency to help people. 'People that have been impacted are afraid to apply for the assistance, that they can then get a hotel room. If I can’t get them to apply, I can’t get them the assistance,' Criswell said. 'I've heard rumors that if you take our $750 and don't pay it back, we're going to take your home. Absolutely false.' But the men and women running the Redneck Air Force say they have found FEMA’s response lacking. '[It’s] incompetent, if we’re talking about, broadly speaking, limited-to-no personnel,' said Adam Smith, former Green Beret. 'Once they did get here, they put themselves in positions, obviously, to make connections, create rapport, but in the process, there’s not been much dedicated assistance or support. I’ve not seen one FEMA individual come through this location. I’ve not seen one FEMA truck in this town.' James Taylor, Luke Combs, Eric Church to take part in Helene relief concert Aaron Switzer, who was part of Air Force Special Operations before he retired, said FEMA is taking too long to get aid out. 'These guys are coming in trying to figure out what the problem is and who’s in charge while we’re solving the problems,' Switzer said. 'People don’t care what’s going to happen two weeks from now when they’re starving. They need food, they need water, they need warmth. They need somebody to give them a hug and say, what do you need? They don’t need a government official to say we’re here, and we’re going to fix this.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/redneck-air-force-aid-north-carolina/	2024-10-08T11:40:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175400595.jpg?w=900
How can I protect my social security number from hackers and scam...	(NewsNation) — It's important to keep your personal information under lock and key — evidenced by a recent hacking operation that compromised nearly three billion personal records, including social security numbers. The theft happened in April, according to a class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A hacking group known as USDoD reportedly stole the records from National Public Data, which offers personal information to employers, private investigators and others who do background checks. Credit card rates hit historic highs as banks raise fees Regularly checking your credit for suspicious loans or payments can help identify fraudulent activity, but the best defense is a good offense. Here's how to stay proactive about protecting sensitive information and what to do if it's it's already been compromised. Protect your SSN before it’s compromised It’s best not to carry your social security card on you. Instead, keep it in a safe, secure place, and don’t give out your social security number freely. Regularly changing your passwords, setting unique, hard-to-guess passwords for different accounts, and using multi-factor authentication can also reduce the risk of hackers accessing your information. Even with those precautions in place, scammers may reach out pretending to be Social Security employees. The Social Security Administration will never: Threaten you with arrest or legal action because you don’t make an immediate payment Suspend your social security number Request personal information or payment to activate a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) or other benefit increase Pressure you to share personal information or take immediate action Ask you to pay with gift cards, prepaid debit cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash mail. Threaten to seize your bank account Offer to move your money Demand secrecy Message you directly on social media If you receive a suspicious call, text or email regarding your social security information, hang up and file a report if necessary. Which students were most affected by 2024 FAFSA glitch? What do I do if my SSN was stolen? There are several places to consider filing reports if someone has stolen your social security card or your number has been compromised. Filing a police report and keeping a copy of your records can help if problems arise after your SSN is compromised. You can visit IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877IDTHEFT (4338) to make a report with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and find information about recovery plans. You may also want to file a report with the Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov. The center receives and refers cybercrime complaints to law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Notifying one of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) freezing your credit and setting up fraud alert can further protect your credit. Whichever company you contact must notify the others. Finally, notifying the IRS can help prevent someone from using your social security number to file a tax return and try to get their hands on your refund.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/protect-my-social-security-number-hackers-scams/	2024-10-08T08:20:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/AP24079459358377-e1723750930822.jpg?w=800
San Antonio firefighters worried after Tren de Aragua arrests	(NewsNation) — The presence of Tren de Aragua gang members in San Antonio has raised alarms, especially among first responders who may be at risk while on the job. San Antonio Professional Firefighters Association President Joe Jones sent a memo warning first responders to 'keep your heads on a swivel and watch your six' for gang members, meaning to stay alert and watch their backs. Several gang members were arrested Saturday in San Antonio during a multiagency raid on an apartment complex. People involved with the Venezuelan gang have been illegally entering the United States and have been arrested for committing crimes in various parts of the country. Diddy accuser’s lawyer: Combs used oil, knife How are police, firefighters responding to Tren de Aragua presence? San Antonio Police Chief Bill McManus vowed to crack down on the gang’s presence in the south-central Texas city. The firefighters union said higher-ups in the department began urging caution as the gang's presence increased in certain parts of the city. Jones worried gang members may confuse firefighter and paramedic uniforms for police uniforms, potentially putting first responders at risk of attack. San Antonio firefighters are unarmed, and it's common for them to take a police escort when entering hostile environments that could lead to violence. There are currently no police escorts for firefighters in areas where there is a Tren de Aragua presence, but the San Antonio Professional Firefighters Association continues to push for better protective measures for their crews. Panera settles Charged Lemonade wrongful death lawsuit Tren de Aragua arrests in San Antonio San Antonio authorities on Saturday cracked down on the gang's presence at an apartment complex on the city's north side, arresting four confirmed gang members. It's been less than three weeks since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared the gang a terrorist organization. The raid, which included local, state, and federal authorities, saw multiple Tren de Aragua members arrested after complaints alleging human trafficking, narcotics violations and violent threats against building staff were made at the apartment complex. According to police, 19 people were arrested: 16 Venezuelans and three U.S. citizens. Four were confirmed Tren de Aragua members and taken into custody by Homeland Security agents. Among those arrested, several of them had previously received deportation notices.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/san-antonio-firefighters-tren-de-aragua-arrests/	2024-10-08T05:18:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Gateway-hotel.png?w=900
Live: Milton downgraded to Category 4 hurricane ahead of landfall	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Milton was downgraded to a Category 4 storm Tuesday but still remains on track to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in over a century, the National Weather Service in Tampa Bay said. The region has become home to more than 3 million people and is one of the most vulnerable metropolitan areas in the U.S. to storm surge. 'Hurricane Milton is still a major hurricane,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an early morning press conference Tuesday. DeSantis warned Floridians that the hurricane could 'wobble,' meaning it could hit at any point whether it is north of Tampa, Tampa or south of Tampa. 'Wherever it makes landfall, there's going to be impacts far beyond what the cone actually shows,' DeSantis warned. LIVE: Hurricane Milton real-time wobble tracker Milton was downgraded early Tuesday, but forecasters said it still posed 'an extremely serious threat to Florida.' Milton had intensified quickly Monday, becoming a Category 5 storm at midday with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph before being downgraded. Almost the entirety of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane warning early Tuesday as the storm and its 155 mph winds crept toward the state at 12 mph, sucking energy from the Gulf of Mexico’s warm water. The strongest Atlantic hurricane on record is 1980’s Allen, which reached wind speeds of 190 mph as it moved through the Caribbean and Gulf before striking Texas and Mexico. Milton’s center could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region, which has not endured a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than a century. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains. 'Now is the time to execute your plan,' DeSantis said. He said that 'time is running out' for residents to finalize their emergency plans ahead of Hurricane Milton's landfall.

(AP Photo/Martin Zetina) Milton had rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane Monday and is forecast to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in 100 years with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph. Forecasters warn the area could see a storm surge up to 12 feet, prompting evacuations. The hurricane reached an incredibly low pressure Monday night, which generally correlates with a storm’s strength. The lower a system’s pressure, the stronger the hurricane. As of Monday afternoon, there were already traffic backups of people attempting to leave the Tampa area, leading authorities to institute emergency shoulder use, allowing vehicles to travel on the inside shoulder of the road. Northbound traffic on Interstate 75 was bumper to bumper for miles, moving at roughly 6 mph as Floridians and tourists alike tried to flee the state Monday. Flights out of Florida will stop Tuesday, with Tampa International Airport grounding trips at 9 a.m. and St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport closing after the last flight that day. The hurricane went from Category 1 to Category 5 in less than 24 hours, becoming only the second Category 5 hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1966. Forecast models currently show Milton making landfall Wednesday and remaining at hurricane strength as it moves across Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. The current track would avoid other states affected by Helene. Are hurricanes intensifying more rapidly than before? Preparing for Hurricane Milton President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for South Florida to allow federal resources to assist state and local efforts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged residents to execute preparedness plans, noting there was still time to get ready, but that any preparations have to be done quickly. He also detailed efforts being made to protect critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants, and he urged people to stock up on fuel ahead of the storm. In a Monday briefing with reporters, DeSantis called the hurricane 'ferocious' and emphasized the system’s rapid strengthening. 'At the strength it is now, this is a really, really strong storm. The effects of that, not just from the storm surge but from wind damage and debris, will be really, really significant,' DeSantis said. 'This is not a storm you want to take a risk on.' DeSantis also announced that 30,000 linemen were headed to Florida from all over the country to assist with cleanup and repairs after the storm. Less than an hour later, the U.S. National Hurricane Center issued storm surge warnings and hurricane warnings for almost all of Florida’s west coast. The hurricane center also issued storm surge watches on the U.S. East Coast, including much of Florida up to parts of South Carolina. 'If you are in an evacuation area, I beg you, I implore you to leave,' said Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie. 'Drowning deaths from storm surges are 100% preventable if you leave.' Residents have been urged to resupply disaster kits that may have been depleted during Helene, and officials urged those with special needs on Monday to sign up for the state registry as soon as possible. The governor said the state could expect several evacuation orders to be issued ahead of landfall, and that shelters would be open after evacuation orders were given. Officials also urged those with the means to do so to get on the road as soon as possible and to consider hotels in areas less likely to be hard hit, especially people who are reliant on power for medical devices. DeSantis noted that people do not have to evacuate hundreds of miles and that those on barrier islands and in low-lying areas may be able to go to a shelter in their own county. The state is preparing for the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017 when 7 million people were told to evacuate. Tolls have been suspended to aid in evacuation efforts and hotels have offered disaster rates, which also include accepting pets regardless of if a hotel is usually pet-friendly. Ahead of the storm, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced the team would be relocating to the New Orleans area for the week. DeSantis said the state would not be extending the deadline for voter registration because of the storm. Reconsidering where you live after Helene? You’re not alone Evacuation orders: Should I stay, or should I go? Treasure Island is a small beach community in Pinellas County, Florida, hit hard by Hurricane Helene's storm surge two weeks ago. The storm caused catastrophic damage, leaving behind mounds of sand and debris on sidewalks and front lawns. Now, the community is in the path of Hurricane Milton, and residents have been urged to evacuate ahead of the storm. This is in Treasure Island, Florida — right in the pathway of a potential direct hit from Hurricane #Milton. Look at how much debris is still left in neighborhoods from Helene. The state is trying to clean a lot of this up, but it seems near impossible to do in the next 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/13gwKfzWXN&mdash; Ryan Bass (@Ry_Bass) October 7, 2024 Florida's goal is to clean up as much of the Helene debris as possible before Milton makes landfall. One of the state's top fears for Milton is that it will kick back up the debris left behind by Helene and cause further damage to the community. However, due to the excessive debris, DeSantis has urged residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate now before it's too late. As of Tuesday morning, 11 counties along Florida's west coast were under evacuation orders, and 51 out of the state's 67 counties were under a state of emergency. Weather experts forecast the hurricane storm surge will reach anywhere from 8 to 12 feet in some places. To encourage residents to evacuate ahead of the storm, St. Petersburg's government said it would likely shut off northeast and southwest sewage plants, meaning 66% of the town would not be able to flush toilets or take showers for at least 24 hours. St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch warned that if the city takes a direct hit, the rebuilding of electric and water services could take a long time.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricane-milton-ahead-landfall-florida/	2024-10-08T04:31:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24281671677886.jpg?w=900
Supreme Court will hear a challenge to ghost-gun regulation	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court will hear a challenge Tuesday to a Biden administration regulation on ghost guns, the difficult-to-trace weapons with an exponentially increased link to crime in recent years. The rule is focused on gun kits that are sold online and can be assembled into a functioning weapon in less than 30 minutes. The finished weapons don't have serial numbers, making them nearly impossible to trace. The regulation came after the number of ghost guns seized by police around the country soared, going from fewer than 4,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department data. Finalized after an executive action from President Joe Biden, the rule requires companies to treat the kits like other firearms by adding serial numbers, running background checks and verifying that buyers are 21 or older. The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to court documents. But manufacturers and gun-rights groups challenged the rule in court, arguing it's long been legal to sell gun parts to hobbyists and that most people who commit crimes use traditional guns. They say the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority. 'Congress is the body that gets to decide how to address any risks that might arise from a particular product,' a group of more than two dozen GOP-leaning states supporting the challengers wrote in court documents. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas agreed, striking down the rule in 2023. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld his decision. The administration, on the other hand, argues the law allows the government to regulate weapons that 'may readily be converted' to shoot. The 5th Circuit's decision would allow anyone to 'buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes — no background check, records, or serial number required. The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation’s communities,' Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration last year, allowing the regulation to go into effect by a 5-4 vote. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberal members to form the majority.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/supreme-court/ap-supreme-court-to-hear-challenge-to-ghost-gun-regulation/	2024-10-08T04:10:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670514b26c6c01.05613570.jpeg?w=900
Harris pressed on changing positions, economic plan in '60 Minute...	Vice President Harris was pressed on her changing policy positions and her expensive economic plan on '60 Minutes,' in what proved to be her toughest media interview since becoming the Democratic nominee. CBS News’s Bill Whitaker questioned Harris on a variety of issues, including Harris’s evolving stances on fracking, immigration and Medicare. At one point, Whitaker, citing the nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, estimated her plans could add more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit. Harris, in turn, argued that her plan would strengthen the economy, while former President Trump’s plan would weaken it. But Whitaker repeated the question, asking how such expensive proposals would be paid for. 'But we're dealing with the real world here,' he replied when she said she would make sure wealthy Americans pay their fair share in taxes. 'How are you gonna get this through Congress?' 'When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about because their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class, hard-working folk,' Harris replied. She disagreed when Whitaker said Congress has not indicated they would agree and pass such legislation. 'I am a devout public servant. You know that. I am also a capitalist. And I know the limitations of government,' Harris said. Whitaker also questioned her on several changing positions including once supporting a ban on fracking, looser immigration policies at the border and the concept of Medicare For All, which she stood by when running for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Whitaker asked if Harris thought that was one reason that Americans say they don’t know her. 'In the last four years I have been vice president of the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people,' Harris said. She added, 'Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common-sense solutions.' In past interviews, Harris has responded to similar questions by saying her 'values' have not changed on issues like fracking. Her previous opposition to fracking, which her campaign now says it no longer supports, will matter in a critical state like Pennsylvania, where fracking is an important industry. On the issue of immigration, Whitaker noted that President Biden’s recent crack down on asylum seekers has led to a decrease in illegal border crossings after those numbers quadrupled compared to the Trump administration. Whitaker then asked why the administration didn’t take those steps three years ago. The vice president responded that the first bill the Biden administration proposed to Congress was to fix the immigration system, but it was not taken up. Then she highlighted that Trump had a hand in tanking a border proposal negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this year. 'But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,' Harris replied when Whitaker continued to ask about why Biden didn’t step in to curb the influx of migrants sooner. Harris is on a media blitz this week, where on Tuesday she will appear on 'The View' and Howard Stern’s Sirius XM show. She has faced widespread criticism for not sitting for more tough interviews, in particular by Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio). In August, Harris was interviewed by CNN, alongside her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. She was interviewed by MSNBC last month. Trump declined CBS News’s offer to participate in the program’s traditional interviews it has with presidential candidates ahead of the election.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-pressed-on-changing-positions-economic-plan-in-60-minutes-interview/	2024-10-08T02:32:09-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/HarrisKamala.jpg?w=900
When will Hurricane Milton hit Florida?	(NewsNation) — As Florida and much of the southeastern United States pick up the pieces left by Hurricane Helene, another massive storm is brewing in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Milton, now a Category 5 hurricane with estimated top wind speeds reaching 180 mph, is expected to make landfall on the Sunshine State sometime Wednesday. Milton rapidly strengthened from a Category 1 to a Category 5 hurricane in less than 24 hours, becoming only the second highest-strength hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1966. Forecasters warn the area could see a storm surge of up to 12 feet. When, where will Milton make landfall? The massive hurricane will make landfall midweek, with current models forecasting its arrival in the Tampa Bay area somewhere between Wednesday night and Thursday morning. It's expected to be the worst storm to hit the Tampa Bay area in a century. Two days out of its arrival, Floridians and tourists alike are fleeing the area. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm Northbound traffic on Interstate 75 was bumper to bumper for miles, moving roughly 6 mph as Floridians and tourists alike tried to flee the state Monday. Flights out of Florida will stop Tuesday, with Tampa International Airport grounding trips at 9 a.m. and St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport closing after the last flight that day. Will Milton stay a Cat 5 hurricane? Forecast models currently show Milton remaining at hurricane strength as it moves east across Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That trajectory places much of Central Florida in the direct impact zone, though it avoids other states impacted by Helene, which has resulted in at least 230 deaths so far, with many still missing in the Appalachians.

With new rule changes, are real estate agents still necessary?	(NewsNation) — New real estate commission rules are encouraging some to skip the agent altogether, finding the process more straightforward than they expected. Gabrielle Hillman, 30, and her roommate recently sold their Chicago condo without a real estate agent. 'It's definitely time-consuming — but all things considered — to save $30,000 we were happy to do it,' she said. Historically, agent fees have come from the seller’s proceeds, usually around 5 to 6% of the sale price, which gets split between the buyer's and seller's agents. But, due to recent changes in how commissions are advertised and paid, Hillman felt she had more flexibility to go it alone. Will homebuying costs change under real estate settlement? To determine the asking price, she researched condos in the neighborhood and figured out what a comparable unit had sold for. Instead of relying on an agent for marketing, Hillman paid a company $100 to get the condo on the multiple listing service (MLS) — a private database agents use to list homes for sale. When it was time to close, the 30-year-old hired a real estate attorney, a step she said was critical and more cost-efficient than working with an agent. 'The couple hundred that (attorneys) are doing this for is nothing compared to a couple thousand that you're paying an agent,' she said. Ultimately, Hillman agreed to pay a commission to the buyer's agent but she was able to negotiate a lower fee than the norm just a few months ago. All told, she said the condo sold in roughly three weeks: 'It was much easier, I would say, than expected.' The New York Times recently highlighted another woman who decided to sell her home without an agent via Facebook marketplace. Joanne Y. Cleaver, 66, estimated she saved $25,000 in real estate fees. Most people still use real estate agents As part of the $418 million settlement between home sellers and the National Association of Realtors (NAR), listings on the MLS will no longer advertise the buying agent’s commission upfront — a tweak meant to deter agents from steering clients away from lower-commission deals. It's one of several changes that will give Americans more negotiating power when it comes to agent fees and may push more consumers to forgo them entirely. Data suggests the sluggish housing market already has real estate agents fleeing the industry, but the trend could accelerate if commissions drop off. But that outcome is not a foregone conclusion and the do-it-yourself approach comes with risk, especially for those unfamiliar with the process. Amanda Pendleton, Zillow's home trends expert, thinks the recent market — characterized by elevated mortgage rates, low inventory and high prices — has made agents' expertise more important, not less. 'What we're seeing is that homes that are priced and marketed correctly are selling pretty quickly, in about 20 days or so, but homes that are not are lingering on the market for a couple of months,' she said. Last year, for sale by owner (FSBO) sales accounted for just 7% of home sales, an all-time low, according to the NAR. The real estate trade group found that the typical FSBO home sold for almost $100,000 less than those sold with an agent's help. Half of all homes for sale have sat for 60-plus days: Redfin 'A mistake could cost you tens of thousands of dollars, so having an expert by your side is critical if you want to net top dollar,' Pendleton said. On top of marketing and pricing advice, good agents help their clients through the entire process, using their local knowledge to negotiate better deals. According to a 2023 survey from Clever Real Estate, home sellers who used an agent were more satisfied with their experience than those who didn't. 'We don't expect that the settlement is going to dramatically change the way that people ultimately buy and sell homes,' Pendleton said. 'What it does do is it brings more transparency to the process and that's a really good thing for buyers and for sellers.' Are real estate lawyers a better option? The question is whether real estate agents are the best experts for the job. Real estate attorney Doug Miller doesn't think they are. 'There's no barrier to entry to become a Realtor, and as a result, you have a huge number of incompetent people out there doing this,' said Miller, who started Consumer Advocates in American Real Estate (CAARE), a nonprofit that educates consumers about the real estate industry. Instead, Miller said you're 'far better off' — in terms of price and quality — going to a lawyer who specializes in residential real estate. The Minnesota attorney has spent decades trying to make the residential real estate industry fairer for consumers and his ideas helped shape the antitrust lawsuits against the NAR that led to the recent changes. 'Attorneys can only represent one side of the transaction,' he said. 'We're trained in how to handle conflicts of interest, Realtors are not.' Marketing remains the biggest challenge Using sites like Zillow, sellers have gained some freedom to market their homes but Miller pointed out that FSBO listings are on a different section of the site that receives less traffic. Hillman and her roommate experienced that limitation firsthand. After initially listing the unit on Zillow, she said interest picked up only after they paid to get the unit on the MLS. 'The biggest obstacle to getting a house sold is marketing exposure, and the Realtors have created the multiple listing service by taking their client data and compiling it and creating this database and then limiting access to it to only other MLS members,' Miller said. He's hopeful the new rules will make it easier for sellers to go around agents and recommends going through a company, as Hillman did, to get listed on the MLS. Miller also emphasized the importance of taking good photos, something Hillman and her roommate paid to have done. Hillman plans to use the knowledge she's gained in future real estate transactions. 'I just bought another condo. When I eventually sell that condo, I will not use a Realtor to sell it,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/real-estate-agents-necessary/	2024-10-07T14:54:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/AP22272552094893-e1697564817258.jpg?w=800
Trump mass deportation plan embraced by some border sheriffs	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump plans to lean heavily on local law enforcement in his efforts to conduct mass deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally should he return to the White House. Speaking exclusively to NewsNation last week, Trump detailed why he would utilize the expertise of local authorities. 'They know them very well. They know their names. They know their middle names. They know everything about them,' Trump said of those who entered the country illegally. 'They know the good ones, the bad ones. They know everything about them, and they're going to get them, and they're going to get them out,' he added. Border town buying drones to deal with migrant emergencies Local law enforcement who spoke to NewsNation embraced the former president's plan. However, there are questions as to how it can be pulled off with limited resources. 'It will be a very big and monumental task to cooperate with the federal government and to ensure our community that we aren't just going rounding up persons of color and deporting them,' Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County, California, told NewsNation. 'These are criminals that we are arresting for victimizing us, and we are making sure they go back to the country where they belong,' Bianco added. Sheriff Mark Dannels of Cochise County, Arizona, told NewsNation that collaboration with the federal government is necessary to ensure a successful operation. Did migrants from Hamas cross into US after Oct. 7? 'We need some kind of court documents for the federal government,' Dannels said. 'Say, 'Hey, this person is possibly in your county. Can you find them?' 'And I don't know everybody in my county, but I guarantee you those that come, whether it's on a traffic stop or speed or traffic violation, we will encounter any other person has wanted this country. Time is our friend. Time is their enemy.' Last week, Trump exclusively told NewsNation he would revoke the Temporary Protected Status for Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, and ensure their return to Haiti.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/trump-local-law-enforcement-mass-deportation/	2024-10-07T12:35:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2167168063.jpg?w=900
Live Wobble Tracker: Map shows real-time movements of Hurricane M...	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Hurricane Milton, which reached Category 5 strength Monday, is heading right for Florida's west coast, with a potential landfall near or at Tampa Bay. The National Hurricane Center predicted that it could possibly weaken to a Category 3 before making landfall, but where it makes landfall could produce drastic differences in how the bay is hit by storm surge. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm Nexstar's Tampa-based meteorologists at WFLA track 'wobbles,' or small movements, on the system’s path. Those wobbles determine where the hurricane is headed and how much damage Floridians can expect. 'If it hits St. Pete Beach, there's 15 feet of water in the Bay,' said Jeff Berardelli, Max Defender 8 chief meteorologist. 'If it hits Longboat Key, 15, 20 miles south of there, there's not much of any water in the bay.' As Milton continues moving forward, there will likely still be changes in its path that will affect where it is headed. 'You're going to have to watch the wobble tracker up until 20 miles off shore,' Berardelli said. While the movements may seem negligible at first glance, these wobbles make a big difference when they compound into a change in the storm’s path. Mandatory evacuations begin in Tampa Bay ahead of Milton This was the case when Max Defender 8 first launched the wobble tracker for Hurricane Ian, a Category 5 hurricane that was originally expected to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay but 'wobbled' further south to its landfall in Charlotte County, Florida. Since then, the tracker has been a major asset in other major hurricanes like Helene and, now, Milton. The wobble tracker watches the motion of hurricanes and tropical storms by using a combination of data from satellites, radar, the forecast trajectory, and the previous path the storm is on, to indicate how the path is changing in real time. Are hurricanes intensifying more rapidly than ever before? The WFLA Wobble Tracker will remain actively streaming 24/7 until Milton makes landfall.

Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire rockets in...	Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country’s south killed at least 10 firefighters. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its ally Hamas, fired new barrages despite its recent losses. Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza. The Israeli military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure. The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants’ resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population. Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week. ___ Here is the latest: Nearly 900 Americans and their families have left Lebanon on flights, officials say WASHINGTON — The State Department says that nearly 900 American citizens, green card holders and their families have now left Lebanon on U.S.-contracted flights since late September. Another 150 Americans, legal permanent residents and immediate family left Beirut on Monday on a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, department spokesman Matthew Miller said. The U.S. has so far organized eight flights — most to Istanbul but at least one to Frankfurt, Germany — since fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified at the end of last month. Each of those flights, which cost $283 per person, has had a capacity of 300 passengers for a total of 2,400 seats, meaning that fewer than half of the available seats have been occupied. Miller said about 8,500 Americans citizens, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals, have reached out to the U.S. embassy in Beirut for information about how to leave the country. Relatives of hostages and those killed in the Oct. 7 attack gather for a service in Tel Aviv TEL AVIV, Israel — Hundreds of relatives of hostages and people killed in the Oct. 7 attack have gathered for a memorial service in a central Tel Aviv park. The gathering is one of two major memorial services marking the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack Monday. Families of victims, angry over the government’s failure to protect them on Oct. 7 or to bring home dozens of hostages still held in Gaza, decided to hold their own ceremony, which was broadcast live on major Israeli TV stations. The government planned a second ceremony later Monday evening. That ceremony was pre-recorded without an audience — apparently out of concern that it could be disrupted. Tens of thousands of people had been expected to join the grieving families in Tel Aviv. But the event was scaled back and limited to about 3,200 people because of threats of missile fire. Shortly before it began, sirens warned of an incoming missile from Yemen, forcing people at the site to lie face down on the ground until it was intercepted. The ceremony included performances by Israeli singers, emotional testimonies from survivors and a moment of silence where the crowd stood at attention. As the artists performed, many in the crowd sobbed or hugged one another. The remains of several destroyed cars of victims of the Hamas attack stood at the front of the stage. The US and Israeli defense ministers are having regular discussions, Pentagon says WASHINGTON — At the Pentagon on Monday, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is having regular discussions with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. He said the conversations include what Israel’s next steps will be. Noting that Gallant will be in the Pentagon to meet with Austin this week, he said the visit 'provides the opportunity for ongoing discussions in more depth.' Austin, he said, will also continue to stress the importance of talking civilian safety into account. Asked if the U.S. has gotten assurances from the Israelis that they will give the Biden administration a heads up as they conduct major operations, Ryder said the U.S. has been clear that 'it’s helpful to be able to have awareness about activities in the region for several reasons. One, to ensure that we can protect Americans and U.S. forces throughout the region in terms of potential second, third order effects. But then also as we work to support the defense of Israel.' Ryder would not comment on what the U.S. may or may not do if Israel strikes nuclear or other key targets in Iran. He said Austin agrees with President Joe Biden in opposition to strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran. He said the U.S. continues to work to prevent the conflict from expanding into a wider regional war. But he stressed that the U.S. supports Israel’s efforts to defend itself against Hamas, through operations in Gaza, and against Hezbollah, through strikes in Lebanon. Israeli military warns people to stay off Lebanon's coast ahead of operations BEIRUT — The Israeli military says it will soon launch operations on Lebanon’s southern coast, telling residents to stay off beaches and the sea. In a statement late Monday, the Israeli army told fishermen and people using any kinds of boats not to sail along an area up to 40 kilometers (22 miles) north of the Israeli border. It also said people should not be on the beaches along the Mediterranean coast from the Israeli border all the way north of the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon. The army warned that people who go to the coast or use boats will be putting their lives in danger. Hundreds gather in Prague to remember victims of the attack PRAGUE — Hundreds of people with Israeli flags gathered at the Old Town Square at the heart of the Czech capital to honor the victims of Hamas’ attack against Israel one year ago. 'On this day, we don’t just mourn, but we’re also aware that it’s necessary to do everything to give such attacks no chance to happen again,' Petr Papousek, the head of the Federation of Jewish Communities in the Czech Republic, said in his address. 'Israel will always strive for the world without violence in which people live without fear of terror,' Papousek said. He said that their gathering 'reminds us that hope is stronger than fear and love is stronger that hate.' French President Macron meets with the families of hostages and victims PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron held meetings Monday with the families of two French nationals who are being held hostage in the Gaza Strip and families of victims of the Oct.7 attacks living in France, Macron’s office said. Macron said France will do 'everything possible' to push for a cease-fire and an agreement that would allow the release of Ohad Yahalomi and Ofer Kalderon, the French hostages, as a priority, the statement said. Macron expressed 'the nation’s compassion' toward those affected by the Oct. 7 attacks and told the families meeting at the Elysee presidential palace that France will stand by their side and continue to 'fight tirelessly' against the rise of antisemitism. A second flight leaves Beirut to take Brazilians home RIO DE JANEIRO — The second repatriation flight organized by the Brazilian government to assist its nationals left Beirut on Monday, according to a statement from the Brazilian air force. The plane carrying 227 Brazilians, including 49 children, will stop for fuel in Lisbon before heading to Sao Paulo’s Guarulhos airport, where it is due to arrive Tuesday. The plane took Lebanon medical and hospital supplies donated by Brazil, Brazil’s foreign ministry said Monday, adding that more will follow in future flights. The first repatriation flight landed in Sao Paulo on Sunday. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was on site to greet those fleeing the violence. About 21,000 Brazilians live in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon. In a separate statement, Brazil's foreign ministry called 'for the immediate release of all hostages and for negotiations that lead to a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.' US President Biden and the first lady mark the anniversary at the White House WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden hosted a somber memorial ceremony at the White House Monday to mark the one-year anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The Bidens looked on as Rabbi Aaron Alexander of Washington’s Adas Israel Congregation recited the Jewish remembrance prayer for the more than 1,200 people, including dozens of Americans, killed that day, listing the towns, villages and festival site that were the scenes of the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The president then lit a lone memorial candle placed on a small table at the center of the Blue Room before they observed a moment of silence. Earlier in the day, Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the White House said. Rocket fire from Lebanon targets Israel on a tense day TEL AVIV, Israel — Some 175 rockets were launched from Lebanon on northern Israel on Monday, injuring a woman and causing heavy damage on a tense day marking a year since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 raid, the Israeli military said. Seven other people were injured, one severely, when volleys of rockets hit the cities of Haifa and Tiberias late on Sunday, Israel’s rescue service said. Police said the rocket fire on Monday caused direct hits on highways and several homes. Hezbollah said that it carried out several rocket attacks on Monday including a 'large salvo' on areas north of Haifa, and on the northern Israeli city of Karmiel and the town of Kfar Vradim. It also said it fired rockets on the edge of the Lebanese village of Maroun El-Ras, where Israeli troops took positions inside a public garden. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it conducted an extensive aerial operation in Lebanon on Monday, striking over 120 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon within an hour. It said the targets included sites that belong to the militant group’s Radwan Forces, missiles and rockets force, and an intelligence division. Israeli military intercepts a ballistic missile from Yemen TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said it intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen that triggered sirens across central Israel for the second time on Monday. There were no reports of injuries. The sirens came as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Oc. 7 Hamas attack. Earlier on Monday, rockets fired from Gaza set off sirens in Tel Aviv and several adjacent cities. Vandals deface mural in Italy depicting survivor of Oct. 7 MILAN — The Antisemitism Observatory in Milan said the vandalism of a mural depicting a survivor of last year’s Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 people in Israel is an example of rising and 'overpowering' antisemitism in Italy. Researcher Stefano Gatti said the number of antisemitic incidents has risen to about 90 a week in the last year, from about 30 a week before. He said antisemitism has moved from the internet to the real world, and has become more 'socially acceptable' as a protest against Israel’s assault in Gaza. They include graffiti, insults, acts of intimidation and aggression, that so far have not translated into cases of bodily harm. The mural vandalized on Monday by AleXsandro Palombo depicted a survivor, Vlada Patapov, escaping the Hamas attack. Vandals erased the figure’s head and legs from the mural near Milan’s state university. Political feuds divide Congress over how closely to stand by Israel WASHINGTON — There were some bipartisan efforts in the U.S. Congress to commemorate the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, but the anniversary also touched on political feuds raging over how closely the U.S. should stand by Israel. Republicans have pushed steadfast support for Israel even amid its devastating campaign into Gaza. Earlier this year, they heartily welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Capitol for a speech. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday called for the U.S. to 'recommit to stand with Israel in its righteous fight.' He also said that the Hamas attack that triggered the war a year ago had drawn antisemitism 'out of the shadows' against Jewish communities around the world. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, was expected to speak later Monday at an event for the Republican Jewish Coalition. Democrats, meanwhile, marked the day with statements of condolence for the victims of the Oct. 7 attack, but were divided in their continued support for Israeli aggressions. The left-wing of the party has become increasingly critical of Israel’s retaliatory attack that left Gaza in ruins and killed over 41,000 people. 'Instead of securing the release of the hostages, however, Prime Minister Netanyahu has unleashed unthinkable violence on innocent civilians in Gaza,' said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Ma., in a statement. 'More than a million Palestinians are facing starvation. We see videos of dead children held in the arms of their parents. Violence is escalating throughout the region, including most recently in Lebanon, threatening even more human suffering.' US Treasury sanctions 3 people for helping bankroll Hamas WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury on Monday sanctioned three people in Europe, a charity group and a bank in Gaza, all accused of helping to bankroll militant group Hamas. Treasury says Hamas and its affiliates raise funds through sham charities and as of this year, the militant Palestinian group may have received as much as $10 million a month through such donations. Included in the sanctions: Mohammad Hannoun, an Italy-based Hamas member and his Charity Association of Solidarity with the Palestinian People; Majed al-Zeer, a senior Hamas representative in Germany and Adel Doughman, who is in charge of Hamas activity in Austria. Additionally, Al-Intaj, an unlicensed Hamas-run bank in Gaza was sanctioned for allegedly providing services to Hamas. 'As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Israeli defense minister will hold talks in Washington WASHINGTON -- Israel’s defense minister is to travel to Washington this week for talks at the Pentagon. The visit by Yoav Gallant comes at a sensitive time in the yearlong Mideast conflict. Israel has vowed to attack Iran following an intense Iranian missile barrage last week. Such an attack could rattle international oil markets and potentially draw in American forces in the region. Israel has also been expanding a ground offensive against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. The Pentagon’s spokesman, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, announced the visit on the platform X, saying that Gallant and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would discuss 'ongoing Middle East security developments.' Gallant’s office confirmed the scheduled visit but gave no further details. A Lebanese mountain village mourns the dead in an airstrike QMATIYEH, Lebanon — A village in the mountains southeast of Beirut was in shock after an Israeli airstrike demolished a residential building and partly destroyed another, killing seven people, including three children. Hadi Zahwe, a resident of the area, told reporters that the strike on Sunday was 'terrifying.' 'There were children killed, there were children’s body parts,' he said. 'This enemy is targeting civilian women and children.' Israel has carried out a widening aerial bombardment of many parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs over the past two weeks, targeting what it said were Hezbollah militants and weapons. It was not clear what the intended target was in Sunday’s strike, which was the first one to hit the area. Mahmoud Nasr Eldin, the town’s deputy mayor, said the village contains 'no security or military centers.' ''There’s nothing in Qmatiyeh that they’re looking for — it’s a safe area,' he said. 'We welcomed around 15,000 internally displaced people. They are our people, they ran away from their villages and came to get protection here.' A 12-year-old Palestinian boy is fatally shot in the West Bank RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israeli troops shot and killed a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in the central West Bank Monday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The boy, Hatem Ghaith, was fatally shot in the stomach at the Qalandiya refugee camp, the ministry said. Commenting on the shooting, the Israeli army said its forces opened fire at rioters who were hurling rocks at troops operating in the area. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian new agency, the shooting occurred during an Israeli military raid on the camp. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago, violence has surged in the occupied West Bank, where over 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the Health Ministry. Netanyahu says Israel is waging a 'war of resurrection' JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel was fighting a 'war of resurrection' and would continue until achieving its goals, as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack. 'This is the war of our existence — the ‘war of resurrection’. This is what I would like to officially call the war,' Netanyahu said during a Cabinet meeting. His comment provoked a response from a group representing the families of the hostages held in Gaza, who said they wished to 'remind the prime minister that there is and will be no resurrection without the return of all the hostages.' In a statement earlier, Netanyahu vowed that Israel would keep fighting until the 'living and dead' hostages were returned, Hamas is overthrown in Gaza and residents of the country’s north and south could go back to their homes. 'Since that black day, we are under attack on seven fronts,' Netanyahu said, referring to Oct. 7, 2023. He said counterattacking Iranian-backed groups 'is a necessary condition for securing our future.' French foreign minister on a visit to Israel pleads for a cease-fire PARIS — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot on Monday pleaded in favor of a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, saying that France and its partners were 'ready to work collectively for de-escalation and peace in the region.' 'After a year of war, the time for diplomacy has come,' Barrot said in Jerusalem. He earlier took part in a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, where about 1,200 people were killed and some 250 were taken hostage in Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, 2023. He said he had held multiple meetings while touring the region in recent days, including in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan. Barrot reiterated France’s commitment to Israel’s security as 'unwavering,' but said 'force alone cannot guarantee Israel’s security.' Barrot said that a two-state solution is 'the only one that guarantees a just and lasting peace.' Barrot’s comments came two days after French President Emmanuel Macron called for 'a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,' drawing strong criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Both leaders spoke over the phone on Sunday. Macron’s office said the French leader told Netanyahu that arms deliveries, the prolongation of the war in Gaza and its extension to Lebanon will not produce security for either Israelis or others living in the region. 'We must be consistent,' Barrot said on Monday. 'We cannot ask for a cease-fire while arming the belligerents.' Barrot announced that France will hold in a few days an international conference in support of Lebanon's army and to help strengthen its institutions. Swedish, Czech prime ministers condemn Hamas' attack a year ago STOCKHOLM — Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Monday that Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago was 'the worst mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust was committed.' Kristersson said the attack also 'led to an escalated conflict in the Middle East that is still ongoing, with tens of thousands of civilian casualties and enormous suffering.' Kristersson called for a cease-fire and the release of hostages, a de-escalation in the region and an increased humanitarian access. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala reiterated his country’s support for Israel on the anniversary of the attack by Hamas. 'A few days ago, Israel was attacked again by Iran. Again, unfortunately, anti-Semitism in various forms is also on the rise,' Fiala wrote on X. 'Tensions in the Middle East bring suffering to many people. However, terrorist organizations will not bring peace and a dignified life to people there. Israel defends its existence, it is repeatedly attacked and must have the right to defend itself. Therefore, on the day of this tragic anniversary, I repeat: The Czech Republic stands by Israel!' Erdogan condemns Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack to condemn Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Today, I remember with sorrow the tens of thousands of people that the murderous Israeli government has massacred since Oct. 7,' Erdogan said in a message posted on X. 'I convey my most heartfelt condolences to my brothers from Gaza, Palestine, and Lebanon.' An outspoken critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza and more recently the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Erdogan said: 'Israel’s long-standing policy of genocide, occupation, and invasion must finally come to an end.' He has praised Hamas previously as a 'liberation group.' Erdogan on Monday made no mention of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, in which the militants killed about 1,200 people and dragged some 250 hostages back to Gaza. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and displaced most of the territory’s 2.3 million population. 'Israel will sooner or later pay the price for this genocide, which it has been implementing for a year and which is still continuing,' Erdogan wrote. 'Just as Hitler was stopped by a joint alliance of humanity, (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and his killer network will be stopped in the same way.' Pope Francis refers to the ‘fuse of hatred’ lit a year ago ROME — The Vatican marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel by taking up a collection for the people of Gaza and publishing a letter form Pope Francis to Catholics in the region expressing his solidarity. Francis made no mention of Israel, Hamas or hostages in the letter dated Oct. 7 and addressed to Catholics in the Middle East, especially in Gaza. He referred to the 'fuse of hatred' being lit one year ago, and the spiral of violence that had ensued, in insisting that what is needed is dialogue and peace. After some comments that upset Israel early on in the conflict, Francis has usually tried to strike an even tone, often referring to Palestinians and Israel in his frequent appeals for peace. But he recently suggested Israel was using disproportionate and 'immoral' force in Lebanon and Gaza. And on the Oct. 7 anniversary, Francis spoke in general terms to people of all religious confessions in the region, thanking Christians for staying in their historic lands and directing himself in a particular way to the people of Gaza. 'I am close to you, I am with you. I am with you, the people of Gaza, long embattled and in dire straits. You are in my thoughts and prayers daily,' he wrote. Francis said he was particularly close to those who have been forced to flee their homes to find refuge from bombing; to the mothers weeping over their dead children and those 'who are afraid to look up for fear of fire raining down from the skies.' Francis has called for a day of fasting and prayer on Monday, and his chief almsgiver announced he was taking up a collection from participants in Francis’ big meeting of bishops at the Vatican this week. He urged donors to be particularly generous, saying the proceeds of the fundraising drive would go straight to the Catholic parish in Gaza, where Francis calls every day. At least 10 Lebanese firefighters killed in the country's south BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country’s south killed at least 10 firefighters on Monday. It said more people were buried under the rubble and the death toll may rise. The ministry said the firefighters were in a municipality building in the town of Baraachit that was hit as they prepared to embark on a rescue mission. Biden and Harris condemn Hamas on the attack anniversary and call for a cease-fire WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris condemned Hamas on the anniversary of the militant group’s attack on Israel, while reiterating their administration’s commitment to cementing cease-fire deals to end fighting in Gaza and Lebanon. 'On this solemn anniversary, let us bear witness to the unspeakable brutality of the October 7th attacks but also to the beauty of the lives that were stolen that day,' Biden said in a statement. The president said that he thinks every day of the more than 100 hostages still in captivity and their families. He vowed that his administration 'will never give up until we bring all of the remaining hostages home safely.' Biden added that 'history will also remember October 7th as a dark day for the Palestinian people because of the conflict that Hamas unleashed that day.' Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. 'It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people,' Harris said. 'And I will always fight for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination.' Israeli military warns dozens of towns in southern Lebanon to evacuate BEIRUT — The Israeli military Monday warned people in over a dozen towns and villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate, including the coastal town where the U.N. peacekeeping mission is headquartered. Israeli evacuation warnings in recent days have expanded to include a provincial capital, as troops continue their ground incursion backed by intense airstrikes. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, is headquartered in Naqoura, not far from the coastal city of Tyre. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee in a post on X told residents to immediately flee north. 'You are not allowed to head southward,' the statement read. 'Any movement to the south puts your lives at risk.' Lebanon’s cash-strapped government estimates that some 1.2 million people have been displaced in the fighting and it's struggling to support them. Israel says its aim is to weaken Hezbollah to allow its displaced residents to move back to northern Israel. Hezbollah maintains that it will stop firing rockets at Israel when there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, in solidarity with its ally Hamas. Israeli military orders an evacuation in southern Gaza after Hamas' rocket attack JERUSALEM — The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate areas near the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip after Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv. The military had also ordered an evacuation of the areas east of Khan Younis earlier in the war when it sent ground troops into the territory’s second largest city. The latest orders on Monday came after a barrage of five rockets triggered air raid sirens in central Israel, lightly wounded two women and caused minor damage. The military said the rockets were fired from the area of Khan Younis. Hamas claimed the attack, which came as Israelis marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza that triggered the war. On Sunday, the military reiterated warnings for the entire population of northern Gaza to flee south. Those warnings date back to the early weeks of the war, when Israeli forces sealed off the north and launched heavy operations there. A year of war has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas, but its fighters have repeatedly regrouped in areas where Israel has carried out large operations. Netanyahu addresses an Oct. 7 memorial JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel 'arose as a nation as lions' following the Oct. 7 attack a year ago. 'We remember our fallen, our hostages — whom we are committed to return — our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,' Netanyahu said at a memorial commemorating the anniversary of the attack. He visited the memorial in Jerusalem for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in the Hamas-led attack and the war it ignited. He spoke alongside the mayor of Jerusalem as the two held a small tribute at an event that appeared closed to the public. Netanyahu has faced heavy criticism for security lapses that allowed the attack to unfold and mass protests over his failure to return some 100 hostages still held in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. The attack one year ago killed some 1,200 people across southern Israel, mostly civilians. Palestinian militants dragged some 250 hostages back to Gaza. The subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and displaced most of the territory’s 2.3 million population. Nearly 700 Americans have left Lebanon WASHINGTON — The State Department says nearly 700 American citizens, green card holders and family members have now left Lebanon aboard U.S.-contracted planes since late September. The department said Monday that about 90 passengers — less than a third of the planes 300-person capacity — departed Beirut for Istanbul, Turkey, on Sunday on the latest flight. Hundreds of other Americans have left Lebanon aboard regularly scheduled commercial flights since fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified. The department said it has made more than 2,900 seats available for Americans on those flights. Jordan's foreign minister criticizes Israel's war with Hezbollah BEIRUT — Jordan’s top diplomat on Monday slammed Israel’s war with the militant Hezbollah group in Lebanon, saying it is pushing the Middle East into the 'abyss of full-scale regional war.' 'We are facing a disaster and a dangerous escalation that threatens the region,' Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. 'Israel bears responsibility of this aggression, the escalation in the region, and any new escalation that the region faces.' He spoke in a news conference following a meeting with Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati in Beirut. Safadi said that Jordan backs the Lebanese government’s initiative to elect a new president and commitment to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended Israel’s last war with Hezbollah in 2006, and that would keep southern Lebanon exclusively under the control of the Lebanese military and U.N. peacekeepers. He added that Jordan, like Lebanon, backed an initiative by the United States and France for a three-week cease-fire in Lebanon. Meanwhile, as the region braces for an Israeli retaliation for Iran's missile attack, Safadi said Jordan rejects either country using its airspace in their tit-for-tat hostitilies. 'We will not a battlefield for anyone,' he said. 'We made this message clear to Iran and to Israel as well.' Australian prime minister attends a vigil in Melbourne MELBOURNE, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil commemorating the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and walked in Melbourne with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Albanese was not expected to speak at the vigil, attended by thousands. In a statement, he said the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas’ actions. 'Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day -- and as a nation we say never again,' he said. 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He acknowledged the 'devastating' loss of civilian lives since Oct. 7. Hundreds of people gathered Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict amid a heavy police presence. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia’s cities on Sunday. Meanwhile, the first of two repatriation flights organized by the Australian government to transport Australians from Lebanon touched down in Sydney on Monday evening with nearly 350 people on board. Kibbutz Be'eri commemorates the Oct. 7 attack KIBBUTZ BE’ERI, Israel — Members of Kibbutz Be’eri, one of the hardest-hit communities during the Oct. 7 attack, gathered amid the burned ruins of their homes and demanded an immediate return of the hostages during a memorial and rally on Monday. More than 95 people were killed there and 30 were taken hostage on Oct. 7, according to the community’s spokesperson. Some of the women and children from the kibbutz were released in a cease-fire deal in November, but 10 hostages from Be’eri remain in captivity. Israel believes most of them are no longer alive. On Monday, the community marched silently through the streets of the kibbutz bearing signs of the hostages before gathering for a rally, unfurling a massive flag with the words 'Be’eri cannot heal until everyone is home.' Ella Ben-Ami, whose father Ohad Ben-Ami was kidnapped from Be’eri, addressed the crowd and demanded the government of Israel bring her father home. She said she continues to take solace from the video of his kidnapping, when he stands tall and proud, as if he knew he was being filmed, to broadcast a message to his family that he would be OK. Many people at Be’eri were dreading the anniversary, which felt like an 'impossible' amount of time, she said. 'But then I stop for a moment I think that my father woke up today to count a year in captivity, a year!' she said. Meloni visits the Rome synagogue ROME — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel’s right to defend itself. Meloni also denounced the 'latent and rampant antisemitism' that has arisen in the year since the Hamas attacks, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy over the weekend, some of which turned violent. While asserting Israel’s lights to live safely within its borders, she insisted that it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been 'victims twice over: first of Hamas’ cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.' As the current president of the Group of Seven, Italy will continue to work for an immediate cease-fire, 'the release of Israeli hostages and the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border through the full implementation of U.N. resolutions,' Meloni said. Since coming to office in 2022, Meloni has taken several initiatives to show her strong support for Italy’s Jewish community and Israel. Her Brothers of Italy party has roots in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, or MSI, which was founded in 1946 by sympathizers of Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Hamas fires rockets from Gaza, setting off sirens in central Tel Aviv TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Monday that projectiles fired from Gaza set off sirens in central Tel Aviv, as Israel marks a year to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury. The sirens came as Israelis were marking the anniversary to the deadliest attack in their country’s history. That attack one year ago began with a volley of rockets from Gaza. Israeli strikes hit locations used by Hamas-run police in central Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes hit two makeshift points used by Hamas-run police at a hospital in central Gaza, wounding a journalist. There were no police present at the sites when they were hit early Monday. Ali al-Attar, a journalist working for Al Jazeera, was hit by shrapnel while he was inside a tent used by reporters nearby, according to an Associated Press journalist. Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, operated a police force numbering in the tens of thousands before the war. They have adopted a low profile after being repeatedly targeted by Israeli strikes but still maintain control on the ground in Gaza. Lebanon's Hezbollah group pledges to keep fighting Israel BEIRUT — The Lebanese Hezbollah militant group on Monday reaffirmed its commitment to support Hamas by fighting Israel along Lebanon's southern border. The statement came a year after its allies from the Palestinian Hamas group staged a surprise attack into southern Israel, setting off the war, and amid ongoing intense Israeli airstrikes and a ground incursion into Lebanon. Hezbollah maintains that it will stop its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and although its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed. Large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon have been targeted in Israeli airstrikes. 'We are confident, God willing, in the ability of our resistance to repel the aggression, and in our great and resistant people to be patient, steadfast, and endure until this calamity is removed,' Hezbollah said. The Lebanese government estimates that some 1.2 million people in Lebanon have been displaced, mostly during the escalations less than a month ago. Hezbollah also praised Iran and other Tehran-backed groups in the region, notably Yemen's Houthis and Iraqi Shiite militias for their attacks on Israel. Families gather across southern Israel to mark anniversary of Oct 7 attack BE’ERI, Israel — Across southern Israel on Monday, families gathered in spots where their loved ones were killed during Hamas’ attack, marking a year since the assault that sparked the war in Gaza. They crowded into roadside bomb shelters that became death traps when people seeking shelter from Hamas rockets and militants were sprayed with bullets or struck by grenades. People were also visiting spots on the side of a main road marked with memorials. In Kibbutz Be’eri, one of the hardest-hit communities struck in Hamas’ attack, where roughly 100 residents were killed and 30 kidnapped on Oct. 7, hundreds marched silently holding signs bearing photos of people still being held captive in Gaza. They held a rally in front of homes destroyed in the attack. French President Macron says pain of Oct 7 ‘as vivid as it was a year ago’ PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media on Monday to mark the one-year anniversary since Hamas’ attack on Israel. 'The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,' Macron said on X. 'We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts.' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot was in Israel for the anniversary and attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival where hundreds were killed in Hamas’ attack. Barrot, talking to the families of victims, pledged France’s support in the face of 'the worst anti-Semitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.' 'The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,' he said. 'France mourns alongside Israel our 48 compatriots victims of barbarism.' Barrot, who is expected to speak with his counterpart Israel Katz later Monday, said that Macron will also meet in Paris with family members of Israelis held hostage today. Japan expresses condolences on anniversary of Hamas attack TOKYO — Japan has expressed its condolences to families of victims on the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and demanded the immediate release of hostages. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Monday that Japan is seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip amid continued fighting, the large number of civilian casualties and the ongoing security threats to both Israeli and Palestinian people. 'Japan continues to urge all parties including Israel to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, and strongly urges them to steadily work toward realization of a cease-fire,' Hayashi said. He added that Japan strongly supports mediation efforts by the United States, Egypt and Qatar in achieving negotiations for the release of the hostages and a cease-fire. Group representing families of hostages announces death of a captive TEL AVIV, Israel — A group representing the families of Israeli hostages announced on Monday the death of a captive whose body is still being held in Gaza. The Hostages and Families Forum said Idan Shtivi, 28, was captured from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7. He was thought to have been taken alive. Israeli media reported that he was killed that day and his body was taken into Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Shtivi’s death became apparent, but in previous such announcements, the Israeli military has discovered evidence indicating a hostage’s death. The announcement of Shtivi’s death comes as Israelis are marking one year since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, where militants killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others. About 100 remain in captivity, although more than a third of those are said to be dead. Hundreds gather at Nova music festival site to remember Oct 7 victims RE’IM, Israel — Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault. Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch. 'We can’t understand how a year has passed,' said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. 'It’s the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,' he said. Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden’s last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed. The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman’s piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away. 20 Indonesians who were evacuated from Lebanon arrive in Jakarta JAKARTA, Indonesia — Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said. President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow. 'I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,' Widodo said last week. Indonesia’s Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said. Australian PM Albanese condemns Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried 'terrible pain' and his government 'unequivocally' condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago. Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack. Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have 'felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day — and as a nation we say never again.' 'We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,' Albanese said. He added that 'every innocent life matters' and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was 'a devastating tragedy.' 'Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,' Albanese said. New Israeli strikes hit Beirut suburbs as Hezbollah claims blasts in Israel's Haifa BEIRUT — A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people. Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel’s military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and 'fallen projectiles' were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/international-headlines/ap-middle-east-latest-palestinian-militants-in-gaza-fire-4-rockets-into-israel-as-mourners-mark-oct-7/	2024-10-07T10:44:43-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67041e9c292c79.26109211.jpeg?w=900
Reconsidering where you live after Helene? You're not alone	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene's devastation has nearly a third of young adults reconsidering where they want to live in the future, according to a new survey conducted by Redfin. 'Americans are beginning to realize that nowhere is truly immune to the impacts of climate change, and we're starting to see that impact where people want to live, even people who haven't experienced a catastrophic weather event firsthand,' Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather said. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm Helene's damage along Florida's Gulf Coast to the unexpected devastation in Asheville, North Carolina, has Americans ages 18 to 34 rethinking where they want to live. In addition to possible weather catastrophes, 23% of respondents fear the overall insurance premiums for their areas will go up after Helene and that it will be hard to get insurance to cover storm-related damages. However, nearly half of all respondents said the news and hurricane damage has not impacted the way they think about their housing situation, the report said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/reconsidering-live-helene/	2024-10-07T10:34:49-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176842434.jpg?w=900
Are hurricanes intensifying more rapidly than ever before?	(NEXSTAR) – Hurricane Milton intensified from a Category 1 to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale over the course of Monday morning as it progressed toward Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was also expected to bring heavy rainfall and storm surges to parts of Florida before weakening and making landfall. Hurricane Milton intensifies to Category 5 storm People living in the Gulf area’s most frequent hurricane paths, meanwhile, are no stranger to storms. But the rapid intensification of these storms? That might be relatively new. Rapid intensification is defined by the National Hurricane Center as an increase of at least 30 knots (about 35 mph) in maximum sustained winds within a 24-hour period, which can mean a jump of two categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale. As it currently stands, rapid intensification has been observed in about 80% of all major hurricanes in the North Atlantic 'and nearly all category four and five hurricanes,' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said earlier this year. Scientists have also found evidence to suggest that storms are more frequently experiencing rapid intensification when compared to cyclones in years past, but it’s unclear if all of those instances can be attributed to climate change, or if 'natural variables' can account for some, according to an October 2024 report from the Congressional Research Service. Researchers, however, have indeed observed an increase in rapidly intensifying storms in global basins, as well as a significant spike in rapid intensification happening just offshore, rather than out in the open ocean. Residents board up a sea shell store ahead of Hurricane Milton's expected landfall in the middle of this week in Treasure Island, Florida on October 7, 2024. (Photo by Bryan R. Smith/AFP via Getty Images) The NOAA points to our warming planet as a major factor. Rising ocean temperatures (both on the surface and below) as well as humid air — which often accompanies warmer water — are two of the main conditions that encourage cyclone development, the agency says. Such rapidly intensifying storms will only become 'more likely' in the future, according to the Congressional report. 'According to NOAA, scientists have medium to high confidence that tropical cyclone intensities globally will likely increase on average under a [2 degrees Celsius] of global surface temperature increase, and that the global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach very intense levels (Category 4 and 5) will also likely increase over the 21st century,' the report states. Mandatory evacuations begin in Tampa Bay ahead of Milton 'Scientists also project these changes for the Atlantic basin, specifically,' the author added. An increase in rapidly intensifying cyclones, too, is especially problematic for those in the paths of the forecasted storms. Rapid intensification is hard to predict, meaning residents in the target areas not be fully aware of the intensity of a hurricane — and perhaps not prepared to evacuate — until it’s too late. How climate change is intensifying storms like Hurricane Helene Milton is expected to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday, albeit as a weaker Category 3 hurricane, Nexstar's WFLA reported Monday. Still, officials are urging residents of some parts to prepare and evacuate before it’s too late to do so. 'This is the real deal here with Milton,' Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said, the Associated Press reported. 'If you want to take on Mother Nature, she wins 100% of the time.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/hurricanes-intensifying-weather/	2024-10-07T09:44:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/HurricaneMiltonGettyImages-2176495337-e1728319044683.jpg?w=800

Border town buying drones to deal with migrant emergencies	SUNLAND PARK, N.M. (Border Report) – The City of Sunland Park is acquiring drones so its fire and police departments can more effectively rescue stranded migrants and hikers on Mount Cristo Rey and individuals struggling in the Rio Grande. The drones also will help police ensure children at public schools are safe whenever incursions by groups of people are reported – as has often happened in this border community during migrant surges in the past few years. Border Report Live: How the border shapes US politics, Mexico relations 'We get a lot of people, obviously immigrants coming across NM 273 (McNutt Road) trying to either run or hide, and if they do they go toward the river, toward areas that are vegetated. It’s very difficult for us to have line-of-sight,' said City Manager Mario Juarez-Infante. 'And sometimes they try to assimilate with the schools, so that’s the advantage of having the drones.' Juarez-Infante expects the drones will be primarily used to save lives and to ensure that children are safe inside their campus. The city is spending an initial $6,000 on three drones and plans to deploy them before the end of the year. Volunteers want sheriff to pick up human remains found in desert He said real-time information would be shared with federal agencies such as the U.S. Border Patrol during public safety emergencies. This graphic shows how Sunland Park, N.M., police plan to integrate drones and collaboration with state and federal agencies into its public safety strategy. The Sunland Park Fire Department has developed a close relationship with the Border Patrol while assisting migrants who slide off the mountain, fall over the border wall or nearly drown in the Rio Grande. Man awaiting smuggling trial allegedly arrested with new group of migrants A total of 176 migrants have died in the past 12 months in the El Paso Sector of the Border Patrol that runs from Hudspeth County, Texas, to the New Mexico-Arizona state line.

Frontlines with Robert Sherman: Oct. 7 — One Year Later	NewsNation National Correspondent Robert Sherman has found himself on the frontlines of some of the world’s biggest stories: from Ukraine to Israel and across the United States. He shares what he’s seeing on the ground. Subscribe to his newsletter: Frontlines with Robert Sherman here. This morning I am writing to you from Kibbutz Nir Oz. I am sitting on the lawn of a courtyard separating half a dozen homes. The birds are scenically chirping as small wildlife critters hop around. If you close your eyes and take it all in, it’s a small slice of serenity. But then you open your eyes and reality sets in. There is a home right in front of me scorched from the inside as its melted metal awning droops down. There are spray paint markings on the front of the house left behind by the search-and-rescue crews to signify bodies were found inside. Down the road, there is a memorial taking place for those killed and taken hostage, the chorus of mourners at times drowned out by what one local referred to as 'the symphony of war.' That would be the sound of jets, artillery and machines guns rattling nearby. How to register to vote Kibbutz Nir Oz before the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack was a community of less than 400 people. About a quarter of the population there was killed or taken hostage that day. Twenty-nine are still being held in Gaza. You may recall from the early days of the war one of the few pieces of good news Israel received: a pair of elderly hostages were released in October. One of them was Yocheved Lifshitz, who was taken from Nir Oz by bike and held in Hamas’ tunnels, which she described as being like a 'spider web.' She returned to Israel that day. Her husband, Oded, is still in Gaza. We spoke with their grandson Monday on 'Morning in America.' You can watch that interview here. There is palpable pain on the ground here. Families are broken. Closure has not been attained. As I wrote previously, the feeling here is that one year has passed since Oct. 7, but Oct. 8 has not yet arrived. We’ll be sharing the stories of those caught right in the middle of Oct. 7 throughout the day on NewsNation. Additionally, one year later, there is still a big question many are asking: How could this have possibly happened? Especially considering mere weeks ago Israeli intelligence pulled off an astonishing feat as they detonated Hezbollah pagers across Lebanon that injured and exposed their members. Yet one year ago, Hamas was able to overwhelm Israel’s air defense systems and enter the country on bikes, trucks and homemade gliders. How could they not see it coming and, perhaps more pointedly, is Israel ready for the next attempt? We spoke with a former member of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal intelligence agency, who thinks Israel is susceptible to the mistakes of the past. Close Thank you for signing up!

Diddy's mom: 'My son is not the monster they have painted him to ...	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs’ mother, Janice Smalls Combs, condemned the allegations against her son, likening the investigation to a 'public lynching' rooted in 'lies' for 'financial gain.' The business mogul wields significant wealth and power in the entertainment industry. He faces federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution. Smalls Combs acknowledged a video showing her son assaulting his former girlfriend in a hotel in 2016. Combs admitted to the assault in May, calling his actions 'inexcusable.' Florida doctor faces murder charges after running pill mill: Police 'It is important to recognize that none of us, regardless of our status, are immune to fear or mistakes,' Smalls Combs said. 'Not being entirely straightforward about one issue does not mean my son is guilty of the repulsive allegations and the grave charges leveled against him.' In November 2023, Combs’ former girlfriend and fellow musician Cassandra 'Cassie' Ventura filed a lawsuit alleging Combs physically and sexually abused her for years during their relationship. They settled the suit the next day, directing further scrutiny at Combs and a series of additional lawsuits in the months that followed. Smalls Combs said she believes the allegations against her son are cash-grabs based on lies. 'These individuals saw how quickly my son’s civil legal team settled his ex-girlfriend’s lawsuit, so they believe they can receive a quick payday by falsely accusing my son,' she said. Prosecutors allege Combs used the resources of his music empire to create 'a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.' Read Smalls Combs’ full statement below: 'I come to you today as a mother that is devastated and profoundly saddened by the allegations made against my son, Sean Combs. It is heartbreaking to see my son judged not for the truth, but for a narrative created out of lies. To bear witness (to) what seems to be like a public lynching of my son before he has had the opportunity to prove his innocence is a pain too unbearable to put into words. Like every human being, my son deserves to have his day in court, to finally share his side, and to prove his innocence. I am not here to portray my son as a perfect person because he is not. My son may not have been entirely truthful about certain things, such as denying he has ever gotten violent with an ex-girlfriend when the hotel’s surveillance showed otherwise. Sometimes, the truth and a lie become so closely intertwined that it becomes terrifying to admit one part of the story, especially when that truth is outside the norm or is too complicated to be believed. This is why I believe by son’s civil legal team opted to settle the ex-girlfriend’s lawsuit instead of contesting it until the end, resulting in a ricochet effect as the federal government used this decision against my son by interpreting it as an admission of guilt. It is important to recognize that none of us, regardless of our status, are immune to fear or mistakes. Not being entirely straightforward about one issue does not mean my son is guilty of the repulsive allegations and the grave charges leveled against him. Many individuals who were wrongfully convicted and later exonerated had their freedom taken from them not because they were guilty of the crimes they were accused of, but because they didn’t fit the image of what this society considers to be a ‘good person.’ History has showed us how individuals can be wrongfully convicted due to their past actions or mistakes. Watching the world make jokes and laugh at my son’s life crumbling before our eyes is something I can never forget. It is truly agonizing to watch the world turn against my son so quickly and easily over lies and misconceptions, without ever hearing his side or affording him the opportunity to present his side. These lies thrown at him are motivated by financial gain, and not justice. These individuals saw how quickly my son’s civil legal team settled his ex-girlfriend’s lawsuit, so they believe they can receive a quick payday by falsely accusing my son. False allegations of sexual assault thwart true victims of sexual violence from getting the justice they deserve. To make matters worse, the federal government is now using these lies to prosecute my son. This injustice has been unbearable for our family. The worst part of this ordeal is watching my beloved son be stripped of his dignity, not for what he did, but for what people choose to believe about him. I ask his supporters, fans, colleagues, friends, and the public, to not judge him before you’ve had the chance to hear his side. I beg you to think about those who have been wrongfully persecuted, to remember that not everyone who has made mistakes in life deserves to have their entire existence judged by a single action or a few mistakes. My son is not the monster they have painted him to be, and he deserves the chance to tell his side. I can only pray that I am alive to see him speak his truth and be vindicated.'

Live: Milton upgraded to Category 4 storm, DeSantis gives update	(NewsNation) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday is expected to give an update on preparations for Hurricane Milton, which is likely to make landfall Wednesday near the Tampa Bay area. Milton rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane Monday with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph after developing in the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters warn the area could see a storm surge up to 12 feet, leading the way for possible evacuations. Milton comes on the heels of Hurricane Helene, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane before weakening over land. While Helene decreased in intensity as it traversed the Southeast, the storm still brought major devastation to several states, with western North Carolina still largely cut off due to storm damage. More Americans than ever rely on government help: Report Forecast models currently show Milton making landfall Wednesday and remaining at hurricane strength as it moves across Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. The current track would avoid other states affected by Helene, which has resulted in at least 230 deaths so far with many still missing in the Appalachians. A tropical storm watch was in effect for Florida’s Gulf Coast from Flamingo to south of Chokoloskee and from north of the mouth of the Suwanee River to Indian Pass, and for the Florida Keys, including Florida Bay. DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be seen where exactly Milton will strike, it’s clear the state is going to be hit hard. 'You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,' DeSantis said. 'If you’re on that west coast of Florida, barrier islands, just assume you’ll be asked to leave.' The state is preparing for the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017, when 7 million people were told to evacuate. Milton also makes the first time there have been three hurricanes happening simultaneously in the Atlantic, though Hurricanes Leslie and Kirk are not currently expected to make landfall. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/florida-desantis-update-milton/	2024-10-07T06:24:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/GettyImages-2161724853.jpg?w=900
Dolly Parton, Walmart announce millions in donations to Helene vi...	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — Dolly Parton announced significant donations to flood relief at a Friday event in Newport, Tennessee. The music icon, speaking at a Walmart, said she was making a $1 million donation to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing immediate assistance to Hurricane Helene flood victims. Parton's Dollywood Foundation and her businesses in East Tennessee — Dollywood Parks &amp; Resorts, Dolly Parton’s Stampede and Pirates Voyage Dinner &amp; Show — matched her donation, bringing the total contributions to $2 million. 'We wish that we were all together for another reason, but we all have seen the devastation. I mean, who knew in our little part of the country here, where I was born, raised just right down the road, that we would have this kind of devastation?' Parton asked. How you can help after Helene 'And I look around and I think 'These are my mountains, these are my valleys. These are my people and this is my home.'' Eugene Naughton, the president of the Dollywood Company, spoke just before Parton, reflecting on the 2016 fires in Sevier County, and how they proved how resilient the community is. 'Just one week ago, thousands of lives again were impacted across East Tennessee, Western North Carolina and points beyond, and while in Sevier County we were spared the major damage, the lessons we learned from the Smoky Mountain wildfire, those of resilience, those of determination, and those of love for others, led us to reach out to our neighbors to determine how we could help following the recent flooding,' Naughton said. During the event, Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner announced the company, including Sam’s Club and the Walmart Foundation, would also be donating a total of $10 million to hurricane relief efforts across the affected states. Part of the money will be going to the East Tennessee Foundation. Furner said his family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, in 1979, and he had watched as Walmart expanded into Appalachia and East Tennessee. Close Thank you for signing up!

Not until the media leaves, but until we recover, and that's what's going to happen here, we're going to recover,' said Furner. Dollywood had already worked with its sponsorship partner Coca-Cola to donate a semi-truck full of water for distribution in Cocke County. Dollywood has also donated 60,000 reusable masks, 30,000 disposable protective garments and 2.5 million disposable masks to be used for cleanup efforts across East Tennessee. In conjunction with the donation centers established by the city of Pigeon Forge, Dollywood will become a donation drop-off location for those wishing to donate cleanup items and necessities. Dolly Parton announces donations to Helene relief at an event in Tennessee on Friday. (WATE) Wrapping up the event, Parton answered a few questions, including one asking what she would say to those who have lost everything. 'I know it's easy for us to say, 'Oh, things are going to get better' when things are still really bad. All we can say is that 'We are with you, we love you. We hope that things get better real soon and we're going to do our part to try to make that possible,'' she said. Fact-checking scam claims about Hurricane Helene Parton is well known for her philanthropy work throughout the region, especially in times of disaster. In 2021, Parton donated a portion of ticket sales from Dollywood and her many dinner shows to help those affected by flooding in Middle Tennessee. Parton was also involved with the Dollywood Foundation’s My People Fund, which gave $1,000 to Sevier County families whose homes were uninhabitable or destroyed by the 2016 Sevier County wildfires. In total, more than $9 million was raised during a star-studded telethon, allowing Parton to surprise the families being helped through the fund with a final $5,000 check. On Thursday, reports emerged that another country star from East Tennessee, Morgan Wallen, had reached out to Governor Bill Lee to offer assistance to victims of flooding. Earlier in the week, Red Cross officials confirmed that Wallen’s foundation had donated half a million dollars toward the relief efforts after Hurricane Helene.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/dolly-parton-helene/	2024-10-07T06:17:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-2024-10-04T145923.612-e1728072268435.jpg?w=800
US braces for protests 1 year after Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel	(NewsNation) — Cities throughout the United States are bracing for protests on the first anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. Monday marks one year since Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out an attack in which 1,200 people in Israel were killed and around 250 taken hostage. Some events began over the weekend and additional protests and rallies are expected Monday. Former Hamas hostage urges release of Israelis still held captive Oct. 7 commemorative events Several thousand people could attend a rally in Washington, D.C., that a Christian nonprofit organized in support of Israel. Leaders at Columbia University also issued a notice to students Monday, saying the campus could be the site of major gatherings for the anniversary. The university campus has been home to several pro-Palestinian protests over the past few months. School staff said extra security will be on hand Monday and students may notice more dividers and barricades. Some events began over the weekend, including thousands who marched through downtown Washington and gathered near the White House to show solidarity with Palestine. Crowds also gathered near Times Square in New York City, where some people waved Palestinian and Lebanese flags. Others protested against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The group If Not Now has called for an end to U.S. support for Israel and plans to host events in cities including Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago to honor lives lost during the war. Antisemitic incidents reach fever pitch Meanwhile, antisemitic incidents in the United States have reached an all-time, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The group recorded more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S., including bomb threats against synagogues, assaults against Jewish students on school campuses and online harassment. That’s the most incidents ever recorded in a single year since the ADL began tracking that data in 1979. This year’s numbers are three times higher compared to the same period last year. Abigail Edan’s aunt says ‘we need a deal’ on Oct. 7 anniversary Many of those incidents have involved verbal or written harassment, but some included vandalism and physical attacks, according to the ADL. 'The attacks by Hamas, by Hezbollah and the Houthis and the direct onslaught by the largest patron of antisemitic terrorism, Iran, have sparked a fire here in the U.S. and throughout the world,' the ADL wrote in a post commemorating the anniversary. 'While antisemitic incidents had already been on the rise, these attacks threw fuel onto the fire.' Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, threats to the status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed thousands, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/october-7-israel-hamas-anniversary-protests/	2024-10-07T04:51:59-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24160483884903.jpg?w=900
Israelis remember Oct. 7 attacks one year later	(NewsNation) — It's been one year since Hamas militants launched a surprise cross-border attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Israelis marked the somber occasion Monday and are still pressing for the release of the around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. As Israelis mourned the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel. Abigail Edan’s aunt says ‘we need a deal’ on Oct. 7 anniversary Now, tensions in the Middle East continue to brew as fighting between Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran wages on. The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants’ resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population. As fears of a wider regional war grow across the Middle East, about 20 Hezbollah rockets rained down on northern Israel overnight, injuring at least nine people. These attacks followed a bombardment on Hezbollah targets just outside Beirut in Lebanon.

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit) A moment of silence Thousands of mourners gathered Monday morning at the location of the Nova music festival where Hamas militants killed more than 360 people. Moments of silence, prayers and sunrise memorials around the world have honored those killed during the Hamas attacks. New film documents Oct. 7 attacks after first anniversary At Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community of about 400 people lived not far from the Israel-Gaza border. One year ago from Monday, about a quarter of the kibbutz's residents were killed or taken hostage. Today, the scars of those attacks are still evident. 'One year ago, there were 400 people here, and now, it's totally empty,' Dani Lifshitz, the grandson of two Israelis taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023, told NewsNation. He continued, 'We didn't move one day. This place, we feel we are on Oct. 7, 2023. A year didn't pass for us.' Since the attacks, Lifshitz grandmother was returned to Israel. However, his grandfather remains in Hamas' captivity. 'This was a heaven, and now this is hell,' Lifshitz said. Benjamin Netanyahu reflects on Oct. 7 anniversary Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel 'arose as a nation as lions' following the Oct. 7 attack a year ago. 'We remember our fallen, our hostages — whom we are committed to return — our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,' Netanyahu said at a memorial commemorating the anniversary of the attack. He visited the memorial in Jerusalem for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in the attack. He spoke alongside the mayor of Jerusalem as the two held a small tribute at an event that appeared closed to the public. Netanyahu has faced heavy criticism for security lapses that allowed the attack to unfold and mass protests over his failure to return remaining hostages.

Supreme Court taking the bench with ghost guns, a capital case an...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is taking the bench again on Monday, ready to hear cases on ghost guns, a death sentence and transgender rights. The docket doesn’t have quite as many blockbuster cases as it did last term, when its rulings included an opinion granting broad immunity to former President Donald Trump. Still, it’s possible that the conservative-majority court could yet be asked to intervene in election disputes after the ballots are cast in November. The justices also stayed relatively busy during their summer break. The orders they issued on emergency appeals included a refusal to restore President Joe Biden’s student loan plan and a partial approval of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship to vote. The new term also opens against the backdrop of low public trust in the Supreme Court, and continued debate about whether their newly adopted code of ethics should have an enforcement mechanism. Here’s a look at some of the cases coming up: Ghost gun regulations The justices will hear a case Tuesday on regulations for ghost guns, privately made weapons that are hard for police to track because they don't have a serial number. The number of the firearms found at crime scenes has soared in recent years, from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2021, according to Justice Department data. The numbers have been declining in multiple cities since the Biden administration began requiring background checks and age verification for ghost gun kits that can be bought online. But manufacturers and gun rights groups argue that the administration overstepped and the rule should be overturned. Doubts about a death sentence In the decades since Richard Glossip was sentenced to die over a 1997 murder-for-hire scheme, the case has become a rare one where prosecutors are conceding mistakes. Oklahoma’s Republican attorney general has joined with Glossip in seeking to overturn his murder conviction and death sentence. Despite those doubts, an Oklahoma appeals court has upheld Glossip’s conviction, and the state’s pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency. The court will hear arguments in his case on Wednesday. Transgender rights Perhaps the court's most closely watched case so far this year is a fight over transgender rights. The case over state bans on gender-affirming care comes as Republican-led states enact a variety of restrictions, including school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people, though Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students. The justices will weigh a Tennessee law that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. The case does not yet have a hearing date, but will likely be argued in December.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/supreme-court/ap-supreme-court-taking-the-bench-with-ghost-guns-a-capital-case-and-transgender-rights-on-the-docket/	2024-10-07T04:06:07-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6703c0c4b66fa3.06856219.jpeg?w=900
New analysis suggests national debt could increase under Harris, ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris' and Donald Trump's economic plans. The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. That's even though the vice president's campaign insists her proposed investments in the middle class and housing would be fully offset by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Her campaign policy guide states that Harris is 'committed to fiscal responsibility — making investments that will support our economy, while paying for them and reducing the deficit at the same time.' The same analysis says former President Trump's ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. That's even though he suggests growth would be so strong under his watch that no one would need to worry about deficits. The 34-page report released by the fiscal watchdog group puts a spotlight on the issue of government borrowing that will confront the winner of November's election. Total federal debt held by the public now tops $28 billion and is expected to keep climbing as revenues can't keep up with the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The analysis noted that the expense of servicing that debt in dollar terms has 'eclipsed the cost of defending our nation or providing health care to elderly Americans.' Drawing on the candidates' speeches, campaign documents and social media posts, the analysis warns bluntly: 'Debt would continue to grow faster than the economy under either candidates’ plans and in most scenarios would grow faster and higher than under current law.' Neither candidate has meaningfully stressed budget deficit reduction in their pitch to voters. But multiple analyses show a clear difference of Harris being much more fiscally responsible than Trump. Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the top economist in the Obama White House, estimated in an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal that Harris' plans could cut deficits by $1.5 trillion or raise them by $1.5 trillion. Meanwhile, his estimates show that Trump's plans would increase deficits by $5 trillion, though that figure does not include his plans to charge no taxes on overtime pay and scrap the limit on deductions of state and local taxes. There are other estimates by The Budget Lab at Yale and the Penn Wharton Budget Model that also show Harris would be better at keeping the deficit in check. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis estimates that Harris' policy ideas could add $3.5 trillion to the national debt through 2035. That conclusion depends on its treatment of how much various programs could cost. It forecasts that Harris would implement $4.6 trillion in tax reductions, including extensions of some of the expiring 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed into law and tax breaks for parents and no taxes on tipped income for hospitality workers. Roughly $4 trillion in higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy would be insufficient to cover the total cost of her agenda and the additional interest on the debt that it could generate. Still, the analysis notes that its numbers depend on various interpretations of what Harris has said. It's possible that Harris' agenda would add nothing to baseline deficits, but the report also said it might plausibly add as much as $8.1 trillion in debt in what appears to be a worse-case scenario. By contrast, Trump's ideas would likely add another $7.5 trillion to the debt. His $2.7 trillion in tariff revenues would be unable to cover $9.2 trillion in tax cuts and additional expenditures such as $350 billion to secure the border and deport unauthorized immigrants. But the analysis includes other possibilities that show far higher deficits under Trump. If his tariffs raised less money and there were higher costs for his mass deportations and tax breaks, the national debt could jump by $15.2 trillion. On the other hand, if the tariffs raised $4.3 trillion and there were no costs tied to deportations, Trump's plans could only increase the debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-new-analysis-suggests-national-debt-could-increase-under-harris-but-it-would-surge-under-trump/	2024-10-06T21:06:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67035f83d17090.55349456.jpeg?w=900
Abigail Edan's aunt says 'we need a deal' on Oct. 7 anniversary	(NewsNation) —The great aunt of Abigail Edan, a 4-year-old American girl who was held hostage in Gaza for several weeks at the start of the war, joins 'NewsNation Prime' on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks to call for peace. Liz Naftali said a cease-fire is necessary and nothing good will come of continued violence. 'I really just say to everybody, and I say this to the Palestinian people, and I say this to the Israelis, and for the world to understand there is no good that will keep coming from this fighting,' Naftali said. 'Diplomacy now is what we need. And we need a deal.' Israel-Hamas war will affect generations: Humanitarian worker She addressed the remaining hostages and their families directly, assuring 'there is love from so many places in this world, and so many people are fighting for their freedom.' She said those working to free hostages include President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump and other major political figures. 'I'm not a diplomat, I'm not a politician, but I've been doing this now for a year, and what I know is that until these people come home, and until the people in Gaza are able to receive the dignity and security they need this region and these families, families cannot move forward,' Naftali said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/oct-7-anniversary-abigail-edan-hostage-aunt/	2024-10-06T18:55:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/230632CA1ED7487C875D7EA79D27254D.jpg?w=603
New film documents Oct. 7 attacks after first anniversary	(NewsNation) — A French-Israeli filmmaker says the international response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, particularly pro-Palestinian demonstrations at American universities, compelled him to create a documentary about the conflict. Pierre Rehov, speaking from Ashdod, Israel, said he was disturbed by reactions that seemed to excuse the attack. 'I was expecting all cities in the world, all people, everybody in the streets of Washington and Paris with T-shirts saying 'I'm Israel,'' Rehov said Sunday on 'NewsNation Prime.' 'It was exactly the opposite.' Rehov said he began working on the documentary, titled 'Pogroms,' after United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made comments that Rehov felt inappropriately connected Hamas' actions to the Palestinian situation. Israel-Hamas war will affect generations: Humanitarian worker The filmmaker experienced the attack firsthand, awakening to air raid sirens at 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 7. He recalled receiving a warning from a friend to lock his doors and windows because 'Palestinians are invading Israel.' Rehov said he was unable to reach his wife, who was staying closer to the Gaza border, for two hours. The documentary aims to explain the political and historical background of the conflict, Rehov said. About 100 hostages remain in Hamas custody one year after the attack. What to know: The Israel-Hamas war Protests have been taking place across the world since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war which erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others.

Did migrants from Hamas cross into US after Oct. 7?	(NewsNation) — Just weeks after the deadly Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza, border patrol agents were warned of related actors attempting cross into the United States. According to a memo to U.S. border patrol agents obtained by NewsNation, potential foreign terrorist fighters engaged in the Israel-Hamas conflict and with potential ties to Hamas or Hezbollah could be entering the United States via the southern border. The document, circulated among CBP agents and shared by the San Diego Customs and Border Protection office, specifically mentions Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Hezbollah. At the time of the memo, federal agents on the border were already overwhelmed by record numbers of migrants crossing into the U.S. FEMA says no disaster relief money was spent on migrant aid Nearly one year later, more than 460 individuals on the terror 'watch list' have been apprehended by border patrol and field operations agents. In February, an Afghan migrant on the list was arrested after spending nearly a year in the U.S. During his time in the states, he was twice released back into the country. In June, eight Tajik nationals were arrested for potential ties to ISIS. At least three of these individuals on the terror watch list entered the country legally through the CBP One App — and were later released. In August, three Palestinian Nationals and one Turkish national entered the U.S. illegally and were found to have terrorist ties. Explainer: How immigrants end up on ICE’s non-detained docket On Friday, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a joint statement saying that Oct. 7, 2024, could serve as the backdrop for violent extremists in the U.S. and globally. The agencies also say the threat is not only from organized foreign terrorist groups, but from individuals. They say that online messaging highlighting the October 7 anniversary could inspire people to act alone, attacking with little or no warning. In a separate notice, the FBI said that 'it is essential to be watchful for threats against Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities and institutions and to immediately contact law enforcement to report any suspicious activity.'

Israel-Hamas war will affect generations: Humanitarian worker	(NewsNation) — Palestinians in Gaza are facing severe shortages of basic necessities and 'nightmarish' conditions as Israel's military campaign enters its twelfth month, a humanitarian worker said Sunday on NewsNation's 'Morning in America.' 'We've reached the point where we need everything,' said Bushra Khalidi, humanitarian policy lead at Oxfam, speaking from the West Bank. She described a dire situation where Gaza residents lack access to clean water, medical supplies and adequate nutrition. According to Khalidi, Gazans have access to only 4.74 liters of water per day, three times less than the minimum requirement. The conflict has also created approximately 25,000 child amputees, who now struggle to evacuate during ongoing military operations. 'People that have amputations now because of the war and those traumatic injuries, they can't flee, they can't go anywhere. They're just waiting for their fate,' Khalidi said. Israel intensifies bombardment of Gaza and southern Lebanon ahead of Oct. 7 anniversary Restrictions on aid deliveries have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Khalidi said that aid workers in Gaza haven't had access to fresh fruits, vegetables, or meat for weeks or months. Medical facilities are running short on essential supplies, including gauze and anesthetics needed for surgeries. The conflict has also disrupted education, with children out of school for the entire year. Khalidi warned of long-term traumatic impacts that will affect 'generations of children.' Palestinian health authorities estimate the death toll in Gaza has reached 41,800, with 90,000 wounded since Israel's offensive began following Hamas's October 7th attack. The exact numbers remain difficult to verify due to widespread destruction and limited access to aid organizations. Khalidi, who said her own home in Jerusalem's Old City was forcibly entered by settlers in June, called for an immediate cease-fire to allow humanitarian organizations to conduct proper needs assessments and begin addressing the crisis. 'It's going to take only years just to remove the rubble out of Gaza,' she said. 'So imagine rehabilitating an entire civilian population.'

Couple reunited after volunteer rescue pilot threatened with arre...	LAKE LURE, N.C. (WJZY) — For a split second, it sounded like thunder. Mike and Susan Coffey were sitting in silence, trying to figure out what was happening outside their Lake Lure home as the winds and rain from Hurricane Helene hammered the North Carolina mountains. The Coffeys and their cat were the only two living beings inside their mountainside home that sits along the Broad River. In the next split-second, they both knew the sounds below them weren't coming from the heavens. They didn't know it then, but they were hearing millions of gallons of flood waters, raining down hell along the river's path through Lake Lure. 'We started to hear a lot of noise,' Susan said, recounting the moment to Nexstar's WJZY. 'Rumbling. Rumbling – wasn't thunder. What's this weird rumbling?' SC pilot flying volunteer supply and rescue missions ordered out of Lake Lure under arrest threat 'Trees, falling rocks… so it got a little bit frightening at that point,' Mike said. 'We said we'd better get to higher ground, just in case. So, we grabbed the cat, a couple bottles of water, a bag of chips; like we were really thinking. And got in our cars and drove up the driveway, which was probably 30 feet higher and parked in the cul-de-sac and parked our cars against the mountainside.' From some 80 feet above the river, the Coffeys watched the earth that held their mountainside home disappear as everything they had washed away with the raging flood waters below. The Seidhoms photographed this cliff where the Coffey home once stood in the town of Lake Lure. This is the area where Jordan and Landon Seidhom landed their helicopter on Sept. 29, 2024, after spotting Susan Coffey waving for help near the cliff's edge. (Credit: Jordan and Landon Seidhom) 'We watched our house go,' Mike told WJZY's Chief Investigator Jody Barr in an interview on Oct. 3. 'The cliff just dropped that whole side of the road, the cliff just dropped off. All of the trees and dirt and everything else just started collapsing. We saw the house next to us where its back deck went over and it was hanging for a while. About 2 hours later, that house went.' 'Another house down the street from us, so we just kind of watched that whole area slide down and into the river.' The Coffeys thought they — and the strip of asphalt left beneath their cars — might go next. They could see the flood waters chipping away at the mountainside. Within a few yards of eroding the rest of the road and the cul-de-sac out from under them, it all just stopped. The couple spent Thursday night in their car. There was no need to ask how much they slept that night since one could imagine it likely wasn't much. This is the cliff where the Coffey home once stood. It's also the spot where volunteer pilot Jordan Seidhom landed his helicopter on Sept. 29, 2024, and rescued Susan Coffey before he was forced out of Lake Lure by threat of arrest from Lake Lure Asst. Fire Chief Chris Melton. (Credit: Jordan Seidhom) Once the storm passed, the Friday morning sun revealed a new world. Very little of the life they built on that mountainside was there. The couple knew they were in trouble. The food and water they had inside the house were somewhere downriver. 'Luckily, the house next door was under construction so they had left some equipment and there was a pickup truck that was parked there. I saw a cooler in the back in the cab and so I opened it up, and there was water and a thing of cranberry juice and some Mountain Dew that he wouldn’t drink,' Susan Coffey joked as she turned to her husband during Thursday's video call. 'There was some beer like, well, that would be dehydrating. I don't want that, but if we're desperate, well, we'll take it. So, it just gave us a lifeline for another day that we knew we had some water to have so that was just such a blessing. It was a relief to find that.' But it didn't last. 'Friday night, we had no water,' Susan said. 'We had potato chips, which were also dehydrating and that was a great pick. But by the next morning, we were starting to get worried again about what we would have to be able to drink.' This aerial photograph taken on Oct. 3, 2024, by volunteer helicopter pilot Jordan Seidhom shows the cul-de-sac where Susan and Mike Coffey sat in their vehicle after the home was washed away in Hurricane Helene's flood waters. The black SUV is still parked there, days after the storm, and the road leading up to the cul-de-sac no longer exists. Friday night was another night spent in their car. Luckily, Susan said, they had filled their car with gas and could charge their phones. The problem was that cell service in the storm's path was impossible to reach. 'We did find some cell service, and called a friend to let them know so they could call emergency services and let them know our location,' Susan recalled. 'We started to see helicopters go over. So, every time we heard a copter, we'd just run out and start waving. There was a big pile of rocks at the house next door. So, we did a big S.O.S. sign in the cul-de-sac with the rocks and just [tried] at the moment to stay positive and not worry too much.' The pair had a bit of hope on Saturday when they said two Lake Lure Fire Department personnel hiked in from across the mountain to tell the Coffeys they'd be rescued by a helicopter. A chopper — the couple said it appeared to be the National Guard — came back later that day, but couldn't get to them. 'It was too big, and it just had no place, safe place to land. So, then they said they'd have to airlift us out and we just didn't know when that would be,' Susan said. 'So they gave us some hope there, right? So we thought we were going to get out Saturday and then, you know, just kept watching helicopters fly overhead a lot,' Mike told WJZY. 'Every time we heard a 'copter, we would run out there: 'Is this it? Is this it?' No, go back to the car,' Susan said. 'So, yeah, we were ... we were alert, just always – the adrenaline is just so high, you're just so on alert. We were told you don't miss it, you don't want to miss it. But then when it started to get dark, and we realized they were not going to do helicopter rescues in the dark. So, we had another night there.' Emergency crew looked 'very, very annoyed' 'I don't think we ever ran out of hope. We had each other, and that was the main thing,' Mike Coffey said when asked if they started to believe help wouldn't come by the third day after multiple helicopters had flown over without stopping. 'Sometimes you get a little scared and then you just stay in the moment and not worry too much. And we knew that people knew where we were, so worst case, we were going to swim ourselves, try and cross the river ourselves,' Susan said. 'We knew we could survive so long without food or water, we'll be okay. Like I said, we had the Mountain Dew as backup,' she joked. Not long after the sun rose Sunday morning, they heard the sweet sound of chopper blades ripping through the air. This is the small, black helicopter Susan and Mike Coffey waved down on Sunday, Sept. 29, 2024, after spending nearly three days on an eroded mountainside in Lake Lure, N.C. after floodwaters from Hurricane Helene washed their home into the river 50 feet below. (Credit: Jordan Seidhom) 'And then we saw this small black helicopter fly and we were waving at it and it stopped,' Susan said, 'It circled over us. And so, I thought, oh, maybe the National Guard sent a smaller helicopter to get us because they knew their big ones were just weren't good for that area.' But, it wasn't a government worker coming to their aid, it was Jordan Seidhom, the owner of a scrap steel recycling business in Pageland, South Carolina. He's also a pilot, former head of the Chesterfield County drug unit, reserve law enforcement officer, and volunteer firefighter — among other jobs. He decided the day after the storm to use his own helicopter on his own dime to answer the cries for help he read on social media within hours of the storm passing. Susan and Mike Coffey were stranded on a mountainside near Lake Lure, N.C. after flood waters washed their homes away on Sept. 27, 2024. The couple was stranded for days without food and water until volunteer helicopter pilot Jordan Seidhom spotted them waving for help and turned around to rescue them. (Credit: Jordan and Landon Seidhom) Seidhom and his 1,400 flight hours decided to load his son, a junior in high school and a volunteer fireman in Pageland, into their chopper to fly into the disaster zone to deliver food and water. Along the way on Saturday, they happened to pluck four people off a mountainside. Seidhom, a veteran pilot, said there were no flight restrictions anywhere near Lake Lure when he decided to fly there on Saturday and Sunday. The Federal Aviation Administration issues flight restrictions and post those to digital flight-mapping software accessible to pilots all across the country. Then on Sunday, the Seidhoms spotted Susan Coffey frantically waving for help. 'So when this helicopter actually landed just at the very end of the driveway where it had fallen off, they're able to land it at the very end of the driveway, a little bit on the road, we were just amazed,' Susan said, initially thinking it would be another failed mission to save them. Seidhom landed his helicopter near the edge of the cliff and hopped out to speak with the Coffeys. Because he didn't want to place too much weight on the unstable ground, Seidhom said he told the Coffeys he'd take them one by one to a nearby command post he spotted about three minutes away. The sun highlighted Susan Coffey's red covering as she rode alongside volunteer rescue pilot, Jordan Seidhom, as he flew her to rescue crews on Sunday, Sept. 29, 2024. Minutes later, Seidhom said he was threatened with arrest if he didn't leave the area. (Source: Jordan and Landon Seidhom) Seidhom loaded Susan into the helicopter and asked his son to stay with Mike as he delivered the couple to safety. Seidhom lifted off and flew Mrs. Coffey to the Lake Lure Fire Department post just downriver. 'He found a safe place to land, on a street that was in front of a bunch of some firemen, policemen, and some National Guardsmen. So we land, and I get out of the helicopter, and I go towards them,' Susan said, 'And they're just standing there looking very mad and very annoyed. And said, 'Who are you?' And I didn't realize [Seidhom] had just taken it upon himself, followed his heart to come help rescue people. And communication is so down, it's hard to know who to let know that he has this free airspace, that he can go do this.' Seidhom was explaining who he was to the first responders, and said he was first greeted by two leaders of a fire department out of Michigan. Those men, Seidhom said, were welcoming and gave him radio frequencies to communicate with them and began setting up a landing zone so he could continue delivering people to the post. But, Seidhom told WJZY that Lake Lure Fire and Emergency Management Asst. Chief Chris Melton jumped into the mix, ordering him out of the area and threatened to have him arrested if he didn't go. Mike Coffey comforts his wife, Susan, as the pair describe finding one another hours after she was rescued by a volunteer chopper pilot, but her husband was left stranded after Lake Lure Fire Asst. Chief Chris Melton ordered the pilot to leave under threat of arrest on Sept. 29, 2024. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) Susan Coffey witnessed some of the exchange: '[Seidhom] was telling them who he was and what he was doing, and they just were not happy. They weren't happy about it. And [Melton] said, this is our mission, this is our operation, we can't just have you flying in and out. Jordan was telling them, 'Well, I can't just leave her husband, I don't want to separate a family. So, if you just let me go back and get her husband and then I'll bring him here, then I'll take my son. Then we'll go,'' she recalled. 'I thought, that's reasonable, it saves the National Guard a trip,' Susan said. 'You know, one less person they have to save.' She didn't hear and didn't know that Melton had threatened Seidhom with arrest if he didn't leave. 'I'm going back and get my copilot,' Seidhom recalled telling Melton, 'He said, 'If you turn around and go back up the mountain, you're going to be arrested.' I said, 'Well, sir, I'm going to get my copilot. I don't know what to tell you.' And he said, 'I'm letting you know,'' Seidhom said. Volunteer helicopter pilot Jordan Seidhom regrets he didn't force Lake Lure Asst. Fire Chief Chris Melton to arrest him in the middle of his volunteer rescue mission of Mike and Susan Coffey on Sept. 29, 2024. Seidhom said if he had not had his son with him, he would have carried out saving the Coffeys and suffered whatever consequence Melton imposed on him. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) 'At that point, he waved for two law enforcement officers to come over and told me that, again, if I go back up the mountain, I will be arrested,' Seidhom said, 'There was a conversation before I left again, just trying to de-escalate the situation and speak with him and say, 'Hey, you know, I'm right here. I've already brought one person down and I'm willing to help. Can I please go back and get this other victim?' And his response was just, 'you need to leave the area.'' 'And he just would not allow me to do it,' Seidhom recalled. 'As I was actually leaving to go back to get my son, the original chief or captain (Michigan crew) that I spoke to his crew and himself, they came back over and said, 'Hey, man, we can't tell you to go get the victim. We can't even ask you to go get the victim, but we can tell you if you come back with the victim, we'll have you a designated landing spot and we'll make sure they don't come over here.'' Believing Melton was intent on having him hauled off to jail, Seidhom decided to get his son out of there and regroup another day. When Seidhom lifted off from the command post, he went back to the mountainside to get his son and informed Mr. Coffey he would not be able to save him. Jordan Seidhom said as soon as he left Lake Lure, N.C. on Sept. 29, 2024, he started researching to find out who Asst. Chief Chris Melton was. Seidhom said he found Melton's contact page on the town's website and confirmed Melton's identity from a photograph posted there and on social media. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) 'When I got to the door, he said, 'I am so sorry, but I'm told if I bring you back that I'm going to be arrested and I can't take you back with me. And in fact, I was told I couldn't come get my co-pilot, my son, and I just told him I'm not going to leave my son here,'' Mike Coffey recalled of the conversation with the pilot from Pageland. 'He said, 'I am so sorry. I don't know what to tell you, but I need to take my son and we're going to leave.' ''They've told me they're aware of where you are and you will be rescued,' and he took off,' Coffey recounted. 'He takes off, I had no idea where my wife was. I couldn't comprehend what was going on. Like, how did this make sense?' Mr. Coffey told WJZY. 'And when, if ever, I was going to be reunited with her, how long it would take for some other rescue crew to get back to me. So that was the most stressful part of the whole experience. I can watch my house go. I can watch our neighbors’ houses go. 'We were together, right? And we knew each other was safe. And when he left, that, that thought right just kind of disappeared, like okay, I don't know what's going to happen from here.' Mike decided to act. He took their cat carrier and his computer bag down the side of the cliff and spotted a rescue crew across the river. 'I was waving them down and I was able to get down the banks to our side of the river where I could at least yell and communicate across the river, saying, 'Do you have my wife? Do you know where my wife is?' And they were giving me the thumbs up,' Mike said. Instead of the three-minute chopper ride to safety, Mike Coffey was now faced with having to cross the raging river, full of storm debris, mud, and who knows what else. It was a rescue effort that would take the next hour of his life. This still frame taken from a video Jordan Seidhom recorded on Oct. 3, 2024, shows the exact spot in the river where Mike Coffey was roped to safety on Sept. 29, 2024. Coffey said the river was flowing heavily and littered with storm debris on Sunday when he was rescued. (Credit: Jordan Seidhom) 'This was a crew out of Michigan, and they were great. There were, I think, three of them and a guy from Chimney Rock who swam, one of them swam across the river with a rope. And the very first thing he said to me was, 'Are you okay? Are you Mike Coffey? We've got your wife, so she's safe.'' Coffey said one of the rescuers took his cat carrier and another got his computer bag and through a series of ropes, the group crossed the river. 'Those guys also, they came down from Michigan. They don't know us from anybody. They were willing to put their lives on the line. They're also heroes in that story,' Coffey said. Once across, Coffey was loaded into a shuttle bus and taken to a nearby shelter. It would take a few hours before the Coffeys found one another again. Susan Coffey was still waiting at the command post, watching shuttle buses pass. One eventually stopped. 'When the bus came back to get me and then I see the doors open and Mike's head sticks out, oh, my God. I was so relieved that he was picked up and that we were back together,' Susan said, 'It's one of those things; we met in the parking lot. We're hugging and crying, just so relieved to have found each other again.' Seidhom still regrets not finishing the job on that mountainside that day. 'I'm sorry, if I had to do it over again, I would have stopped and I would have rescued as many people until they decided they were going to arrest me,' Seidhom told WJZY the day after the threat. Jordan Seidhom holds his phone out as he plays a voicemail from a family member pleading for help to rescue her parents stranded on a mountaintop somewhere in the disaster zone in the North Carolina mountains. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) 'He got my wife and at his own cost, at a risk to himself,' Mike Coffey told WJZY. 'He was the one person who actually stopped to help just because he could. I mean, he got in his helicopter and flew up there just because he knew he could make a difference to someone, and he did. He’s a hero.' 'I'm sure everyone's stressed in that scenario, but he was following his heart and doing the right thing,' Mike said. 'And maybe there were rules that somebody would like to impose order on the chaos, but the bottom line is getting those people out of there. And even if I had never been rescued, knowing that she was safe because he did what he did would have been enough. So, thank you, Jordan. Thank you.' Melton won't speak with WJZY, but makes appearance WJZY spent nearly four days waiting for Assistant Fire Chief Melton to respond to multiple attempts to request an interview with him, hoping to hear his side and his reasons for ordering Seidhom out of Lake Lure — and whether he would have carried out his threat to have the volunteer pilot arrested in the middle of an active rescue mission. Lake Lure Asst. Fire Chief Chris Melton did not respond to any messages sent to him by WJZY's Chief Investigator Jody Barr in the days leading up to our reporting. Although he wasn't available, this still image from a video interview between Barr and Lake Lure Town Manager Olivia Stewman shows a man who appears to be Melton opening Stewman's door during the interview and an unidentified woman off camera waving him out. (WJZY Photo/Jody Barr) But Melton never responded, even after the town's media contact, Laura Krejci, responded to a Facebook message confirming Melton received WJZY's request to speak with him a few days earlier. Still, knowing Melton was likely actively involved in the efforts there and knowing communication lines were potentially unavailable, WJZY did not publish Melton's identity. By Thursday, WJZY was ready to publish this follow-up report and informed the town a final request to speak with Melton before publishing had been made. Krejci responded, telling WJZY she would make Lake Lure Town Manager Olivia Stewman available for an interview. On Thursday, just past 2:30 p.m., Stewman and Barr met via video conference for an interview. Chris Melton has still not responded to any of WJZY's messages. Although he was not available to interview, a man who appeared to be Melton opened the door to the room where Stewman was participating in the interview. An unidentified person off camera frantically waved to the man to leave. The man's face is visible in the background of the video conference video recording. Here's a partial transcript of the interview of the exchange between WJZY's Barr and Lake Lure's Stewman: BARR: 'What happened in that incident?' STEWMAN: 'The personal aircraft that landed was not only unauthorized but also, they provided no notification that they were coming. And that did pose a potential risk to ongoing operations with search and rescue. And then, you know, also just wasn't safe for them to be there as regular citizens, especially since we didn't know who they were or what they were doing there. We had multiple national, local and state resources. That includes the National Guard, NCHART (North Carolina Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team), SCHART, we had the Coast Guard, state troopers, and then there may have been more, as well. So, they were completing their operations. And you know, in order to do that there, they were not authorizing private aircraft at that time. Any aircraft that would have – that should have gone through there should have gone through incident command as well. I just wanted to note that.' BARR: 'The FAA website shows that there was no flight restriction in the area at that time. Do you agree with that?' STEWMAN: 'I'm not sure of that. I'm sorry. But it was FAA’s ultimate call to not allow that – not to allow private aircraft into that area.' BARR: 'In the days after the storm, through that Sunday morning, there was no restricted airspace in Lake Lure. The FAA did impose a temporary flight restriction after this encounter between Mr. Seidhom and the assistant fire chief, Melton. You all still contend today that no one should have been in that area trying to save these people who had been stranded for two days, headed into day two, next to day three?' NOTE: Within 30 minutes of Jordan Seidhom, the FAA issued a Temporary Flight Restriction for the area near Lake Lure. The FAA confirmed in an Oct. 3, 2024, email to Barr that no TFR was issued anywhere in the NC disaster zone before. STEWMAN: 'Correct. If anything, they should have at least notified Incident Command who would have authorized them or not authorized them to be in that area.' BARR: 'Do you know whether Mr. Seidhom spoke with the people in charge at the Rutherford Airport? The airport did not have power at the time, but the airport told Mr. Seidhom if he was going to conduct volunteer search and rescue operations, those were the only aircraft they were fueling and they sold Mr. Seidhom fuel to go in and sold him fuel to come back under that condition?' STEWMAN: 'I’m unaware of that.' BARR: 'Unaware of that?' STEWMAN: 'Yep.' BARR: 'Would that not be an effort to coordinate and communicate?' STEWMAN: 'If that was coordinated, then it was not relayed to us. I will say that.' BARR: 'Was there a way to relay that to you all with the communications in the shape they were in at that time?' STEWMAN: 'Communications have been tough. I know you're aware of that. Rutherford County EM (Emergency Management) has been communicating with us as best they can through radios at that time, we were still struggling more with the service, but they were communicating with radio. So, you know, we didn't get anything over the radio that I'm aware of that indicated that.' BARR: 'If someone were to fly into an airport, communicate with the people in charge, was sold fuel under the condition that he was there to do volunteer a search and rescue, and then he proceeded to land where he saw what he believed to be a command center and talk to people in charge there, would that not yet be another attempt to coordinate and communicate with the with the rescue efforts on the ground to let them know why he's there and what he was doing?' STEWMAN: 'Again, that should have gone through the chain of command at incident command.' BARR: 'Was that published anywhere? If someone were looking for incident command, where would they have found that information?' STEWMAN: 'I’m unaware of that.' BARR: 'Do you think that your people on the ground in Lake Lure did what they should have done when they handled this flooding victim that was delivered to them in the encounter between Assistant Chief Melton and this private pilot?' STEWMAN: 'Yes, sir. They were doing what they were supposed to do at that time. And, you know, I can't speak highly enough of Mr. Melton and all of our emergency personnel that's here right now. They've been out here for days on end, putting their lives on the line to save people. And, you know, they were doing their job.' BARR: 'Less than 24 hours later, private pilots were being asked to return to that area to do what Mr. Seidhom was doing at that time. Do you see how the public may look at that and go, well, that's a little perplexing? Just before he was severely endangering rescue efforts and then, you know, less than a day later, they're being begged to come back and help?' STEWMAN: 'Well, I can only imagine that they went through the correct chain of command to be authorized to come here.' BARR: 'What was the danger posed in what Mr. Seidhom did, the specific danger that day?' STEWMAN: 'Well, it interrupted operations of the people who were there from national, state, and local resources, one. And two, downtown Chimney Rock is in disarray right now. For someone who's not trained, not adequately, adequately trained in emergency operations, you know, especially at that time, they should not have been in that location.' BARR: 'Well, just some hours later, he was back in the area and the county welcomed him in to do exactly what he did just the day before. Do you think his training was significantly improved overnight?' STEWMAN: 'I think that it's not that we're turning away help or volunteerism at all. Once again, we just need to go through the right steps to do that. So we're aware, the state is aware, the county is aware, and the Town of Lake Lure, and the Village of Chimney Rock is aware of what's going on. That was not the case initially.' [ZOOM QUALITY BREAKS UP] BARR: 'Lake Lure’s position here is that because Mr. Seidhom did not go through whatever unpublished channel he was supposed to go through, that he should have maybe guessed the right way to do this, even though that right way to do this was nowhere to be found at that time?' STEWMAN: 'Again, we were listening to the FAA's direction, and at that time, that is what we were told, that there was no personnel or aircraft unless they went through the correct steps. And we are not aware that this individual did that.' BARR: 'Does the town understand that the way the FAA communicates with pilots is through restricting airspace and publishing that on the FAA website?' STEWMAN: 'I'm not sure, sir.' BARR: 'And there was no TFR until the encounter between your assistant fire chief and Mr. Seidhom.' STEWMAN: 'Okay.' BARR: 'The final question I have, the town of Lake Lure has no regrets about how Mr. or Mrs. Coffey were treated that day when a pilot showed up to help save their lives on the side of that mountain in Lake Lure?' STEWMAN: 'No, I want to reiterate again that our personnel, our public safety personnel, were doing what they were instructed to do at that time. They were doing their jobs, trying to save lives and they have been out there doing that since – I mean, they're doing that all the time. But, you know, out in this condition is worse than usual. And they're continuing to do that. We support them fully and we're going to continue to support them.' STEWMAN: 'We really just need some support, compassion, understanding and patience. That's really what we need from people right now, especially in this tough situation. You know, this is making it worse and, you know, we're just asking that people have some compassion and consideration.' BARR: 'Are you all welcoming those private helicopter pilots who have delivered food and water and medical supplies and are helping rescue human lives from the mountains around Lake Lure? You guys welcoming them now?' STEWMAN: 'That would need to go through the Rutherford County Emergency Management or the state Emergency Management.' BARR: 'I'm asking you as an official, the leader of Lake Lure, North Carolina, are you now welcoming those private helicopters in your community?' STEWMAN: 'Yes. If they go through the necessary channels.' Despite rumors published to social media channels on Friday, Asst. Chief Chris Melton was not terminated by the Town of Lake Lure. In a follow-up text after the interview, Barr asked whether the rumors were true and Stewman replied that Melton is still employed with the town.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/north-carolina-volunteer-rescue-pilot-helene/	2024-10-06T14:15:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/COFFEY-IN-CHOPPER-TIGHT-e1728221868441.jpg?w=800
Denver's marijuana industry records first recession since legaliz...	(NewsNation) — For the first time in Colorado's 11 years of recreational marijuana legalization, Denver's marijuana sales and revenue are consistently dropping. City data shows the descent began in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the first drop recorded in 2021. Compared to 2020's all-time high medical and retail sales of $715 million, the first seven months of 2024 have raked in a measly $180 million. Is the stock market in an AI bubble? Revenue goes hand in hand with these numbers. Since 2021's peak revenue of $72.9 million, profit has been consistently harder to come by. 2022 raked in $56.2 million, while 2023 recorded only $48.5 million. Shannon Donnelly, an adjunct professor of cannabis at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, told NewsNation local affiliate KDVR that Denver's dispensaries must now accommodate in-state purchases rather than traveler traffic. 'It’s no longer you can just make a dispensary and become rich,' Donnelley said. 'You have to have something that differentiates yourself.' Another Denver Department of Excise and Licenses spokesperson told KDVR that, since the pandemic, Colorado consumers might be budgeting more — and marijuana is no longer making the cut. IRS to crack down on winning gamblers Eric Escudero, spokesperson for the Denver Department of Excise and Licenses, echoed Donnelley's statement about supply and demand in an interview with Scripps News. 'Because legalization has spread across the United States, less people are coming to Denver to consume and purchase marijuana,' said Escudero. '[Businesses are] going to have to adapt.' According to DISA Global Solutions, which helps businesses with drug testing needs, marijuana is legal on some level in a vast majority of the states, with 25 boasting a 'fully legal' status.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/denver-marijuana-recession/	2024-10-06T13:52:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/66328749eee987.65967460.jpeg?w=900

Former Hamas hostage urges release of Israelis still held captive	(NewsNation) — Former Hamas hostage Aviva Siegel has urged all remaining Israeli hostages to be released on the eve of the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks. Siegel was released from captivity but her husband Keith remains in captivity. According to The New York Times, three other Israeli-Americans are still being held by Hamas. There are still 101 Israelis in captivity. Siegel was among them before being released in November. 'It's very, very difficult for all of us,' Siegel said of the anniversary. 'We really just can't believe that a year's passed and Keith and the hostages are still thrown on a faulty, dirty mattress underneath the ground and can hardly breathe.' A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Lebanon Siegel was released during the brief ceasefire in November, but peace seems a distant reality seven months on. 'I just can't believe it that Keith and the other hostages are still in Gaza, thrown underneath the ground with no human rights,' she added. On Friday, the FBI and DHS warned of the threat of violence on Oct. 7 in a statement. An Israeli airstrike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip killed at least 19 people on Sunday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/former-hamas-hostage-urges-release-israelis-captive/	2024-10-06T09:37:46-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e01dcf724fd8.06263600.jpeg?w=900
Tropical Storm Milton expected to become hurricane on Sunday: NHC	TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Tropical Storm Milton is expected to become a hurricane on Sunday, and a major hurricane by midweek, according to the National Hurricane Center. In an 11 a.m. update, the NHC said their NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft 'finds a stronger Milton.' It has current maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and is moving east at 5 mph. Tampa prepares for more severe weather this weekend The storm is located roughly 835 miles west-southwest of Tampa. Milton is forecasted to reach Category 3 major hurricane strength with 115 mph winds as it heads toward Florida’s Gulf Coast. The storm is expected to weaken to a Category 2 before making landfall midweek. WFLA The risk for life-threatening impacts continues to increase for parts of Florida's west coast, as the storm-force winds are extending outward up to 35 miles from the center. Hurricane and storm surge watches for Florida are likely to be made later on Sunday, the NHC said. A tropical storm watch is currently in effect for Mexico's Celestun to Cancun. WFLA’s Chief Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli said heavy downpours will begin Sunday as the first wave of moisture reaches Florida’s coast. TIMELINE: When a tropical threat could impact the Tampa Bay area 'Given that the ground is saturated after one of the rainiest wet seasons on record, any downpours will lead to flooding,' Berardelli said. WFLA Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be seen just where Milton will strike, it's clear that Florida is going to be hit hard. 'You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,' the governor said. 'Know your evacuation zone — there will be mandatory and voluntary evacuations.' Florida officials tell residents to 'get a plan' ahead of Milton 'I highly encourage you to evacuate' if you're in an evacuation zone, said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. 'We are preparing ... for the largest evacuation that we have seen, most likely since 2017, Hurricane Irma.' DeSantis said as many as 4,000 National Guard troops are helping the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the Florida Department of Transportation to remove debris ahead of the next storm, and he declared a state of emergency in 35 counties. He said Floridians should prepare for more power outages and disruption. 'All available state assets ... are being marshaled to help remove debris,' DeSantis said. 'We're going 24-7 ... it's all hands on deck.' FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said her agency is preparing for Milton and working with Florida 'to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall.' Hurricane Kirk and Hurricane Leslie The Atlantic hurricane season has become more active as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast continue to search for people unaccounted for in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which left a huge trail of death and catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains. Out in the Eastern Atlantic, Hurricanes Kirk and Leslie continue to strengthen, heading north in the open waters. Kirk continues to accelerate northeastward, bringing life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. While Leslie is slightly stronger Sunday morning, the hurricane is expected to gradually weaken over the next few days.

Harris, Walz to do several high-profile interviews this week	(NewsNation) — Often criticized for avoiding journalists since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris will be on TV, radio and online this week as she sits down for several high-profile interviews. The multi-media blitz begins Sunday with the release of Harris’ conversation with Alex Cooper on her podcast 'Call Her Daddy.' The Harris campaign said the show boasts a following of more than 2.4 million on Instagram and more than 3.9 million on TikTok. A senior Harris campaign official tells NewsNation that the conversation focuses on reproductive freedom, abortion access and other issues critical to women. Hillary Clinton: Misinformation targeting Harris will ramp up Harris will appear Monday night on '60 Minutes.' The interview with CBS Correspondent Bill Whitaker was conducted on Saturday. Harris will have a very busy Tuesday in New York, as she will be on ABC’s 'The View,' Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show and 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.' She then heads west for appearances in Las Vegas, including a Thursday town hall produced by Univision. Harris concludes the week with a visit to Arizona, where early voting is already underway. 5 takeaways from Harris’s MSNBC interview with Stephanie Ruhle Vice presidential nominee Tim Walz will also face the cameras, starting with a Sunday appearance on 'Fox News Sunday' – his first Sunday interview show appearance since becoming Harris’ running mate. He then makes his late-night talk show debut Monday in Los Angeles on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live.' Walz also sat for a '60 Minutes' interview, which will air on Monday. Walz is scheduled to conduct interviews with local reporters during stops in Nevada and Arizona on Tuesday and Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-walz-high-profile-interviews/	2024-10-06T08:34:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66c8ce8b7b2bf6.61731068.jpeg?w=900
The Plot to Kill Trump: Back to Butler	Watch Part 1 of the special report: The Plot to Kill Trump: What we know and what comes next (NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, three months after surviving an assassination attempt. 'Exactly 12 weeks ago, this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me,' Trump told the crowd at the Butler fairgrounds, where he was joined for the first time at a rally by Elon Musk. Security was noticeably heightened for Trump's return visit, with snipers positioned around the perimeter and increased local, state and federal law enforcement presence. A Senate investigation has revealed significant security failures leading up to the attempt. The Secret Service, which recently saw its director step down, acknowledged it failed to properly secure the perimeter and couldn't even determine who was in charge of various security assignments. This special report, 'The Plot to Kill Trump: Back to Butler,' explores the investigation, law enforcement failures and what went wrong. You can watch the full report in the player above. Trump Florida assassination attempt suspect: What we know Trump returns to Butler, Penn., with Musk in tow Musk joined Trump at his rally Saturday in Butler, the Pennsylvania city where the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt earlier this year. He took the stage on Saturday to praise the GOP presidential nominee and slam Democrats he claimed 'want to take away your right to vote, effectively.' 'The true test of someone’s character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who couldn’t climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot,' Musk said, swiping at President Biden. Before Trump’s entrance, his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, referred to the attempted assassination, joining in on the Democratic blame game. 'Even after that terrible assassination attempt that took one man’s life and nearly took many others, they continue to use dangerous, inflammatory rhetoric,' Vance said. 'The media has continued to call Donald Trump, the guy who actually won his primary, a threat to Democracy.' Trump began his rally with a moment of silence for the firefighter who was killed during the attack. Speaking at the same location, Trump said time stopped on July 13 and called the shooter an 'evil villain.' FBI investigating 'assassination' attempt on Trump Supporters: Butler rally was 'exciting,' not 'scary' Rallygoers Heather Hertig and Shelly Nadler attended both former President Donald Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania, rallies. Rather than be scared upon return to the small city where shots rang out, the pair told NewsNation's Brian Entin that Saturday's event felt like 'camaraderie.' 'You feel like a part of it. Now, instead of just coming to see Trump talk, it's more of an emotional, like you're a part of things ... It's not just an election. It's about togetherness,' Hertig told NewsNation. 'I felt like I needed to have some closure, because it was just so surreal when we were here the last time, and it was so traumatic,' Nadler added. Trump shooting: What was Thomas Matthew Crooks' motive? Why don't we know more about Thomas Crooks? Twelve weeks after the first attempt on Trump's life at a Pennsylvania rally, little is known about his shooter's motive and background. Local authorities spotted the accused shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, multiple times before he opened fire, including with a range finder at 5:38 p.m. Despite alerts to command, effective action wasn't taken before Crooks fired from the roof of a nearby building at 6:12 p.m. 'This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service,' said Ronald Rowe, the agency's acting director. 'It's important that we hold ourselves accountable.' Three months after the shooting, investigators have released little information about Crooks or his motives. While they know he planned the attack through internet searches and practice at a gun range, no manifesto or explanation has emerged. NewsNation's Sean Noone, Anna Kutz, Damita Menezes and The Hill contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/the-plot-to-kill-trump-back-to-butler/	2024-10-05T20:46:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-1.jpg?w=900
Death toll from Hurricane Helene rises to 227 as grim task of rec...	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — The death toll from Hurricane Helene inched up to 227 on Saturday as the grim task of recovering bodies continued more than a week after the monster storm ravaged the Southeast and killed people in six states. Helene came ashore Sept. 26 as a Category 4 hurricane and carved a wide swath of destruction as it moved northward from Florida, washing away homes, destroying roads and knocking out electricity and cellphone service for millions. The number of deaths stood at 225 on Friday; two more were recorded in South Carolina the following day. It was still unclear how many people were unaccounted for or missing, and the toll could rise even higher. Helene is the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. About half the victims were in North Carolina, while dozens more were killed in Georgia and South Carolina. The city of Asheville, in the western mountains of North Carolina, was particularly battered. A week later workers used brooms and heavy machinery to clean mud and dirt outside of New Belgium Brewing Company, which lies next to the French Broad River and is among thousands of city businesses and households affected. So far North Carolinians have received more than $27 million in individual assistance approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said MaryAnn Tierney, a regional administrator for the agency. More than 83,000 people have registered for individual assistance, according to the office of Gov. Roy Cooper. In Buncombe County, where Asheville is located, FEMA-approved assistance has surpassed $12 million for survivors, Tierney said Saturday during a news briefing. 'This is critical assistance that will help people with their immediate needs, as well as displacement assistance that helps them if they can’t stay in their home,' she said. She encouraged residents impacted by the storm to register for disaster assistance. 'It is the first step in the recovery process,' she said. 'We can provide immediate relief in terms of serious needs assistance to replace food, water, medicines, other life safety, critical items, as well as displacement assistance if you cannot stay in your home.' Helene’s raging floodwaters shocked mountain towns hundreds of miles inland and far from where the storm made landfall on Florida’s Gulf Coast, including in the Tennessee mountains that Dolly Parton calls home. The country music star has announced a $1 million donation to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing immediate assistance to Hurricane Helene flood victims. In addition, her East Tennessee businesses as well as the Dollywood Foundation are combining efforts, pledging to match her donation to Mountain Ways with a $1 million contribution. Parton said she feels a close connection to the storm victims because so many of them 'grew up in the mountains just like I did.' 'I can’t stand to see anyone hurting, so I wanted to do what I could to help after these terrible floods,' she said. 'I hope we can all be a little bit of light in the world for our friends, our neighbors — even strangers — during this dark time they are experiencing.' Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said the company, including Sam’s Club and the Walmart Foundation, would increase its commitment and donate a total of $10 million to hurricane relief efforts. In Newport, an eastern Tennessee town of about 7,000, residents continued cleaning up Saturday from the destruction caused by Helene's floodwaters. Mud still clung to the basement walls of one Main Street funeral home. The ground-floor chapel of another nearby was being dried out, a painting of Jesus still hanging on the wall in an otherwise barren room. Newport City Hall and its police department also took on water from the swollen Pigeon River. Some of the modest, one-story homes along its banks were destroyed, their walls crumbled and rooms exposed. Farther east in unincorporated Del Rio, along a bend in the French Broad River, residents and volunteers toiled to clean up. The smell of wood hung in the air as people used chainsaws to cut through downed trees, and Bobcats beeped as they moved mangled sheet metal and other debris. Many homes sustained damage, including one that slid off its foundation. ___ Associated Press journalists Jeff Roberson in Newport, Tennessee; Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa; and Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia, contributed.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-death-toll-from-hurricane-helene-rises-to-227-as-grim-task-of-recovering-bodies-continues/	2024-10-05T18:31:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6701e9c894d259.76809491.jpeg?w=900

Hurricane Helene killed at least 227, more unaccounted for	FRANKFORT, Ky.

Harris visits North Carolina to survey Helene's aftermath one day...	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris visited North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene, arriving there one day after a stop in the state by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster. The vice president was greeted at the airport by Gov. Roy Cooper among others, and quickly headed into a briefing with emergency response officials about the recovery effort. Earlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed. The two have been vocal and visible about the government's willingness to help, and the administration's efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage. In a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund 'has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year.' He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program. More than 200 people have died. It's the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change. But in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states. Trump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn't doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene's aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it 'one of the great scams of all time.' During a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Thursday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal response and cited 'lousy treatment to North Carolina in particular.' In fact, Cooper said this week that more than 50,000 people have registered for FEMA assistance and about $6 million has been paid out. Biden has suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is withholding money for disaster relief needs. Harris’ visits present an additional political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She’s trying to step into a role for which Biden is well known — showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy — in the closing stretch of her White House campaign. Until this week, she had not visited the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice president. That duty was reserved for Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and more. Harris said this week that she wanted to 'personally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary.' She expressed admiration for how 'people are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.' She said that shows 'the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,' an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail. 'We are here for the long haul,' she said. ___ Associated Press writers Makiya Seminera in Boone, North Carolina, and Meg Kinnard in Fayetteville, North Carolina, contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said about $6 million, not $6 billion, has been paid out in disaster relief assistance for people in his state.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-harris-is-heading-to-north-carolina-to-survey-helenes-aftermath-one-day-after-trump-visited/	2024-10-05T13:03:21-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67019c5a093768.01480396.jpeg?w=900
How the Butler shooting changed Donald Trump's campaign	NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump was onstage at a rally on Long Island last month, talking about taxes, when he appeared momentarily spooked by something he had spotted over his shoulder. 'I thought this was a wise guy coming up,' he explained, joking that he was getting his elbow ready to fight back. 'You know I got a little bit of a yip problem here, right?' he added to laughs, using a term familiar to golf aficionados to describe a phenomenon once blamed on performance anxiety where players suddenly lose the ability to make easy shots. 'I was all ready to start duking it out.' It was a fleeting moment passed off as a joke. But as he returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday for a rally at the site where a gunman opened fire in July, grazing his ear with a bullet, the scare underscores the lasting fallout for the candidate and his campaign even as much of the national attention has shifted to other crises. Beyond the two attempts on his life in as many months, the former president and GOP nominee faces ongoing death threats from Iran, which has also been blamed for hacking top campaign officials and allies, exacerbating anxieties already heightened by a stepped-up security apparatus and new restrictions on how he can campaign. Trump's allies insist he was not fundamentally changed by the gunman who fired from an unsecured roof at the rally in July or the would-be assailant in September who shoved a rifle barrel through the fence at his West Palm Beach golf course. The picture of Trump standing, with blood streaked across his face, as he raised his fist and shouted 'Fight!' has become the indelible image of the campaign. 'When you almost lose your life, it stays with you. It stays with him,' said Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a close Trump ally. 'But that doesn’t change his resolve. His resolve is just as strong as it ever has been.' Threats have reshaped how he campaigns Trump staffers are on edge. There have been death threats directed at his aides, and his team isn't as able to quickly organize the mass rallies that have always been the signature of his campaigns. Armed security officers now stand guard at the campaign’s Florida headquarters, and staff have been told to remain vigilant and alert. Events have been canceled and moved around because the U.S. Secret Service lacked the resources to safely secure them. Even with the use of glass barricades to protect Trump onstage, there are concerns about holding additional rallies outdoors due to fears about drones. Trump has accused President Joe Biden's administration of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds. 'They couldn't give me any help. And I'm so angry about it because what they're doing is interfering in the election,' he said in a recent Fox News interview. U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Trump 'is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection' and that 'our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times.' Biden expressed concern for Trump after both assassination attempts, saying in September, 'Thank God the president is OK.' Trump also now travels with a larger security footprint, with new traffic restrictions outside his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and a line of dump trucks and big guns on display outside Trump Tower in New York when he’s staying there. As reporters filed into his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a press conference this summer, guests — including a little girl wearing a red, white and blue bathing suit — were forced to exit their cars and go through airport-style metal detectors as their vehicles were searched for bombs. Trump’s campaign last week was briefed on continued threats from Iran in presumed retaliation for his administration's killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target. Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to 'weaponize' the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded. The cyberattacks have forced some staff to change their email addresses and others to be wary of communicating online. Trump already faced unprecedented legal jeopardy for a presidential candidate, with four criminal indictments — one resulting in a felony conviction with sentencing delayed until after the election, one case dismissed, and two pending — along with civil lawsuits that carry hundreds of millions of dollars in potential penalties. 'I think that from our perspective, just from the campaign standpoint, operationally, if there’s one group of people that can handle something like this thrown in their lap, it’s the team that Donald Trump assembled to run this campaign, just based on everything we’ve had to deal with, whether it’s lawsuits to keep him off the ballot, to indictments, to assassination attempts,' Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said. Trump talks of divine intervention As for Trump, he speaks more often publicly of divine intervention, musing that God saved him in order to save the country. He also often says that assailants only go after consequential presidents. 'Obviously, when you come within a half an inch of a very different outcome, that’s going to impact you,' said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, another ally who said she spoke to Trump the morning after the Butler shooting. 'Of course, those moments really make you consider a higher power, why you are so committed to helping save this country,' she said. 'I think it has further empowered and energized President Trump.' Trump was recently asked by NewsNation if he's concerned about his safety ahead of his return to Butler. 'Well, I'm always worried,' he responded. 'I’m going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do,' he said. 'And I said that, when I was shot, I said, we’re coming back. We’re going to come back. And I’m fulfilling a promise; I’m fulfilling really an obligation.' His most loyal supporters at his rallies, including the one on Long Island where he joked about the 'yips,' haven't been dissuaded from seeing him in person. 'I know some people are scared to come, but I’m not,' said Eileen Deighan, 63, a nurse from nearby Yonkers, New York, who said she was inspired by Trump’s decision to keep on campaigning given the threats. 'The fact that he didn’t give up, he’s willing to fight for our country, how could you not support that?’ she asked. 'That will that he has — doesn’t give up. It’s very contagious.' Trump told his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday that he would continue fighting 'no matter what obstacles and dangers are thrown on our path.' But he had another point to make. 'I tell you what, I had a good life before I did this,' he said. 'Nobody was shooting at me. I had a hell of a life.' ___ Associated Press writer Scott Bauer contributed to this report from Waunakee, Wisconsin.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/ap-assassination-attempts-and-new-threats-have-reshaped-how-donald-trump-campaigns/	2024-10-05T12:42:14-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670197aa2071d3.09082699.jpeg?w=900
Where the Harris-Trump race stands 1 month out from Election Day	Vice President Harris and former President Trump have one month to convince voters to side with them in what appears likely to be one of the tightest presidential races in American history. Harris enters the homestretch as the slight favorite, with The Hill/Decision Desk HQ model giving her a 54 percent chance of winning the presidency. Republicans are bigger favorites to win the Senate, at 71 percent. The House battle is as close as the race for the White House, with Republicans having a 56 percent chance, according to the model, of holding on to their majority. With no more debates scheduled between the adversaries, it’s not entirely clear what could further shift the numbers, which have remained roughly the same for weeks. 'If you look at the way this presidential campaign has been thus far, the only thing that’s predictable is how unpredictable it’s been,' Republican strategist Nicole Schlinger said. The past four months alone have included one of the most consequential presidential debates ever, two assassination attempts on one of the candidates and an incumbent president ending a reelection bid later in the cycle than any point in modern history. Harris taking over for President Biden as the Democratic candidate spurred new energy for the party after Biden’s chances of reelection seemed to be plummeting. She enjoyed a remarkable rise in favorability after being underwater for a couple years. But after her improvements began to level off, the polls have remained largely static. Harris has maintained a slight lead in the national average and a smaller lead in most of the seven key battleground states. But almost all polls from major polling institutions of those states have shown a candidate ahead by a couple points at most, within the margin of error. Some have predicted this election could end up one of the closest in U.S. history. 'I think the race is where I expected it would be, which is really, really close,' Democratic strategist Jared Leopold said. 'It’s going to come down to the last month and who can execute and get done what they need to get done in a couple swing states.' While some voters have already cast their ballots with early voting in a few states getting underway, much can still happen in the next four weeks to shake up the race, especially given how long a week can be in the current news cycle. Just in the past 10 days, a major hurricane struck the Southeastern United States and a significant escalation has broken out in the Middle East after Israel killed the head of the militant group Hezbollah and Iran responded with firing missiles at Israel. In such a hyper-polarized atmosphere, each event has become politicized. And October has been known to throw in a last-minute surprise right before Election Day. The two most recent presidential election cycles, in 2016 and 2020, saw the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which Trump bragged about groping women; the reopening of the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server; and the reports about Hunter Biden’s laptop. A surprise in 2024 could include a growing conflagration in the Middle East, another natural disaster causing havoc or the unexpected release of audio or video of a candidate speaking. With two assassination attempts already having happened, more political violence seems not outside the realm of possibility. Still, strategists questioned how much another surprise would redefine the race given the intense partisanship and how much the country has already experienced this cycle. Schlinger noted that an October surprise initially had meant one side having opposition research about the other side and releasing it at the last minute to get the most attention, pointing to revelations of George W. Bush’s drunk driving arrest in the 2000 election from decades earlier. But she said for the most part 'folks are likely to know what they need to know' to make a decision, hence the small movement of the polls. 'It’s not a matter of when it gets this close,' she said. 'I think it’s a matter of what the American people have seen and lived through over the last 12 months in terms of surprises.' But others noted that it doesn’t mean even a marginal change could be critical in such a tight race. 'We're fighting for inches on the map, so every little thing is magnified when you're talking about these states,' said Republican strategist Ford O’Connell, referring to the main swing states. O’Connell said if a state like Arizona or Wisconsin is being decided by just 10,000 votes, that may require a difference of five votes per precinct. Trump carried the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by tens of thousands of votes in 2016, and Biden won them in 2020 by only a bit more. 'I don't think you're going to have this monstrous thing that's going to shove it one way or the other, but I do think you could have a series of events that together finally says to somebody who doesn't traditionally vote, screw it, I'm pulling the lever for Trump or Harris,' O’Connell said. For now, both sides are projecting optimism about their prospects. Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a call with reporters marking a month to Election Day that the enthusiasm behind Harris is 'palpable.' But he said Democrats know that the election will 'come down to the margins.' He said the party has been on the ground well before this year to get its message out to voters. 'We’re not taking any vote for granted as we fight against Donald Trump, JD Vance and their dangerous Project 2025 agenda,' Harrison said. O’Connell noted Trump’s past elections outperforming expectations, which should have him feeling 'pretty good' given that the polling is tighter now than it was in 2016 or 2020. He pointed to under-the-surface developments that should also give Trump reason for hope. He said if the recovery from Hurricane Helene is underwhelming as the death toll continues to rise, that could be critical in battleground states that the storm hit like Georgia and North Carolina. He said the poll from the Arab American Institute showing Trump leading among Arab American voters is notable especially because Democrats have traditionally had a 2-to-1 advantage among that group. 'So when you take those two things, I mean if this port [strike] had gone on beyond the week, that would have politically been the best thing Donald Trump could hope for,' O’Connell said, referencing the strike port workers were on before reaching a deal and returning to work Friday. Democrats and Republicans agreed that the result could ultimately come to turnout and motivation. 'It's either a turnout game or a persuasion game at this point, and I think this election is both, and you have to do both,' Leopold said. 'You have to both turn people out and persuade people.' Schlinger emphasized that campaigns do not want to leave votes on the table that they didn’t get because of a lack of infrastructure. 'This is where a grassroots ground game makes all the difference,' she said. 'Where you're knocking on doors, you're making phone calls, you're identifying people, and you're making sure that the right people you identify turn out and you don't mistakenly turn out your opponent.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/where-the-harris-trump-race-stands-1-month-out-from-election-day/	2024-10-05T10:18:19-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/One-month-left_100524_Illustration_Courtney-JonesMark-Schiefelbein-and-Seth-WenigAPand-Adobe-Stock.png?w=900
Israel expands its bombardment in Lebanon as thousands flee widen...	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon on Saturday, hitting Beirut’s southern suburbs with a dozen airstrikes and striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. Israel's attack on the Beddawi camp near Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli killed an official with Hamas’ military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in an Israeli strike in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. Israel’s military said it killed two senior officials with Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks. Israel has killed several Hamas officials there since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. At least 1,400 Lebanese, also including civilians and paramedics, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from homes in less than two weeks. Plumes of smoke dominated the skyline over Beirut’s densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah commanders and military equipment and aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 250 Hezbollah fighters. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister did not name the countries putting forward initiatives, saying they include regional states and some outside the Middle East. Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary. Fleeing Lebanon on foot Israel’s military on Saturday said about 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Most were intercepted, but several fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured. At least six people in Lebanon were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency. Nearly 375,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee. Associated Press journalists saw hundreds continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot, crunching over the rubble after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading to it on Thursday. Much of Hezbollah’s weaponry is believed to come from Iran through Syria. 'We were on the road for two days,' said Issa Hilal, one of many Syrian refugees in Lebanon who are now heading back. 'The roads were very crowded … it was very difficult. We almost died getting here.' Some children whimpered or cried. Other displaced families now shelter alongside Beirut’s famous seaside Corniche, their wind-flapped tents just steps from luxury homes. 'We don’t care if we die, but we don’t want to die at the hands of Netanyahu,' said Om Ali Mcheik. The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads and weapons storage facilities. It said troops dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. More evacuation orders in Gaza Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the Health Ministry there, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Almost 90% of Gaza’s residents are now displaced, amid widespread destruction. Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza on Saturday killed at least nine people. One in the northern town of Beit Hanoun killed at least five, including two children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four, Awda hospital said. Israel's military did not have any immediate comment but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. An Israeli airstrike killed two children in Gaza City’s Zaytoun neighborhood, according to the civil defense first responders’ group that operates under the Hamas-run government. Israel's military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza that was at the heart of obstacles to a cease-fire deal. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, a coastal area it has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are in those areas. Israeli forces have often returned to areas in Gaza to target Hamas fighters as they regroup. ___ Mroue and El Deeb reported from Beirut, Lebanon. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-strikes-lebanon-hitting-beirut-suburbs-and-the-north/	2024-10-05T09:09:55-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6701654262e3e0.98215737.jpeg?w=900
Republicans seek to tie Democrats in crucial New York House races...	Republicans are trying to tie New York Democrats to New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the wake of his indictment on federal corruption charges, hoping the association will be a liability for those running in tight Empire State races that could determine control of the chamber next year. The effort — which has spanned top GOP lawmakers, Republican candidates and the House GOP’s campaign arm — has sought to link New York Democrats to the 'cult of corruption' surrounding Adams, who is facing five counts including bribery, wire fraud and solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national. He has pleaded not guilty. Republicans are also attempting to connect Democrats to the crime and migrant crisis in the Big Apple, two politically charged matters that Adams has come under fire for. Strategists on both sides of the aisle have expressed skepticism that the messaging blitz will sway voters in the battleground districts that make up New York City suburbs. But Republicans are, nonetheless, moving ahead with their full court press. Rep. Elise Stefanik, the chair of the House GOP conference and the highest-ranking New York Republican in Congress, wrote in a statement hours after the Adams indictment that 'New York Democrats will pay the price for this corruption and incompetence in November and Republicans will sweep this November.' The House GOP’s campaign arm echoed that sentiment. 'As extreme New York Democrats try to distance themselves from the NYC Mayor like rats fleeing a sinking ship, we are ready to remind voters what exactly he and his policies did to America's largest city,' National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Savannah Viar said in a statement. The push has percolated to the candidate level, too. Alison Esposito, who is taking on Rep. Pat Ryan (D) in New York’s 18th Congressional District, which covers the northern suburbs of New York City, penned a Washington Reporter op-ed this week that tried to connect Ryan to Adams’s tenure. 'Like Adams, my opponent, Pat Ryan, supports the same liberal policies that have caused chaos in New York,' she wrote, later adding, 'At the end of the day, Ryan and Adams represent the same repressive and dangerous policies that are the worst of our government and New Yorkers deserve better.' Ryan has not called on Adams to resign. In a statement to The Hill, the congressman said, 'My sole focus is delivering for the Hudson Valley.' In New York’s 3rd Congressional District, Rep. Tom Suozzi (D) is taking heat from his GOP challenger, Mike LiPetri. Adams in 2021 had publicly floated asking Suozzi to serve as deputy mayor, a prospect the congressman declined. LiPetri, a former New York state assemblyman, told the New York Post last month that Suozzi’s 'old buddy Eric Adams is going down in an alleged bribery scandal.' 'No wonder the duo considered working together in City Hall,' he added. 'We deserve better than these career politicians who only look out for themselves — it’s time for a fresh start.' Suozzi declined to comment to the Post and has stopped short of calling on Adams to resign. Federal prosecutors unsealed a five-count indictment against Adams on Sept. 26, accusing him of accepting travel and gifts from those in the Turkish government, soliciting campaign contributions from Turkish businessmen, taking in straw donations and engaging in bribery in connection to Turkish individuals. The charges followed a lengthy investigation into Adams that had been ongoing since 2021, when he was serving as Brooklyn borough president. The mayor has remained defiant in the wake of the indictment, pleading not guilty and insisting that he will remain in office amid increasing pressure. Prosecutors this week warned that more charges could be on the way. While many House Democrats are urging the public to respect the legal process, some competing in the closest races in New York are calling on him to resign. That group includes the Democrats taking on Republican Reps. Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.), Mike Lawler (N.Y.), Marc Molinaro (N.Y.) and Nick LaLota (N.Y.), whose races are considered to be among the most competitive this cycle. 'Upstate New York is facing serious issues, and the last thing we need is more corrupt downstate politicians compounding the problems, exporting their chaos, and abusing the public’s trust,' Josh Riley, who is challenging Molinaro, said in a statement. 'Eric Adams should immediately resign.' Molinaro dismissed the calls for resignation as political in nature. 'Josh Riley is a phony,' Molinaro told The Hill in an interview. 'He is absolutely happy to surround himself with the same people that have created this culture of corruption, and then when politically necessary, feign some sort of opposition or concern.' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), for his part, brushed aside any prospect of the Adams indictment negatively affecting downballot Democrats, saying the races would be decided on local issues. 'We have incredible candidates who are running all across the state of New York and beyond, who are running their own races,' he said in an interview with MSNBC. And former New York lawmakers from both sides of the aisle were skeptical that the GOP strategy would be potent enough to influence New York contests. Former Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) — a 16-year veteran of the House who served as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) for two cycles — said the headlines regarding Adams are not helpful for Democrats, but he predicted that they will not be too damaging for those campaigns. 'First, because Election Day is still over a month away. And second, because these days there’s nothing earth-shattering about scandals of this nature … and that is particularly true in areas around New York City,' Israel told The Hill in an interview. Israel said he would advise candidates to determine, based on their districts, how to proceed — which many are doing now — noting that it is 'perfectly understandable' for Democrats in battlegrounds to distance themselves from the mayor. 'In an extremely tight race where the margin could be several 100 votes, you don’t want to leave a single vote on the table. And you don’t want extraneous controversies to dissuade any single voter from supporting,' Israel said. 'So they have to be taken seriously, the headlines have to be taken seriously. But they don’t rise to an existential threat to any campaign.' Democratic sources have also been quick to note that Adams, who was elected mayor in 2021, is not on the ballot this year and that several Republican candidates are facing scandals of their own. The New York Times recently reported that D’Esposito put his lover and fiancée’s daughter on his House payroll. He denied any wrongdoing. The paper also uncovered a photo of Lawler wearing blackface while dressed as Michael Jackson in 2006, which he has apologized for. Additionally, one Democratic operative working on a New York House race argued that the GOP criticism is hypocritical because many are supporting former President Trump’s quest for the White House, despite his quartet of indictments. 'The problem for Republicans is that they can’t align on which flavor of bulls‑‑‑ to spew. Half of them are screaming lawfare, half of them have magically come to the conclusion that an indictment is now a disqualifying offense,' the operative said. Former Rep. John Faso (R), who represented parts of the Hudson Valley from 2017 through 2019, said the indictment is 'certainly not a plus for Democrats.' But, he added, 'I think the major issues are immigration, crime and inflation and among Jewish New Yorkers, I think the failure of Democrats to truly support Israel in its time of need are more significant factors.' Republicans tying Democrats to Adams, to be sure, is a strategy that predates the September indictment, as the mayor for months has faced scrutiny for his handling of crime and the migrant crisis in the city. In December, The New York Times issued a poll that found Adams's approval rating had sunk to 28 percent, which was the lowest for any Big Apple mayor since 1996. The day before news of Adams’s indictment broke, for example, the NRCC started running an ad associating Democratic New York state Sen. John Mannion — who is running against incumbent Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.) — with Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul (D). 'John Mannion, he’s with them, not us,' the ad reads, showing a photo of the Democratic candidate beside Adams and Hochul. But now, with the indictment in tow and more charges potentially on the way, New York Republicans are re-upping their criticism of Adams and House Democrats, hoping that the messaging blitz helps put the GOP over the edge in the tight race for the lower chamber. 'Single-party rule in New York has produced a culture of corruption which, sadly, far too many Democrats accept,' Molinaro said. 'Now we have yet one more example of that and it’s gonna come back to bite them. As well it should.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-seek-to-tie-democrats-in-crucial-new-york-house-races-to-eric-adams/	2024-10-05T08:35:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/adamseric_100224upi02_w.jpg?w=900
North Carolina mom explains how her family escaped Helene	(NewsNation) — Hurricane Helene has devastated lives and families across the southeast, and while Stephanie Zara and her family lost their home it could have been worse. Hundreds of people are still missing as hopes of finding them dwindle. More than 200 people have been killed since Helene made landfall in Florida over a week ago. Like much of western Carolina, Swannanoa was hit hard by Helene and caused much damage to the Zara family home. 'We were in complete panic,' Zara told 'Morning in America.' 'So I was able to get a distress call out to 911 when the water started rushing in. When I got through, they were telling me they were overwhelmed with calls, and they just told me to get to high ground.' FEMA has faced criticism and praise during Helene. Here’s what it does — and doesn’t do Once realizing their attic was no longer a safe place, the Zaras had to swim through their home to get on the roof. It was there they waited until a neighbor came through on a kayak to save them. 'It was by a complete miracle,' Zara said of their survival. 'I'm beyond grateful for my community, and we would not be here without our neighbor, John, specifically, who had the kayaks and had the forethought to rush into action. 'He trained another neighbor on the spot how to use the other kayak, and they just immediately, was like they were just a rescue group. It was amazing. What they did for us.' Zara and her family will rebuild in Swannanoa, but did not have flood insurance so are relying on assistance from FEMA.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/north-carolina-mom-family-escaped-helene/	2024-10-05T08:26:17-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2176842434.jpg?w=900
Helene victims face grim task of rebuilding without flood insuran...	A week after Hurricane Helene overwhelmed the Southeastern U.S., homeowners hit the hardest are grappling with how they could possibly pay for the flood damage from one of the deadliest storms to hit the mainland in recent history. The Category 4 storm that first struck Florida’s Gulf Coast on September 26 has dumped trillions of gallons of water across several states, leaving a catastrophic trail of destruction that spans hundreds of miles inland. More than 200 people have died in what is now the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina, according to statistics from the National Hurricane Center. Western North Carolina and the Asheville area were hit especially hard, with flooding that wiped out buildings, roads, utilities and land in a way that nobody expected, let alone prepared for. Inland areas in parts of Georgia and Tennessee were also washed out. The Oak Forest neighborhood in south Asheville lives up to its name, with trees towering over 1960s era ranch-style houses on large lots. But on Sept. 27, as Helene’s remnants swept through western north Carolina, many of those trees came crashing down, sometimes landing on houses. Julianne Johnson said she was coming upstairs from the basement to help her 5-year-old son pick out clothes that day when her husband began to yell that a giant oak was falling diagonally across the yard. The tree mostly missed the house, but still crumpled part of a metal porch and damaged the roof. Then, Johnson said, her basement flooded. On Friday, there was a blue tarp being held on the roof with a brick. Sodden carpet that the family torn out lay on the side of the house, waiting to go to the landfill. With no cell phone service or internet access, Johnson said she couldn't file a home insurance claim until four days after the storm. 'It took me a while to make that call,' she said. 'I don’t have an adjuster yet.' Roof and tree damage are likely to be covered by the average home insurance policy. But Johnson, like many homeowners, doesn't have flood insurance and she’s not certain how she’ll pay for that part of the damage. Those recovering from the storm may be surprised to learn flood damage is a completely separate thing. Insurance professionals and experts have long warned that home insurance typically does not cover flood damage to the home, even as they espouse that flooding can happen anywhere that rains. That’s because flooding isn’t just sea water seeping into the land – it’s also water from banks, as well as mudflow and torrential rains. But most private insurance companies don't carry flood insurance, leaving the National Flood Insurance Program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the primary provider for that coverage for residential homes. Congress created the federal flood insurance program more than 50 years ago when many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas. North Carolina has 129,933 such policies in force, according to FEMA’s latest data, though most of that protection will likely be concentrated on the coast rather than in the Blue Ridge Mountains area where Helene caused the most damage. Florida, in comparison, has about 1.7 million flood policies in place statewide. Charlotte Hicks, a flood insurance expert in North Carolina who has led flood risk training and educational outreach for the state's Department of Insurance, said the reality is that many Helene survivors will never be made whole. Without flood insurance, some people may be able to rebuild with the help of charities but most others will be left to fend for themselves. 'There will absolutely be people who will be financially devasted by this event,' Hicks said. 'It’s heartbreaking.' Some may go into foreclosure or bankruptcy. Entire neighborhoods will likely never be rebuilt. There’s been water damage across the board, Hicks said, and for some, mudslides have even taken the land upon which their house once stood. Meanwhile, Helene is turning out to be a fairly manageable disaster for the private home insurance market because those plans generally only serve to cover wind damage from hurricanes. That's a relief for the industry, which has been under increasing strain from other intensifying climate disasters such as wildfires and tornadoes. Nowhere is the shrinking private market due to climate instability more evident than in Florida, where many companies have already stopped selling policies — leaving the state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corporation now the largest home insurer in the state. Mark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said Helene is a 'very manageable loss event,' and estimates insurer losses will range from about $5 billion to $8 billion. That’s compared to the insured losses from the Category 4 Hurricane Ian in September 2022 that was estimated in excess of $50 billion. Friedlander and other experts point out that less than 1% of the inland areas that sustained the most catastrophic flood damage were protected with flood insurance. 'This is very common in inland communities across the country,' Friedlander said. ' Lack of flood insurance is a major insurance gap in the U.S., as only about 6% of homeowners carry the coverage, mostly in coastal counties.' Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, said the images of the flood destruction in North Carolina shook her despite decades of seeing challenging recovery faced by victims of natural disasters. 'This is a pretty serious situation here in terms of people disappointed. They are going to be disappointed in their insurers and they are going to be disappointed in FEMA,' Bach said. 'FEMA cannot match the kind of dollars private insurers are supposed to be contributing to the recovery.' This week, FEMA announced it could meet the immediate needs of Helene but warned it doesn't have enough funding to make it through the hurricane season, which runs June 1 to Nov. 30 though most hurricanes typically occur in September and October. Even if a homeowner does have it, FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program only covers up to $250,000 for single-family homes and $100,000 for contents. Bach said that along with homeowners educating themselves about what their policies do and don’t cover, the solution is a national disaster insurance program that does for property insurance what the Affordable Care Act did for health insurance. After Hurricane Floyd in 1999, the state of North Carolina started requiring insurance agents to take a flood insurance class so they could properly advise their clients of the risk and policies available, Hicks said. The state also requires home insurance policies to clearly disclose that it does not cover flood. 'You can’t stop nature from doing what nature is going to do,' Hicks said. 'For us to think it’s never going to be this bad again would be a dangerous assumption. A lot of people underestimate their risk of flooding.' ___ Associated Press Staff Writers Jeff Amy in Asheville, North Carolina, Lisa Leff in London and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/ap-homeowners-hit-by-hurricane-helene-face-the-grim-task-of-rebuilding-without-flood-insurance/	2024-10-05T08:18:18-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/67015992b01a40.49700410.jpeg?w=900
Middle East latest: A Hamas official is killed in an Israeli stri...	An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed Hamas official Saeed Atallah Ali and his family, the militant group said Saturday. The early morning strike came a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Israel conducts more ground raids in southern Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Saturday its special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border. Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries’ shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it calls a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, which is saturated with arms and explosives, the military said. Israeli strikes in Lebanon have hit civilian areas and infrastructure including hospitals and paramedics. Israeli strikes hammer Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — Beirut’s southern suburbs was hit by 12 Israeli airstrikes early Saturday, including one that badly damaged a large hall Hezbollah has used to hold ceremonies, Lebanon’s state news agency said. Later in the day, more strikes hit the area, from which tens of thousands of people have fled over the past two weeks. Israeli airstrikes also hit areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to state media. At least six people were killed, according to NNA. Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 9, including 2 children CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least nine people, including two children. One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry’s Ambulance and Emergency service. Another strike hit a house in the northern part of Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of wounded people, it said. The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas. Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the almost year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Israel orders more evacuations in central Gaza CAIRO — The Israeli military on Saturday warned residents in parts of central Gaza to evacuate, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian militants. The warnings cover areas along a strategic corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military warned Palestinians in areas of Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps, located along the Netzarim corridor, to evacuate to an along Gaza's shore called Muwasi, which the military has designated a humanitarian zone. It’s unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas affected by the order, parts of which were evacuated previously. Less than an hour after the evacuation order, Palestinians reported Israel’s artillery shelling and smoke bombing in the northern areas of Nuseirat camp. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the war one year ago. The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps. Others have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe. An Israeli strike on a refugee camp kills a Hamas official BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday. Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali’s wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima — whom the statement described as children — were also killed in the attack. Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in the recent conflict. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023. South Korea evacuates 97 people from Lebanon SEOUL, South Korea — A military plane evacuating 97 people from Lebanon arrived in South Korea on Saturday. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the group on the plane includes South Korean nationals and their family members.

Trump to rally with Elon Musk at site of first assassination atte...	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk will join Donald Trump at his rally Saturday in Butler, the Pennsylvania city where the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt earlier this year. 'I will be there to support!' Musk wrote on his social platform X on Thursday in a retweet of Trump’s own promotion of the rally. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO will be among special guests in attendance, Trump's campaign confirmed Friday. Saturday's rally will take place at the same property where a gunman's bullets grazed Trump's right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured. Where are Trump, Harris, Vance and Walz campaigning today? Several members of Comperatore's family, as well as other attendees and first responders from the July rally, will join Trump on Saturday at the farm show property, according to the campaign. The FBI said in July that the attempted assassin was Thomas Crooks. The Secret Service shot and killed the 20-year-old seconds after Trump was shot. The attack is the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Also appearing with the former president will be his running mate, Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, his son Eric Trump, his daughter-in-law and RNC co-chair Lara Trump and several Pennsylvania lawmakers and sheriffs, the campaign said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-rally-butler-pa-elon-musk/	2024-10-04T12:50:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/AP24211571601042-e1723232689364.jpg?w=800
US launches airstrikes on Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, going after weapons systems, bases, and other equipment belonging to the Iranian-backed rebels, U.S. officials confirmed. Military aircraft and warships bombed Houthi strongholds at roughly five locations, according to the officials. Houthi media said seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sanaa, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province. The Houthi media office also reported three air raids in Bayda province, southeast of Sanaa. The strikes come just days after the Houthis threatened 'escalating military operations' targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships. Boris Johnson alleges Netanyahu may have bugged his bathroom The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The group has maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/ap-us-news/us-airstrikes-yemens-iran-houthi-rebels/	2024-10-04T12:13:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2173931972.jpg?w=900
Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu trying to influence election	President Biden on Friday said he wasn't aware of whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, while noting no administration has been a stronger ally to Israel than his own. In his first briefing room appearance of his presidency, Biden addressed Democratic concerns that the Israeli leader is ignoring Biden’s call to negotiate a Gaza peace deal and confronting Hezbollah and Iran in an effort to interfere with the White House race. 'No administration has helped Israel more than I have, none, none, none. And, I think Bibi should remember that,' Biden said. He added, 'And whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know. But I’m not counting on that.' The president has publicly and privately been frustrated with Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza over the past year, which has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians. Monday will mark the anniversary of the Hamas attack against Israel that set off the war. He was also pressed on if he wants to speak to Netanyahu and said he assumes that when Israel 'makes an assessment on how they’re going to respond, we will have a discussion.' He added that his team and the prime minister’s team are in 'constant contact' while they try to figure out their retaliation plan. Biden a day earlier had caused waves in the markets when he said the U.S. and Israel were in discussions about the response to Iran’s missile attack earlier in the week, including the possibility they could strike Iranian oil fields. On Friday, Biden suggested he would advise against such a move. 'The Israelis have not concluded what they’re going to do in terms of a strike,' Biden said. 'That’s under discussion. If I were in their shoes I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/biden-i-dont-know-if-netanyahu-trying-to-influence-election/	2024-10-04T11:56:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/BidenJoe.jpg?w=900
NewsNation's Nichole Berlie announces she's cancer free	(NewsNation) — NewsNation anchor Nichole Berlie announced on Friday, amid Breast Cancer Awareness Month, that she is officially cancer-free after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year. 'One year ago today, Oct 4. of last year, I was one of those women under the age of 50 to be diagnosed,' Berlie said in her emotional announcement during Friday's broadcast of her show 'NewsNation Now.' 'Mine started with no symptoms; I had no signs. So please hear this: My mammogram was fine. I was given the all-clear,' she said. 'And it’s because there was no cancer. The cancer was only detected through a recommended ultrasound because I have dense breast tissue. And another twist, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, but doctors never actually found any cancer in either breast. It was found in one lymph node in my armpit.' With October being Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Berlie has a request for viewers. 'I’ve always been healthy, I’ve always been active and I still got cancer. So it can happen to anyone. Please do not put off going to the doctor.' Berlie said that while she still has years of medication and screenings ahead, she’s relieved. 'I am here and I am thankful,' she said. If you or someone you love has breast cancer or want to get involved to help out, you can find help, resources, and community at the National Breast Cancer Foundation here.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/media/newsnations-nichole-berlie-announces-cancer-free/	2024-10-04T11:44:44-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/snapshot-4.jpg?w=900
Boris Johnson alleges Netanyahu may have bugged his bathroom	(The Hill) -- Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson alleged in an interview with The Telegraph that his staff found a 'listening device' in his bathroom after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had used it in 2017. Johnson had been a foreign secretary at the time. Johnson claimed ahead of the release of his book 'Unleashed' that he was told, 'Later, when they (security) were doing a regular sweep for bugs, they found a listening device in the thunderbox.' When asked for more detail during the interview, Johnson said 'Everything you need to know about that episode is in the book.' Boris Johnson says Trump presidency would have prevented Ukraine invasion The Telegraph reported that 'it is not clear whether Israel was questioned or rebuked over the incident.' Israel also was accused around the same time of planting listening devices in The White House, The Telegraph also reported. U.S. officials said that 'Washington concluded that Israel was likely behind the placement of cellphone surveillance devices that were found near the White House and other sensitive locations around the capital,' The Telegraph wrote. The Hill has contacted the Israeli Embassy in London for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/boris-johnson-alleges-netanyahu-may-have-bugged-his-bathroom/	2024-10-04T11:41:02-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/646d0e774596b6.03191945-e1728042130490.jpeg?w=900
Trump, joined by Kemp, to be briefed on Helene in Evans, Georgia	(NewsNation) — Former president and 2024 Republican nominee Donald Trump will be in Evans, Georgia Friday to get a briefing on Hurricane Helene. After the briefing, during which he will be joined by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Trump will deliver remarks to the press, according to his website. The relationship between Kemp and Trump has sometimes been tense. Trump still falsely says that he won Georgia in the 2020 election, and Kemp refused to stop the certification of Trump's loss four years ago. However, NewsNation partner The Hill reports the two politicians have sought to put a 'long-simmering feud' on the back burner during campaign season. Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend last week, wreaking havoc in six states. Its effect are still being felt a week later, with at least 215 people dead and many unaccounted for. A lack of phone service and electricity has hindered search efforts for the missing. Roughly half the victims of the storm were in North Carolina, while dozens more were killed in South Carolina and Georgia, according to the Associated Press. How much do longshoremen make? Trump also visited Georgia earlier this week, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. 'Our hearts are with you and we are going to be with you as long as you need it,' Trump said in Valdosta Monday. During his trip to Valdosta, Trump repeatedly lied about the federal response to Hurricane Helene, claiming President Joe Biden hadn't responded to Kemp. The White House, however, previously said Biden spoke by phone to the Georgia governor, and Kemp himself confirmed Monday morning that he'd spoken to the president on Sunday night. Harris, meanwhile, went to Augusta Wednesday, where according to the Associated Press she handed out meals, embraced a shaken family and surveyed Hurricane Helene’s path of destruction. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-kemp-briefed-helene-evans-georgia/	2024-10-04T08:26:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2175694179.jpg?w=900
Garth Brooks responds to sexual assault allegations	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — Country music superstar Garth Brooks has issued a statement following a lawsuit accusing him of raping a hair and makeup artist in 2019. In a lawsuit filed in California court Thursday, an unnamed woman detailed a pattern of sexual abuse. Brooks' statement claims the allegations are 'wholly untrue.' Country music star Garth Brooks accused of sexual assault by makeup artist 'For the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars. It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face. Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of—ugly acts no human should ever do to another. We filed suit against this person nearly a month ago to speak out against extortion and defamation of character. We filed it anonymously for the sake of families on both sides. I want to play music tonight. I want to continue our good deeds going forward. It breaks my heart these wonderful things are in question now. I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be.' Garth Brooks Brooks filed his own lawsuit anonymously in September to stop the woman from publicly repeating the allegations. His lawsuit claims the allegations came about after 'John Doe,' now revealed to be Brooks, denied the woman's requests for salaried employment and medical benefits. Click here to read Brooks' lawsuit. The makeup artist's lawsuit claims Brooks committed sexual assault and battery against the woman — one in a Los Angeles hotel room in May 2019 and another at his home the same year, when he allegedly 'grabbed her hands and forced them' on his crotch. The woman says she refused but opted not to leave Brooks’ employment at the time 'knowing she needed the work,' the lawsuit states. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Live: NASA astronaut discusses 6-month stay on ISS	(NewsNation) — NASA astronaut Tracy Dyson shared the details of her six-month stay on the International Space Station after returning to Earth. Dyson called it a privilege to be on the ISS and work with Russian partners to journey to and from the station. Dyson spent 184 days in space on her third spaceflight, which included 2,944 orbits of Earth and a 78-million-mile journey. She was on the ISS with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who became the first person to spend 1,000 cumulative days in space. When asked if she would want to spend that long in space, Dyson said the work would make it worthwhile but leaving behind family and friends on Earth would make it a tough call. Earth’s temporary 2nd moon has arrived: What you need to know She also completed a 31-minute spacewalk during her stay, which she described as 'character-building' due to difficulties and a coolant leak in the station's umbilical that led to the spacewalk being cut short. As part of the ISS crew, Dyson conducted dozens of scientific and technological experiments, including remotely controlling a robot on Earth. She also used a 3D bioprinter to print cardiac tissue samples to test technology that could create replacement organs and tissues on Earth. Dyson said the work with biofabrication was one of the experiments she found especially rewarding to work on considering how it may be needed for long-term space exploration and settlement. 'That's incredibly important when we think about staying where we're going, not just visiting,' she said. Dyson also discussed the challenges everyday life can pose in space, including eating meals and snacks. She said it's not a place where you can snack on the go because food can easily go flying everywhere. 'Eating in microgravity is fraught with peril sometimes,' she said. Dyson's favorite meal on the ISS? A tortilla with brisket and braised red cabbage. Hope of finding Helene survivors starts to dwindle as searches go on The ISS is now being commanded by NASA astronaut Suni Williams, who is one of two crew members who flew to the station on what was meant to be an eight-week mission on Boeing's Starliner. After issues with Starliner surfaced, NASA decided not to return Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore to Earth on Starliner. Instead, the mission was extended to February 2025, when Williams and Wilmore will return to Earth with SpaceX's Crew-9 mission, which launched in September.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/astronaut-tracy-dyson-iss-stay/	2024-10-04T07:55:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/02/65dfa72f8a63f6.83131196.jpeg?w=900
Is the port strike over?	(NewsNation) — The port strike threatening to derail the holiday shopping season has temporarily ceased. On Thursday, an accord was struck to suspend the strike until Jan. 15 to allow both sides time to negotiate a more permanent remedy. The deal between the International Longshoremen’s Association and the U.S. Maritime Alliance includes dockworkers returning to the job with immediate effect. Hope of finding Helene survivors starts to dwindle as searches go on Strikes began on Tuesday as port workers following the expiration of their contracts amid a pay dispute with the ports. What is the deal currently agreed to? The 45,000 workers at East and Gulf Coast ports are back on the job and will remain in situ until Jan. 15 unless a more solidified deal is agreed to prior. An anonymous source briefed on the agreement told the AP ports had tentatively agreed to increase wages by 62% across the next five years, a 12% jump on the previous proposal, as part of the future deal. Workers will continue to work under their expired contract rates until Jan. 15. Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway linking Lebanon with Syria What is still unclear? It is uncertain when a new deal will be ratified, but there is little likelihood that a strike will happen again. Before Tuesday's strikes, both sides had moved off their initial wage offers, according to the Maritime Alliance, meaning progress had begun before the brief crisis occurred. What goods will be affected if it resumes? In the unlikely event that a strike somehow occurs, notwithstanding the in-principle agreement, food products are among the most likely to be impacted. Diddy accusations continue, including alleged abuse of ‘major’ star This includes fruit, vegetables, coffee, and seafood from outside the United States. American Farm Bureau Federation economist Daniel Munch told CBS News that more than 75% of America's bananas are dealt with by the International Longshoremen's Association.

Hope of finding Helene survivors starts to dwindle as searches go...	(NewsNation) — Hundreds of people across the Southeast are still missing Friday morning just over a week after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida's Big Bend and wreaked havoc in six states. Western North Carolina was among the hardest-hit places, and now time is running out to find any remaining survivors. So far, the massive storm has killed more than 200 people, wiped away smaller communities and displaced thousands. Search an--rescue crews from all over the nation remain on the ground, searching for missing survivors. SC pilot flying rescue missions ordered out of Lake Lure Road to recovery after Hurricane Helene Madison County said it needs more volunteers to help with the massive cleanup. But for those who have come out to help so far, they are masked up and working to shovel the mud all over town. Many fear that what they are cleaning up could be toxic. A firefighter with the volunteer fire department says it received help from the state with cadaver dogs. '(It's) very important because they can smell things we can't see and as you can see down here and in town, we have large debris piles we can’t see through and it’s very important,' said Capt. Morgan Silvers with the Marshall Fire Department. While recovery operations continue, several residents on the top of the mountains or in the valleys still don't have access to power, cutting them off from the rest of the world. Supplies have been airlifted in and delivered by mule train in some areas due to the difficult terrain and storm damage. Officials in Asheville have said it could be several weeks for critical services, including water, to be restored. The North Carolina National Guard said it has airlifted multiple people in need of medical assistance directly to hospitals for care with the help of members of the Connecticut National Guard. So far, the guard has completed 146 flight missions and rescued a total of 538 people and 150 pets. But now that it's been a week since the catastrophic flooding, the hope first responders will find survivors is dwindling. North Carolina election officials grapple with storm’s impact Hurricane Helene's devastation After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled north. However, wind and rain still caused significant damage to several states, including Georgia and the Carolinas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has shipped more than 9.3 million meals, nearly 3 million gallons of water, 150 generators and over 260,000 tarps to communities affected by the storm. One of the hardest-hit areas is western North Carolina, where Asheville and surrounding towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains experienced record-breaking floods. Following the storm, loss of power, water and cellphone service as well as damage to hundreds of roads left Asheville virtually cut off from the rest of the world. As of Friday morning, more than 200,000 people are still without power in Georgia. In South Carolina, there are another 282,000 outages, and in North Carolina another 231,000, according to poweroutage.us. The town of Black Mountain, North Carolina, says its fire and police departments have been able to account for more than 90% of the town's residents, but they are still continuing to look for more. So far, the North Carolina National Guard said as of Thursday afternoon, it has rescued over 450 people in 13 different counties. North Carolina's Department of Adult Correction, meanwhile, had to evacuate and relocate more than 800 prisoners due to Hurricane Helene damage. Blue Ridge Parkway closed indefinitely, National Park Service says Hurricane Helene has killed more than 200 According to The Associated Press, more than 215 people have died from the storm so far, with 72 of those deaths in Buncombe County, North Carolina, alone. The number is expected to rise as officials and volunteers continue searching for the missing. Helene is now the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/helene-survivors-recovery-search-efforts/	2024-10-04T05:05:12-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/GettyImages-2175400595.jpg?w=900
Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway lin...	An Israeli airstrike has cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road. The airstrike Friday rendered the road unusable for cars, leaving people to go on foot to the Masnaa Border Crossing where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. On Tuesday, Israel began a ground incursion into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group while also conducting strikes in Gaza. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Iran's leader praises missile strike on Israel in a speech at Friday prayers TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the country’s recent missile strike on Israel, state TV reported Friday. Khamenei was leading Friday prayers and was to deliver a rare public sermon in the Iranian capital, Tehran, that was being watched for signs of what Iran might plan next. In a 40-minute speech, he praised Tuesday's missile barrage against Israel as a shining job by Iranian armed forces. 'It will be done in the future again if it becomes necessary,' he said. There was a commemoration ceremony for the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah beforehand. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and the Revolutionary Guard’s top generals, attended the ceremony. Iran is Hezbollah’s main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group over the years. Also on Friday, Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut, where he was expected to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials. Spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Iran sent its first shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine. Japan prepares to evacuate citizens from Lebanon, urging nationals in Iran to leave, too TOKYO — As Japan prepared to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon, the government also urged those in Iran to leave as soon as possible, while commercial flights are still operating. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters Friday that Japan’s embassy in Iran renewed its safety advisory to Japanese nationals this week after Iran fired missiles into Israel. On Thursday, the Japanese Defense Ministry dispatched two C-2 transport aircraft to Jordan to stand by for an evacuation of about 50 Japanese nationals from Lebanon. Iwaya said the government has not decided whether to also dispatch defense aircraft to Iran, where about 440 Japanese citizens are based, but 'we will do our utmost so that we can respond to any contingency in order to protect the safety of Japanese citizens.' Iran’s foreign minister is in Beirut to meet with Lebanese officials BEIRUT — Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut where he will discuss with Lebanese officials the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group over the years. The Iranian official arrived in Lebanon as Israel launched new airstrikes on different parts of Lebanon, including Beirut’s southern suburb, south Lebanon, and the eastern Bekaa Valley. Araghchi’s visit to Beirut came after Iran launched at least 180 missiles Tuesday into Israel, part of a series of rapidly escalating attacks that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israeli strike cuts a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria. The agency gave no further details about Friday’s airstrike that led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It’s the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded more than 250,000 Syrian citizens and over 80,000 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory during the last week of September, after Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles and damaged the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. The Lebanese group has a presence on both sides of the border where it fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Australia's prime minister condemns comments by Iranian ambassador praising Hezbollah's slain leader SYDNEY — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday condemned the Iranian ambassador’s comments praising a recently slain Hezbollah leader, but rejected opposition advice to expel the envoy. Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi described Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli missile strike in September in Lebanon, as a 'remarkable leader' on social media. 'The government condemns any support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. We condemn the ambassador’s comments,' Albanese told reporters in Sydney. 'Australia has maintained a relationship with Iran since 1968 that has been continuous. Not because we agree with the regime, but because it’s in Australia’s national interest,' Albanese added. Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who could become prime minister at elections due by May, called for Sadeghi to be expelled over his post. Dutton described Sadeghi’s words as 'completely and utterly at odds with what is in our country’s best interests.' Sadeghi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Australia officially rebuked Sadeghi in August for endorsing Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin’s hope that 'wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-middle-east-latest-an-israeli-airstrike-cuts-a-major-highway-linking-lebanon-with-syria/	2024-10-04T03:16:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66ffc1c2baf5c6.54858480.jpeg?w=900
Suspect in Maryland mom Rachel Morin's killing due in court	(NewsNation) — The suspect charged in connection to the death of 37-year-old Maryland mother Rachel Morin is due in court Friday morning. Victor Martinez-Hernandez, an El Salvador national, will appear in Harford County Circuit Court for a motions hearing on charges of rape, kidnapping and murder. In a motions hearing, the judge will listen to arguments from the defense and prosecution regarding pretrial matters, such as evidence allowed at trial, a change of venue or excluding specific witness testimony. Menendez brothers case under review: LA district attorney Rachel Morin, 37, was last seen alive at around 6 p.m. Saturday when she left to take a walk on a nature trail. (Photo: Harford County Sheriff's Office) The prosecution or defense in this case may request a postponement of the motions hearing, according to the Morin family attorney. There were no motions filed with the court ahead of Friday’s hearing. 'While we hope for timely justice, it is possible that both parties may request a postponement, which could delay the current trial date of October 23, 2024. However, the family remains steadfast in their pursuit of justice for Rachel, and we will continue to push for accountability,' Randolph Rice, the Morin family attorney and spokesperson, said in a news release. If the hearing is postponed, the trial scheduled for Oct. 23 would likely also be delayed. Cameras are not allowed in the courtroom. TikTok star arrested in connection with death of therapist 'The outcome of these motions may significantly impact the direction of the case,' the release said. Morin, a mom of five, was first reported missing Aug. 5, 2023, and found the next day on a popular hiking trail in Harford County. Police began a 10-month nationwide manhunt for the suspect they believed to be Martinez-Hernandez, who was 22 years old at the time of the killing. He was arrested June 15 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was officially indicted July 2 and denied bail, according to court records. The high-profile killing sparked national outrage over the suspect’s immigration status. Martinez-Hernandez entered the U.S. from El Salvador illegally on at least three occasions last year, according to CBS News. He is also wanted for murder in his native country, according to the Tulsa Police Department.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/rachel-morin-murder-suspect-court-hearing-motions/	2024-10-04T02:24:41-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/Untitled-design-24.png?w=900
Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway lin...	An Israeli airstrike has cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. The airstrike led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. On Tuesday, Israel began a ground incursion into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group while also conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. ___ Here is the latest: Iran’s foreign minister is in Beirut to meet with Lebanese officials BEIRUT — Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut where he will discuss with Lebanese officials the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group over the years. The Iranian official arrived in Lebanon as Israel launched new airstrikes on different parts of Lebanon, including Beirut’s southern suburb, south Lebanon, and the eastern Bekaa Valley. Araghchi’s visit to Beirut came after Iran launched at least 180 missiles Tuesday into Israel, part of a series of rapidly escalating attacks that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israeli strike cuts a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria. The agency gave no further details about Friday’s airstrike that led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It’s the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded more than 250,000 Syrian citizens and over 80,000 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory during the last week of September, after Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles and damaged the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. The Lebanese group has a presence on both sides of the border where it fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Australia's prime minister condemns comments by Iranian ambassador praising Hezbollah's slain leader SYDNEY — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday condemned the Iranian ambassador’s comments praising a recently slain Hezbollah leader, but rejected opposition advice to expel the envoy. Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi described Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli missile strike in September in Lebanon, as a 'remarkable leader' on social media. 'The government condemns any support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. We condemn the ambassador’s comments,' Albanese told reporters in Sydney. 'Australia has maintained a relationship with Iran since 1968 that has been continuous. Not because we agree with the regime, but because it’s in Australia’s national interest,' Albanese added. Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who could become prime minister at elections due by May, called for Sadeghi to be expelled over his post. Dutton described Sadeghi’s words as 'completely and utterly at odds with what is in our country’s best interests.' Sadeghi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Australia officially rebuked Sadeghi in August for endorsing Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin’s hope that 'wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/top-headlines/ap-top-headlines/ap-middle-east-latest-an-israeli-airstrike-cuts-a-major-highway-linking-lebanon-with-syria/	2024-10-04T00:34:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66ff9b1f99c345.04078924.jpeg?w=900
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut and cut off a ...	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. The blasts overnight rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon’s Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 — when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon — and Sept. 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon’s minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/top-headlines/ap-top-headlines/ap-israeli-airstrikes-rock-southern-suburbs-of-beirut-and-cut-off-a-key-crossing-into-syria/	2024-10-03T23:51:41-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66ff91b707c188.16024944.jpeg?w=900
Mixed verdict for 3 Memphis officers convicted in Tyre Nichols' f...	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Three former Memphis police officers were convicted Thursday in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, but were acquitted of the harshest charges they faced for a death that sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing. Jurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. All were convicted of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols’ civil rights causing death, but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. He was also convicted of a conspiracy to witness tamper charge that the others were acquitted of. The court remained silent as the verdicts were read. The judge ordered all three officers to be taken into custody. He planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights charge against Haley carries up to 10 years in prison. They had faced up to life in prison if convicted on the harshest charges. The verdict marked a partial setback for prosecutors who were unable to land a conviction for civil rights violations for two officers who played an active role in the encounter. Jurors repeatedly watched graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the 29-year-old called out for his mother. In a statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department’s civil rights division, said 'Tyre Nichols should be alive today.' 'We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable,' Clarke said. Bean and Smith were seen on video wrestling with Nichols and holding his arms, while also hitting him, but the jury was not convinced those actions amounted to civil rights violations. An FBI agent said Smith told him he punched Nichols, but defense lawyers argued Bean and Smith were merely slapping Nichols’ hands away as they tried to put handcuffs on him. Rodney Wells, Nichols’ stepfather, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom: 'A win is a win. They’re all going to jail.' Five officers were charged in Nichols’ death, but two pleaded guilty and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit. Prosecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in officer slang as a 'street tax' or 'run tax. ' They said the officers lied — to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols and in required written reports — about the extent of the force they used. 'This has been a long journey for our family,' RowVaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told reporters. 'I’m actually in shock right now because I still can’t believe all the stuff that’s going on. But we’re happy that they all have been convicted and they have been arrested.' Smith's lawyer declined to comment. Attorneys for Bean and Haley did not respond to requests for comment. Nichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after the beating, also are Black. Some of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry, that he left Nichols’ young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would 'blow over.' Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is now 7 years old. The other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin, testified that Nichols was 'helpless' while officers pummeled him, and that afterward the officers understood 'they weren’t going to tell on me, and I wasn’t going to tell on them.' Under his plea agreement, prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years. Defense attorneys sought to portray Martin as a principal aggressor. Martin testified Nichols was not a threat, yet he acknowledged punching and kicking Nichols in the head. Mills' lawyer declined to comment. Martin's attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message. The police video shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and other areas. With the federal criminal trial complete, other investigations and court action still aren't settled. The five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set. The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a 'patterns and practices' investigation into how Memphis officers use force and conduct arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing. The Justice Department also has a separate review concerning use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units within Memphis police. Pastor Earle Fisher, a Memphis activist who has long called for investigations of the city's police, said he hopes the probes 'provide for us the remedies we so rightly deserve.' Additionally, Nichols’ mother filed a $550 million lawsuit against the city and its police chief. Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci, lawyers for Nichols' family, said the verdicts 'bring a measure of accountability for his senseless and tragic death.' 'Our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over,' the lawyers said in a joint statement. _____ Mattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee.

North Carolina election officials grapple with storm's impact	(NewsNation) — Western North Carolina is one of the areas hardest hit by the remnants of Hurricane Helene; Asheville and surrounding towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains experienced record-breaking floods. As a result of the storm, people in the area lost power, water and cellphone service, and damage to hundreds of roads left Asheville virtually cut off from the rest of the world. Reporter Bob Buckley from NewsNation affiliate WGHP says the impact of Helene in North Carolina could have a 'massive' impact on the election. 'Early voting is supposed to start in two weeks. I don't see any way that happens in most of these counties up in the mountains,' Buckley said on NewsNation's Swing State Spotlight segment on 'The Hill.' 'Trump won those (most impacted) 14 counties by more than 90,000 votes in 2020. But he only won the state overall by 75,000 votes. So getting all those voters that are now displaced is gonna be massive to the Republicans for this November,' Buckley added. Helene first responders resume search and rescue for the missing North Carolina election officials say they will do everything in their power to ensure that voters in the crucial presidential swing state will be able to cast their ballots despite the devastation of Hurricane Helene and the destruction of basic infrastructure only about a month before the November election. Helene, which battered large areas across the Southeast late last week with torrential rain and strong winds and massive storm surges along the Gulf Coast, caused devastation 'beyond belief' in western North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said during a media briefing Tuesday. 'This disaster is unlike anything our state has ever experienced,' he said. The level of destruction could have far-reaching implications beyond the immediate damage to the flooded communities, especially if it has any impact on voting.

RSV, COVID, flu shots: Who should get vaccinated, according to th...	SHREVEPORT, La. (KTAL/KMSS)— Fall is here, and so is the season for respiratory infections. The CDC is urging everyone to get up to date on vaccines to minimize the side effects and potential hospitalizations. Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Principal Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there were about 800,000 hospitalizations for COVID, RSV, and influenza in 2023, and they would like to see that number lowered this year. US school-entry vaccination rates fall as exemptions keep rising 'The vaccines have arrived. And so if you if you do one thing this week or this weekend, try to take a minute to schedule time to go get you and your family, your vaccines,' Shah said. Shah said that a common thread in the number of those hospitalized last year was that 95 percent were unvaccinated. In addition to vaccinations, Shah emphasizes the importance of avoiding gatherings when you do not feel well and shares an anecdote about his family's plan to stay healthy. 'One of the things that we're trying to do in our family is to establish that so that if there's a Sunday dinner at somebody's house, but you're not feeling well, don't feel the need to come. There's always going to be another dinner. There's always going to be another church picnic. There's always going to be another school meeting. But if you go and spread a disease that can hurt a lot of people, particularly folks who are older, well, that's not going to be in the spirit of this time of the year.' 200 chemicals linked to breast cancer found in food packaging: Study While flu and COVID vaccines are recommended for anyone six months of age and up, Shah says the CDC has a different set of guidelines for RSV vaccinations. The RSV shot is a little bit different for anyone 75 and over. They should get that shot. Now, for folks who are between the ages of 60 and 74. It really depends on whether you've got some health conditions that might make it harder for your body to deal with RSV if you got it,' Shah said. 'So maybe you've got asthma, maybe you've got something like heart disease or hypertension. If you've got one of those conditions, it's also worth it to get the RSV shot.' When is the best time for flu or COVID vaccines to have a healthy holiday? Shah recommends getting vaccinated when it suits your schedule; however, your immune system needs time to acclimate, so a little lead time before holiday gatherings is recommended. 'Like any medicine or measure, vaccines take a little while to reach maximum effectiveness. With these vaccines, it's about two weeks or so before they are maximally effective. Now, don't worry, because even while they're building up, your body is still enjoying the benefits of protection. But I recommend folks take the month of October.' Ozempic, Wegovy shortages create anxiety, hunt for alternatives Shah said in Louisiana, only about 14 percent of residents were vaccinated against COVID, while about 36 percent received flu shots last year and says they would like to see those numbers climb in 2024. What's the difference between vaccines this year versus previous versions? Shah explained the differences in vaccine formulas by analogizing software updates to phones or other digital devices. 'The core of those vaccines, the blueprint that they work off of, hasn't changed. All that has changed is that they've gotten a little bit of a software update. And that software update means that they are that much more effective against the versions or the strains of the viruses that are circulating right now. Again, they're still fundamentally the same, but they've just gotten that little software update to keep them timely.' Ultimately, Shah says the vaccines are intended to minimize the effects we feel when contracting one of these viral infections; and the overall goal is keeping one another safe, especially elders, those with pre-existing illnesses, and young children. 'When one of us is that much more safe, all of us are that much more safe,' Shah concluded. For more information, visit vaccines.gov .

Blue Ridge Parkway to be closed indefinitely, National Park Servi...	NORTH CAROLINA (WJZY) -- The country's most-visited national park site, Blue Ridge Parkway, will remain closed indefinitely, the National Park Service said Wednesday. The closure affects the entire length of the Blue Ridge Parkway, though some parts were hit harder than others by storm damage. It comes right as the region and scenic road typically see a boom in tourism, as weather cools and the leaves change colors. Helene first responders resume search and rescue for the missing National park officials said the closure will be in place as crews continue their initial assessment of the damage from Tropical Storm Helene. The 469-mile scenic road starts at the Shenandoah National Park and ends at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Parkway winds through the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and North Carolina, two states that suffered serious flooding and storm damage. A photo shared by the National Park Service shows tree clearing efforts on the Blue Ridge Parkway. (Photo: NPS) Rescue operations were ongoing nearly a week after the storm barreled through the region. The efforts were especially challenging in the mountains of North Carolina, where remote communities were hard to reach with all the washed out roads. The death toll across the Southeast topped 200 on Thursday, and hundreds were still reported missing. The search for the missing hits snags at every corner as Helene’s death toll tops 200 Initially, two sections of the Parkway were closed ahead of the storm, but the full length was shut down on Saturday. The National Park Service said it has activated an incident management team, which is assessing damage and stabilizing park resources. There is no scheduled date for reopening any parts of the road.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/blue-ridge-parkway-closed-indefinitely/	2024-10-03T15:37:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP21323701619270-e1727981615655.jpg?w=800
Twin babies who died alongside their mother in Georgia are younge...	Obie Williams could hear babies crying and branches battering the windows when he answered his daughter’s daily phone call last week as Hurricane Helene tore through her rural Georgia town. Kobe Williams, 27, and her newborn twin boys were hunkering down at their trailer home in Thomson, Georgia, and starting to fear for their safety. She promised her father she would heed his advice to shelter in the bathroom with her month-old babies until the storm passed. Minutes later, she was no longer answering her family’s calls. One of her brothers dodged fallen trees and downed power lines to check on her later that day, and he could barely bear to tell his father what he saw. A large tree had crashed through the roof, crushing Kobe and causing her to fall on top of infant sons Khyzier and Khazmir. All three were found dead. 'I'd seen pictures when they were born and pictures every day since, but I hadn't made it out there yet to meet them,' Obie Williams told The Associated Press days after the storm ravaged eastern Georgia. 'Now I'll never get to meet my grandsons. It's devastating.' The babies, born Aug. 20, are the youngest known victims of a storm that had claimed 200 lives across Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and the Carolinas as of Thursday. Among the other young victims are a 7-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy from about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south in Washington County, Georgia. In the elder Williams' home city of Augusta, 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of his daughter's home in Thomson, power lines stretched along the sidewalks, tree branches blocked the roads and utility poles lay cracked and broken. The debris left him trapped in his neighborhood near the South Carolina border for a little over a day after the storm barreled through. Kobe, a single mother nursing newborns, had told her family it wasn't possible for her to evacuate with such young babies, her father said. Many of his 14 other children are still without power in their homes across Georgia. Some have sought refuge in Atlanta, and others have traveled to Augusta to see their father and mourn together. They are waiting for the bodies to be released by the county coroner and for roads to be cleared before arranging a funeral. Williams described his daughter as a lovable, social and strong young woman. She always had a smile on her face and loved to make people laugh, he said. She was studying to be a nursing assistant but had taken time off from school to give birth to her sons. 'That was my baby,' her father said.

Around 200 people have died because of the storm, and that number is expected to rise. Hundreds are still missing and without power or cell service. After it made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane last week, Helene weakened to a tropical storm, but wind and rain still caused significant damage to several Southeast states, including Georgia and the Carolinas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said so far, 60 Starlink units have been sent to multiple places devastated by the hurricane. Of these, 40 are going to North Carolina, which has been hit particularly badly, and more are on the way, according to FEMA. SC pilot flying volunteer supply and rescue missions ordered out of Lake Lure under arrest threat Starlink, a portable satellite internet service, has previously been deployed in areas such as Guam, Hawaii and Alaska that have also seen damage from natural disasters. 'Since the Hurricane Helene disaster, SpaceX has sent as many Starlink terminals as possible to help areas in need,' Musk said on X. 'Earlier today, @realDonaldTrump alerted me to additional people who need Starlink Internet in North Carolina. We are sending them terminals right away.' On Truth Social, former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump thanked Musk. 'Great news. So badly needed in North Carolina, where there is virtually no communication. Starlink was the perfect answer, and Elon Musk, as usual, came through,' he wrote Wednesday. Musk has endorsed Trump in the 2024 election. Trump visited Georgia on Monday, where he was critical of the federal government as well as Democratic nominee for president Kamala Harris' response to Hurricane Helene. David Brown disappeared while walking in Florida President Joe Biden and Harris, meanwhile, visited North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia on Wednesday. Biden praised the Democratic governor of North Carolina and Republican governor of South Carolina for putting politics aside in the wake of disasters. 'Our job is to help as many people as we can as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can,' Biden said. The Biden-Harris administration, FEMA said, has given Hurricane Helene survivors more than $20 million in funds. In a press release, FEMA said more than 5,000 employees from the federal workforce are deployed to areas struck by disaster, including 1,500 from their agency. 'To date, FEMA has shipped over 9.3 million meals, more than 11.2 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 260,000 tarps to the region,' the press release said. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/starlink-internet-service-hurricane-helene/	2024-10-03T12:50:08-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/64ff988992fa67.53963547.jpeg?w=900
Hurricane Helene renews calls for Congress to pass disaster fundi...	The widespread devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene is upping the pressure on lawmakers for a looming end-of-year fight over disaster funding. While funding negotiators on both sides acknowledge the need for additional resources for disaster recovery, it has already been a point of contention in spending talks and the dynamic could continue when a divided Congress returns from recess. President Biden on Monday said he may request Congress reconvene during the October break to pass emergency supplemental funding for storm recovery, and lawmakers from hard-hit states signaled a desire to do so. But it appears unlikely Congress will return early, with lawmakers spread across the country campaigning ahead of November and GOP leaders saying the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding included in last week’s stopgap spending bill is sufficient to address Helene. 'Congress has previously provided the funds it needs to respond, so we will make sure that those resources are appropriately allocated,' Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Tuesday. And House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said this week the funding legislation Congress passed has ensured FEMA 'has sufficient resources in the near term.' Congress passed a three-month stopgap last week to prevent government funding from lapsing ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline to avert a shutdown. Notably missing from the bipartisan agreement, which was passed a day before Helene made landfall in Florida, was billions of dollars in additional funding for FEMA’s disaster relief fund (DRF). Appropriators said the deal instead allows for the agency to use the fund’s resources faster for disaster response for the duration of the stopgap, allowing FEMA access to draw from roughly $20 billion starting Oct. 1. But funding negotiators on both sides have acknowledged the need for more resources in the months ahead. Sen. Katie Britt (Ala.), top Republican on the subcommittee that oversees funding for FEMA, said in a statement this week that resources made available in the fund will be 'pushed out the door through existing processes,' but she added the DRF will 'need additional funding in the coming months for the remainder of fiscal year 2025.' 'We will undoubtedly learn more about short- and long-term recovery needs in the coming days and weeks, and I look forward to hearing from the administration on what additional resources are needed to aid our fellow Americans who have lost loved ones, livelihoods, property, and possessions due to Hurricane Helene.' However, disaster aid was a thorny subject for a few in the latest round of spending talks, with some Democrats fuming last month as congressional leaders jammed through a stopgap they said misses the mark on dollars for disaster relief. 'This bill risks another depletion of FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund,' Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said at the time. 'Spending down next year’s funds early, especially as we deal with more catastrophic weather, threatens to create a perfect storm by our next funding deadline.' House Republicans had previously included $10 billion in additional funding for FEMA as part of their initial six-month stopgap offer. But the funding fell out amid calls from hardline conservatives pushing for more to be done to curb government spending. Other Republicans also expressed confidence that the funding in the shorter stopgap plan that was eventually adopted was sufficient. 'It provides for up to $20 billion and we're not going to run out of money to respond to natural disasters. They didn't add money, but we can use it faster, and it resolves any concerns I have,' Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told The Hill last week. 'We'll talk about it in December, particularly if we keep having natural disasters,' Kennedy said. But since the hurricane hit, killing at least 150 people, lawmakers have piled up calls for Congress to come back immediately and pass a supplemental funding bill. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on Tuesday told reporters 'My view is we should come back and get the job done.' Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Monday said that the Senate should 'immediately reconvene' to pass a disaster supplemental aid package. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a post on X that it is 'imperative that Congress reconvene to pass a supplemental aid package for the damage done to the Southeast by Hurricane Helene and also to provide missile defense assistance to Israel.' While FEMA has said it has the funds to cover its response to Hurricane Helene, officials have warned the agency could have to again cut back on funding in the coming months, potentially at the expense of reimbursing communities for public assistance and hazard mitigation projects. The agency had similarly cut back earlier this year as funds ran down. 'We went into Immediate Needs Funding as our Disaster Relief Fund was running low,' FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters last week, adding that by doing so, $9 billion worth of projects had to be put on hold. Criswell said at the time that once the stopgap funding measure that passed last week to avoid a government shutdown takes effect, the agency will be able to pay for those projects for the time being. But, she added that without supplemental funding from Congress, FEMA will likely need to dip back into the Immediate Need Funding (INF) – and put more projects on hold — by January. Yucel Ors, the legislative director for public safety and crime prevention at the National League of Cities, said that without supplemental funding, putting those projects on hold could hamper recovery efforts in the months after a disaster takes place. 'They're still clearing up debris. They're still building the infrastructure, the roads, the communication systems, the power lines and everything else. Those take a long time in that recovery process,' Ors told The Hill. 'When FEMA puts in the INF limitations, that funding could be frozen until FEMA gets the additional tranche of money from Congress,' he added. 'That would mean all those recovery processes, either local governments or the states, have to put up that money and hopefully get reimbursed by FEMA down the road or it could mean that these recovery processes could take a much longer time.' Ors noted that a longer recovery process could have negative impacts to cities, not only because it takes longer to build up the infrastructure itself, but also because governments often take out loans for recovery and delays in reimbursements could mean they’re paying higher interest rates. This could also have knock-on effects, limiting the other services a local government has to offer. 'The more of this money that goes towards disaster recovery, the harder it is going to [be] for cities to actually fund those other projects that they might be working on to make their communities safer, to make their communities stronger and be economically competitive,' Ors said. Also at risk without supplemental appropriations is funding for projects that help localities proactively prepare for extreme weather events — things like storm drain management, levee fortification and wildfire barriers. 'If these programs are cut back, we do know that the cost of disaster recovery goes up,' Ors said. He called for FEMA to be 'fully funded' through a supplemental package. Other advocacy groups made similar calls. 'With payments from key FEMA programs on hold, communities still reeling from previous disasters may opt to hold off on permanent recovery work such as repairing damaged facilities, restoring roads and bridges, or rebuilding infrastructure to be more resilient against future disasters,' Julie Seger, government relations and policy director of the American Flood Coalition, told The Hill in a written statement. 'Congress must provide consistent, long-term [Disaster Relief Fund] resources to ensure FEMA can continue lifesaving emergency operations without delaying hard-fought recoveries for communities across the country,' Seger added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/hurricane-helene-renews-calls-for-congress-to-pass-disaster-funding/	2024-10-03T11:23:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/helene_aid_093024ap01_w.jpg?w=900
Mortgage calculator: Calculate your monthly payment	(NewsNation) — Mortgage rates are at their lowest level in two years — and could fall further — but interest payments are just one of the costs that come with a mortgage. Buyers also have to take into account property taxes and insurance — both of which contribute to the overall monthly payment. Social Security calculator: Figure out your monthly benefits The length of your mortgage, also known as the loan term, will also impact the size of your payment. Typically, a longer loan term means smaller monthly payments but higher interest costs, while a shorter loan term requires higher monthly payments but less interest over time. NewsNation has created a mortgage calculator to help you make sense of it all. Mortgage Calculator This calculator helps you estimate your monthly mortgage payment. It adds up the loan payment (principal + interest), property tax, and insurance. The loan payment is spread out over the years of your loan term. Loan Amount ($): This is the total amount you're borrowing from the bank. Annual Interest Rate (%): This is the yearly interest rate on your loan. Loan Term (years): This is how long you'll take to repay the loan. Annual Property Tax ($): This is the yearly tax you pay on your property. Annual Homeowners Insurance ($): This is the yearly cost to insure your home. Calculate Clear Monthly Payment Breakdown Principal and Interest: $ Property Tax: $ Homeowners Insurance: $ Total Estimated Monthly Payment: $ What goes into a monthly mortgage payment? The basic components of a monthly mortgage payment are PITI: Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance. Principal or Loan Amount: The amount you borrow from a lender to buy a home. Each month, a portion of your payment goes toward repaying that loan. Over time, those payments lower your mortgage balance until the loan is fully repaid. Annual Interest Rate: This is what the lender charges you for lending you money. When people refer to 'mortgage rates,' they're talking about the interest rate on a home loan. Part of your monthly payment goes toward paying interest, especially at the beginning of your mortgage because your loan balance is higher. Home mortgages: Here’s the difference between prequalified and preapproved Taxes or Annual Property Tax: Typically, your monthly mortgage payment will include property taxes, which are calculated by the government and based on your home's value. These payments are generally put in an escrow account and then your lender pays them on your behalf when they're due. Homeowner's insurance: This protects you and your lender if there's damage to your home, like a fire or burglary. Your mortgage payment usually includes one-twelfth of the annual cost, which goes into an escrow account. When your insurance is due, the lender pays from that account. Additionally, prospective homeowners may want to consider factoring private mortgage insurance into their monthly total. This is not included in NewsNation's calculator but can also be considered part of your overall mortgage costs. Private mortgage insurance: If your down payment is less than 20%, there's a good chance you'll have to pay for mortgage insurance, which protects the lender if you can't keep up with your monthly payments. As with property taxes and homeowners insurance, you'll pay one-twelfth of your annual premium each month into an escrow account. What are the different types of mortgages? Fixed-rate mortgages are the most common type of home loan. With fixed-rate mortgages, your interest rate doesn't change over time. That means your principal and interest payments will remain the same throughout the loan. 30-year fixed term: A home loan with a 30-year repayment period and by far the most common. According to Freddie Mac, 90% of homebuyers choose a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Due to the length of the loan, you'll pay more interest over time compared to shorter options. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.09% for the week ending Sept. 19. 15-year fixed term: A home loan that borrowers repay over 15 years. This will have higher monthly payments but you'll pay less interest over the life of the loan. You'll also get a better rate compared to a longer mortgage term. The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage was 5.15% for the week ending Sept. 19. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are another option for homebuyers. An ARM is a loan where the interest rate changes over the course of the loan. That means homeowners could see their monthly payments go up over time. Here’s what’s needed to buy a house How to get the best mortgage rate? There are several ways to set yourself up to get the best possible mortgage rate. Credit score: Generally, consumers with high credit scores receive lower interest rates than those with low credit scores. According to a recent Realtor.com report, improving your credit score from Bad (under 600 FICO) to Very Good (750–800) can lower your mortgage rate by 39 basis points. Down payment: Typically, the more money you put down, the better interest rate you can get. Putting at least 20% down can also help you avoid paying for mortgage insurance. Loan term: Longer loan terms usually come with higher interest rates, whereas a shorter-term loan, will come with higher monthly payments but less interest. Debt-to-income ratio: How much money you make can impact your mortgage rate. Borrowers with a low debt-to-income ratio, meaning their debt payment is a small portion of their monthly income, are generally considered lower risk. Shop around: Weighing your options can lead to big savings. Realtor.com found an average difference of 86 basis points between the least expensive and most expensive lenders.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/mortgage-calculator-payment/	2024-10-03T10:18:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66e4669d7c8a87.88527414.jpeg?w=900

If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673. (NewsNation) — This week the nation was stunned when Tony Buzbee, a Houston lawyer, announced he is representing 120 people — 60 men and 60 women — who say they have experienced sexual misconduct by Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. And the allegations were explosive. What we know about the Diddy investigation More Diddy allegations from lawyer Tony Buzbee Among the most explosive claims Buzbee made: One victim was just 9 years old. The child had been introduced to Combs in hopes of getting the minor a recording contract. '(The child) was taken to an audition in NYC at Bad Boy records ... this individual was sexually abused by Sean Combs and other people at the studio in the promise to both his parents and the boy of getting a record deal.' (Question from me: Why aren’t these parents being charged as well? Why didn’t they call the cops immediately? Why isn’t Child Protective Services involved?) Another minor was allegedly told Combs would make him a star, but needed to visit Combs privately without his parents. Combs allegedly made the victim perform oral sex. Another minor, 15, was allegedly flown to New York City to attend a party with drugs, and then taken to a private room in the presence of Combs where this female minor was (gang) raped. One woman, 26, was allegedly given one drink in Combs’ SUV, then woke up the next day not knowing what happened, but with pain and damage to both her vagina and anus. A pregnant woman refused alcoholic beverages at a dinner in Miami — but did have a nonalcoholic beverage, which according to her was laced with drugs. The woman 'blacked out, and woke up in the same bed allegedly with Combs in his mansion in Miami. Her vagina and anus were torn and sore.'

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File) More rumors swirl around alleged Diddy tapes These are just the allegations out there. I have heard from several sources that there is a video floating around with Combs having sex with a 'major' music star who was underage — as well as another Hollywood staple allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with multiple people. It’s seedy. It’s horrific. And even worse: The tapes are out. The lawyers are seeing them, and copies were made of Combs' vast porn library and they are being offered up at high prices. Diddy hires convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyer And the alleged perpetrators — the men who had sex with unconscious or drugged up victims — as well as the bodyguards who threatened the victims afterward, will also be named. As Buzbee said: 'I imagine there's a myriad of people who are nervous. You can't hide skeletons in the closet forever.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/diddy-accusations-alleged-video-abuse-major-star/	2024-10-03T08:57:26-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/09/6503437e82e024.50315127.jpeg?w=900
Human connections bring hope in North Carolina after devastation ...	BLACK MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) — Sarah Vekasi is a potter who runs a store in Black Mountain, North Carolina, called Sarah Sunshine Pottery, named after her normally bubbly personality. But these days she’s struggling with the trauma of Hurricane Helene and uncertainty about the future of her business. 'All I can say is that I’m alive. I’m not doing great. I’m not doing good. But I’m extremely grateful to be alive, especially when so many are not,' Vekasi said. One thing that makes her feel a little better is the fellowship of the daily town meeting at the square. 'It’s incredible being able to meet in person,' said Vekasi, who was cut off by impassible roads for days. At Wednesday’s session more than 150 people gathered as local leaders stood atop a picnic table shouting updates. In the midst of the devastating destruction left by the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina, human connections are giving the survivors hope in western North Carolina. While government cargo planes brought food and water into the hardest-hit areas and rescue crews waded through creeks searching for survivors, those who made it through the storm, whose death toll has topped 180, were leaning on one another. Martha Sullivan, also at the town meeting, was taking careful notes so she could share the information — roads reopened, progress in getting power restored, work on trying to get water flowing again — with others. Sullivan, who has lived in Black Mountain for 43 years, said her children invited her to come to Charlotte after the storm, but she wants to stay in her community and look after her neighbors. 'I’m going to stay as long as I feel like I’m being useful,' Sullivan said. Helping one another in the hardest-hit areas In remote mountain areas, helicopters hoisted the stranded to safety while search crews moved toppled trees so they could look door to door for survivors. In some places, homes teetered on hillsides and washed-out riverbanks. Electricity is being slowly restored, as the number of homes and businesses without power dipped below 1 million for the first time since last weekend, according to poweroutage.us. Most of the outages are in the Carolinas and Georgia, where Helene struck after barreling over Florida’s Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane. Deaths have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, in addition to the Carolinas. Robin Wynn lost power at her Asheville home early Friday and was able to grab a bag of canned goods and water before getting to a shelter despite water up to her knees. 'I didn’t know where I was going, didn’t know what was going to happen next. But I got out and I’m alive,' Wynn said on Wednesday. Now that she’s back home, her neighbors have been watching out for one another. Plenty of people have come around to make sure everyone has a hot meal and water, she said. Eric Williamson, who works at First Baptist Church in Hendersonville, normally makes home visits to members who can’t physically get to church. This week, he’s their lifeline, delivering food that meets dietary restrictions and tossing out food that had spoiled. Beyond checking in on the essentials, he says it’s important to just socialize with folks in a moment like this to help them know they aren’t alone. He has a handwritten list of everyone he needs to visit. 'They don’t have telephone service, even if they have a landline, a lot of that isn’t working,' Williamson said. 'So we're bringing them food and water, but also just bringing them a smile and a prayer with them just to give them comfort.' Volunteers in Asheville gathered on Wednesday before going out to help find people who have been unreachable because of phone and internet outages. They took along boxes of drinking water and instructions to return in person with their results. Even notifying relatives of people who died in the storm has been difficult. 'That has been our challenge, quite honestly, is no cell service, no way to reach out to next of kin,' said Avril Pinder, an official in Buncombe County where at least 61 people have died. 'We have a confirmed body count, but we don’t have identifications on everyone or next-of-kin notifications.' Thursday marks the seventh day of search and rescue operations, Pinder said, adding the county doesn’t have an official tally of people who are unaccounted for or missing. 'We’re continuing to find people. We know we have pockets of people who are isolated due to landslides and bridges out,' she said. 'So they are disconnected but not missing.' Biden and Harris get a firsthand look President Joe Biden flew over the devastation in North and South Carolina, getting a firsthand look at the mess left by a storm that now has killed at least 189 people. Speaking afterwards in Raleigh, North Carolina, Biden praised the Democratic governor of North Carolina and the Republican governor of South Carolina for their responses to the storm, saying that in the wake of disasters, 'we put politics aside.' 'Our job is to help as many people as we can as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can,' he said. That includes a commitment from the federal government to foot the bill for debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months. The money will address the impacts of landslides and flooding and will cover costs of first responders, search and rescue teams, shelters, and mass feeding. 'We’re not leaving until you’re back on your feet completely,' Biden said. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to neighboring Georgia, where she said the president had approved a request to pick up the tab for similar emergency aid there for three months. Biden plans on traveling to disaster areas in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. Devastation from Florida to Tennessee Employees at a plastics factory in rural Tennessee who kept working last week until water flooded their parking lot and power went out at the plant were among those killed. The floodwaters swept 11 workers away, and only five were rescued. Two are confirmed dead. Tennessee state authorities said they are investigating the company that owns the factory after some employees said they weren’t allowed to leave in time to avoid the storm’s impact. Hospitals and health care organizations in the Southeast mostly stayed open despite dealing with blackouts, wind damage, supply issues and flooding. Many hospitals halted elective procedures, while only a few closed completely. In Florida, officials were turning to 'low-risk' state prisoners to help clear the mountains of debris left behind. 'Department of Corrections, they do prison labor anyways. So they’re bringing them to do debris removal,' Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters on Wednesday. ___ Verduzco reported from Swannanoa, North Carolina, and Peterson from Hendersonville, North Carolina.

Daniel Penny, charged in death of Jordan Neely, due in court	(NewsNation) — Daniel Penny, who faces charges in connection to the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train, will be in court Thursday. The Marine veteran has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges. If convicted, Penny faces up to 20 years in prison. On May 1, the New York Police Department reported that Neely, a street performer who had been experiencing homelessness, boarded the F train in Manhattan and began acting erratically. Penny claims Neely was angry and talking to himself, which prompted him to intervene. Cellphone footage from those on the train shows Penny putting Neely in a chokehold and holding him down until he stopped moving and breathing. Officers arriving to the scene reported Neely was unconscious and he was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. David Brown disappeared while walking in Florida A medical examiner ruled Neely’s death a homicide due to 'compression of neck.' Attorney Donte Mills, who is representing Neely's family, previously told 'Dan Abrams Live' that Penny had 'no authority' to place someone in a chokehold. Mills said Penny was not attacked by his Neely. '(Penny) knew or should have known that choking him (Neely) for 15 minutes would kill him,' Mills said. 'I can’t tell you what was in his mind when he approached him.' Penny’s attorneys said their client 'never intended to harm' Neely and that he was just trying to protect others. Jury selection in the trial is set to begin Oct. 21.

Diddy hires convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried's lawyer	(NewsNation) — Sean 'Diddy' Combs is adding a new name to his legal representation as he fights the federal sex trafficking case he’s facing. The music mogul hired the same lawyer as his cellmate, former FTX CEO turned convict Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced this year to 25 years in prison for fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. Combs’ new lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, will help him appeal a judge’s decision to keep him detained in a Brooklyn jail while he awaits trial on sex trafficking and racketeering charges, among others. A Sept. 18 notice of appeal lists Shapiro as his counsel. What we know about the Diddy investigation Shapiro has represented Bankman-Fried since the fraudster’s conviction, filing a 102-page appeal for a new trial. Shapiro’s experience also includes clerking for former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Two judges rejected Combs’ $50 million bond offer citing the possibility of violence or witness tampering. He remains in the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center where he shares a cell with Bankman-Fried. It’s unclear whether the two discussed legal representation. The rapper was arrested Sept. 16. Since then, he has faced 120 new sexual misconduct allegations, which a lawyer saying he expects his clients to file civil lawsuits soon.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/diddy-hires-sam-bankman-fried-lawyer/	2024-10-03T06:14:24-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Diddy-Bankman-Fried-collage.jpg?w=900
Helene first responders resume search for missing, rescue survivo...	(NewsNation) — First responders have worked tirelessly in the wake of Helene and are running out of steam, many of them in action since the hurricane made landfall in the Southeast one week ago. While police and fire agencies in affected counties continue to receive help from organizations across the U.S., first responders have been working upward of 12-hour shifts or more per day. Woman recounts her rescue from river, husband’s death Helene's devastation After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled north. However, wind and rain still caused significant damage to several states, including Georgia and the Carolinas. One of the hardest-hit areas is western North Carolina, where Asheville and surrounding towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains experienced record-breaking floods. Following the storm, loss of power, water and cellphone service as well as damage to hundreds of roads left Asheville virtually cut off from the rest of the world. The town of Black Mountain, North Carolina, says its fire and police departments have been able to account for more than 90% of the town's residents, but they are still continuing to look for more. So far, the North Carolina National Guard said as of Thursday afternoon, its rescued over 450 people in 13 different countries. North Carolina's Department of Adult Corrections, meanwhile, had to evacuate and relocate more than 800 prisoners today due to Hurricane Helene damage. Death toll reportedly at 200 According to the Associated Press, 200 people have died from the storm so far, with 61 of those deaths in Buncombe County alone. The number is expected to rise as officials and volunteers continue searching for the missing. Helene’s health risks include contaminated water and mold: Doctors Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp provided an update on Helene's recovery Thursday, saying the storm did massive damage to the agriculture industry in the state. He said that the state declined federal assistance from the National Guard as they have had what they needed on a state level. However, the Biden administration has agreed to cover 100% of the state's cleanup cost for the first three months of recovery. So far, the federal government has provided more than $20 million to Hurricane Helene survivors. At least 33 people died in Georgia from the storm and about 200 people were severely impacted by the devastation, Kemp said. Road to recovery after Helene The Ohio Calcutta Fire Department, which traveled to assist affected areas, said its search and water team has teamed up with the Black Mountain Fire Department, National Guard and other law enforcement agencies in the area to conduct search-and-rescue missions. NASCAR driver Greg Biffle posted a video to social media Wednesday, showing a person stranded on the mountains who was able to use a mirror and the sun to get his attention. While search, rescue and recovery operations continue, several residents on the top of the mountains or in the valleys still don't have access to power, cutting them off from the rest of the world. Supplies have been airlifted in and delivered by mule train in some areas due to the difficult terrain and storm damage. Officials in Asheville have said it could be several weeks for critical services, including water, to be restored. In Asheville Thursday, groups of volunteers, many of whom who didn’t have power themselves, conducted welfare checks for people not able to get in touch with loved ones. 'We’re looking to make sure they’re OK, or are they ill? Do they need medicines? Do they need food? Or maybe even worse,' Mike Vernon, one volunteer, told NewsNation. One group said they had fielded 15,000 inquiries from people not able to get in touch with their loved ones. Nonprofits, charity groups and volunteers in other areas have also stepped up to make sure people cut off from society can get the supplies they need. 'We are so grateful,' Black Mountain, North Carolina resident Nancy McDaniel said. 'I think everyone, especially on our street, was in a panic because we didn’t know about the water and that was the worst.' McDaniel continued, 'It’s been devastating and inspiring at the same time. We are a mountain town that thrives on tourism and visitation. We are proud of our beautiful mountains here and its been so hard to see the devastation; but at the same time, I have never met so many of my neighbors and just seen how everybody comes to check on each other.' Altogether, people in Black Mountain and other areas affected by Helene are exhausted. Every day, the mountain community has a town meeting in the park to update people of the efforts being conducted in the wake of Helene. Emotions remain high as many have lost everything, the death toll hits close to home and many witness their community nearly destroyed. Factory under investigation after employees swept away in flooding Biden and Harris' firsthand look President Joe Biden flew over the devastation in North and South Carolina on Wednesday, getting a firsthand look at the mess left by a storm that now has killed around 200 people. Speaking afterward in Raleigh, North Carolina, Biden praised the Democratic governor of North Carolina and the Republican governor of South Carolina for their responses to the storm, saying that in the wake of disasters, 'we put politics aside.' 'Our job is to help as many people as we can as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can,' he said.

The money will address the impacts of landslides and flooding and will cover the costs of first responders, search-and-rescue teams, shelters and mass feeding. 'We’re not leaving until you’re back on your feet completely,' Biden said. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to neighboring Georgia, where she said the president had approved a request to pick up the tab for similar emergency aid there for three months. Biden also went to disaster areas in Georgia and Florida on Thursday.

Israeli strike in Beirut kills 7 as troops fight in southern Leba...	(NewsNation) — Tensions in the Middle East show no signs of simmering with Israel’s latest airstrike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut that killed seven health and rescue workers overnight into early Thursday morning. This is the latest development in Israel’s ground operations in efforts to weaken Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist militant group. The target was a multistory apartment building that houses an office for civilian first responders affiliated with Hezbollah, the Associated Press reported. The airstrike was the closest strike to the central downtown district of Beirut, where the United Nations and government offices are located. Last week, Israel conducted an airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, which added fuel to an already growing fire of cross-border tension. Iran, which heavily backs Hezbollah, launched nearly 200 missiles Tuesday in retaliation for the killing of Nasrallah, as well as Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July.

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla) The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday to address the events of what could lead to a possible regional war. Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the council the missile strike targeting Israel was 'a necessary and proportionate response to Israel’s continued terrorist aggressive acts over the past two months.' Israel and Hezbollah have a long history of hostility and violence. Hezbollah was formed in 1982 in response to the 15-year Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Western states and Israel consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the group has major political power in Lebanon’s national elections and operates schools, hospitals, charities and other entities. The current regional conflict broke out after Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist militant group, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — the deadliest attack in Israeli history. Israel declared war and invaded Gaza the next day. At the same time, Hezbollah started firing at Israel in support of Gaza, forcing a cross-border conflict. The first anniversary of the attack that killed 1,200 people is four days away. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s latest missile attack on Israel failed.

'The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies.' Southern Turkey welcomed Lebanese evacuees on a ferry Thursday following the Beirut airstrike. Israel's military forces have been actively operating in southern Lebanon as they attempt to damage Hezbollah's infrastructure. People are leaving Lebanon out of fear for their safety, and almost two dozen countries are working together for a possible evacuation of citizens, Reuters reported. Japan has readied its military jets for evacuations of Japanese citizens from Lebanon, while Australia has planned evacuation flights for its Australian citizens, the AP reported. In Israel, schools are closed as the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah began Wednesday and runs through Friday, but people are on edge as the area braces for a response from Iran. Emergency sirens are going off about every hour in northern Israel, according to NewsNation’s Robert Sherman, who is on the ground reporting. On Monday, President Joe Biden said the U.S. is prepared to help Israel defend against the Iranian missile attack, but by Wednesday, he told reporters 'no,' he does not support an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites should Israel retaliate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israeli-strike-beirut-troops-southern-lebanon/	2024-10-03T03:34:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24277269610508.jpg?w=900
Advocates demand policy changes as migrant deaths hit record numb...	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – Immigration advocates are calling for asylum restrictions between ports of entry to be relaxed, as migrants placing their lives in the hands of smugglers are dying in record numbers here. A total of 176 migrants died in canals, mountains and the desert in El Paso and southern New Mexico in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024. That’s 27 more than the previous record of 149 deceased migrants border agents encountered in FY 2023. Volunteers want sheriff to pick up human remains found in desert 'It’s heartbreaking,' said Alan Lizarraga, a spokesman for the Border Network for Human Rights. 'There is a lot of frustration to know that person was a father, a mother, somebody’s son or uncle. People arriving here are people who have families, people who work hard and have dreams. Sadly, when they arrive at the border they become just another number.' BNHR and the Hope Border Institute say they noticed a steep increase in migrant fatalities after the White House on June 4 issued an executive order banning most foreign nationals from applying for asylum if they came into the country between ports of entry. Biden administration expands asylum restrictions at southern border The federal government is now requiring asylum-seekers to make an online appointment at a port of entry through the CBP One app. But activists say the app has issues and that many vulnerable populations stuck in Mexico don't have the means to survive for long periods of time and are exposed to extortion, kidnapping and assault by criminals. That’s why they get desperate and seek to enter the U.S. by any means available as soon as possible. Lizarraga said the high number of fatalities 'represents the horrors and cruelty of our immigration system and of the operations that are happening in our southern border. People migrating are being met with harsh words, force (and) concertina wire.' Texas doubles down on razor wire, fencing facing New Mexico He was referring not only to the asylum ban between ports of entry but also the State of Texas' Operation Lone Star, which has deployed thousands of soldiers, Department of Public Safety troopers and miles of razor wire to the border. This summer, most migrant deaths occurred in the mountains and desert of southern New Mexico. Many took place in the busy migrant smuggling corridor west of Mount Cristo Rey in Sunland Park, New Mexico, and the Columbus Highway (NM State Road 9). Border Patrol agent bitten in face during assault on Mount Cristo Rey 'It was very unfortunate to see that number go up in the summer, especially after the new asylum proclamation was announced in June,' said Aimee Santillan, policy analyst for Hope Border Institute. 'And we saw a huge increase in the number of people that are coming through the desert, trying not to be detected by Border Patrol.' The fatalities reflect that vulnerable populations are putting themselves in harm’s way because they see little alternatives, she said. A group of volunteers who have located multiple remains in the desert of New Mexico say half the victims were women. Students, volunteers help fingerprint migrant remains with hopes of identifying them Others may have been part of a larger group that got left behind by smugglers for not being able to keep up or perhaps after suffering an injury or a fall. Border agents have told Border Report in the past many of the migrants they apprehend are malnourished and haven’t been given sufficient water at stash houses where they are kept across the border prior to being helped over the U.S. border wall. Santillan called for expanded legal pathways so that migrants can approach the U.S. border without resorting to smugglers, and improvements to the CBP One app. Trump warns he’ll expel migrants under key Biden immigration programs 'There are a number of issues with CBP One: Giving appointments at random times, making people wait for long periods of time, language barriers and other factors the app does not account for. It’s just a recipe for this kind of death crisis that we are seeing,' Santillan said. The Hope Border Institute say the death toll this year would have been higher if not for the efforts of first responders like the El Paso Fire Department, the Sunland Park Fire Department, and federal agencies monitoring the border. Smugglers on TikTok: ‘We cross you into the US, 100% guaranteed’ The Border Patrol, for instance, has rescued 981 migrants in harm’s way in the El Paso Sector since Oct. 1, 2023. U.S. Customs and Border Protection last month deployed a tethered aerostat with long-range cameras in Santa Teresa to detect groups that come over the border wall and anyone who may be wondering the desert. Visit the BorderReport.com homepage for the latest exclusive stories and breaking news about issues along the U.S.-Mexico border 'I want to acknowledge the incredible work that local first responders in El Paso, in Doña Ana County and New Mexico in general to respond to calls of crisis,' Santillan said. 'Through conversations with them and conversations with Border Patrol we know they are understaffed and underfunded when it comes to search and rescue operations. They just don’t have enough trained staff to assist people dying of heat exposure at 107 degrees. 'The border needs more resources.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/advocates-demand-policy-changes-as-migrant-deaths-hit-record-number/	2024-10-03T02:26:51-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/IMG_1695-1.jpg?w=900
Trump on Springfield Haitian migrants: 'They have to be removed'	Download our NewsNation app for 24/7 fact-based, unbiased coverage. HOUSTON (NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump exclusively told NewsNation in an interview Wednesday he would revoke the temporary protected status for Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, and ensure their return to Haiti. The Republican nominee was at a private fundraiser in Texas when he addressed the situation in Springfield, telling NewsNation border reporter Ali Bradley that 32,000 Haitian migrants had been relocated to a community of 52,000 residents. Trump told NewsNation he believes Haiti would accept the migrants back under his leadership. 'It has nothing to do with Haiti or anything else. You have to remove the people, and you have to bring them back to their own country,' he said. 'Springfield is such a beautiful place. Have you seen what's happened to it? It's been overrun. You can't do that to people. I'd revoke (the protected status), and I'd bring (the migrants) back to their country.' Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues The comments come after Trump's running mate, Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, revisited false claims he made about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio eating pets, saying now he is 'concerned for the American citizens' in the city. 'In Springfield, and communities across this country, you have schools that are overwhelmed, housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,' Vance said while debating Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, his Democratic opponent, in the election's only vice presidential debate. Former President Donald Trump spoke with Ali Bradley, who leads NewsNation’s daily coverage of the border. Follow Ali on X and click here to download the NewsNation app to see exclusive reporting from the border every day. Trump calls Jack Smith filing ‘pure election interference’ Enabling and protecting border law enforcement The former president told NewsNation he would enable local law enforcement to execute what he calls the largest deportation in American history and potentially deploy military forces to combat drug cartels. Trump said border agents 'know everything about [migrants] ... they know the good ones, the bad ones, and they're going to get them out.' Addressing cartel violence along the southern border, Trump proposed a 'military operation' to counter increasingly sophisticated tactics by Mexican drug organizations, which reportedly now employ drone jammers and have been found with rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices near the border. 'They're very rich, and they're very evil,' Trump said of the cartels. 'We're going to have to get in some military action. … They're killing 300,000 people a year.' Two Mexican drug cartels have helped flood the United States with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 80 times stronger than morphine that’s killing over 200 Americans daily, authorities say. Exclusive: Mexican cartels using devices to disrupt U.S. drones The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have established a sophisticated supply chain, sourcing precursor chemicals from China and manufacturing fentanyl in clandestine Mexican labs before smuggling it across the U.S. border, according to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports. Mexican drug cartels operating along the U.S.-Mexico border are using electronic devices to disrupt drones being used by U.S. border officials to track immigrants who crossed into the United States illegally, NewsNation learned. In September 2023, Border Patrol agents in Texas discovered a backpack with what appeared to be cannonball-sized IEDs. It wasn't the first time the U.S. government had found potential explosive devices at the border. In May 2023, NewsNation reported border officials recovered a rudimentary device created using an M&amp;M container that was bound with electrical tape. The former president also praised GOP Texas Governor Greg Abbott's border initiatives but maintained that border security ultimately requires federal action, stating, 'All you have to do if you're the president is say to the Border Patrol and to the states, 'Nobody come in, it's closed.'' Trump predicted he would win New Mexico because of the southern border. Trump lost the state in 2020 by about 11 points and in 2016 by about 8 points. Houston teens carjack driver to smuggle migrants How many people are crossing the border? U.S. Border Patrol arrests along the Southwest border rose slightly from July to August but remained among the Biden administration’s lowest monthly numbers. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, agents had 58,038 encounters between ports of entry in August, up from 56,399 in July. The actual number of encounters at America’s borders is expected to reach about 10 million by the end of the fiscal year, including repeat crossings and deportations. These encounters include repeat crossings and deportations, which means the actual number of unique individuals entering the country is much lower. Walz, Vance spar on immigration ‘The largest deportation effort in American history’ One of Trump’s key promises if reelected is to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history. He made similar promises when he first ran for office, but during his administration, deportations never topped 350,000. For comparison, then-President Barack Obama carried out 432,000 deportations in 2013, the highest annual total since records were kept. This time, Trump has given some more specifics on his promises. He said he’ll use the National Guard to round up migrants. And he said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with. He’s also vowed to kick out hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have entered the country under two key Biden administration programs if he’s reelected. Any mass deportation plans would certainly be challenged in court and be enormously expensive to carry out. And it would depend on countries' willingness to take back their citizens. Trump also said he would bring back policies he had put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42. Remain in Mexico made migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard, while Title 42 curbed immigration on public health grounds. He has said he’ll revive and expand a travel ban from his term that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and pledged new 'ideological screening' for immigrants to bar 'dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots and maniacs.' Trump also seeks to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally. DHS increases time for new asylum regulations Why is the border a top voter issue? Making the border safer and other immigration-related issues remain among the biggest concerns for voters heading into the 2024 election. Trump has used the border as a backdrop for a series of campaign stops in recent months. Trump has repeatedly criticized President Joe Biden and Harris, claiming that the president and his 'border czar' are to blame for the steady amounts of migrants and for the trouble that Trump has alleged has come specifically from the illegal border crossings. The president has countered with the effectiveness of his executive order, which led to a drop in the number of border encounters after a record 250,000 encounters were reported in December 2023 alone. There has been a significant drop in encounters between federal agents assigned to the U.S.-Mexico border and immigrants who have entered the country illegally. Political gridlock on border policy In June 2024, Biden released a series of executive actions capping migrant crossing until border encounters remain consistently low — under 2,500 per day for an entire week — to give Border Patrol more time to handle each migrant’s situation. The president also clarified his use of executive powers, saying he was doing what Congress would not about a bipartisan immigration deal that failed in the Senate after Trump urged GOP lawmakers to vote against it.

Trump calls Jack Smith filing 'pure election interference'	This is a developing story. Refresh for updates. Download our NewsNation app for 24/7 fact-based unbiased coverage. HOUSTON (NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump called the unsealing of documents in his election interference case a 'weaponization of the government' during an exclusive interview with NewsNation on Wednesday in Houston, Texas. The Republican nominee was at a private fundraiser when he told NewsNation's Ali Bradley that special counsel Jack Smith is a 'deranged person' following the dismissal of his classified documents case. 'This was a weaponization of the government ... and released 30 days before the election,' Trump said. 'My poll numbers have gone up instead of down. It is pure election interference.' The interview came after prosecutors in a court filing unsealed Wednesday said Trump 'resorted to crimes' after losing the 2020 election by disregarding the advice of his vice president and other aides. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues The filing was submitted by Smith’s team following a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office, narrowing the scope of the prosecution charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the results of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. 'So what?' the filing quotes Trump as telling an aide after being alerted that his vice president, Mike Pence, was in potential danger after a crowd of violent supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Earlier on Truth Social, Trump alleged the documents were unsealed a day after the vice presidential debate so that the news coverage would not focus on 'Tim Walz’s disastrous debate performance.' The first and only vice presidential debate between Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was largely civil, with each vice presidential candidate sharing their thoughts on how their running mate may govern. 'The people know it, I know it, everybody knows it,' Trump told NewsNation in alleging Democrats are trying to rig the 2024 election. The release of the documents 'is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine and Weaponize American Democracy, and INTERFERE IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,' he said on Truth Social. The filing from Smith’s team offers the most comprehensive view to date of what prosecutors intend to prove if the case charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the election reaches trial. Though a monthslong congressional investigation and the indictment itself have chronicled in stark detail Trump’s efforts to undo the election, the new filing cites previously unknown accounts offered by Trump’s closest aides to paint a portrait of an 'increasingly desperate' president who while losing his grip on the White House 'used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process.' The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-jack-smith-pure-election-interference/	2024-10-02T17:47:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/trump-3-exclusive.jpg?w=900
Exclusive: Mexican cartels using devices to disrupt U.S. drones	(NewsNation) — Mexican drug cartels operating along the U.S.-Mexico border are using electronic devices to disrupt drones being used by U.S. border officials to track immigrants who crossed into the United States illegally, NewsNation has learned. Members of Cartel del Noreste are using the disruptors to interfere with efforts to secure the southern border. An alert, sent out borderwide by U.S. Border Patrol officials and obtained by NewsNation, indicates that the transnational criminal organization is using the devices to counter American drones being used along the border. Houston teens carjack driver to smuggle migrants Border officials say that the devices being used by the cartel can detect nearby unmanned aircraft systems. The devices can intercept the signal between the drone and its operator. According to the alert, the loss of signal will result in aircraft failure and will cause the drone to crash. The drone jammers being used by the cartel send strong signals to the same frequencies as those being used by drone operators. That, in turn, drowns out the communications between the drone operator and the aircraft they are controlling. The loss in communication causes the drone to either run out of control or lose all functionality. The jammers can be stationary devices or can be mounted or be built into gunlike devices, border officials warn. They can also radiate their signal in a cone shape or 360 degrees. Border officials say that the most effective devices being used by the cartels can be used effectively from about a mile away and become more effective the farther away the drone operator’s remote becomes from the aircraft. DHS increases amount of time asylum regulations at Southwest border in effect Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol Union, called the alert a 'knee-jerk reaction' to something that the agency should have already been monitoring. 'Here we have a bulletin that goes out that says, be careful,' Judd told NewsNation. 'Well, they should be careful anyway.' Drones are used by various U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the Border Patrol, Texas Department of Public Safety and others. However, those devices are being used strictly for surveillance purposes. Once in the air, the drones can detect where immigrants who have crossed the border illegally along with smugglers are located. The cartels can use drone jammers to disrupt those aircraft, which demonstrates to Judd that the cartels are using better technology than U.S. officials because they do not have to adhere to budget restrictions.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/mexican-cartels-drones/	2024-10-02T15:05:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66aaf5b704e464.03166595.jpeg?w=900
Prosecutors: Trump 'resorted to crimes' after losing 2020 electio...	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump 'resorted to crimes' after losing the 2020 election, federal prosecutors said in a court filing unsealed Wednesday that argues that the former president disregarded the advice of his vice president and other aides and is not entitled to immunity from prosecution over his failed bid to remain in power. The filing was submitted by special counsel Jack Smith's team following a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take in office, narrowing the scope of the prosecution charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the results of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The purpose of the brief is to convince U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that the offenses charged in the indictment are private, rather than official, acts and can therefore remain part of the indictment as the case moves forward. 'Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,' Smith’s team said, adding, 'When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office.' Those include efforts to persuade former Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the counting of the electoral votes on the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021. The filing includes details of conversations between Trump and Pence, including a private lunch the two had on Nov. 12, 2020, in which Pence 'reiterated a face-saving option' for Trump, telling him, 'don’t concede but recognize the process is over,' according to prosecutors. In another private lunch days later, Pence urged Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024. 'I don’t know, 2024 is so far off,' Trump told him, according to the filing. But Trump 'disregarded' Pence 'in the same way he disregarded dozens of court decisions that unanimously rejected his and his allies’ legal claims, and that he disregarded officials in the targeted states — including those in his own party — who stated publicly that he had lost and that his specific fraud allegations were false,' prosecutors wrote. Trump’s 'steady stream of disinformation' in the weeks after the election culminated in his speech at the Ellipse on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, in which Trump 'used these lies to inflame and motivate the large and angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and disrupt the certification proceeding,' prosecutors wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/ap-prosecutors-trump-resorted-to-crimes-after-losing-2020-election-in-failed-bid-to-cling-to-power/	2024-10-02T13:22:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/66fda571dc5004.51096749.jpeg?w=900
How much do longshoremen make?	(NewsNation) — Major ports are at a near standstill from Maine to Texas as tens of thousands of dockworkers strike over wages and the use of automation. Members of the International Longshoremen's Association, or ILA, which represents roughly 45,000 workers, walked off the job Tuesday after they were unable to reach a new labor contract with port employers. It’s the first time the union has been on strike since 1977 — a standoff that could cost the U.S. economy $540 million per day. The president could invoke a 1947 law to try to suspend the dockworkers’ strike. Here’s how The ILA is asking for significant wage hikes and a total ban on automated cranes, gates and container-moving trucks. 'We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,' ILA President Harold Daggett said in a social media post. Here's how much longshoremen currently make and what they're asking for going forward. Some panic buying reported amid dockworkers strike How much do longshoremen make? Under the contract that expired Monday, top-scale portworkers earned a base pay of $39 an hour, or just over $81,000 a year. That rate applied to workers with at least six years of service. The starting pay for dockworkers was $20 an hour, which rose to $24.75 after two years and $31.90 after four years. However, many longshoremen make much more with overtime and other benefits. A 2019-2020 report by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor said about a third of longshoremen based there made at least $200,000 a year, and more than half earned over $150,000. Though not the norm, 59 dockworkers brought in more than $400,000 that year, according to the report. The ILA points out that many workers operate multimillion-dollar container-handling equipment for 'a mere $20 an hour' and says most members are constantly on call. 'They work extraordinary hours, sacrificing time with their families,' the union said in a statement. Daggett made over $900,000 last year — $728,000 from the ILA and an additional $173,000 for being the president emeritus of ILA Local 1804-1, according to union filings with the Department of Labor. West Coast dockworkers have a separate union from East Coast workers. They agreed to a new six-year contract last year, which included a 32% raise, Reuters reported. According to The New York Times, West Coast longshore workers make nearly $55 an hour, earning an average of nearly $220,000 last year. What is the union asking for? The union is demanding a 77% raise over six years — a $5 increase per hour for each year of the contract. That means the top-scale hourly rate could reach $69 by 2030 — over $140,000 a year. 'Our members feel underappreciated, especially given the sacrifices they made during the pandemic, keeping ports open and the economy moving,' the union said in a statement Monday. 'The wage increases in the previous contract were rendered meaningless by rising inflation.' The ILA is also asking for better benefits and a ban on automation over concerns that new technology will threaten jobs. The union said foreign-owned ocean carriers 'continue to make record profits' and are imposing 'outrageous surcharges on consumers.' The U.S. Maritime Alliance, the group negotiating for the ports, said it's offered a nearly 50% wage increase and called the strike 'completely avoidable' in a statement. The ILA has rejected that offer and said it doesn't address worker demands. The union reiterated that it's against any form of automation that replaces jobs or historical work functions.

Kamala Harris backs striking port workers, knocks Trump	(The Hill) -- Vice President Kamala Harris voiced her support Wednesday for striking port workers while bashing her rival former President Donald Trump after tens of thousands of longshoremen at ports along the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico walked off the job. 'This strike is about fairness. Foreign-owned shipping companies have made record profits and executive compensation has grown. The Longshoremen, who play a vital role transporting essential goods across America, deserve a fair share of these record profits,' Harris said in a statement. The president could invoke a 1947 law to try to suspend the dockworkers’ strike. Here’s how She quickly turned to Trump, saying he 'wants to pull us back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize,' arguing that he makes 'empty promises' to workers but 'never delivers.' The United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) and the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) failed to reach a new labor agreement by the deadline on Tuesday, leading to the first strike by the port workers’ union in nearly 50 years. The union has demanded wage increases and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and container-moving trucks. The USMX said Monday evening that it had 'traded counteroffers related to wages' with the ILA. Bill O’Reilly: JD Vance succeeded by making ‘himself human’ at debate Harris, in her statement, repeated a line from her rallies, saying Trump cares more about skyscraper owners than the workers who built the buildings. And, she touted the PRO Act, which is the pro-labor legislation that President Joe Biden has also called for Congress to pass. 'He thinks our economy should only work for those who own the big skyscrapers, not those who actually build them,' Harris said, referring to Trump. 'As President, I will have workers’ backs and finally pass the PRO Act. And I will fight for an opportunity economy — where every person has the chance not just to get by but to get ahead.' Some panic buying reported amid dockworkers strike Biden on Tuesday called for the striking workers to get an increase in wages, urging USMX to come to the table and present an offer to the workers that ensures they are paid fairly. The strike raises political obstacles for Biden and Harris and has real consequences for the U.S. and international economy, costing as much as $5 billion per day and impacting both exports and imports.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/kamala-harris-longshoremen-strike/	2024-10-02T10:54:37-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/harriskamala_091224ap01_w-e1727888796687.jpg?w=900
Eric Adams to appear in court on bribery, fraud charges	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to appear in court Wednesday after being indicted on bribery and fraud charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Adams is alleged to have accepted around $100,000 worth of flights, hotel stays, meals and entertainment that were given to him for free or at a steep discount. Those are said to have occurred on international trips, most of which Adams took before he was elected mayor. Prosecutors say a senior Turkish diplomatic official and Turkish businesspeople arranged the bribes, hoping to gain influence with Adams. Some panic buying reported amid dockworkers strike The indictment also accused Adams of receiving illegal campaign donations from foreign sources who aren't allowed to contribute to U.S. political candidates. In exchange, prosecutors say Adams helped Turkey open a new diplomatic facility in the city, overriding concerns from the fire department about the building's ability to pass safety inspections. Adams has denied the allegations and said the trips and his work on the building were both routine actions and were not improper. He has also suggested prosecutors improperly leaked information to the media and is asking the judge to investigate. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denied any efforts to meddle in U.S. politics.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/eric-adams-appear-court/	2024-10-02T07:12:01-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24270549143810.jpg?w=900
Frontlines with Robert Sherman: Riding out Iran's Attack	NewsNation National Correspondent Robert Sherman has found himself on the frontlines of some of the world’s biggest stories: from Ukraine to Israel and across the United States. He shares what he’s seeing on the ground. Subscribe to his newsletter: Frontlines with Robert Sherman here. I knew right from the get-go this attack from Iran was going to be different than anything we had seen. Over the past year, I’ve personally witnessed countless rocket attacks on cities like Tel Aviv, Ashkelon and Sderot coming from Gaza. They were so common in the early aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks that you inevitably developed a routine. Sirens blare, you run into a bomb shelter, sit there for five to 10 minutes, then resume your day. The moment the announcement was made Iran was preparing a ballistic missile strike on Israel, a thick cloud of anxiety formed over all of Israel. The leadership here was telling people to avoid gathering in public and to not stray too far from a bomb shelter. Millions knew right away this would be no ordinary strike. Then came the alerts on our phone that the attack was launched. My phone has never pinged in such an incessant manner as I watched every community in Israel — North, South, large and small — put on notice. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Decision Desk '24 Campaign View Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } I was stationed in Haifa, where I waited the 10-15 minutes for those Iranian missiles to travel into our line of sight and watched as they crossed over Syria. Some were intercepted quickly, emitting large orbs of explosions in the sky — similar to the way fireworks ignite the Fourth of July night. But of course, these were weapons of war and not some kind of celebratory display. We had one of the first views of the attack from northern Israel, though it was cities like Tel Aviv that received the brunt of the targets. Many of the missiles were intercepted by Israel’s air defense systems, but there were plenty of impacts — far more than Israelis are accustomed to seeing. With help from many of Israel’s partners including the United States, the attack was largely repelled. National security adviser Jake Sullivan even called it 'defeated and ineffective.' At this hour, only one death has been reported: a Palestinian man in the West Bank. How to register to vote But make no mistake about it: We are not talking about a past-tense episode in the Middle East. We are very much living in a present-tense world rife with uncertainty. This morning, the area just north of us was targeted by one of Iran’s proxies, Hezbollah, with a large rocket barrage. In the early afternoon here, alerts sounded multiple times in communities spread out across northern Israel, also due to Iran’s proxy in Lebanon. And of course, the elephant in the room. There are highly consequential conversations taking place across Israel, including in the Israeli War Cabinet, largely revolving around one question: How will Israel respond to Iran’s attack? The Israel Defense Forces says it is operating at its highest level of alertness. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to not let this action go unpunished. 'This evening, Iran made a big mistake – and it will pay for it,' Netanyahu said Tuesday night after the missile attack. 'The regime in Tehran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to exact a price from our enemies.' Iran, in turn, has said it will retaliate should Israel make a move against it. 'Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue,' the country’s mission to the U.N. posted on X. And in the interim, the IDF’s operations in Southern Lebanon are continuing. Millions around the globe will be watching these next few hours in the Middle East hoping a regional war can be avoided. But to many in Israel, after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, a year of strikes from Hezbollah and the ramping up of the Houthis’ efforts out of Yemen — all of which are Iranian proxies — this attack by Iran further solidified in their minds what they’ve already believed: War with Iran is not around the corner — it’s already been here.

JD Vance 'made himself human' during the vice presidential debate, doing a great service to the Republican ticket, Bill O’Reilly told NewsNation on Tuesday. O’Reilly praised Vance's performance, saying the senator 'did his ticket more good than Walz did his.' 'What JD Vance accomplished is that he made himself human, unlike Donald Trump, who never does that,' he said. 'And he made himself accessible.' Vance squared off with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in the first and likely only vice presidential debate, which was hosted by CBS News. Who won Vance-Walz debate? The Republican freshman senator from Ohio, and the two-term Democratic governor of Minnesota got the chance to introduce themselves, make the case for their running mates, and go on the attack against the opposing ticket. The two faced each other on a number of issues, including the economy, border control and reproductive rights. Though he thinks Vance won, O'Reilly said, 'Walz wasn’t bad.' 'I’d invite him to Thanksgiving dinner, but he wouldn't get dessert' because he would be 'tedious,' O’Reilly said. O’Reilly agreed that the pair had a 'much better' time than the September presidential debate, but he lamented that both Vance and Walz 'still dodged' questions.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/oreilly-vance-succeeded-by-making-himself-human-at-vp-debate/	2024-10-01T21:21:48-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276040453208.jpg?w=900
Who won Vance-Walz debate?	(NewsNation) — The first and only vice presidential debate of the 2024 election has come to a close, and political experts joined NewsNation to discuss the format, content and how the candidates stacked up against each other. The debate between Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was very civil, with each vice presidential candidate sharing their thoughts on how their running mate may govern. Trump rips Walz, CBS moderators in debate’s opening 15 minutes The pair had traded barbs in the past, with former President Donald Trump‘s running mate questioning Walz’s military record and liberal leanings. Meanwhile, Walz — who Kamala Harris selected as her running mate just weeks after taking up the mantle from President Joe Biden — has jabbed Vance for his statements about childless cat ladies and school shootings. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues Vance vs. Walz debate overview The 90-minute debate featured unmuted microphones and no fact-checking by CBS moderators, Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, according to the network. There will be two four-minute breaks. Policy took center stage: The debate unfolded in a campaign defined by harsh, personal attacks and historic convulsions, including a candidate dropping out and two attempted assassinations. The heated tone was mostly replaced by deep policy discussions, with the candidates sometimes saying they agreed with each other Both men acknowledged past missteps: Vance was asked to address his past biting criticisms of the former president, including once suggesting Trump would be 'America’s Hitler.' Walz, meanwhile, was pressed on his misleading claim that he was in Hong Kong during the turbulence surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Will there be another debate? There are no upcoming debates on the calendar for Vance and Walz or Trump and Harris. JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views O'Reilly: Vance won, 'made himself human' Bill O'Reilly said he thought the vice president candidates did 'OK' but that they 'still dodged' important questions. 'There's not enough thinking about the audience in these debates. The candidates are thinking about themselves, and the moderators are thinking about themselves,' O'Reilly said. Ultimately, O'Reilly said he thinks the GOP vice presidential candidate did more for his ticket than Walz did. 'What JD Vance accomplished was he made himself human,' O’Reilly added. 'Unlike Donald Trump, who never does that. And he made himself accessible.' Though he thinks Vance won, he said, 'Walz wasn’t bad.' Walz started off nervous, later 'flipped it' on Vance: Stirewalt Stirewalt pointed out how nervous Walz appeared to be but said he later 'flipped it on Vance.' 'That poor guy (Walz) was so nervous, but he eventually settled in. For the first hour, Vance had him. He walked him like a dog,' Sitrewalt said. 'At the very end, Walz did flip it on Vance.' Stirewalt referenced when Vance dodged the question about certifying the 2024 election. When asked if he would challenge the 2024 election results, even if every governor certified their state’s results, Vance did not clarify what he would do. 'My own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues, peacefully in the public square,' Vance said. He emphasized that Trump 'peacefully' transferred power on Jan. 20, 2021, despite what happened Jan. 6. Overall, the pace of the event was 'very incremental,' but that may be for the better, Stirelwat said. '(It’s) quite pleasant to have a normal conversation between two human beings who seem to have done some homework … Can you imagine, policy actually coming into the discussion? Good for them,' Stirewalt said. Abrams said that, despite unfavorable polling numbers toward the Ohio senator, Vance was empathetic and measured. The candidates’ consistently kind approach to each other, Cuomo added, was refreshing to see. 'Boy, was it clear that both men there weren’t looking to make you hate somebody else,' he said. 'And we did not see that in the presidential debate.' Cuomo: Walz would be more likeable than Harris NewsNation's Chris Cuomo said he didn't think Walz had a great night but thought that 'if they had a real primary, Walz would be more likable to a lot of Democrats than Kamala Harris.'

JD Vance and Tim Walz spar over Trump and Harris economic policie...	(NewsNation) —The vice presidential candidates both defended their running mates in a back and forth during their first and likely only debate Tuesday. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who has been tapped by Vice President Kamala Harris to run on Democratic ticket, touted her economic plan saying it would redistribute money back to the middle class. 'Kamala and I believe in the middle class,' Walz said, adding that her plan includes more housing assistance, drug price fairness, tax cuts for middle class and getting businesses off the ground. 'We will ask the wealthy to pay their fair share.' Walz also slammed Trump saying he created the largest trade deficit with China during his presidency. 'Trump's plan would lead to a recession.' Republican nominee Donald Trump’s pick, JD Vance shot back at Walz saying Harris 'had the chance to make things better, but didn't,' when it came to the economy. Harris policies 'make life unaffordable for Americans,' he said. He defended Trump's economic plans saying they will 'deliver highest take-home pay' and make 'groceries affordable again' for all Americans. Vance pushed that the U.S. needs to get back to 'common sense' economic policies. The debate in New York hosted by CBS News gave Vance, a Republican freshman senator from Ohio, and Walz, a two-term Democratic governor of Minnesota, the chance to introduce themselves, make the case for their running mates, and go on the attack against the opposing ticket. Walz’s economic record includes passing tax cuts for Minnesotans while maintaining a balanced budget in the state. He also has a record that includes investments in infrastructure and community college programs as well as supporting a transition to green energy. He has also advocated for paid family and medical leave. Among his other accomplishments as governor, Walz also signed a $2.3 billion education budget into law, which provided 'students free breakfast and lunch at school, created thousands of new pre-K seats, expanded access to mental health resources for students, and made significant investments to improve child literacy.' Vance, Trump’s campaign partner, has built a brand on economic populism, diverting from the GOP’s traditional pro-business platform. Vance partnered with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to crack down on big banks. Abroad, Vance has made his stance on the war in Ukraine clear, opting to reject any U.S. aid for the country. He was also a key figure in the unsuccessful attempt to block a $60 billion supplemental aid package to Ukraine.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/jd-vance-tim-walz-spar-trump-harris-economy/	2024-10-01T19:46:36-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276066615746.jpg?w=900
Vance returns to Springfield, Ohio, 'illegal immigrant' fear rhet...	(NewsNation) —Republican Ohio senator JD Vance doubled down on controversial comments he’s made about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he is 'concerned for the American citizens' in the city during the vice presidential debate Tuesday. 'In Springfield, and communities across this country, you have schools that are overwhelmed, housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,' Vance said while debating Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. 'The people I'm worried about in Springfield are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris' open border.' When corrected by the moderators that the Haitian immigrants in the city are legal under the Temporary Protected Status program, Vance went on a tangent discussing immigration laws. Vance faced a slew of criticism for repeating false allegations that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating neighbor’s pets. Last month, Vance made a series of posts and statements about the Haitian immigrant population in Springfield, Ohio. He posted on X, without evidence, that Springfield has experienced 'a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime.' Later he said his office 'has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants,' adding, 'It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.' Following Vance’s initial post, the internet subsequently exploded with AI-generated imagery of Trump appearing to rescue dogs, cats and birds from harm, with Trump posting several of the memes to his own Truth Social account. Trump repeated the claim during the presidential debate against Kamala Harris. More than 30 bomb threats have been made against schools, government buildings and city officials’ homes since Trump’s comments, forcing evacuations and closures. Springfield also canceled its annual celebration of diversity, arts and culture in response to the threats, and on Tuesday, state police were deployed to city schools. He has also gotten heat over several resurfaced comments on childless women and violent marriages. In a 2021 interview with former Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson, Vance said that the U.S. was being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.' The then-Senate candidate specifically mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York as examples. Vance drew widespread criticism over his words, but stood behind them calling it a 'sarcastic comment.' Trump defended his running mate saying he believed Vance’s comments meant that he’s 'strongly family-oriented.' In another set of resurfaced comments from a 2021 event, Vance criticized people leaving marriages, even when they are violent. Who is JD Vance, Trump’s pick for vice president 'This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is the idea that like, well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy, and so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that’s going to make people happier in the long term,'' Vance said, according to Vice. The founder of the organization Moms Demand criticized his comments on X. 'JD Vance said women are obligated to stay in ‘violent’ marriages,' Watts wrote. 'Each month, 70 women are fatally shot by intimate partners in the US, and 1 million women alive today have been shot or shot at by intimate partners.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/vance-springfield-ohio-illegal-immigrant-fear-rhetoric/	2024-10-01T19:36:38-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276046306213.jpg?w=900
Vance on carbon emissions and climate change: 'Let's just say tha...	Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (Ohio) expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus behind climate change in response to a question during Tuesday's debate. 'One of the things that I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions — this idea that carbon emissions drive all the climate change,' Vance said. Trump rips Walz, CBS moderators in debate’s opening 15 minutes 'Let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,' Vance continued. There is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and is primarily being driven by human activity — largely carbon emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels. Vance, in his answer, said the Trump administration’s climate policy would be to bring more energy production and manufacturing to the U.S. 'because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.' The U.S. is currently the second-largest emitter of planet-warming gases, behind only China, and is the largest historic emitter. Moderator Norah O'Donnell fact-checked Vance’s response, saying, 'The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the Earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate.' When asked by a moderator, Vance also did not say whether he agrees with former President Trump’s infamous false assertion that climate change is a 'hoax.' JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views In his own remarks, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized former President Trump’s oil industry fundraisers and denial of climate science. 'To call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, 'Give me money for my campaign, and I'll let you do whatever you want.' We can be smarter about that,' Walz said. Walz appeared to be referring to reports that Trump asked the oil industry for $1 billion in campaign cash during a fundraiser earlier this year. What is the QR code on screen during the vice presidential debate? The Washington Post reported that Trump said the donations would be a 'deal' for oil executives because of the tax cuts and relaxed regulations he would implement, but someone with knowledge of the meeting who spoke with The Hill said the discussion was not framed as any sort of quid pro quo. Walz also described his running mate Vice President Harris as having an 'all-of-the-above' energy policy and touted oil and gas production in the U.S. — Updated at 10:00 p.m.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/jd-vance-carbon-emissions-climate/	2024-10-01T19:16:42-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24276040453208-e1727833924160.jpg?w=900
Walz: I 'misspoke' about being in Hong Kong during 1989 protests	(NewsNation) —Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz addressed criticism about his previous statement saying he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 saying he 'misspoke' about his exact time there during the vice presidential debate against Ohio Senator JD Vance Tuesday. 'I got there that summer and misspoke on this,' Walz said during the debate in New York hosted by CBS News. 'I was in Hong Kong in China during democracy protests and from that I learned a lot.' Walz touted his time in the military saying that he became a teacher through the GI bill and then created a program to take students there as well. Here’s a look at questions about Tim Walz’s military record 'My commitment has been there from the beginning,' he said. Multiple news reports indicated that Walz misleadingly claimed he was in Hong Kong during the turbulence surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Walz suggested that he was in the then-British colony of Hong Kong in May 1989, but he appears to have been in Nebraska. Public records suggest he left for Hong Kong and China in August of that year. Walz has faced criticism on several discrepancies. Several Republicans, including Vance, had questioned Walz’ military service and retirement suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress. 'When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,' Vance posted on X in August. 'When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that’s shameful.' Walz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. The two-term Democratic governor retired from the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress just before his unit received an order to mobilize for the war in Iraq. There is no evidence that Walz timed his departure with the intent of avoiding deployment. But the fact remains that he left ahead of his unit’s departure. That departure became a major point of attack on Walz by his opponents. The Harris campaign statement said Walz 'would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country' and thanked 'Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way.' 'After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform — and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,' the Harris campaign said in August. Walz was chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris to be her running mate in August after an exhaustive search of several high-profile candidates. Walz has since been out on the campaign trail for Harris, promoting the vice president and saying he will do whatever it takes to get her elected in November.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/walz-misspoke-hong-kong-1989-protests/	2024-10-01T19:06:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/AP24233042000701-e1724271899331.jpg?w=800
Walz: Trump leadership brought Iran 'closer to a nuclear weapon'	(NewsNation) — In the first debate between the vice presidential candidates, Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz contrasted how former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris would lead the country through foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on Tuesday, the latest in a series of escalating attacks in a yearslong conflict between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies that threatens to push the Middle East closer toward a region-wide war. When asked about supporting a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran, Walz stressed the importance of steady leadership in handling the situation in the Middle East. Voter Guide 2024: Breaking down the candidates, policies and issues He criticized Trump's approach to foreign policy, citing concerns raised by Trump's former staff members about his fitness for office. Walz praised Harris for her 'steady leadership' and 'calmness' in building and maintaining international coalitions. Vance, on the other hand, defended Trump's foreign policy record. He argued that Trump 'delivered stability in the world' through 'effective deterrence.' Vance criticized the Biden-Harris administration's policies towards Iran, claiming that unfrozen assets provided to Iran have been used to fund weapons potentially threatening the US and its allies. Where are Trump, Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walz campaigning today? Regarding a preemptive strike, Vance said, 'It is up to Israel … we should support allies wherever they are.' The candidates also clashed over the Iran nuclear deal. Walz accused Trump of making Iran 'closer to a nuclear weapon' by withdrawing from the agreement without an alternative plan. Vance countered by pointing out that Iran is currently closer to developing a nuclear weapon than ever before, despite the current administration's policies. Walz highlighted coalition-building and diplomatic steadiness, while Vance stressed the importance of projecting strength and deterrence on the world stage. JD Vance, Tim Walz face off in VP debate What to know about the Israel-Iran attacks and Biden's response The Biden administration is closely monitoring missile attacks launched by Iran into Israel, but while the White House says it fully supports Israel’s right to defense, it may not be on the same page when it comes to offensive use of force. Both President Joe Biden and Harris have been in the situation room watching the attack and said the military has been ordered to assist in shooting down missiles. Biden said that the attack 'appears to have been defeated and ineffective' and that the U.S. is 'fully fully fully supportive of Israel.' Before Iran’s attack, Israel had landed a series of devastating blows in recent weeks against the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon. It then ratcheted up the pressure on the Iran-backed militant group — which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began — by launching what it said is a limited ground incursion in southern Lebanon. JD Vance, Tim Walz trade barbs before vice presidential debate Israel has said it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for citizens displaced from homes near the Lebanon border to return. Hezbollah has vowed to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas, which is also supported by Iran. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are calling on Biden to get tougher on Iran in the wake of Tuesday’s attack, urging the administration to adopt a series of specific measures designed to cripple the military powers of Tehran and its proxies. The Biden administration has given Israel weapons, billions of dollars and 2,000-pound bombs used to take out some of Hezbollah’s leaders, but the Trump-Vance ticket has consistently criticized Kamala Harris’ handling of the situation, claiming she 'hates Israel.' Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for years, but rarely have they come into direct conflict.

Live Updates: JD Vance, Tim Walz face off in VP debate	(NewsNation) — With just 34 days left until the 2024 presidential election, Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota will spar in their first and only debate Tuesday night. The pair have traded barbs in the past, with former President Donald Trump's running mate questioning Walz's military record and liberal leanings. Meanwhile, Walz — who Vice President Kamala Harris selected just weeks after taking up the mantle from President Joe Biden — has jabbed Vance for his statements about childless cat ladies and school shootings. JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates’ political views The 90-minute debate will feature unmuted microphones and no fact-checking by CBS moderators, Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, according to the network. There will be two four-minute breaks. Vance will have the last word as a result of a Thursday coin toss, CBS said.

Education a potential flashpoint in Vance-Walz vice presidential ...	Education hardly came up in last month's Trump-Harris presidential debate, but it could be a central focus at Tuesday's undercard event. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) is the first former educator in decades to make a major party ticket, and he has foregrounded that experience on the campaign trail. Live updates: Vance, Walz set for high-stakes VP debate But Walz's record on schools, both as a teacher and as a governor, has also been a leading point of attack for Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who won't be pulling punches at the first and only vice presidential debate. 'It's more likely to come up in the VP debate then it would be in even another presidential debate, with one of the reasons for that being that it's so central — education is so central to Walz's identity as a former teacher,' said Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institute. 'And then the other part of it being that a lot of what we've heard from JD Vance is so related to parents, and parents of school-aged children, that I think there are kind of more invitations to focus on education in this debate than there are for the presidential debate,' Valant added. 'I would be a little surprised if we don't get any questions about either education or at least parenting.' Walz has a very personal relationship with education, teaching in China for a year before coming back to the U.S. to teach social studies in Minnesota. He was also a football coach at Alliance High School, where he met his wife, who is also a teacher. He has not shied away from bringing up that background on the campaign trail and has received the enthusiastic endorsements of major teachers' unions. During the debate, 'it's important for him to tell his story,' said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic political strategist. 'And then telling his story, the teacher aspect of who he is will come out and how he has fought for accessible and affordable education for everyone,' Seawright said. But Walz’s record has also been an area where Republicans have gone on the attack, nicknaming him 'Tampon Tim' after he signed a bill expanding access to menstrual products, including in boys' bathrooms. 'I suspect education policy won’t be a focal point of the debate beyond examples used as part of larger critiques of the candidates. For example, conservatives have criticized Walz’s education record while governor by attacking him for a law he passed requiring menstrual products in public schools. This attack is part of the GOP’s larger culture war against the left,' said Ryan Dawkins, assistant professor in the political science department at Carleton College. 'Similarly, Walz might try to connect Vance to Project 2025 and its policy goal of dissolving the entire Department of Education,' Dawkins added. Republicans have rallied around 'parents rights' as the central tenet of their education platform, and Vance has leaned into the issue, though he has drawn heat in the past for his aggressive rhetoric. In 2021, he decried what he called an 'antifamily' agenda promoted by Democrats and said the movement was led by 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.' Vance has also directly criticized Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, in 2022 saying she 'doesn’t have a single child.' Weingarten is a mother by marriage. 'If she wants to brainwash and destroy the mind of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone,' Vance said. Observers are interested to see how Vance tries to go after Walz without alienating other educators in the process. 'I think the teacher side of this is very interesting ... It's so central to who Walz is. He was a teacher. He presents as a teacher in a lot of ways. And I'm curious to see how Vance handles that,' Valant said. 'If Vance comes out and his rhetoric feels very anti-teacher, I think that could end up being part of the story coming out of the debate. Or if he's going to focus on teachers’ unions. I'm just very curious.' he added. Conservatives are looking for Vance to focus on Walz's record as governor of Minnesota without getting bogged down in personal broadsides. 'Minnesota is home to what scholars have said are the most radical state standards in the country. As governor, Walz signed into law standards that teach students they are part of ‘racialized hierarchies’ and to ‘be aware of [their] own bias, power, and privilege.’ The standards instruct students on intersectionality and ‘settler-colonialism,’ among other concepts and buzzwords rooted in toxic identity politics,' said Ryan Walker, the executive vice president for Heritage Action for America. 'Walz should be pressed on these radical standards and asked whether this is the vision of America that should be taught to children in public schools,' Walker added.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/education-a-potential-flashpoint-in-vance-walz-vice-presidential-debate/	2024-10-01T15:12:15-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/Debate-Education_100124_AP_Jose-Luis-Magana-and-Steve-Helber.png?w=900
Diddy facing 120 new sex misconduct allegations: Lawyer	(NewsNation) — A Houston lawyer says he is representing 120 people who say they have experienced sexual misconduct by Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Attorney Tony Buzbee says he expects his clients to file lawsuits within the next 30 days. Buzbee said the alleged victims are 60 men and 60 women, of whom 25 were minors at the time of the alleged misconduct. The youngest, Buzbee said, was 9. 'I imagine there's a myriad of people who are nervous,' Buzbee said. 'You can't hide skeletons in the closet forever.' Diddy receiving privileges including more showers: Former inmate Erica Wolff, Combs' lawyer, said in a statement to NewsNation that the rap mogul 'cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a reckless media circus.' 'That said, Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors,' Wolff said in a statement. Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He has pleaded not guilty and is due back in court for a status conference on Oct. 9.

Jimmy Carter turns 100: How has America changed?	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter celebrates his 100th birthday Tuesday — making him the first American president to live a full century. Celebrations include a benefit concert and the construction of 30 new Habitat for Humanity homes, marking the occasion in Carter's philanthropic fashion. What was the US like when Jimmy Carter was born? Carter was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Much has changed since then. Calvin Coolidge was the president at the time. The summer and winter Olympics both happened that year. 'The Thief of Bagdad,' starring Douglas Fairbanks, was topping the box office and the Washington Senators beat the New York Giants in the World Series. The average cost of a home was just around $23,000. Gas cost about 19 cents per gallon and a pound of steak was about 37 cents. You could even buy a brand-new car for just over $100. These are the 50 best school districts in US for 2025, report finds How has it changed? The country faced a long list of significant events leading up to Carter’s venture into politics, including the invention of the first car phone, World War II, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War and The Beatles' disbandment. Carter rose to become America’s 39th president. His legacy includes hands-on support for Habitat for Humanity and advocacy for affordable housing, which earned him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Fast forward several decades — the world has experienced a new series of significant cultural events. That includes the rise of social media, a global pandemic and now — the world’s longest-living president turning 100 years old.

JD Vance vs. Tim Walz: Vice presidential candidates' political vi...	(NewsNation) — The Republican and Democratic presidential tickets are stacked after presumptive nominee Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Ohio Sen. JD Vance's nomination as former President Donald Trump's vice president pits him against Walz, a former teacher and longtime politician. At 39, Vance will represent a younger generation of Republicans alongside 78-year-old Trump. Meanwhile, Walz and Harris stand united on major Democratic voting issues, including abortion and immigration. What happens now that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is running for VP? Here is how Vance and Walz stack up against one another on the big issues. Who is Tim Walz? Walz’s liberal policy record and decorated background as a congressman and soldier made him stand out as a vice presidential contender. Walz, a Nebraska native, enlisted in the National Guard out of high school at 17 years old and served 24 years. He also worked in agriculture and manufacturing before graduating from Chadron State College with a degree in education.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) The veteran temporarily taught in China and on South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which is one of the poorest areas in the country. Walz won his congressional bid in 2006 and served for 12 years before pivoting his career in 2019 to assume the governorship. In that time, he gained recognition as a top Democrat on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee and the highest-ranking enlisted soldier in congressional history. During his time in Congress, he served on three House committees: Agriculture, Armed Services and Veterans’ Affairs. He was also the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress. Who is JD Vance? A Yale School graduate, Vance went on to become a best-selling author and Ohio senator. Vance was gaining recognition for the publication of his 2016 memoir 'Hillbilly Elegy' as Trump was entering the White House. Vance was openly critical of the former reality TV star at the time, referencing himself in a 2016 interview as a 'never-Trump guy.' That changed in 2021 as Vance eyed an Ohio Senate seat that he won and still holds. Vance deleted tweets from 2016 calling Trump 'reprehensible' and an 'idiot,' Politifact reported.

Puskar, File) The public didn’t forget about Vance’s former stance, however, and the then-budding politician acknowledged his criticism of Trump during a 2021 Fox News interview. 'Like a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016, and I ask folks not to judge me based on what I said back in 2016 because I’ve been very open about the fact that I did say those very critical things, and I regret them,' Vance said. 'I was wrong about the guy. I think he made a good president.' Vance, Walz on crime Although statistics show a decline, crime remains one of the top issues for voters. NewsNation and Decision Desk HQ polling shows crime as one of the top three issues for the 2024 election. In February 2023, Walz signed into law legislation providing funding for the attorney general to hire as many as seven additional criminal prosecutors. The law, he said, would triple the capacity of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office to 'prosecute violent crime and bring justice to victims of crime.' Walz has said investing in public safety will lower crime rates, local outlet KTTC reported in June 2022. 'The sheer capacity to process evidence and work crime scenes is critical,' KTTC quoted Walz saying at the time. 'We have heard it time and time again at dozens of stops. Invest money in us. Invest money in the BCA and the researchers and investigators, and we will bring down these numbers.' Later that year, Walz signed a bill to legalize recreational marijuana for people over the age of 21 starting in August, making Minnesota the 23rd state to legalize the substance for adults. Trump vs. Harris: Where they stand on issues that matter to voters Vance's record on criminal justice intertwines GOP talking points, including crime, abortion and immigration. In 2023, Vance introduced the Protect Children’s Innocence Act as a companion bill to a measure by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Vance’s bill, if passed, would make it illegal for doctors to provide gender-affirming care to minors, making the act punishable by as many as 12 years in prison. The nonprofit LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD criticized Vance, saying the bill contains 'an array of far-right, anti-transgender buzzwords' and bans on medical procedures, 'none of which are a part of transgender healthcare for minors.' Several of the procedures Vance sought to ban include those commonly performed on cisgender people, including plastic surgery and hormone therapies, GLAAD noted. Vance also supported Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s PRINTS Act, which called for fingerprinting and federal reporting of minors who cross the border in suspected acts of human trafficking, The Marshall Project reported. Anyone who 'use(s) unrelated minors to gain entry into the United States' would be eligible for a sentence of as many as 10 years in prison. Vance additionally co-sponsored Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s Back the Blue Act of 2023. The act would raise the minimum and maximum sentences, including death or life in prison, for people convicted of killing or assaulting police officers, according to The Marshall Project. Vance, Walz on abortion During his time in political office, Vance has opposed abortion access and some LGBTQ+ rights. He also supports policies he argues would increase birth rates in the United States, such as making childbirth free and financially incentivizing couples to have children. While Vance ran for Senate on a staunchly anti-abortion platform, he has somewhat shifted his public stance on the issue. In a July 7 interview on NBC’s 'Meet The Press,' Vance said he agreed with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling dismissing a case challenging the availability of mifepristone, an abortion drug. How will the economy affect Harris, Trump campaigns? 'I think it’s important to say that we need to have a conversation in our country about what our abortion policy should be,' he said. 'Donald Trump is the pragmatic leader here.' In January 2023, Walz signed a bill codifying abortion rights following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Walz signed an executive order shielding people seeking or providing abortions in his state from facing legal consequences in other states. He also vowed to reject requests to extradite anyone accused of committing acts related to reproductive health care that are not criminal offenses in Minnesota. Walz, Vance on border and immigration In a 2021 letter, Walz asked Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to 'prioritize a clean pathway to citizenship for essential workers, dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holder, and their families.' 'Dreamers and TPS holders have enriched and strengthened Minnesota’s cities, schools, businesses, congregations and families,' Walz wrote. 'We believe that it is a moral imperative that Republicans and Democrats in Congress work together to enact bipartisan legislation that replaces fear and uncertainty with permanent protection for these individuals.' Vance's views on immigration largely echo Trump, saying he opposes 'every attempt to grant amnesty' to immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally. During his 2022 campaign for Senate, Vance ran a political ad saying, 'Joe Biden’s open border is killing Ohioans,' looking straight into the camera, adding, 'With more illegal drugs and more Democrat voters pouring into this country.' Vance argues illegal immigration has devastated parts of the country, including places like Wisconsin that are far from the U.S. border with Mexico. He blames Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden for problems such as the flow of illegal drugs, and says he and Trump will secure the border and 'put Americans first.' The Ohio senator faced backlash in September after promoting false claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting and eating pets as he tried to draw attention to Democratic presidential nominee Harris’ immigration policies. Officials have said there have been no credible or detailed reports about the claims. Walz, Vance past controversies Walz came under fire in 2022 when the Justice Department announced federal criminal charges against dozens of people accused of exploiting a federally-funded child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic. The theft of $250 million marked one of the country’s largest pandemic aid fraud cases, resulting in charges against 70 people. Five of the first seven defendants to stand trial were convicted. The trial gained widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash the night before the case went to the jury. Republican legislative leaders said the report shows that the failure to stop the fraud lies with Walz’s administration, which said the state’s hands were tied by a 2021 court order to resume payments despite its concerns — a charge the judge disputed — and that the FBI asked the state to continue making payments while the investigation continued. Tim Walz’s evolution on guns: From NRA darling to reform champion The Democratic governor also came under fire from GOP critics for his response to the civil unrest after a white former Minneapolis police officer killed 46-year-old Black man George Floyd. Walz’s detractors said he waited too long to deploy the Minnesota National Guard. Critics have said Vance’s 'Hillbilly Elegy,' which tells a first-person account of his extended Appalachian family’s efforts to escape poverty, perpetuates stereotypes many Appalachian people try to outrun. Vance's 2021 comments about 'violent' marriages also caused a stir. Vice reported on his remarks, which Vance made at an event that took place at Pacifica Christian High School in Southern California. Vance faced backlash after the report came out but previously said his comments had been misconstrued. Recently, he addressed resurfaced remarks that the country was being run by 'childless cat ladies,' calling it a 'sarcastic comment' and pivoting to attack Democrats as 'antifamily.' Comments Sen. JD Vance made in 2021 about 'violent' marriages also circulated online and sparked controversy. Vance made the remarks at an event at Pacifica Christian High School in Southern California.

Iran preparing ballistic missile attack against Israel: Official	(NewsNation) — Iran is preparing to 'imminently' attack Israel with a ballistic missile following Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon, a senior U.S. official confirmed to NewsNation. 'We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack,' the official said. 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.' Following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks last year, Israel launched a military campaign in the Gaza Strip. As the conflict dragged on, fears of a wider regional war increased. Recent conflicts between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel have ramped up. Following the death of a top Hezbollah commander, Israel launched what it described as a 'limited military campaign' in Lebanon. Israel has accused Hezbollah of attempting to invade the country from the north and engaged in a number of attacks against the group. Prior to the ground assault, Israel told people in 27 villages near the Lebanese border to evacuate.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/iran-missile-attack-israel-official/	2024-10-01T06:58:27-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2174986726.jpg?w=900
Helene has killed at least 130; crews search for missing	(NewsNation) — Helene's devastation came into focus Tuesday morning as rescue crews continued to search for Americans unaccounted for and trying to reach areas that were isolated by the storm. The death toll topped 130. From Florida to Virginia, tens of thousands remained without power Tuesday morning — days after Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, reaching up to 140 mph wind speeds. The system weakened as it quickly moved island, but not before causing catastrophic flooding across multiple states in the Southeast.

During a briefing Monday, White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall suggested as many as 600 people hadn’t been accounted for as of Monday afternoon, saying some might be dead. President Joe Biden said he will travel to North Carolina on Wednesday to meet with officials and take an aerial tour of Asheville. He said he hoped not to interrupt 'access to help there.' Then, the president will travel to Georgia and Florida. He said earlier that the federal government would be with affected residents in the nation’s Southeast 'as long as it takes.' When will hurricane season end? Asheville's road to recovery What was once a thriving mountainous city in North Carolina, glistening with art and historic architecture, is now a wasteland of splintered houses, crushed cargo containers and mud-covered highways. Helene has virtually cut off Asheville from the rest of the country. 'I think now people are feeling afraid. They need resources. They need help and we definitely are at a point of desperation,' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said. Monday's recovery efforts revealed that mudslides had washed away or blocked several main routes. Crews worked around the clock to repair cell towers and electricity, but several homes and businesses were completely gone. Government officials and aid groups worked to deliver supplies by air, truck and even mule to the hard-hit tourism hub of Asheville and its surrounding mountain towns. At least 40 people died in the county that includes Asheville. As a result, families were uprooted and lives were shattered.

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images) One family of six spoke to NewsNation after discovering their home was destroyed from the storm. They said they were originally planning on staying put to ride out Helene. However, a family member called them to tell them to evacuate because the water levels were rising. The rain, coupled with mudslides, left their Asheville house unrecognizable and uninhabitable. Inside the structure, furniture was tossed in different directions and the ground was caked in dirt. The family's four kids are unable to return to school due to damage and no internet service for online learning. 'I cried. I burst into tears. I couldn't handle it,' Jesse Kern said. 'Everything that we accomplished and built up over the last six years since we lived down here, everything is gone.' He said they now have to start from ground zero. 'I know we'll end up being OK,' His wife Dana Wunsch said. 'We have each other, we'll be alright and pull through. But it's going to suck, you know? But, we are staying positive.' The family of six has been staying at a shelter nearby, which is receiving food and water through airlifted services. For now, the family's goal is to send Wunsch and her four kids to live with her family in Ohio while Kern stays behind to tend to their dogs. South Carolina woman named after 1958 Hurricane Helene Analyzing Helene Helene was recorded as the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region, and it was the third hurricane to hit the area in 13 months, according to the Weather Channel. The Category 4 hurricane is estimated to have brought historic storm surge, peaking at an estimated 10.33 feet in Cedar Key, Florida. Parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina saw upward of a foot of rain, and nearly 30 inches were recorded near Busick, North Carolina, the Weather Channel reported. Virginia also experienced heavy rainfall and severe flooding Each governor declared a state of emergency to receive federal assistance. Multiple deaths across those states have been attributed to drowning, while some were the result of downed trees or other hurricane-related incidents, like carbon monoxide poisoning from generators. Some of the worst destruction occurred in the storm’s center in Florida’s Big Bend region and South Georgia. Inland cities like Atlanta and Asheville were not shielded from the storm’s impact, with flooding trapping residents and leaving them isolated from contact. AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene from $145 billion to $160 billion. North Carolina man hikes 11 miles to parents after Hurricane Helene Tropical Storm Kirk forms and could become a powerful hurricane Tropical Storm Kirk formed Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a 'large and powerful hurricane' by Tuesday night or Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was located about 800 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, and the storm system was not a threat to land.

Longshoremen strike could cost US economy billions daily	(NewsNation) — A strike shutting down ports from Maine to Texas could put holiday shopping — and the United States economy — at risk. The International Longshoremen Association’s strike — affecting ports along the East and Gulf coasts between Maine and Texas — comes after stalled negotiations with the U.S. Maritime Alliance. The union wants higher hourly wages and bans on automated cranes, gates and trucks. It’s the first time the union has been on strike since 1977. Rescuers search for missing after Helene rips Southeast 'ILA Longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing,' the union said in a statement. 'It's disgraceful that most of these foreign-owned shipping companies are engaged in a 'make and take' operation: they want to make their billion-dollar profits at United States ports, and off the backs of American ILA longshore workers, and take those earnings out of this country and into the pockets of foreign conglomerates.' The strike could pack a punch. The Baltimore port alone leads the country in car shipments. President Joe Biden told reporters Sunday he would not intervene in negotiations. The strike could cost the U.S. economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume, according to the Associated Press.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/longshoremen-strike-economy-cost/	2024-10-01T04:23:04-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/AP24275197522182.jpg?w=900
Israeli military begins ground operation in Lebanon	This is a developing story. Refresh for updates. Download our NewsNation app for 24/7 fact-based unbiased coverage. (NewsNation) — The Israeli military on Tuesday warned people to evacuate nearly two dozen Lebanese border communities hours after announcing the start of ground operations against Hezbollah. The militant group denied Israeli troops had entered Lebanon. It was not immediately clear whether Israeli troops had crossed the border. No photos or video footage has yet emerged showing Israeli ground forces inside Lebanon. Israel began a ground operation in Lebanon on Monday, days after its military killed the head of Hezbollah. Israel Defense Forces have begun 'limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' the IDF said in a statement. This comes after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and two weeks of intensive air strikes in Lebanon. Hezbollah's acting leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah's death Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told local council heads in northern Israel earlier Monday that the next phase of the war along Lebanon's southern border would begin soon. 'We will use all the means that may be required — your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land,' Gallant said. Israeli military officials declared the areas around the communities of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon as a closed military zone. Entry to the areas was prohibited. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Israel informed the U.S. about the raids, which he said were described as 'limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border.' In accordance with the decision of the political echelon, a few hours ago, the IDF began limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon. These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel. The IDF is operating according to a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command which IDF soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months. The Israeli Air Force and IDF Artillery are supporting the ground forces with precise strikes on military targets in the area. These operations were approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon. Operation 'Northern Arrows' will continue according to the situational assessment and in parallel to combat in Gaza and in other arenas. The IDF is continuing to operate to achieve the goals of the war and is doing everything necessary to defend the citizens of Israel and return the citizens of northern Israel to their homes. IDF STATEMENT Netanyahu adds rival to Cabinet, strengthening hold on office In a statement to NewsNation, a National Security Council spokesperson said, 'This is in line with Israel's right to defend its citizens and safely return civilians to their homes. We support Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups.' 'Ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border.' Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost every day since the war in Gaza began, displacing tens of thousands of people in Israel and Lebanon. Israel says it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for families to return to their homes near the Lebanon border. Hezbollah has promised to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. The group’s acting leader, Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, Hezbollah is ready. He said commanders killed in recent weeks have already been replaced.

The hip-hop mogul's lawyers filed a notice of appeal Monday in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after previously saying they would ask the appeals court to overturn Judge Andrew L. Carter's ruling and release him. Diddy receiving privileges including more showers: Former inmate Combs, 54, has been locked up at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since pleaded not guilty Sept. 17 to charges that he used his 'power and prestige' to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers in events dubbed 'Freak Offs.' Carter rejected a defense proposal that would've allowed the 'I’ll Be Missing You' singer to be placed under house arrest at his Florida mansion with GPS monitoring and strict limits on visitors. The judge said the plan, which included a $50 million bail offer, was 'insufficient' to ensure the safety of the community and the integrity of Combs' case. Carter said that 'no condition or set of conditions' for Combs’ release could guard against the risk of him threatening or harming witnesses. What we know about the Diddy investigation Combs' lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, had suggested moving him from the Brooklyn jail, which has been plagued by rampant violence and horrific conditions, to one in Essex County, New Jersey. He later abandoned that idea. Combs is due back in court for a status conference on Oct. 9.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/entertainment-headlines/ap-sean-diddy-combs-appeals-for-release-while-he-awaits-sex-trafficking-trial/	2024-09-30T14:25:52-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/66cce049c5aa44.78118796.jpeg?w=900
Why was Asheville hit so hard by Helene?	(NewsNation) — After Helene swept through western North Carolina, the storm left behind a trail of devastation, leaving those in the city of Asheville cut off from the rest of the world and wiping smaller towns off the map almost entirely After making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Florida, Helene rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as it moved through the Southeast. The western North Carolina mountains were hit especially hard, with Buncombe County alone accounting for a third of the total storm-related deaths and hundreds more people still missing as of Monday morning. Geography and circumstance played a role in how the city was struck so hard, with the storm leaving thousands without power and water and hundreds of roads closed, making it difficult for supplies to get into the area. Helene flooding: Volunteers reopen bridge to help stranded neighbors The flooding in Asheville, home to around 94,000 people, was predicted to break records, with forecasters comparing it to a 1916 flood from a tropical storm, which also cut the city off from the rest of the world. The Great Smoky Mountains are one of the things that has drawn people to Asheville since it was first established. But the scenery comes with a price when it comes to storms: Asheville essentially sits in the bottom of a bowl of mountains, with floodwaters from higher elevations headed downhill toward the area. The mountains essentially act as a funnel, directing water down toward the valley and wiping out entire towns in the mountains along the way. Asheville is also settled between two rivers that broke 230-year-old records for flooding during Helene. The French Broad River, which usually crests around 1 1/2 feet, reached 24.6 feet during the storm. The Swannanoa River went from a crest of around 1 1/2 feet to 26.1, a height not reached since 1791. Dad makes 30-mile trek through Helene debris to walk daughter down the aisle Helene also came at a particularly bad time for the region. The area saw several days of heavy rain prior to the storm, leaving the ground saturated and rivers already rising higher than normal. Over three days, the city saw 17.31 inches of rain, breaking a previous record of 13.71 for the entire month of September. The mountains that surround Asheville are also hindering supply delivery. In addition to widespread power and cell service outages, there has been extensive damage to the city's water system that officials say will take weeks to be fully restored. In the meantime, Buncombe County authorities have said there are plans to set up distribution sites for food and water as supplies arrive. However, road closures are making it difficult to get supplies to the city, with only one major route into the area fully open.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/why-asheville-hit-hard-helene/	2024-09-30T09:41:34-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2174585773.jpg?w=900
JD Vance, Tim Walz trade barbs before vice presidential debate	(NewsNation) — Vice presidential candidates Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are ramping up their personal and political attacks ahead of what could be the last debate of the 2024 election Vance, Republican nominee Donald Trump's running mate, has questioned Walz's military record, saying he exaggerated aspects of his service. Walz, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' running mate, meanwhile, sharply criticized his opponent for his comments after a school shooting in Georgia. Speaking at a rally in Phoenix, Vance said that school shootings are a 'fact of life.' Both candidates have been facing scrutiny for flip-flopping on important issues and catering to their party lines. Politicians on both sides of the aisle say their candidate will be focusing on policy at Tuesday night's debate hosted by CBS News. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said on NewsNation's 'The Hill Sunday' that Walz has to put a 'human face' on his and Harris' emphasis on small businesses, startups and innovation, 'as opposed to the big business orientation on the other side.' Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., on the other hand, said Vance has the issues, such as the economy and border, on his side during an interview on ABC News. Vice presidential debate rules CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell and 'Face the Nation' host Margaret Brennan will moderate the debate, which begins at 9 p.m. ET. The debate will last 90 minutes, with candidates having two minutes to answer questions. Microphones will not be muted, and moderators will not be fact-checking either side's statements, so it'll be up to the candidates to do that to each other. After winning a coin toss Thursday, Vance chose to give the second closing statement, giving him the final word, CBS said.

Hezbollah's acting leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah's deat...	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah's acting leader vowed Monday to continue battling Israel and said the militant group was prepared for a long fight even after much of its top command was wiped out, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli strikes have killed Nasrallah and six of his top commanders and officials in the last 10 days, and have hit what the military says are thousands of militant targets across large parts of Lebanon. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Early Monday, an airstrike hit a residential building, wiping out one apartment, damaging others, and killing three Palestinian militants in central Beirut, as Israel appeared to send a clear message that no part of Lebanon is out of bounds. Despite the heavy blow Hezbollah has suffered in recent weeks, acting leader Naim Kassem said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, the group's fighters are ready — noting that the commanders killed have already been replaced. 'Israel was not able to affect our (military) capabilities,' Kassem said in his first speech since Nasrallah was killed. 'There are deputy commanders and there are replacements in case a commander is wounded in any post.' He added that Hezbollah anticipated 'the battle could be long.' A founding member of Hezbollah who had been Nasrallah’s longtime deputy, Kassem will remain in his acting position until the group’s leadership elects a replacement. The man widely expected to take over the top post is Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs. Hezbollah has significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week to several hundred daily, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. Several people have been wounded in Israel. There have been no fatalities since two soldiers were killed near the border on Sept. 19. But Hezbollah’s capabilities remain unclear. As recently as two weeks ago, a strike like Monday's in central Beirut — outside of the main areas where Hezbollah operates and next to a busy transportation hub normally crowded with buses, taxis and vans — would have been seen as a major escalation and likely followed by a long-range Hezbollah strike into Israel. But the unspoken rules of the long-running conflict are no longer clear. It's possible that Hezbollah is holding back to save resources for a bigger battle, including a threatened Israeli ground invasion. But the militant group might also be in disarray after Israeli intelligence apparently penetrated its highest levels. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including the massive strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations closer to the city center. The strike early Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist faction that has not been meaningfully involved in months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has not claimed the strike but is widely assumed to have carried it out. Also Monday, Hamas announced that its top commander in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif, was killed with his family in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre. The Israeli military confirmed that it had targeted him. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into Israel sparked the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies and both supported by Iran, and Hezbollah said it would continue the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians until there was a cease-fire in Gaza. Israel has responded to the rockets with airstrikes in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, and the fighting has steadily escalated over the past year. The Lebanese government says the fighting may have displaced up to a million people, although the U.N. estimate is around 200,000. Tens of thousands of Israelis have also been displaced. Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the attacks stop and its citizens can return to their homes. The United States and its allies have called for a cease-fire, hoping to avoid further escalation that could draw in Iran and set off a wider war. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown little interest, as his country racks up military achievements against a longtime foe. Some Israelis broke into spontaneous celebrations after Nasrallah’s death was announced. Videos circulated of crowds at bars singing a song in Hebrew mocking him. A news anchor on a pro-Netanyahu station sang and danced as the studio audience joined in with him while a commentator on Israel’s largest TV station offered co-panelists celebratory shots. Hezbollah, which boasts tens of thousands of battle-hardened fighters and long-range missiles capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel, has long been seen as the most powerful militant group in the region and a key partner to Iran in both threatening and deterring Israel. Hezbollah fought Israel to a monthlong stalemate in their 2006 war, But Hezbollah has never faced an onslaught quite like this one, which began with a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies in mid-September that killed dozens of people and wounded around 3,000 — including many fighters but also many civilians. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure but warned that the group will work quickly to rebuild it. 'We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough,' he told CNN’s 'State of the Union' on Sunday. ___ Melzer reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

An Israeli airstrike hits central Beirut for the first time in ne...	JERUSALEM (AP) — The first apparent Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in nearly a year of conflict leveled an apartment building early Monday. It came after Israel hit targets across Lebanon and killed dozens of people, as Hezbollah sustained heavy blows to its command structure, including the killing of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The airstrike hit a multistory residential building, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene. Videos showed ambulances and a crowd gathered near the building in a mainly Sunni district with a busy thoroughfare lined with shops. A Palestinian leftist faction in Lebanon said three of its members were killed in the airstrike. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement early Monday that its military and security commanders in Lebanon, and a third member, were killed in the attack. The group has not played a significant role in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah. An official with Lebanon's Civil Defense had earlier said that a member of the al-Jamaa al-Islamiya was killed in the strike and that 16 other people were wounded, but the Sunni militant group, which fights alongside Hezbollah, has not confirmed the death of any of its members. Also early Monday, another strike killed a commander with the militant group Hamas, which has a presence in Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps. Hamas said Fatah Sharif and his family were killed in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including a major strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations near the city center. Israeli officials had no immediate comment. Earlier, Hezbollah confirmed that Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of its Central Council, was killed Saturday, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader killed in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. They include the group's founding members who had evaded death or detention for decades. Hezbollah also confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in the strike that killed Nasrallah. Israel says at least 20 other Hezbollah militants were killed, including one in charge of Nasrallah's security detail. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 105 people were killed around the country in airstrikes Sunday. Two strikes near the southern city of Sidon, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Beirut, killed at least 32 people, the ministry said. Separately, Israeli strikes in the northern province of Baalbek Hermel killed 21 people and wounded at least 47. Lebanese media reported dozens of strikes in the central, eastern and western Bekaa and in the south, besides strikes on Beirut. Israel says it targets militants, but the strikes have hit buildings where civilians were living and the death toll was expected to rise. In a video of a strike in Sidon, verified by the AP, a building swayed before collapsing as neighbors filmed. One TV station called on viewers to pray for a family caught under the rubble, posting their pictures, as rescuers failed to reach them. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 14 medics were killed over two days in the south. President Joe Biden said Sunday that he would speak soon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. 'It has to be,' Biden told reporters at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware as he boarded Air Force One for Washington. Meanwhile, wreckage from Friday's strike that killed Nasrallah was still smoldering. Smoke rose over the rubble as people flocked to the site, some to check on what was left of their homes and others to pay respects, pray or simply to see the destruction. In response to the dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, Hezbollah significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week, from several dozen to several hundred daily, the Israeli military said. The attacks injured several people and caused damage, but most of the rockets and drones were intercepted by Israel’s air defense systems or fell in open areas. The army says its strikes have degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities and the number of launches would be much higher if Hezbollah had not been hit. Israel strikes Houthi targets in Yemen Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said dozens of its aircraft struck Houthi targets in Yemen in response to a recent attack. The military said it targeted power plants and sea port facilities in the city of Hodeida. The Houthis launched a ballistic missile attack toward Israel's Ben Gurion airport on Saturday when Netanyahu was arriving. The Houthi media office said the Israeli strikes hit the Hodeida and Rass Issa ports, along with two power plants in Hodeida city, a stronghold for the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the strikes killed four people and wounded 40 others. The Houthis claimed they took precautionary measures ahead of the strikes, emptying oil stored in the ports, according to Nasruddin Ammer, deputy director of the Houthi media office. He said in a post on X that the strikes won’t stop the rebels’ attacks on shipping routes and on Israel. U.S. warns Hezbollah will work quickly to rebuild Meanwhile, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure, but he warned the group will work quickly to rebuild it. 'I think people are safer without him walking around,' Kirby said of Nasrallah. 'But they will try to recover. We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough. … Much of their command structure has now been wiped out.' Speaking on CNN’s 'State of the Union,' Kirby sidestepped questions about whether the Biden administration agrees with how the Israelis are targeting Hezbollah leaders. The White House continues to call on Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a 21-day temporary cease-fire floated by the U.S., France and other countries during the U.N. General Assembly last week. Airstrikes drive thousands from homes in Lebanon A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon have killed more than 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes. The government estimates around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets. Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran, Israel’s chief regional rival, rose to regional prominence after fighting a devastating monthlong war with Israel in 2006 that ended in a draw. Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel. The United States announced sanctions against him in 2020. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies that consider themselves part of an Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' against Israel. The conflict has steadily ratcheted up to the brink of all-out war, raising fears of a region-wide conflagration. Israel says it is determined to return some 60,000 of its citizens to communities in the north that were evacuated nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its rocket fire if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which has proven elusive despite months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Trump and Harris on food prices: Promises vs. reality	(NewsNation) — A long-held political truism has been that when the U.S. economy is going well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things aren’t going well, the president gets too much blame. But that hasn’t stopped presidents and presidential candidates from claiming that their policies will quickly and effectively turn around bad times. And the 2024 presidential election is no exception. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have made promises and released proposals to improve the U.S. economy, especially when it comes to food prices. Here’s a look at some of their most prominent positions, and how experts view the chances of those stands becoming reality. Harris: Ban price gouging Harris has called on Congress to pass a bill to ban price gouging on food, a proposal very close to the bill that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., introduced earlier this year. It would give the Federal Trade Commission and the states the power to penalize companies that use their power to sell goods 'at and excessive price.' Warren’s bill would also give the FTC the power to define 'excessive,' a move that is bound to create partisan controversy. And, with a divided Congress, the Warren bill has little chance of passing this year. Even if Harris wins, political experts believe that Republicans could control both houses of Congress next year. What causes rising egg prices? Trump: Impose tariffs on food imports 'Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,'' Trump said this earlier this month. As president, he imposed tariffs with a flourish, targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China. Trump insists that tariffs are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, it is importers – American companies – that pay tariffs, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That's why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs. As president, Trump put a 9% tariff on imported washing machines, which hiked the consumer price of washing machines by 9%, according to Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan. Vance faces biggest moment of political career with debate Harris: Antitrust enforcement The Biden administration has taken action against what it calls 'anticompetitive behavior' in the food industry, which it says has helped drive up food costs. The FTC is trying to stop the $25 billion merger of the two of the country’s biggest grocery store chains, Albertsons and Kroger. The Harris campaign has hired advisers who are tied to Biden’s moves, a signal that Harris will also take an aggressive antitrust stance. It's been a long time since the federal government tried to break up monopolies. The 1936 Robinson-Patman Act, which bans suppliers from offering better prices to its bigger customers at the expense of smaller competitors, is still on the books but hasn’t been enforced for many years. But economists say that, even when antitrust action is successful, it would take a long time to have an impact on retail food prices. Trump: Expand the domestic energy supply Trump has argued that lower energy costs would be one of several steps, along with lowering taxes and interest rates, that would 'quickly bring down prices' for everything, including food. He’s promised to approve more domestic oil drilling, and to bring the price of gasoline down to below $2 a gallon. He has said those moves would 'bring down the price of everything from electricity rates to groceries, airfares, and housing costs.' The U.S. is already producing record amounts of oil and gas, and the Biden administration has approved many new permits to drill on federal land. Economists say that, while energy costs figured in every step of the food supply chain, it’s just one of many factors. Also, the U.S. government can only do so much to influence gas prices, which are mostly shaped by global politics and market factors. ChatGPT can help you save money on your bills Reality vs. perception The experts, and many years of history, suggest that U.S. presidents have very little power to immediately influence consumer prices for food and other goods and services. But it looks like most of us believe otherwise. An August survey conducted by the agriculture departments of Purdue University and the University of Illinois asked this question: Who do you think can help lower retail food prices? 'We find that most respondents thought that political parties could help lower food prices and grocery bills,' the survey authors wrote. 'Perhaps not surprisingly in a polarized political environment, most respondents who identified with one of the major parties thought that only their party could lower prices,' they added. The survey of 1,000 adults around the U.S. found that, among those who prefer Trump, about 65% believe that only Republicans can lower food prices. Among Harris supporters, 50% think that only Democrats can accomplish the task.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-on-food-prices/	2024-09-29T15:46:58-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2050741858.jpg?w=900
Mexican cartels flood US with fentanyl, causing 200+ deaths daily	(NewsNation) — Two Mexican drug cartels are primarily responsible for flooding the United States with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 80 times stronger than morphine that's killing over 200 Americans daily, authorities say. The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have established a sophisticated supply chain, sourcing precursor chemicals from China and manufacturing fentanyl in clandestine Mexican labs before smuggling it across the U.S. border, according to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports. No substance comes close to the death toll caused by fentanyl. It claims over 200 lives every day – that's the equivalent of a full airplane crashing daily. Fact-checking claims Harris and Trump have made about the border DEA seizures highlight the escalating crisis. In 2021, authorities confiscated 23 million fentanyl pills and nearly 7,000 pounds of powder. By 2023, those numbers surged to over 80 million pills and about 12,000 pounds of powder. In 2024 alone, 37.7 million pills and more than 5,400 pounds of fentanyl powder have been seized – enough to produce 269 million lethal doses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported fentanyl-related overdose deaths increased from 70,000 in 2021 to over 74,000 in 2023, surpassing deaths from other drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine. Behind the statistics are tragic personal stories. Stefanie Turner of Texas lost her son Tucker to fentanyl poisoning after he purchased a single pill online while struggling with sleep and anxiety. ICE released 435,000 migrants with criminal convictions: Data 'Fentanyl is taking a whole generation of brilliant minds,' Turner said. 'If you don't receive medication from a pharmacy, count that it has fentanyl. One pill does kill.' Government efforts to combat the crisis are intensifying. California's task force seized 8.8 million fentanyl pills this year, while Texas now prosecutes fentanyl-related deaths as murders. The Biden administration has partnered with China to disrupt the supply of precursor chemicals. Despite these efforts, including high-profile arrests like that of Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada in July, the cartels have proven adaptable. They employ various tactics to evade detection, including mislabeled packages, encrypted messaging and cryptocurrency payments. The cartels have proven resilient and adaptable, shifting their strategies to maintain control over a billion-dollar fentanyl trade that's ripping through communities and lives.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fentanyl/cartels-fentanyl-deaths/	2024-09-29T14:37:35-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/AP24046652384901-e1715598989656.jpg?w=900
200 chemicals linked to breast cancer found in food packaging: St...	(NewsNation) — Common food packaging materials — like shrink wrap, paper, cardboard and plastic — contain dozens of chemicals linked to breast cancer, researchers say. Published in Frontiers in Toxicology, a new article reports that 143 chemicals found in plastic are linked to breast cancer, while 89 were found in cardboard. The research team compared chemicals found in packaging with those listed in the Food Packaging Forum's database, noting that humans are regularly exposed to 76 of the carcinogenic chemicals through food. More brain injuries will occur from contact sports: Doctor In fact, many of them — 40 of those 76 — are already classified as hazardous internationally. Researchers say this shows existing regulations might not be enough to fully prevent exposure. 'Reducing population-wide exposure to potential mammary carcinogens can be achieved by science-based policy amendments addressing the assessment and management of food contact chemicals,' the article reads. The chemicals, including PFAs, bisphenols and phthalates, are known to be hazardous to health. PFAs resist breaking down naturally and can build up in the body over time, earning them the nickname 'forever chemicals.' They are associated with higher risk of certain cancers, such as kidney and testicular, as well as low birthweight, high cholesterol and pregnancy-induced hypertension, according to the CDC. ‘Dirty soda’: Regularly consuming the trendy drink is ‘risky,’ dietitian says This data just days after a peer-reviewed research published in the the journal Nature which found just over 3,600 chemicals — including some known carcinogens — were passed from food packaging to humans. The study cross-examined 14,000 chemicals approved for food contact with databases and biomonitoring programs, which researchers acknowledged as only a partial view of human chemical accumulation: 'Humans are known to be exposed to FCCs via foods, but the full extent of human exposure to all FCCs is unknown … [they] are exposed synthetic chemicals from food, drugs, household and personal care products, and environmental pollutants.' Nexstar’s Ashleigh Jackson and Ashley Bihun contributed to the report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/breast-cancer-chemicals-food-packaging/	2024-09-29T13:29:23-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/GettyImages-1230031258-e1709656349577.jpg?w=900
Rising egg prices linked to bird flu's impact on supply chain	(The Hill) — The rising price of eggs in the last year has been linked to bird’s flu impact on the supply chain. Eggs’ price tag has gone up by 28.1 percent in the last 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average price for a dozen large eggs was $3.20, according to the bureau's statistics. The spikes in prices occurred, in part, because of the high demand for the product, but also due to the bird flu outbreak at chicken farms in Colorado in July. ‘Dirty soda’: Regularly consuming the trendy drink is ‘risky,’ dietitian says 'Bird flu is the number one reason for higher prices, absolutely,' Phil Lempert, a grocery industry analyst, told CNN. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also known as bird flu, has affected over 100 million in 48 states since January 2022, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. 'Think about how they are housed: small spaces with lots of chickens,' Lempert said. 'When one chicken gets bird flu, they’ve got to cull the entire flock. That’s the problem.' The sickness of the birds has affected the total egg output, and lower production of eggs, in part, leads to an increase in prices. Here are the top 10 states where you’re likely to find gold: survey 'Table egg-layer facilities tend to be very large, and so you can lose a million or two million birds on a single facility, because this is a highly contagious virus,' Amy Hagerman, an associate professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, told NPR. But bird flu is not the only factor causing the prices of eggs to go upward. Emily Metz, the president of the American Egg Board, told NPR that 'inflationary pressures' play a key role since fuel prices are higher, along with high labor costs and packaging. 'Egg farmers are price takers, not price makers, and the volatility that we’re seeing is reflecting a number of factors that are completely outside the control of the egg farmer,' Metz said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/egg-prices-bird-flu/	2024-09-29T12:16:32-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Eggs_041123_AP-e1727634263566.jpg?w=800
US retailers brace for potential pain from a longshoremen's strik...	With a dockworkers' strike threatening to close ports on the East and Gulf coasts beginning this week, Chris Butler is growing worried. Butler is CEO of the National Tree Company, and, like many businesses, his is counting on shipments that are en route from Asia but won't reach their ports before an expected strike by longshoremen starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday. The company, based in New Jersey, is an importer of artificial Christmas trees and other holiday decorations. If a strike were to last just a few days, there might be time afterward to unload the trees, transport them to warehouses and have them ready for customers this season. Yet if a strike were to keep ports closed until, say, November, about 150,000 trees might not arrive in time for the peak shopping season, imposing costs on National Tree and other businesses. In a worst-case scenario, those costs, multiplied across industries, could fuel inflation and pressure the U.S. economy. 'Definitely not an ideal situation,' Butler said. National Tree already has stockpiled or delivered most of the roughly 2 million artificial trees it sells each year. But it would lose revenue if 150,000 of the trees got stuck in the pipeline. Other businesses face the same predicament, with goods that could be stranded at sea if 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association make good on their threat to strike. They could shut down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about half the goods shipped into and out of the United States. (West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren't involved in the strike.) A prolonged strike would force companies to pay shippers for the delays, and goods could arrive too late for the high point of holiday shopping season. On Friday, top Biden administration officials met with port operators and told them they should negotiate with the union ahead of Tuesday, according to a White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing meeting. Butler says he's hoping for an agreement or for government intervention to halt a strike. But the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents shippers and ports, and the longshoremen’s union haven't met since June. And no talks are scheduled. The union is demanding significantly higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and moving containers in the loading and unloading of freight. The Toy Association, the nation’s leading toy trade group, was among about 200 organizations that asked President Joe Biden in a letter this month to work with both sides to reach an agreement. The National Grain and Feed Association also urged Biden to take action to avert a strike, which would come just as harvest season gets underway. Their push has put Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a sensitive position: Both have courted union support and don't want to be seen as pressuring the longshoremen to reach a settlement. Yet if an extended strike were to cause shortages of consumer goods or fuel high inflation, it could cost Harris votes in the November election. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order to suspend the strike for an 80-day cooling-off period. Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that the administration has never invoked the act and isn't considering it now. Biden and Congress did step in two years ago to block a looming freight rail strike and force those workers to accept a deal because of widespread fears that a rail strike would have damaged the economy. Alex Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who served as a Labor Department official under Biden, suggested that the administration will follow the playbook it used in talks last year between West Coast ports and the union there: Mediating negotiations without directly intervening. Greg Ahearn, CEO of the Toy Association, said a strike would happen at a critical moment for toy sellers and makers: Up to 60% of annual sales occur from October through December. Though some toy companies shipped goods earlier, Ahearn said a strike would make it hard to replenish hot-selling items. A strike, he warned, could raise toy prices 'based on scarcity and increased costs.' At National Tree, Butler and his crew began preparing for a strike in July. They accelerated shipments for everything they could. But one major retail client, he said, asked for trees early. And until recently, factories in China and elsewhere couldn’t produce the rest of National Tree’s orders. Ships containing the trees are on the way to New York but won't get there before Tuesday. A prolonged strike, Butler said, would force most of the trees to be warehoused until next Christmas season. A longshoremen's strike would further distress a global supply chain that has already endured slowdowns from attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. Those attacks have all but shut down the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. The attacks are forcing longer transit times for vessels that must navigate around the Cape of Good Hope to reach East Coast and Gulf Coast ports. A dockworkers' strike, Gold said, could prove even more damaging than the pandemic-induced port congestion in 2021 and 2022, when cargo was allowed to move, albeit slowly. Eastern ports could be left at a standstill. Gold noted that carriers are already announcing surcharges on containers to address potential disruptions, a trend that could elevate inflation. Many retailers might find it difficult to charge customers more to make up for those expenses. Most vulnerable, Gold said, would be small businesses that don’t import directly and lack the financial resources to incur higher costs. Shippers could reroute some cargo to West Coast ports. But those ports couldn't come close to absorbing the additional cargo. The Port of Los Angeles, for example, moved 960,000 containers in August — about 80% of its capacity — said Gene Seroka, its executive director. The major Western railroads, Union Pacific and BNSF, have added capacity to their systems to handle more freight as imports have increased. Eastern railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern say they can move cars and crews to handle more freight coming to Chicago from the West. But it’s not clear just how much more the railroads can manage. In any case, Butler said, it would be too costly for him to ship trees across the country by rail. Taylor Green, co-founder of landscaping company Artificial Grass Solutions in Los Angeles, which imports artificial turf, said he bought 25% more turf than usual to ensure there would be enough for clients’ projects. He also made arrangements with alternative suppliers in case the strike goes on indefinitely. If it does, Green said, price increases would likely be necessary. Still, like some larger retailers and manufacturers, Artificial Grass says it's better prepared for shortages than it was during the pandemic. 'We’ve learned to be proactive rather than reactive,' Green said. ____ Associated Press Writers Anne D'Innocenzio and Mae Anderson in New York, Josh Boak in Washington and Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-us-retailers-brace-for-potential-pain-from-a-longshoremens-strike/	2024-09-29T06:14:25-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66f95331db86d5.07504581.jpeg?w=900
Harris-Trump race poses biggest test yet for reproductive rights	November will mark the first presidential election since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, posing the biggest test yet over the impact that women’s reproductive health will have up and down the ballot. Democrats rode anger about the overturning of Roe, which legalized abortion at the federal level, to a surprise victory during the 2022 midterm elections. And the party has racked up more wins in competitive races since then, with their success in large part attributed to the lingering power of the issue. Now, two years after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling, Democrats are hoping the issue resonates enough to propel Vice President Harris to the White House. 'Very rarely is an election decided on one issue,' said Christina Reynolds, senior vice president at EMILY’s List, a group dedicated to elected Democratic women in favor of abortion rights. '[But] there is a clear lean to one side and that side is the Democrats,' she added. 'People are actually understanding and seeing what happens and your best way to deal with this is elect the people who will protect your rights.' Anti-abortion advocates push back on this argument, pointing to governors with anti-abortion policies in Georgia and Texas. 'No incumbent pro-life governor or senator lost in 2022, despite facing very vocal pro-abortion Democrats like Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke,' said Emily Erin Davis, vice president of communications at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, 'Since the 2022 midterms, SBA Pro-Life America has invested significant resources in focus groups and polling to drill down on the most effective political messaging heading into 2024,' she said. The two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe has seen the issue largely kicked back to states, which conservatives and anti-abortion advocates have argued is where it belongs. 'Democrats won’t be getting the most bang for the buck anymore after this election on this issue simply because each of the states will have defined rules for themselves,' said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist. But Democrats point to polling that shows the issue playing to their advantage this November. A majority of voters have consistently opposed the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. According to a Marquette Law School poll released last month, 67 percent of respondents said they opposed the decision, while 33 percent said they favored it. Meanwhile, a CNN poll released earlier this week found that 52 percent of likely voters said they favored Harris’s approach to voters nationally, while 31 percent said they felt the same about Trump’s approach. 'We’re working with an electorate that really understands the harms that have come from these Trump abortion bans,' said Olivia Cappello of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. But Republicans note that abortion is not the only issue voters are voting on. 'The issue is important,' said Republican strategist Zack Roday. 'But I believe this election will be decided on who people believe can do a better job bringing down costs and keeping us safe.' According to data released by the Pew Research Center, 81 percent of voters said the economy was their top issue, followed by 65 percent who said the same about health care. Fifty one percent said the same about abortion. Democrats point to their past success in the 2022 midterm elections following the overturning of Roe. The midterm elections that year saw the expected red wave fail to materialize and a number of abortion-related ballot measures in red and blue states passing in favor of maintaining abortion access. This year, abortion-related measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Maryland, New York and Florida. 'On the ballot measure front, voters recognize that they have an opportunity in states that have direct democracy to make swift change in the state of abortion access in their state,' Cappello said. And unlike in 2022, access to in vitro fertilization is a central part of the conversation surrounding reproductive health care. Democrats have sought to tie Republicans to efforts in states like Alabama to limit or restrict access to the procedure. But many Republicans, including Trump, have expressed their support for the procedure. On Wednesday, the Trump campaign said if elected the former president would support 'universal access' to IVF. 'The stance that Trump has taken is the majority feeling within the Republican Party because at the end of the day, IVF is about life,' O’Connell said. But both candidates have addressed abortion and reproductive health. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this week, Trump predicted that under his administration women 'will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.' Harris has repeatedly hammered Trump on the issue, citing his appointment of conservative judges to the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, she called to eliminate the filibuster to codify abortion rights in the Constitution. Earlier this month during a campaign stop in the battleground state of Georgia, Harris highlighted the stories of two women, who Harris said died as a result of the state’s abortion ban passed by Republicans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. ProPublica first reported on the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller. Thurman waited 20 hours in a suburban Atlanta hospital after seeking medical care for an incomplete abortion, and, according to a state medical board review, died largely because of the hospital’s delay in treating her. Miller died after she did not seek medical care for complications from abortion medicine. Her family said she was fearful of getting medical treatment when it was clear the abortion was not complete. 'Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you’re about to die?' Harris said. Georgia’s six-week ban on the procedure does have exceptions to save the life of the mother, but opponents of the ban say it creates confusion for doctors. Earlier this week SBA Pro-Life America’s partner, the Women Speak Out PAC, launched a $500,000 television and digital ad campaign in Georgia, responding to Harris. The group accused Democrats, including Vice President Harris, of spreading 'deadly misinformation' about the women’s deaths. Conservatives and groups like SBA Pro-Life America are pushing Republicans to paint their Democratic counterparts are radical and extreme on the issue, something they have worked to do in the past. 'Many GOP candidates even won by double-digit margins. Republicans will see more victories going forward if they emphasize support for pro-life protections, communicate on the issue with compassion and contrast their position with the deeply unpopular Democrat agenda for unlimited abortion in the seventh, eighth, and ninth months of pregnancy,' Davis said. Roday noted that this cycle both sides find themselves in 'uncertain terrain' on the issue given the top of the ticket. 'Simply because of it being a presidential [election], I do believe it’s a whole new dynamic,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-race-poses-biggest-test-yet-for-reproductive-rights/	2024-09-29T05:31:22-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/Abortion-first_0929_AP_Mark-Schiefelbein.png?w=900
Gabby Petito's father has a mission to help the missing	(NewsNation) — Turning tragedy into purpose — that’s the mission of Joe Petito, whose daughter Gabby was found dead in September of 2021. Gabby Petito's death Gabby Petito’s disappearance sparked a national search and news coverage across the world, in television, newspapers and especially social media. The search ended 8 days after her parents reported her missing when her body was found at a Wyoming campsite. The FBI later announced that her fiance, Brian Laundrie, was found dead and left a confession admitting he killed her. Drone video shows moment missing girl found in woods 'We found her inside of, what, eight, nine days, and brought her home, you know, and across the country,' Joe Petito told NewsNation’s Marni Hughes. 'How do you say ‘thank you’ for something so overwhelming? I mean, billions of people [paid attention to her case]; it sounds funny saying it. But now we’ve got to get those stories for other people. Everyone deserves the same attention.' Petito spoke during a special episode of Missing, highlighting three years of bringing the stories of missing people to the audience. It’s an effort inspired by the search for Gabby Petito. 150 cases have been profiled on the show, and Joe Petito has made it his mission to help other families find missing loved ones. 'Since Gabby’s story, we've seen an influx of missing person cases not only hit the national news, but also on our social media pages,' he told Hughes. 'And that's been amazing to see. I mean, you have a missing show inspired by Gabby. How do you say ‘thank you’ for that? To be honest, and I know you're doing it to help others and all, but it just, it is humbling to see that Gabby was able to touch that many people and inspire that many people, and we're just trying to help as many people as we can because so many helped us.' Joe Petito and the Gabby Petito foundation One way he is doing that is with the Gabby Petito Foundation, with a mission of supporting the search for missing people and stopping domestic violence. 'Domestic violence is an issue that's as old as time, to be honest with you,' he said. 'We know so much more now than we did before. So really, it's about helping the youth understand certain signs, places to go, information. People don't even know where to begin. And that's always troubling. So we always give out the National Domestic Violence Hotline.' Boy abducted from California in 1951 found more than 70 years later The foundation also highlights the 'Hope Can’t Wait' campaign of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Another partnership is with the Black and Missing Foundation. 'Most of the missing stories that you see on the national stage have my complexion, you know, and that's just the way it is. I don't know why, but you know what? I'm not going to sit here and post blame,' Petio said.' I don't care where the blame lines, but we know there's an issue. So now moving forward, let's fix that.' To the families who are trying to find loved ones, he says the most important thing is to keep working to get their stories to the public, in any way possible. 'First of all, don't give up, you know, reach out to us. Reach out to friends, family, if you're more comfortable. But you have to keep pushing. You have to keep this story out there. You know, keep putting those flyers up. Keep calling the networks, keep trying to get as many stories out there. The more people that see it, the more that it's going to be shared. And that's it helps. It really does make a difference,' he said. Samantha Tapp left a strange trail years after she vanished Petito and the foundation are working with national, state and local organizations. He says they are currently focused on a lethality assessment at statewide levels. In 2023, the foundation was instrumental in helping lawmakers pass the Gabby Petito Act in Florida. 'The more we can get it out there, the more trainings that we can do, the more education we can give, he said. 'That's the goal, to no longer need foundations like the Gabby Petito Foundation, that's the goal. Put me out of business, please. That's for us to close my doors. It's fine. That means we did our job.' To watch the entire one-hour special episode of Missing, click here NEED LINK. Missing airs Thursdays in the NewsNation app and at newsnationnow.com.

Florida fishing community 'devastated' over hurricanes: Boat capt...	(NewsNation) — A Florida fishing community is reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, the latest in a series of storms to batter the region in recent months. Capt. Kenny Mullins, a local charter boat operator, described the devastation in Keaton Beach, a small coastal town north of Gainesville. 'We just had total devastation,' Mullins said in a phone interview on 'NewsNation Now.' 'Lots of us have lost our homes. I have three boats that are damaged. We don't know when we're going to be able to get back out on the water.' Helene aftermath: At least 56 dead, severe flood risk remains The community, which relies heavily on the fishing industry, was still recovering from Hurricane Idalia 13 months ago. Insurance costs for boat operators in the area are high, Mullins said, especially for those with multiple vessels. With the busy fishing season approaching, many captains are facing canceled bookings and requests for deposit refunds. 'We were living on pennies, waiting for this busy season to come in, and then this hit right at that time,' Mullins said. 'I don't know when I'll be able to work again.' Massive rains from powerful Hurricane Helene left people stranded, without shelter and awaiting rescue Saturday, as the cleanup began from a tempest that killed at least 56 people, caused widespread destruction across the U.S. Southeast and left millions without power. Fact-checking claims Harris and Trump have made about the border Mullins said that one of his fellow captains' houses was 'literally in a pile.' He also said that entire houses have been swept into canals, compounding the damage. Helene blew ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday with winds of 140 mph. Despite the challenges, Mullins expressed hope that the community would come together. He and other local boat operators are considering alternative ways to generate income, including selling gift certificates for future charters. 'Anything will help,' Mullins said.

Fact-checking claims Harris and Trump have made about the border	(NewsNation) — With a few weeks until the 2024 presidential election, border security has emerged as a central campaign issue. Both Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump are projecting tough stances on migration, making various claims about their records on border policy. NewsNation fact-checked these claims, revealing a mix of truths, exaggerations, and falsehoods from both candidates. Fact check: GOP claims on noncitizen voting lack evidence Harris: 'Most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico' Fact check: True Harris correctly stated that most fentanyl in America comes from two Mexican cartels, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA confirmed this, naming the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation Cartels as the primary sources of fentanyl entering the U.S., with most fentanyl seizures being at legal ports of entry. Harris: 'Last December I helped raise the rate of overtime pay for border agents' Fact check: True Harris accurately noted her support for increased overtime pay for border agents, as confirmed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. The act devoted $125 million to address overtime pay for Customs and Border Protection agents. This funding aims to support agents as they manage increased workloads at the border. Fact-checking Kamala Harris’ border claims in new ad Harris: 'In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system' Fact check: False Harris's claim that Trump 'did nothing' to address immigration during his presidency was found to be false. Trump implemented several measures, including the 'Remain in Mexico' policy and increased deportations, though these were often controversial. Harris: 'Donald Trump tanked [the border bill.] He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said stop the bill' Fact check: Misleading Harris has pointed to Trump as being responsible for blocking a key border security bill. However, this claim is misleading, as many proposed bills failed due to bipartisan disagreements rather than due to direct actions by Trump alone. DOJ accuses Alabama of clearing voter rolls too close to election Trump: 'He's allowed in my opinion...much more than 20 million people into our country' Fact check: False Trump's claim that the Biden administration has allowed 'much more than 20 million people' into the country is highly exaggerated, according to the House Committee on Homeland Security. The actual number of encounters at America's borders is expected to reach about 10 million by the end of the fiscal year, including repeat crossings and deportations. These encounters include repeat crossings and deportations, which means the actual number of unique individuals entering the country is much lower. Trump: 'That's the lowest point in the recorded history of the border' Fact check: Not entirely accurate Trump's assertion that illegal immigration reached its lowest point in history during his term is not entirely accurate. While there was a significant decline in crossings, FactCheck.org reports historical lows actually occurred in earlier decades, particularly in the early 2000s. In Pennsylvania, the Ukraine vote could prove pivotal Trump: 'We had the best numbers ever and we had them largely because of the wall' Fact check: Not entirely accurate The effectiveness of Trump's border wall construction is partially true. While it did lead to decreases in crossings in specific areas, Department of Homeland Security reports indicate it was just one aspect of a larger security strategy. Other measures, such as increased surveillance and policies like 'Remain in Mexico,' also played critical roles in reducing crossings. Trump: 'They're doing is protecting criminals which set loose illegal alien criminals rather than hand them over to ICE' Fact check: False Trump's characterization of sanctuary cities as places that protect criminals rather than handing them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is false, according to research from the American Immigration Council and Global Refugee. These cities often transfer individuals convicted of serious crimes to federal custody.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-border-claims-factcheck/	2024-09-28T16:05:10-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/snapshot-5-1.jpg?w=900
Trump posts, then deletes, fake image of Kamala Harris with Diddy	(NewsNation) — Former President Donald Trump reposted, then deleted, a fake image claiming to show a young Kamala Harris posing with Sean 'Diddy' Combs. It’s the latest of a handful of fake images that Trump has recently shared. The picture claiming to be Diddy, flanked by Harris and another woman, is actually a picture from 2001. And the man in the middle of the real image is talk show host Montel Williams, whom Harris dated at that time. The other woman is Ashley Williams, Montel Williams' daughter. The picture showed up online shortly after Diddy was indicted on a long list of charges, including racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. AI deepfake videos threaten election integrity: Expert Trump posted the image Friday on his Truth Social site and wrote: 'Kamala, doing the Diddy?' the text read. 'Madam Vice President, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?' Trump later deleted the post. Both candidates have crossed paths with Diddy. In 2020 on her X account, Harris thanked him for hosting a town hall about the impact of COVID-19 on Black communities. 'Thank you, @Diddy, for hosting this town hall last night,' the post read. 'There's a lot at stake for our communities right now, and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities.' Trump and Diddy have interacted many times over the years, including Trump attending Diddy’s 29th birthday party in 1998. AI-powered deepfake detection tool released by non-profit 'Donald Trump is a friend of mine, and he works very hard,' Diddy told the Washington Post in 2015. In 2012, Diddy appeared with Trump on an episode of 'The Celebrity Apprentice.' 'I love Diddy. You know he's a good friend of mine, he's a good guy,' Trump said. Trump’s recent history of sharing fake or AI-generated images on Truth Social includes two posts in August involving Taylor Swift. One showed women wearing 'Swifties for Trump' t-shirts. The other was a fabricated image of Swift that read 'Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.' Trump also shared a fabricated image of Harris addressing what appeared to be a Soviet Union–era gathering, complete with hammer and sickle symbols.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-posts-deletes-fake-image-of-harris-with-diddy/	2024-09-28T15:51:29-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2172703783.jpg?w=900
Elon Musk embraces role as pro-Trump 'megaphone'	Elon Musk has gone from a tech entrepreneur largely avoidant of politics to what strategists call a 'megaphone' for right-wing views as an online surrogate for former President Trump in the White House race. The tech mogul began wading into the political landscape a few years ago, but the past few months have marked a significant increase in his partisan discourse, political experts said. His embrace of Republican politics and Trump can now be seen nearly daily on his social media platform X, which was known as Twitter until he bought it in 2022. DOJ accuses Alabama of clearing voter rolls too close to election Political strategists on both sides of the aisle contend Musk’s ramped up political activity – combined with his wealth and online visibility – could be an asset for Trump, whom he endorsed in July following the first assassination attempt on the former president. 'He probably does more to highlight the problems at the border than the entire corporate media complex just because of the size of his soapbox,' said one Republican strategist. The strategist compared Musk's shift into politics to Trump's, calling the Tesla and SpaceX CEO 'a quirky character that essentially pretty much everyone liked until he managed to buy Twitter and leaned in on some issues.' 'Donald Trump was immensely popular until he got involved in politics, and then half the country doesn’t like him,' the strategist said. A Wall Street Journal analysis of Musk’s posts on X this year found he had about 230 times as many exchanges a month that contain political terms in 2024 compared with 2019, while a Washington Post analysis said nearly 20 percent of his posts this year have been political. 'I would argue that anything that Musk says, you imagine, has been cosigned or even instigated by Donald Trump,' political strategist Basil Smikle told The Hill. Musk’s recent posts on X have ranged from reposting tweets criticizing Democrats — especially Vice President Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — to direct comments about Trump and the benefits of his re-election. Mark Robinson burns hand at event, returns to campaign Saturday Earlier this month, Musk claimed 'America will fall to tyranny' unless Trump is elected, garnering 83 million views. In another post following the second assassination attempt on Trump’s life, Musk wrote, 'The incitement to hatred and violence against President Trump by the media and leading Democrats needs to stop.' Musk's posts and actions mark a sharp contrast from nearly 10 years ago, when he told Vanity Fair in 2015 that he gets 'involved in politics as little as possible,' though his business ventures sometimes required him to get involved to 'some amount.' In that same interview, Musk said he hoped Trump would not get the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, saying 'that wouldn’t be good.' His amped-up political involvement has drawn scrutiny from the left, some of whom argue his sharing of misinformation or conspiracy theories could negatively impact Democrats’ prospects in November. 'It's totally putting a finger on the scale of our information ecosystem, with already such a tough landscape, and I think also a landscape that disadvantages Democrats from traditional media all the way to social media,' Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff said. Musk — the most followed user on X with nearly 199 million followers — drew criticism earlier this month when he reposted a since-deleted tweet about rumors of 'explosives' found in a car near a Trump rally, writing 'Wow,' on X. The post now has a community note clarifying New York officials denied the reports but still appears on Musk’s feed. In another post after the second attempt on Trump’s life, Musk came under fire for writing 'no one is even trying' to assassinate Harris in what he called a 'joke.' He later deleted the tweet amid backlash. 'Elon Musk is blatantly allowing misinformation to flow through that platform, that's just not. It's not good for democracy,' Democratic strategist Rodell Mollineau said. Five things to know about Social Security reforms being considered in Congress Musk is in a complex position as both the owner of a social media platform and a public, now partisan figure, strategists suggested. Since purchasing X in 2022, the tech mogul took a new approach to the platform's content policies, cutting back on several moderation features. The lack of moderation prompted various advertisers to flee the site and launch legal inquiries into company practices. The platform’s algorithm has since been accused of favoring Musk’s posts, drawing concerns from some strategists about his influence on voters. 'The voter may experience a different type of influence on his [Musk’s] part, in the sense that they may see his tweets, but what they’re unsure of is how much his leadership of X is influencing the algorithm so that the voter is seeing something different than they would have seen had he not moved in,' Smikle said. This 'helps Trump,' Smikle said, because 'it makes it feel to the viewer, to the consumer, that it is more organic than it probably is.' Another Trump ally agreed, stating Musk is 'extremely helpful' by simply using his X account to push attacks on Democrats that tend to get millions of views on the platform. Smikle went as far to say that he is 'getting a lot more antidemocratic content' on his feed since Musk’s takeover. 'I have seen a ton more anti Harris tweets by people of color and specifically African Americans, than I ever than I have seen any such, any such activity toward the Democrats or toward Biden,' he said, adding later, 'That’s where Trump gets help and Kamala gets hurt.' Todd Belt, the director of the political management program at the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University, argued X’s algorithm puts Musk 'front and center,' but expressed doubt it could have any tangible effect on influencing voters. 'I don't know that it has a tremendous amount of effect, because it gets lost in all the noise of the campaign, right?' Belt told The Hill. 'It stimulates and activates the base,' he continued, 'but I don't think it's convincing people.' Wisconsin Supreme Court says Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name will remain on swing state’s ballot X nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to The Hill’s request for comment. As Musk aligned with Trump, the former president returned to posting on the platform in July. Trump's account was reinstated in 2023 after pre-Musk management banned him in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Musk restored Trump's account last year amid a slew of other content moderation changes, which drew praise from right-wing personalities and concerns from online misinformation groups. The X owner’s political reach has also stretched to the financial side. Musk has backed Save America PAC, a political group that has spent tens of millions of dollars on get out the vote efforts the Trump campaign is relying on to turn out low-propensity voters in swing states. Trump even suggested he would put Musk in his Cabinet before backtracking, saying the mogul would probably be too busy. The former president then said this month he would create a 'government efficiency commission' and tap Musk to lead the effort if he is reelected in November. Musk, who has long advocated for a smaller government, discussed the concept during a X Spaces conversation last month, suggesting such a panel could look at national debt and how Congress can reevaluate spending. It remains unclear exactly what this commission would do, and some Democrats have questioned whether it would be a serious effort.

ICE released over 435,000 migrants with criminal convictions, dat...	McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) -- The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told a Texas border lawmaker this week that 435,000 undocumented migrants with criminal convictions have been released by the agency to cities around the United States. Border Report Live: Where illegal immigration is trending up ICE Deputy Director Patrick Lechleitner sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, saying as of July 21, there were 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on the agency's non-detained docket (NDD), meaning they are not detained while they await immigration proceedings. 'Of those, 435,719 are convicted criminals, and 226,847 have pending criminal charges,' Lechleitner wrote. The letter was sent after Gonzales in March asked the Department of Homeland Security for data on migrants with criminal backgrounds. Gonzales is a member of the GOP-led House Homeland Security Committee. 'The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing, and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies,' Gonzales said Friday. 'It’s time for Washington to move past rhetoric and toward results. Americans deserve to feel safe in their communities. On Friday, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, of Tennessee, called the new information 'shocking.' 'It may be shocking to hear that the Biden-Harris administration is actively releasing tens of thousands of criminal illegal aliens into our communities, but their own numbers conclusively prove this to be the case. This defies all common sense,' Green said in a statement. ‘Backdoor amnesty’: 14 GOP senators file bill to stop Biden’s immigrant parole program 'DHS law enforcement has been directed to mass-release illegal aliens whom they know have criminal convictions or are facing charges for serious crimes—and these dangerous, destructive individuals are making their way into every city and state in this country. How many more Americans need to die or be victimized before this administration is forced to abide by the laws they swore to uphold? This is madness. It is something no civilized, well-functioning society should tolerate,' Green said. According to Lechleitner, 62,231 noncitizens with criminal convictions for assault currently are not detained by ICE and have been released; 42,915 have pending assault charges. The agency currently is holding 2,348 noncitizens who have been convicted of assault and 1,498 who have pending charges. The agency also has released 15,811 who have been convicted of sexual assault, 56,533 noncitizens convicted of drug possession, and 2,521 who have been convicted on kidnapping, according to the letter. (ICE Graphic) Lechleitner blames some of the releases on law enforcement in 'sanctuary cities' not cooperating with ICE. 'Some jurisdictions have reduced their cooperation with ICE, to include refusal to honor ICE detainer requests, even for noncitizens who have been convicted of serious felonies and pose an ongoing threat to public safety. ICE recognizes that some jurisdictions are concerned that cooperating with federal immigration officials will erode trust with immigrant communities and make it harder for local law enforcement to serve those populations. However, 'sanctuary' policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victimize those same communities,' Lechleitner wrote. He also called the nation's immigration system 'broken' and said Congress needs to better fund DHS. Gonzales said that as an Appropriator, he vows to ensure ICE has the resources necessary to deport noncitizens with a criminal record 'This must be a priority,' he said. 'The Biden-Harris administration also plays a part in cleaning up the mess their failed policies have created. They have the ear of sanctuary city mayors — it’s time to encourage them to reverse course and put the safety of American citizens first.' Lechleitner said that under the Biden administration, DHS is removing and returning 'record numbers of migrants who are unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States and prioritizing for removal those who present national security and public safety risks and recent border crossers.' A Homeland Security official monitored media who were allowed on the tarmac before dawn on Tuesday, May 17, 2022, to watch an ICE Air expulsion flight with 132 migrants being deported from Harlingen, Texas, to Guatemala. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report) Since May 2023 through July, DHS has removed or returned nearly 900,000 individuals, he says. He added that ICE is not allowed to release certain noncitizens from the agency's custody including those convicted of homicide. Other cases are determined 'on a case-by-case basis and take into account the individual case circumstances, primarily considering risk of flight, national security threat, and threat to public safety,' he wrote. ICE has the capacity to hold 41,500 noncitizens in Fiscal Year 2024, which is up from 34,000 in Fiscal Year 2023.

How climate change is intensifying storms like Hurricane Helene	(The Hill) — Climate change is making hurricanes like Hurricane Helene more intense, scientific research shows. Helene has unleashed high winds, heavy rain and a dangerous storm surge in the Southeast after making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane Thursday night. As of Friday afternoon, the estimated death toll of the storm had climbed to more than 40 across four states. It follows roughly two and a half months after Hurricane Beryl — which peaked as a Category 5 storm — tracked destruction across the Caribbean as well as the United States, killing dozens of people. The proportion of hurricanes that fall into these more intense categories 4 and 5 are expected to increase as the planet heats up, according to the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a well-respected climate science authority from the United Nations. Peak hurricane wind speeds are also expected to rise. 'These hurricanes are getting bigger and stronger and that is due to simple energy transfer,' said Claudia Benitez-Nelson, a climate scientist at the University of South Carolina. Benitez-Nelson explained that a hotter planet means more energy can transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere. 'And what are hurricanes? They're big balls of energy and so that energy is now feeding into these tropical storms,' she said. That transferring effect is expected to continue and worsen as the planet heats up. Estimates of just how much it will do so can vary. But if the planet warms up by about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels, a hurricane’s maximum wind speeds could increase by about 5 percent, according to Tom Knutson, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab. Noting the increase in wind speeds, earlier this year scientists suggested adding a Category 6 to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, saying that the currently used categories 1 through 5 are 'inadequate' as hurricanes continue to intensify. In addition to making hurricanes overall more intense, Benitez-Nelson noted that climate change is also causing hurricanes to intensify more quickly, potentially giving people less time to prepare. Hurricane Helene went from a Category 1 storm to a Category 4 in less than a day amid unusually warm ocean temperatures. Benitez-Nelson, who is a member of the climate education group Science Moms, said increased global temperatures lead to increased ocean temperatures that in turn lead to a 'more effective transfer of heat.' She added that this 'really helps to spin up a hurricane that moves from a tropical storm to a hurricane, and then makes these hurricanes even stronger and intensify more rapidly.' As well as fueling increased wind speeds, Knutson noted that climate change is also likely causing more rainfall to occur during hurricanes. 'With the warmer climate, the atmosphere is holding more water vapor systematically, and that's leading the storms to become basically bigger, more intense rain producers,' Knutson said. 'The air is holding more moisture than previously, so that causes some increase in the rainfall rates.' He added that modeling shows that every additional degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in the regional sea surface temperatures where the hurricane is leads to an average of 7 percent more rainfall. The Earth’s surface has already warmed by an average of about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) when compared to preindustrial levels, but the actual level of warming can vary across regions and between lands and oceans. Benitez-Nelson added that as hurricanes become stronger they also don’t dissipate as quickly and can move further inland, including to places that are not used to dealing with them. 'Hot air can hold more water,' she said. 'And it's dumping massive amounts of water in places that simply are ill prepared to handle that amount of rainfall.' She pointed to impacts from Hurricane Beryl’s remnants that made their way to Vermont earlier this year. 'That's ridiculous ... but that is our future,' she said. And beyond climate change’s own impacts on hurricanes, these storms can combine with other climate impacts like sea level rise to bring about more damage. 'Our ocean has been rising, and so, of course it has an impact when a hurricane comes along because now the height of your water is already higher and then you've got the storm surge on top of that,' said Jennifer Collins, a professor at the University of South Florida School of Geosciences. Collins expressed concern that going forward, this will cause significant harm, as people tend to pay more attention to a hurricane’s wind speed than its flood potential. 'We've seen other storms in the past that have had significant flooding from one of these weaker storms,' Collins said. 'I am very concerned about those type of storms, honestly, because people made their evacuation decisions sometimes purely based on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.' Climate change is caused by human activity releasing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which get trapped in the atmosphere and create a greenhouse effect that warms the planet. The burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change, though other parts of the economy like agriculture and landfills are also major contributors. Benitez-Nelson said that to prevent climate-related harm going forward, 'the biggest thing that we can do is reduce emissions.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/how-climate-change-is-intensifying-storms-like-hurricane-helene/	2024-09-28T07:05:50-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-2175042103-1-e1727483301635.jpg?w=800
Social Security COLA raise: How much will recipients get in 2025?	(NEXSTAR) – The Social Security Administration is less than two weeks away from announcing its cost of living adjustment (COLA), the percent increase in recipients' payments designed to offset inflation. According to the latest estimates, the COLA forecast is expected to be about 2.5%, but we'll have to wait for the Oct. 10 announcement to know for sure. The estimate comes from The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) and is based on a decline in consumer price inflation from 2.9% in July to 2.5% in August. 'Ensuring that seniors have enough to feed and house themselves with dignity is a major reason why we advocate for a minimum COLA of 3%,' Shannon Benton, TSCL's executive director, said in a news release. 'TSCL research shows that approximately two-thirds of seniors rely on Social Security for more than half of their monthly income, and 28% depend on it entirely.' Free COVID tests will be available again soon: How to get yours The projected COLA increase is less than it was in 2024, when beneficiaries received a 3.2% bump. The Social Security Administration calculates the COLA using average inflation data from the Consumer Price Index during July, August and September. While there's never been a negative adjustment, the COLA has been as low as 0% in 2010, 2011 and 2016. The largest COLA of the last two decades was 8.7% as the U.S. experienced soaring inflation in 2023. The greatest ever was in 1980 at 14%, SSA tables show. TSCL says its research shows that a combination of soaring health care costs and inadequate COLAs have decimated the buying power of these income bumps by 'over thirty percent.' The rising cost of Medicare, for instance, isn't covered in the COLA calculations, and some politicians are proposing a change. 'A monthly Social Security check is how most seniors make ends meet, we need it to pay our bills and pay for health co-pays and medications,' said U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), who introduced the Boosting Benefits and COLAs for Seniors Act in March. The bill was introduced and referred to the Committee on Finance, but has yet to see a vote in Congress.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/social-security-cola-raise-how-much-will-recipients-get-in-2025/	2024-09-28T07:00:40-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/GettyImages-1310131960-6.jpg?w=724
Helene causes Tennessee dam collapse, severe flood risk remains	(NewsNation) — The worst of Helene’s storm is behind, but catastrophic flooding as it moves east toward Kentucky and Tennessee is highly possible. A major dam in northeast Tennessee collapsed around 7:11 a.m. ET, according to an alert from the National Water Prediction Service at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Early Saturday morning, the National Weather Service warned of an 'imminent breach' of the Nolichucky Dam on the Nolichucky River, urging immediate evacuation. The area is about 70 miles northeast of the tourist town of Pigeon Forge. A flash flood warning is in effect until noon ET. 'Move to higher ground now! This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,' the flash flood warning said. 'Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.' ⚠️ Flash Flood Warning for Imminent Breach of Nolichucky Dam Continues****Here is a detailed map of the impacted areas. The area in light red is the Flash Flood Emergency. ****https://t.co/hrzko3VCES https://t.co/UAJlLDc8mD&mdash; NWS Morristown (@NWSMorristown) September 28, 2024 At least 44 people died in five states from storm-related causes following Helene’s landfall Thursday night. The Category 4 hurricane reached wind speeds up to 140 mph. Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia experienced heavy rainfall and severe flooding on Friday, and each governor declared a state of emergency to receive federal assistance. Multiple deaths have been attributed to drowning, while some were the result of downed trees. State officials say dozens more are still trapped inside their homes, The Associated Press reports at least two died from a suspected tornado in Georgia. Keaton Beach, Florida, ‘unrecognizable’ in Helene’s wake: Resident As Helene continues to move eastward, the amount of rainfall will decrease. 'Most of the rainfall across the central and southern Appalachians has come to an end, although a few lingering showers are possible through Saturday,' the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. Several flood warnings remain in effect across the southeast. Some of the worst destruction occurred in the storm’s center in Florida’s Big Bend region and South Georgia. But inland cities like Atlanta and Asheville were not shielded from the storm’s impact. Within 48 hours, Atlanta received a record 11.62 inches of rain, according to the National Hurricane Center’s Weather Prediction Center data. Asheville received 13.15 inches of rain. Tornadoes also hit some areas, including one in Nash County, North Carolina, critically injuring four people, according to the AP. How to donate and assist Helene victims and survivors Around 3.8 million people are without electricity on Saturday; the majority of which are in South Carolina, with just over 1 million. Florida’s emergency services worked speedily, lowering the number of outages to 480,000. The entire community in Taylor County, Florida, still does not have power. Andrew Morgan, the county’s emergency management public information officer, said crews have worked tirelessly to clear 90% of all major roads, and once the roads are clear, they can begin fixing power lines. 'We’re going to continue to just move forward and clear out the debris and keep searching and we’ll get back to where we were before this,' Morgan said. Moody’s Analytics, a company that analyzes economic research, estimates up to $26 billion in property damage caused by Helene. Hurricane Helene rescues stretch resources Valdosta, Georgia, was directly hit. A 135-year-old shopping mall, which housed over 50 businesses, was torn apart brick by brick. The owner told NewsNation that rebuilding is not an option. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will tour the damage in Valdosta sometime Saturday. 'The winds were really, really strong and picked up a lot of trees … motorcycles, cars were moving around,' said Valdosta resident Vonquez Garland. 'Houses were shaking. It’s a lot of oak trees completely out of the ground.' 'When I woke up, there was stuff everywhere.

Mark Robinson hospitalized: Sources	Two sources tell NewsNation's Libbey Dean that embattled North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson was rushed to a hospital Friday night. One source says that Robinson quickly left a campaign event in Mt. Airy, N.C., and remains in the hospital tonight. Robinson has been under intense pressure to quit his campaign for governor, and even to resign his current post, since CNN found old social media posts in which Robinson referred to himself as a ‘black NAZI;' said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as 'worse than a maggot.' Mark Robinson threatens CNN for bombshell report Brian LiVecchi, Robinson's chief of staff and general counsel, will resign effective next Tuesday, according to a friend. Over the weekend, Robinson announced that four key staff members on his gubernatorial campaign staff had left their jobs. Robinson denied writing the messages that CNN says were from more than a decade ago. He said Tuesday his campaign has hired a law firm to help investigate how what Robinson calls 'false smears' originated. But that hasn't stopped top Republicans from distancing themselves from Robinson. Former NBA star says Eric Adams ghosted him on Turkey’s orders Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump endorsed Robinson before the March primary and has let Robinson speak at the former president’s in-state rallies. But he was not involved in Trump rallies on Wednesday in suburban Charlotte and last weekend in Wilmington. This is a developing story. Check back for update.

50+ people awaiting rescue on roof of Tennessee hospital	UNICOI COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) — More than 50 people were sent to the roof of a Tennessee hospital on Friday and were awaiting rescue as flooding cut the hospital off from land, according to Ballad Health. Ballad, a hospital chain headquartered in Tennessee, said at 10:45 a.m. that the Unicoi County Hospital had closed and suspended operations due to the threat of flooding. Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency told hospital leadership that the hospital needed to be evacuated due to the 'unusually high and rising water from the Nolichucky River.' There were 11 patients at the hospital that Ballad planned to transfer. However, ambulances sent to evacuate the patients could not safely get to them due to the rising water. 'The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water,' Ballad said in a news release. The water started coming into the building and was moving so quickly, rescue boats weren't able to safely navigate the area. Ballad confirmed that as of 12:27 p.m., 54 people had been relocated to the hospital's roof. 'Due to high winds, no helicopters could safely fly in an effort to help evacuate the hospital,' the company said. By 2:50 p.m., conditions had improved and rescues by helicopter got underway. Nexstar's WJHL made attempts to get close to the hospital, but roads in the area are impassable. WJHL's Drone 11 was able to capture video of the people stranded on the roof. The drone footage also shows the extent of the flooding in the area. WATCH: Drifting boat ripped below bridge as Roan Mountain floods Photo: Carolina Avenue in Unicoi County.

Satellite video shows 'potentially historic' Helene from space	(NEXSTAR) – The view on land in Florida Thursday afternoon was overcast and stormy, but incoming Hurricane Helene looked even more ominous from space. The storm was upgraded to a Category 3 as it barreled toward the Florida coast. It could be seen churning over the Gulf of Mexico and picking up steam in satellite videos taken by NOAA. The bands of clouds stretching out from the hurricane's eye are so vast, they obscure almost the entire Southeastern United States when seen from space. Helene weakens to tropical storm, at least 4 dead This satellite image provided by NOAA shows Hurricane Helene advancing across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida on Thursday, Sept. 26, 2024. (NOAA via AP) Helene was expected to make landfall Thursday evening along Florida's northwest coast. The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee forecast storm surges of up to 20 feet and warned they could be particularly 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' in Apalachee Bay. It added that high winds and heavy rains also posed risks. 'You cannot survive 20 feet or even 15 feet of storm surge,' said Jeff Berardelli, chief meteorologist at NewsNation affiliate WFLA. 'If you’re near the water and you know you’re going to flood, especially if you’re in a mobile home, too. You’ve got to go. You cannot take your chances. This is not survivable.' The dangerous impacts of Helene could extend far beyond Florida. While the hurricane will likely weaken as it moves inland, damaging winds and heavy rain were expected to extend to the southern Appalachian Mountains, where landslides were possible, forecasters said. For Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. Close Thank you for signing up!

'This is a potentially historic event with catastrophic, deadly consequences. This is not a maybe. This is on track to happen. So please, please take every precaution to take yourself out of harm’s way,' said Taylor Jones, emergency services director in Buncombe County, North Carolina. Lesser tropical storm warnings were issued as far north as North Carolina, and officials warned that much of the region could experience prolonged power outages and flooding.

(NewsNation) — After making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene is continuing to track inland as a weakened tropical storm, bringing flooding and leaving millions without power in the southeast. There have been four reported fatalities from the storm so far after catastrophic flooding and storm surgery that left destruction in their wake. A person died from a falling sign on a Tampa roadway during the storm, according to Gov. Ron DeSantis, and two others died in a possible tornado in south Georgia as the storm approached, according to the Associated Press. A fourth person in Jeff Davis County, Georgia, died, according to NewsNation affiliate WSAV.

Trump rally moved over Secret Service staffing concerns	Former President Trump moved the venue for his Saturday campaign rally in Wisconsin amid concerns over Secret Service staffing, a senior official briefed on the planning confirmed to The Hill. Trump was reportedly expected to hold his campaign event at an outside airport, according to NBC and CBS News, which first reported details of the switch. The senior official confirmed that his event was moved to a smaller venue given a shortage of Secret Service staff – an event that also coincided with the United Nationals General Assembly. 'The agency was never configured to provide such an elevated level of protection for an increasing number of protectees. Our personnel and equipment are being pushed to their limits to sustain the current operational tempo,' the senior official said. How to watch the Vance-Walz vice presidential debate 'This proposed Wisconsin event also took place during the United Nations General Assembly, where the Secret Service is responsible for the safety and security of over 140 world leaders amid a challenged global threat level,' the senior official noted. The senior official also noted that acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has been advocating for a 'paradigm shift.' 'This paradigm shift would also position the agency to enhance its operational readiness to reduce reliance on external partners when providing heightened protection,' the official said. An advisory on the Trump campaign website notes the event is scheduled to take place at the Prairie du Chien Area Arts Center. U.S. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi noted that the agency could not offer specifics on resources allocated for the event. 'Former President Donald Trump is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection and our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times,' Guglielmi explained. 'Out of concern for operational security, we cannot provide specific details about resources allocated for event security or communications between agency personnel and our protectees.' How to register to vote The development comes as the U.S. Secret Service has been under heightened scrutiny amid two failed assassination attempts against the former president, with the first attempt causing injuries to Trump’s ear. A bipartisan House task force has been created to investigate the Trump assassination attempts, which held its first hearing on Thursday. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee separately released a report this week which detailed shortcomings around how the Secret Service handling of the July assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. The Hill has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-rally-moved-over-secret-service-staffing-concerns/	2024-09-27T07:46:41-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/roweronald_secretservice2_073024_AP.jpg?w=900
NYC Mayor Eric Adams to appear in federal court Friday	(NewsNation) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams will go before a New York federal judge Friday on charges alleging he accepted bribes and illegal foreign campaign contributions. Friday’s arraignment at noon ET will mark Adams’ first court appearance on federal conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery allegations. The court procedure typically involves a formal reading of the charges, often followed by an initial plea. It’s not uncommon for criminal defendants to plead not guilty at that time. It’s unclear whether Adams will turn himself in or if authorities will take the mayor into federal custody. Adams said Thursday he has no plans to resign. NewsNation will cover Friday’s court appearance and publish updates as they become available. Mayor Eric Adams corruption investigation, indictment: Timeline What is Eric Adams accused of? The accusations against Adams are outlined in a 57-page grand jury indictment that a judge unsealed Thursday. The indictment comes on the heels of a widespread ongoing investigation into the mayor’s administration and the resignation of several top city officials. Adams — who oversees public operations in the nation’s largest city — is accused of accepting bribes from foreign nationals and taking illegal campaign contributions in exchange for favors. Authorities said this included helping Turkish officials secure fire-safety approvals for a 36-story Turkish consulate building even though it didn’t pass inspection. The allegations of long-running corruption date back nearly a decade, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a Thursday news conference announcing the indictment. They include alleged straw donor contributions and abuse of a city program that promised to provide up to $8 in matching funds for each $1 of up to $250 in donations from New York City residents. That amounts to nearly $13,000 in matching funds during the 2021 election cycle, according to charging documents. Harris to visit southern border for first time in 3 years What's next for Eric Adams, New Yorkers? Adams addressed the charges at a news conference Thursday when he told New Yorkers to 'wait to hear our defense before making any judgments.' Several top city officials have announced their resignation from the Adams administration in recent weeks. It’s unclear if or how those resignations may be connected to the mayor’s criminal case. 'The conduct alleged in the indictment, the foreign money, the corporate money, the bribery, the years of concealment, is a grave breach of the public’s trust,' Williams said Thursday. 'We continue to dig, and we will hold more people accountable.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/eric-adams-new-york-city-charges-court/	2024-09-27T06:26:45-07:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/66005dbace75c0.94178341.jpeg?w=900
Harris to visit southern border for first time in 3 years	(NewsNation) — Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in three years Friday, and the first time since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, in hopes of addressing one of the biggest topics on voters’ minds. Harris will deliver a speech on immigration policy in Douglas, Arizona, a mostly Democratic border town with 16,000 residents. Harris and the Biden administration have faced criticism for their handling of border security and immigration. Former President Donald Trump has faulted her for spending little time at the border during her vice presidency. The last time she was publicly known to have been at the border was in 2021 when she toured a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing center in El Paso, Texas. Trump seeks to bolster advantage among male voters FILE - Vice President Kamala Harris talks to the media, June 25, 2021, after her tour of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Central Processing Center in El Paso, Texas. Harris visited the U.S. southern border as part of her role leading the Biden administration's response to a steep increase in migration. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) 'The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games,' Harris plans to say in the speech, according to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign, the Associated Press reported. Douglas is an overwhelmingly Democratic border town in GOP-dominated Cochise County, where the Republicans on the board of supervisors are facing criminal charges for refusing to certify the 2022 election results. Trump was in the area last month, using a remote stretch of border wall and a pile of steel beams to draw a contrast between himself and Harris on border security. Harris struggles to break through with young Latinos On Thursday, Trump gave a speech in New York giving his opinion on Harris’ visit that hadn’t happened yet: 'Anything she says tomorrow, you know is a fraud because she was the worst in history at protecting our country. So, she’ll try and make herself look a little bit better. But it’s not possible.' Election day is less than six weeks away, and Arizona is a key battleground state with the potential to swing the election for either Harris or Trump.
