CA firefighters face impersonators, staffing shortages, low pay	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles firefighters battling historic urban blazes face mounting challenges beyond the flames, including criminals impersonating first responders and critical staffing shortages. Officials report 29 arrests connected to the fires, including an incident where police detained two men on Vice President Kamala Harris's property during curfew hours. In one of the most brazen cases, authorities arrested a man dressed as a firefighter who was caught burglarizing a home in the evacuation zone. 'Zero tolerance for crime,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. 'If you are bold enough to go into a fire area and attempt to break in homes or [engage in] looting of any type, you will be arrested.' Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said he encountered a man dressed as a firefighter burglarizing a home. 'I saw a gentleman that looked like a firefighter, and I asked him if he was okay because he was sitting down. I didn’t realize we had him in handcuffs. We are turning them over to LAPD because he was dressed like a fireman and he was not. He just got caught burglarizing a home,' Luna said. Meanwhile, firefighter advocacy groups are pushing for permanent pay increases as staffing shortages reach critical levels. While California state firefighters earn approximately $52,000 annually, U.S. Forest Service wildland firefighters make significantly less at about $36,000 per year, with no hazard pay or health insurance benefits. What we know about how the LA wildfires started Federal wildland firefighters currently receive a temporary pay increase authorized by President Joe Biden, extended through March. Without congressional action to make the increase permanent, these firefighters could see their wages cut in half. The crisis is exacerbated by year-round fire seasons, with many firefighters working 18-22 hour shifts under dangerous conditions. 'At base rate, it's 50 to 100% difference between the feds versus an organization like Cal Fire that's paying significantly more,' Luke Mayfield, president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters said. Adding to the strain, a large portion of the federal firefighting workforce is typically laid off outside traditional fire seasons, despite the evolving nature of fire threats. 'A lot of that mitigation and management work is hazardous. It should have hazard pay attached to it,' Mayfield said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/ca-firefighters-face-impersonators-staffing-shortages-low-pay/	2025-01-12T17:19:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675913a511c130.57131305.jpeg?w=900
Trump slams officials’ handling of Los Angeles inferno: 'Incompet...	WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump slammed Los Angeles officials’ handling of the wildfires Sunday, calling them 'incompetent' and questioning why they have not yet contained the blaze. 'The fires are still raging in L.A,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.' Death toll reaches 16 in LA wildfires, more wind expected 'Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place. This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?' he concluded. As Los Angeles continues to burn, California politicians have come under sharp criticism by the soon-to-be 47th president, specifically for the state’s water management. Trump has hurled blame at Governor Gavin Newsom (D) – whom he has feuded with for years – for the wildfire crisis, proclaiming he should resign. In a post on his social media site earlier in the week, Trump wrote that Newsom 'refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water' to areas now burning, alleging he prioritized 'small fish' over California residents. Newsom swiped back Saturday, insisting Trump’s accusations were 'made up' and 'delusional.' 'The Delta smelt somehow being culpable of somehow leading to some of the challenges that we face down here… it’s made up, it’s delusional,' Newsom said during an interview on 'Pod Save America'. 'It’s so profoundly ignorant and yet [Trump] absolutely believes it,' Newsom continued. 'It’s not an ignorance on his part, it’s sort of an indelible misinformation that he sort of manifested a falsehood and he decided to bring it into this crisis, in a profoundly demeaning and damaging way.' The governor has since launched a website to combat 'misinformation' being spread about the disaster, which addresses claims on resources, funding, and policies. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues Newsom sent a letter to Trump dated Friday – and publicly posted to his X account – inviting the president-elect to survey the devastation firsthand and meet with fire victims and first responders. The California governor said Trump has not responded to his invitation as of Sunday. At least 16 people have been killed by the inferno in the Los Angeles region, and officials warn there will likely be 'a lot more' added to the death toll. The wildfires have burnt at least 40,000 acres and destroyed at least 12,000 structures.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-los-angeles-wildfires/	2025-01-12T12:36:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192426947.jpg?w=900
Altadena, small LA-area town, decimated by Eaton Fire	(NewsNation) — Rubble and debris litter the small town of Altadena, California, whose approximately 44,000 residents are scrambling after the Eaton Fire destroyed homes, churches, businesses and everything in between. 'Hotel to hotel until I get some assistance. I have nothing but my dogs and me,' said Tonya Robinson, who lives in Altadena, as she fought back tears. 'One thing I do have is God. My church here where I'm at right now, I got food, I got blankets, I got food for my dogs. I got everything that I need right now.' Altadena, about 14 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, is known for its resilient working class. The Eaton Fire was 27% contained as of Sunday morning, according to the Los Angeles National Forest. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., recently spoke to NewsNation about the area, which is within her district. 'Altadena has working people, people who may not have enough money by which to go and rent a hotel, maybe for, you know, months to come,' she said Friday. 'I would like to ask you and any other media individuals that may be listening to do everything that you can to get attention on Altadena.' Waters said the area 'has just about been flattened.' California’s working class overlooked amid wildfires, US rep says Up in flames within four minutes Altadena residents Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling lost their home in the Eaton Fire after evacuating with their 3-year-old daughter, who will turn four soon. 'We went to bed feeling a little uneasy, and I was checking my phone every few minutes for updates,' Kiessling said. The next morning, Rhodes went outside to get the car ready. 'Within minutes, he came inside and said, 'We have to go right now,'' Kiessling said. 'It took four minutes for our house to go up (in flames).' They were one of more than 150,000 who were forced to flee in the greater Los Angeles area. They were only able to grab some clothes and important papers and drove about 40 miles away to stay with friends. Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issues 11 dead, all from Altadena Eleven people have died from the Eaton Fire, all of which were Altadena residents, NewsNation affiliate KTLA reported. Scenes of devastation have replaced what was once a thriving middle and working class community in Altadena. In a matter of days, thousands have lost their homes. In some cases, entire blocks are wiped off the map. Homes passed down from generation to generation are gone. 'Everything's gone, and it's just so devastating, just my whole neighborhood, both streets, I'm a corner house, and from the small street going down to the street going across, there's no homes, maybe one. And it's just, it's just devastating,' said Kimberly Grant, an Altadena resident and business owner, to NewsNation. Altadena town Councilmember Sylvia Vega detailed the devastation on NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning. 'When something happens, you want to be able to be able to go to your church, you want to be able to go to school and have some normalcy, and for so many in our community, they're not going to have that.' She has a message for her constituents. 'We will rebuild,' Vega said. 'We will survive.' Strained water supply The area is dealing with a water system issue, resulting in unsafe drinking water and a lacking supply. Power outages are widespread as well. The water still needs to be assessed. 'We need to know that our drinking water will be safe,' said Altadena Councilmember Milissa Morona, whose home was spared but neighbors weren't so lucky. 'If winds pick up, I fear I may lose my house as well,' she said. 'When I was leaving my house yesterday a couple days ago, there were tornado-type winds coming at me with fireballs. I don't know that they (firefighters) could have done anything.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/altadena-california-eaton-fire-destruction/	2025-01-12T09:54:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192352117.jpg?w=900
Police detain 2 near VP Harris’ LA-area home for curfew violation	BRENTWOOD, Cali. (KTLA) — Two people were detained at Vice President Kamala Harris' Brentwood, California, home on Saturday, police confirmed to NewsNation affiliate KTLA. The Los Angeles Police Department said a call came into the West L.A. station around 4:40 a.m. —- during curfew hours, which were set amid the ongoing wildfires — reporting a potential burglary on the vice president’s property. Officers responded to the residence, located on Bundy Drive north of Sunset Drive, and found two individuals on the property. LAPD said officers detained the two people who were breaking curfew, but have since released them as they found no evidence that they were committing a crime. Details are extremely limited, police did not immediately say what the two people were doing on the vice president’s property or whether the incident would be further investigated. National Guard members and local enforcement from the LAPD, Santa Monica Police, and Airport Police Departments reminded residents that they will continue to patrol fire zones from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., ready to arrest anyone for trespassing, looting or any other type of violation. Brentwood, as well as communities in the San Fernando Valley, were growing areas of concern as the Palisades Fire began climbing inland over the mountains on Friday and Saturday. The Palisades Fire, already one of the most destructive natural disasters in Los Angeles history, erupted on Tuesday, Jan. 7. As of Saturday evening, it had claimed 5 lives, burned 23,654 acres and was 11% contained. More than 5,000 structures, many of them homes, have been destroyed in the Pacific Palisades and Malibu.

More than one dozen arrests related to suspected looting have already been reported within the Los Angeles area wildfire zones, authorities said last week.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/police-detain-2-near-vp-harris-la-area-home-for-curfew-violation/	2025-01-12T08:35:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-6-5-e1736696582730.jpg?w=800

Californians contend with looting, price gouging, insurance issue...	(NewsNation) — California is battling not only wildfires but also looting, price gouging and challenges with insurance companies. Law enforcement officers have arrested more than 20 people on suspicion of looting in recent days. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna condemned the criminal activity, saying 'it's a despicable crime and you're going to go to jail, bottom line.' California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Saturday he is doubling the National Guard presence to approximately 1,700 troops to combat devastating wildfires. The expanded response includes more than 12,000 first responders and 1,500 pieces of firefighting equipment as multiple blazes continue to threaten the region. ‘Very dire’ conditions ahead for LA wildfires: Weather Service The crisis is compounded by insurance challenges. State Farm canceled 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades last July, representing 70% of their coverage in the area. In response, California has implemented a one-year moratorium on insurance companies canceling or failing to renew policies for homeowners affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Total damage from the devastating wildfires scorching Southern California could amount to $135 billion to $150 billion, according to AccuWeather. The wildfires were previously estimated to cost around $50 billion, $10 billion of which is expected to be insured, according to JPMorgan. California Attorney General Rob Bonta warned residents about potential scams and price gouging, which is illegal during a state of emergency. LA fire chief says city failed department amid ongoing wildfires Officials advise residents to verify credentials and avoid paying for services upfront. The insurance crisis extends beyond California. A Senate report found companies are withdrawing coverage across the country, including in Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama, the Carolinas and New England states, leaving thousands of Americans unable to secure mortgages. Insurers began dropping plans after 2017 and 2018 when back-to-back wildfires in California resulted in losses totaling $23 billion. Insurers paid out twice as much in claims as they received in premiums. That has left major insurers reluctant to do business in the state. Allstate dropped its business entirely in California in 2023, saying it would come back if regulatory changes were made to protect its bottom line. Insurance industry experts attribute the withdrawals to unprofitable risk levels in certain regions, creating a growing national housing accessibility challenge.

LA fire chief says city failed department amid ongoing wildfires	(The Hill) — Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said during an interview Friday that the city failed the department amid the ongoing wildfires in Southern California that have taken at least 11 lives and burned more than 37,000 acres. Crowley was interviewed by Fox11 on Friday and asked if the city of Los Angeles failed her department, referring to the Santa Ynez Reservoir being shut down and empty. The fire department chief, at first, did not answer the question from Fox11 reporter Gigi Graciette, telling her that the department is tasked with protecting the public. Graciette asked again. Crowley did not respond directly. After asking for a third time 'did they fail you?' Crowley responded 'yes.' When asked about the Santa Ynez Reservoir, Crowley said that when firefighters operate in the field, they expect to have water, but if there isn’t any available, 'they’re going to go find water.' 'So my stance on this is when a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water. We don’t control the water supply. Our firefighters are there to protect lives and property and to make sure that we’re properly trained and equipped,' Crowley said Friday. The reservoir in the Pacific Palisades was closed for repairs and empty as wildfires raged through the region, according to multiple media reports. The reservoir normally holds 117 million gallons of water. 'That’s my position on this. So if there’s no water, I don’t know how the water gets to the hydrants. Please defer that to DWP or whomever controls that part,' she added. 'But I can tell you the resiliency of our firefighters. If there’s no water, they’re going to go find water. They’re going to figure out a way to do the best they can with what they’ve got in a very dynamic situation.' The DailyMail reported Friday night that the Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, fired Crowley on Friday afternoon. Bass’s office denied the reporting on Friday night, telling The Hill in an emailed statement that the report 'is false.' LAFD public information officer Erik Scott then wrote on the social media platform X that Bass and Crowley met Friday, but clarified that the fire department head 'was not dismissed and is in full command' of the LAFD. 'Their foremost priorities continue to be fighting the current wildfires and safeguarding Angelenos,' Scott wrote just past midnight on Saturday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-fire-chief-says-city-failed-department-amid-ongoing-wildfires/	2025-01-11T15:11:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25010603828548-e1736603308713.jpg?w=900
What are the risks of wildfire smoke inhalation?	(NewsNation) — As multiple wildfires continue to scorch tens of thousands of acres in the Los Angeles area, people face dangerous air quality levels and exposure to smoke inhalation. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency Friday. Dr. David Hill, board chair of the American Lung Association, joined 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Saturday morning to discuss the health risks of smoke inhalation. 'These are widespread fires producing a lot of smoke that's toxic, and it's a danger to the entire public,' Hill said. 'Everyone breathes, so this is something everyone, particularly in the greater Los Angeles area, has to be taking seriously.' What are the risks of smoke inhalation? There are both short-term and long-term risks. The short-term risks include lung injury, particularly for high-risk groups. 'This is not just wood smoke that's burning. There are dangerous chemicals in houses and in schools and industrial facilities and all these buildings that are burning that are very toxic,' Hill said. High-risk groups include children, pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with preexisting conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease or diabetes. 'But again, anybody who's breathing this toxic smoke is at risk.' Long-term risks include a higher rate of asthma, worsening lung and heart disease and other complications. 'These particles are so small that they get deep into the lungs and cause inflammation and can also pass directly into the bloodstream and cause problems,' Hill said. 'So, we see an increased risk of Parkinson's disease of cognitive decline, which is why everyone needs to limit their exposure to this to the best degree.' How to protect yourself from smoke inhalation Per Hill's recommendations, people in smoky areas should do the following: Evacuate when urged or ordered to do so Pay attention to air quality indexes Stay indoors as much as possible Set air conditioning to recirculation when leaving home or another building Keep windows closed Close any fireplaces Run central A/C if it's available Wear an N-95 mask if going outside 'A cloth mask is not going to stop these particles from getting into your lungs,' Hill said. 'N95 and N100 masks are necessary.' Wildfire smoke can travel long distances. 'Even though you may not be under an evacuation order, it does not mean your air quality is going to be good locally.' Hill urged people to pay attention to air quality indexes available online at airnow.gov.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/wildfire-smoke-inhalation-risks/	2025-01-11T13:48:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/gettyimages-2192534400-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
California's working class overlooked amid wildfires, US rep says	(NewsNation) — Natural disasters do not discriminate against their victims. From celebrities in the Hollywood Hills to residents in nearby towns, people are grieving the loss of their communities, homes, belongings and memories from the Palisades Fire and other wildfires. However, one official says the working class, particularly in Altadena, California, is being overlooked. 'Altadena has working people, people who may not have enough money by which to go and rent a hotel, maybe for, you know, months to come,' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., on NewsNation’s 'CUOMO' Friday night. 'I would like to ask you and any other media individuals that may be listening to do everything that you can to get attention on Altadena.' She said the area 'has just about been flattened.' Gov. Gavin Newsom Invites Donald Trump to California amid wildfires 'Not everybody's rich, and we have people who don't know where they're going, people who are in temporary situations that need some help and finding a place to live,' Waters said. 'We have people who need food, we have people who need healthcare, all of that, and so that's what I'm concentrated on.' Multiple wildfires have broken out in the greater Los Angeles area in the past week, spanning 36,000 acres, destroying more than 12,000 structures and killing 11. A political 'blame game' has erupted between Democrats and Republicans over the state’s leadership and handling of environmental concerns. But Waters said the focus should be on getting resources to the people who most need it. Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report 'I'm not into the blame game. I'm not into talking about whether or not (Governor) Gavin Newsom is trying to protect himself and run for president. None of that,' Waters said. Critics have pointed to actions by the governor and local mayors to reduce funding to fire departments and cut deals with electric and insurance companies. 'First thing you gotta understand is services cost money, and we should be willing to get the richest people in this country, the richest 1% that is protected, make sure they pay their fair taxes so that we can have the money to provide the services,' Waters said. How to help victims of LA wildfires She urged news media outlets to provide resources to those impacted rather than focus on politics. 'The fact of the matter is we all should have heavy hearts right now,' she said. 'Damn it. You can do the politics later. You can come and talk about Gavin Newsom later … But don't use up this precious time to do petty politics. Use the time to educate and to share information and to let people know where they can get some food, where they can get a place to stay, where they can get some clothing on and on and on.' NewsNation compiled a list of resources on how to help.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/californias-working-class-overlooked-amid-wildfires-us-rep-says/	2025-01-11T08:42:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25011203379482.jpg?w=900

As wildfires continue to rage across Los Angeles County, Soon-Shiong criticized LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom's handling of the city before the crisis. 'It's so crazy we have leaders that are reactive rather than proactive,' Soon-Shiong said during an appearance on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'We have to ask ourselves where are we spending the money and why. Where is the actual planning of preparing for this.' 'With this event, we really must investigate,' Soon-Shiong added. 'That's the basis of the paper. Speaking truth to power. And really investigating the root cause of all these issues and making sure it doesn't happen again.' Drone crashes into firefighting aircraft over Palisades: FAA Soon-Shiong directed the public on X to follow his paper for live updates on the situation while calling out Bass. The Los Angeles Fire Department's budget was cut by approximately $17 million, according to a Newsweek fact check, contrary to Soon-Shiong's claim that Bass reduced it by $23 million. 'Our hearts go out to those who have lost their homes and are seeking shelter. Fires in LA are sadly no surprise, yet the Mayor cut LA Fire Department’s budget by $23M. And reports of empty fire hydrants raise serious questions. Competence matters…Follow @latimes for live coverage in partnership with @Spectrum. The live camera view coverage will give our readers a real time view of the fires and the stream is open to all Angelenos. Stay safe,' Soon-Shiong wrote. Prior to the 2024 election, a number of staff members of the Los Angeles Times editorial board resigned after Soon-Shiong blocked the board’s plan to endorse Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for president. He also announced his intention to overhaul the Times’ editorial board to add more conservative voices, which prompted the paper’s union to publicly rebuke him and longtime columnist Harry Litman to resign. Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report More than 36,000 acres have been burned in total as wildfires continue to rage across the Los Angeles area, and at least 10 people have died.

FEMA Fire admin: No amount of resources could've stopped LA blaze...	(NewsNation) — No amount of water and no number of firefighters on the ground could have stopped the blazes raging in the Los Angeles area from spreading, the head of FEMA's U.S. Fire Administration told 'The Hill on NewsNation.' 'What we have to understand is that with every resource brought to bear on this particular fire ... no one was getting in front of this fire,' Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell said. 'The fuel load on this fire, the wind speeds and the variables at play were astronomical. These extreme conditions (were) like a blowtorch.' What we know about how the LA wildfires started Federal and state officials, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, have been criticized for water shortages and budget cuts that some say compromised firefighters' ability to prepare for and battle the blazes. In a memo just last month, LA Fire Department Fire Chief Kristin Crowley argued that cuts to her budget 'severely limited the Department’s capacity to prepare for, train for, and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires,' per NewsNation's Rich McHugh. As of Friday afternoon, the fires in the LA area have burned over 37,000 acres, destroyed 10,000 properties and left 10 dead.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/fema-us-fire-admin-la-blazes/	2025-01-10T17:00:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192299042_e86313.jpg?w=900

US added a strong 256,000 jobs in December as unemployment rate d...	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. hiring picked up unexpectedly in December as employers added a strong 256,000 jobs, another sign of the economy’s resilience in the face of high interest rates. Job growth rose 212,000 last month from November, the Labor Department reported Friday. For all of 2024, the economy added 2.2 million jobs, a solid number but down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 6.4 million in 2021 as the economy bounded back from massive pandemic layoffs. The monthly numbers beat forecasters’ expectation of around 155,000 new jobs and 4.2% unemployment. Healthcare companies added 46,000 jobs, retailers 43,000 and government agencies at the federal, state and local 33,000. But manufacturers cut 13,000 jobs. Labor Department revisions shaved 8,000 jobs from October and November payrolls. Average hourly wages rose 0.3% from November and 3.9% from a year earlier. The year-over-year wage gain was slightly less than economists had forecast. Stocks fell Friday morning on the expectations that the strong jobs report will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut interest rates. The economy doesn’t seem to need the help. 'It seems pretty certain that the pace of Fed rate cuts is now going to slow down,’’ said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. Getting a clear view of the U.S. job market hasn’t been easy the past few months. Hurricanes and a big strike at Boeing threw off the October jobs numbers, pushing them down and setting up a payback rebound in November that likely exaggerated the strength of hiring. Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, said that seasonal adjustments around the holidays may have affected the December numbers, but he added that nonetheless 'it is hard to say anything negative about the details of this report.'' Over the past few years, the economy and the job market have shown surprising resilience. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate – the fed funds rate -- 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to cause a recession but didn’t. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the economy kept rolling along. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product – the nation’s output of goods and services -- has expanded at a robust annual pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters. American workers enjoy unusual job security. Layoffs are running below the pre-pandemic trend. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that just 211,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the fewest in nearly a year. Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months of 2024. But Fed officials signaled at their December meeting that they planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months, and it remains stuck above the Fed’s 2% target.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/ap-us-economy-likely-added-153000-jobs-last-month-returning-to-normal-after-strike-and-hurricanes/	2025-01-10T06:24:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67812dff789253.01723206.jpeg?w=900
Supreme Court to hear arguments on fate of TikTok	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Supreme Court will hear arguments Friday as TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, makes a final attempt to block an impeding ban on the social media platform set to take effect in nine days. A rule, which was signed into law in April, requires TikTok to break ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance before Jan. 19 or it will be banned in the U.S. The case asks the high court to weigh the First Amendment against serious national security concerns. TikTok: What do polls say Americans think of it? Critics warn this decision could go beyond losing favorite social media influencers, potentially shaping the future of free speech. Oral arguments over the legislation will start at 10 a.m. ET. What's at stake? TikTok, with more than 170 million U.S. users, is at the center of a legal battle over First Amendment rights and national security. Lawyers for ByteDance argue that Congress overstepped by passing a law requiring the company to sell the app to an approved buyer or shut down in the U.S. They claim the law violates users' First Amendment rights since TikTok is a platform that allows users to share videos, views, and opinions. Congress, however, asserts that this is not about free speech but national security, claiming that China could force ByteDance to disclose the personal data of millions of Americans. What to know as TikTok argues in front of Supreme Court In a court filing, the U.S. Department of Justice highlights China's 'well-documented history' of forcing companies, including TikTok, to comply with its government's 'directives and refrain from disclosing those actions.' In response, ByteDance's legal team claimed the law would allow Congress to ban them from operating TikTok 'explicitly because they refused to censor views Congress' doesn't like. If SCOTUS upholds the ban, TikTok won't immediately vanish from devices but will be removed from app stores. Users won't receive updates and will gradually lose access as ByteDance winds down its support for the app.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/supreme-court-tiktok-ban/	2025-01-10T05:53:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Zoom-Titok_031124_AP_Damian-Dovarganes-e1734539458285.jpg?w=800
Trump to be sentenced in New York hush money case	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump faces sentencing Friday for his New York hush money conviction after the Supreme Court refused to intervene. With just 10 days before he is inaugurated for a second term, the president-elect will be the first convicted felon to be sworn into office. Friday's sentencing hearing is set to start at 9:30 a.m. ET. Trump, who is expected to appear by video from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, will have the opportunity to speak. Trump: 'We're going to appeal anyway' Merchan repeatedly postponed the sentencing, initially set for July. But last week, he set Friday's date, citing a need for 'finality.' He wrote that he strove to balance Trump's need to govern, the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, the respect due a jury verdict and the public’s expectation that 'no one is above the law.' Trump's lawyers then launched a flurry of last-minute efforts to block the sentencing on the basis of presidential immunity applying to Trump even as president-elect. Their last hope vanished Thursday night. 7 notable moments between VIPs at Carter’s funeral In a 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney-Barret declined to delay the sentencing, assuring Trump's status as the first felon to assume the presidency. The justices emphasized the lenient sentencing that has already been floated for Trump, writing: 'The burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court's state intent to impose a sentencing of 'unconditional discharge' after a brief virtual hearing.' Following the ruling, Trump said, 'We're going to appeal anyway, just psychologically, because frankly, it's a disgrace. It's a judge who shouldn't have been on the case. He's a highly conflicted judge, and they called for an appeal. So, I read it and thought it was a fair decision actually. So I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent.' 'Unconditional discharge' likely for Trump In May, a New York City jury found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Daniels was paid during the campaign to keep quiet about an affair she allegedly had with Trump, which he denies. Each count is punishable by up to four years in prison and/or a fine of up to $5,000. Merchan has suggested that he's unlikely to sentence Trump to prison. Instead, he's expected to impose the most lenient sentencing given the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the president-elect's imminent inauguration. That would likely result in an 'unconditional discharge,' meaning Trump would remain a convicted felon but face no legal penalties for the crime.

LA DA: 'Max punishment' will be sought for looters, arsonist	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Thursday that the penalty for the suspected arsonist considered responsible for one of the LA wildfires could be as high as homicide and could result in life in prison. 'Justice will be swift. It will be firm, and the maximum punishment will be sought,' Hochman said during an appearance on NewsNation's 'Banfield.' 'Our goal is to send this warning,' Hochman added. 'Whether it’s looting, these internet scams, robbery or future arsons. … the day and age of a DA’s office standing on the sidelines is over. We want to bring justice, and we will.' Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report The Kenneth Fire, which erupted close to homes in the area of Calabasas and Hidden Hills, is now considered a crime scene. Investigators believe the fire may have been purposefully set, and it was citizens who helped detain the suspect. LAPD Senior Lead Officer Sean Dinse informed NewsNation's Brian Entin that one person is in custody. The Kenneth Fire is just one among five wildfires ravaging LA County. The fire was first reported around 2:30 p.m. in an area of dry brush in the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, north of U.S. Highway 101. The Kenneth Fire has burned over 900 acres and is 0% contained. At least 20 people have been arrested for alleged looting this week during the wildfires. L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger has also warned that looters in the fire zones will be held accountable. 'There is no excuse' for such behavior, Barger said on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'Thank God we've got a district attorney that recognizes we will prosecute people who break the law.' Barger said she'll make sure L.A. District Attorney Nathan Hochman 'gets all the resources' to prosecute looters 'to the fullest extent of the law.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/la-da-punishment-guilty-looters-arsonist/	2025-01-09T21:32:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/gettyimages-2192534400-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Supreme Court refuses Trump’s request to block Friday’s criminal ...	The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision on Thursday refused President-elect Trump’s request to halt his criminal sentencing, now just hours away, closing off Trump’s last remaining pathway to avoid receiving his punishment for his 34-count felony conviction in New York. On Friday morning, Trump’s hush money sentencing will secure his status as the first felon to assume the presidency. Trump can attend virtually, as Judge Juan Merchan is slated to hand down an unconditional discharge, a rare alternative to prison or probation that has no strings attached. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberals to deny Trump’s request. Four of the court’s conservatives, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, dissented. Among other reasons, the court in its order indicated it was denying Trump’s request because 'the alleged evidentiary violations at President-Elect Trump’s state-court trial can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal.' 'Second, the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect’s responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court’s stated intent to impose a sentence of ‘unconditional discharge’ after a brief virtual hearing,' the order continued. Speaking at a previously scheduled event at Mar-a-Lago minutes later, Trump said he read the court’s order and highlighted how it noted his future appellate options. 'I read it, and I thought it was a fair decision, actually,' Trump said. 'So I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent.' The Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment on the decision. The Supreme Court’s denial of Trump’s emergency application caps his extensive efforts to stave off his sentencing. When a jury convicted him on 34 felonies in May, the proceeding was originally set for July. After the Supreme Court handed down its ruling carving out immunity for former presidents, however, Trump managed to effect multiple delays, eventually pushing the proceeding until after the election.

Mel Gibson: Loss of Malibu home in LA fires 'devastating'	(NewsNation) — Film actor and director Mel Gibson told NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports' on Thursday that his Malibu home has been destroyed by the wildfires raging in the Los Angeles area, calling the experience 'devastating.' 'It's emotional,' Gibson said. 'I had my stuff there. I've been relieved from the burden of my stuff because it's all in cinders.' Gibson told Vargas that he was in Austin, Texas, appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast when he learned the fire had broken out. He says that while speaking with Rogan, he was 'ill at ease' because he'd heard his neighborhood was in flames. How to help victims of LA wildfires 'I thought, 'Eh, I wonder if my place is still there,'' Gibson said. 'When I got home, sure enough, it wasn't there.' The 'Mad Max' actor is one of many Hollywood stars who have lost their homes, with others affected including Billy Crystal, Paris Hilton and Cary Elwes. Gibson noted that he was surprised by the intensity of the damage and by what seemed to be the randomness of which houses were destroyed in his neighborhood. '(The area) was completely toasted. I've never seen such a complete burn,' Gibson told Vargas, saying he isn't sure if he'll rebuild there but that he was grateful for the generosity of those living nearby and the fact his family was safe. As of Thursday afternoon, the Los Angeles wildfires have burned nearly 29,000 acres, destroyed thousands of structures and forced almost 180,000 people to evacuate their homes. Five have died as a result of the fires.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/mel-gibson-loses-malibu-home-wildfires/	2025-01-09T16:00:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192365794.jpg?w=900
Drones spotted at nuclear power plant in southern Minnesota	(NewsNation) — Police in southern Minnesota saw two drones flying around a nuclear plant Wednesday but were unable to identify the pilot. Shortly after 6:30 p.m., local dispatch received a call about 'four to five' drones flying around the Prairie Island Nuclear Plant in Welch, Minnesota, according to a news release from the Red Wing Police Department. Mystery drones: Where have they been spotted? When officers arrived, they spotted two drones flying around the nuclear plant and Lock and Dam #3. The officers continued to monitor the drones until they left the area, the release said. Police were unable to locate the drone pilot or pilots. 'There is no active threat to the public and the incident is not currently under active investigation by the Red Wing Police Department,' the release said. Why is it hard to identify drones? Drones are prohibited from flying over nuclear power plants and other 'sensitive facilities,' according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Prairie Island is one of two nuclear power plants in Minnesota. It's located along the Mississippi River near the Wisconsin border.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/drones-nuclear-plant-minnesota/	2025-01-09T15:08:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1311146754.jpg?w=900
We were a neighborhood': LA County wildfire victim	(NewsNation) — The two palm trees that stand in front of what was once the home of a victim of the Palisades fire are named for her twin grandsons. They now serve as a reminder of what once was in the Altadena community of Los Angeles County. The remains of the brick home are part of a neighborhood devastated by the wildfires that have burned tens of thousands of acres and have left at least five people dead. But the home’s owner, who identified herself as Fran, tells NewsNation that neighbors are now coming together to cope. Fran told NewsNation she and her husband have lived in the community for 26 years. After the wildfires began earlier this week, she and others are putting together the pieces of their lives that have been torn apart. How to help victims of LA wildfires 'We were a neighborhood,' she said. '(We) helped one another, greeted one another. We’re always here for one another, and we’re still going to be here for one another.' Fran described the community as a beautiful place made up of smaller homes and a collection of residents who raised their children in the same quiet neighborhood. 'It was friendly,' she told NewsNation. 'A good place to be.' Fran said after the wildfires began earlier this week, she learned she had 20 minutes to evacuate. She said she wasn’t able to collect much and was left feeling scrambled. Her neighbors grabbed the possessions they could and left. Within an hour of the fires being reported, the homes in her neighborhood were gone. 'We still can’t believe it,' Fran told NewsNation. 'None of us has anywhere to go. Nowhere to go.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/neighborhood-wildfire-victim/	2025-01-09T13:01:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192444689.jpg?w=900
Economic loss from LA wildfires could reach $150B: Report	(NewsNation) — Total damage from the devastating wildfires scorching Southern California could amount to between $135 billion to $150 billion, according to AccuWeather, a private company specializing in weather data. The wildfires were previously estimated to cost around $50 billion, $10 billion of which is expected to be insured, according to JPMorgan. As homeowners try to recover from the fires, they could face challenges. Many homeowners in California have already experienced difficulty getting insurance, and some have had their insurance canceled. Last summer in Pacific Palisades, 70% of State Farm customers, about 1,600 homeowners, lost coverage when the insurer dropped policies in and around the Santa Monica mountains. How to help victims of LA wildfires There are 9,000 households in Palisades alone, and more than 100,000 Californians have lost coverage since 2019, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. One resident, who was forced to evacuate and does not know if her home survived, received a letter from State Farm in March. 'We are sorry that we cannot continue this insurance, therefore your policy will not be renewed,' the letter read. 'Personal lines, homeowner and dwelling fire insurance policies that present the most substantial wildfire, fire following earthquake hazards, or that are in areas of significant concentration are no longer eligible.' Homeowners have largely replaced their fire coverage with a state plan of last resort called the California FAIR Plan — an insurance pool that covers up to $3 million in damages for residential properties and $20 million for commercial properties. This will be the first major test of the FAIR system. Trump says Newsom should resign as Los Angeles wildfires rage Insurers began dropping plans after 2017 and 2018 when back-to-back wildfires in California resulted in losses totaling $23 billion. Insurers paid out twice as much in claims as they received in premiums. That has left major insurers reluctant to do business in the state. Allstate dropped its business entirely in California in 2023, saying it would come back if regulatory changes were made to protect its bottom line. With similar issues facing Florida residents, the U.S. could see some significant population shifts as homeowners in two of the most populous states find they can't receive coverage.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-wildfire-damage-50-billion/	2025-01-09T12:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192374864.jpg?w=900
LA fire damage likely to be the costliest in US history	(NewsNation) — The wildfires burning across Los Angeles could be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The blazes — which are ripping through some of the nation's priciest real estate — are likely to cause between $52 billion and $57 billion in damages and economic loss, according to a preliminary AccuWeather estimate. 'This is already one of the worst wildfires in California history,' AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said in a statement Wednesday. LA fires: Crews nationwide head to California to aid firefighters Some of the worst damage is located in Santa Monica and Malibu, where median home values are over $2 million, AccuWeather said. 'Should a large number of additional structures be burned in the coming days, it may become the worst wildfire in modern California history based on the number of structures burned and economic loss,' Porter noted. Home to nearly 10 million people, Los Angeles County is the most populated county in the U.S. and has properties worth more than $2 trillion in total. How to help victims of LA wildfires Los Angeles fire officials said Thursday that thousands of homes appear to have been damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades fire, the Los Angeles Times reported. Some of the biggest stars in Hollywood are among those who have lost homes, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Paris Hilton. 'Heartbroken beyond words,' Hilton wrote in an Instagram post of a news clip. 'Sitting with my family, watching the news, and seeing our home in Malibu burn to the ground on live TV is something no one should ever have to experience.' If AccuWeather's $52 billion estimate is correct, the Los Angeles fires could rank among the costliest disasters in U.S. history, most of which are hurricanes. Hurricane Katrina is the most expensive U.S. natural disaster, with an estimated cost of $200 billion, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A separate estimate from JPMorgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar also pegged total economic losses from the LA fires at close to $50 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. That total includes insured losses at more than $20 billion and 'even more if the fires are not controlled,' Bhullar said. Those losses would make the Los Angeles-area infernos the costliest wildfires in U.S. history. Previously, the Camp Fire in 2018 was the most destructive wildfire in history — causing an estimated $12.5 billion in insured losses, WSJ said. Another estimate put overall losses at $16.5 billion. AccuWeather's preliminary estimate includes both insured and uninsured losses, as well as the cost of evacuations and other economic impacts. But as the fires continue to burn around the Los Angeles area, there's a good chance the losses will worsen in the days ahead. At least 180,000 people have been ordered to evacuate and five have died as of Thursday morning.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-fire-damage-costliest/	2025-01-09T11:19:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192342935.jpg?w=900
Palisades resident describes 'apocalyptic' fires	(NewsNation) — Matt Wilmont filmed scenes of the Palisades wildfire from his motorcycle while attempting to get to a friend's house to check on the dwelling and his pets. Wilmont told NewsNation that he's never seen anything like this in his life, though he has been through several fires in Malibu. 'I've never ever, ever seen a fire like this in Los Angeles in my lifetime and I honestly don't think ever, because before my lifetime it was all orange groves and there was no population in the Valley and Hollywood was a fraction of what it is now because of development,' he said. How to help victims of LA wildfires Having grown up in Pacific Palisades, Wilmont says many landmarks dear to his heart have burned down, including Palisades High School. He wasn't able to reach the home but said thinks it may have made it. 'It was apocalyptic,' he said, 'I've seen these fires. They're never at this level of heat, at this level of smoke, never ever at this level of wind in such a population area.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/resident-apocalyptic-fires/	2025-01-09T11:08:23-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/wildfire_homepage_4.jpg?w=900
What we know about how the LA wildfires started	(NewsNation) — Several fast-moving wildfires continue to devastate the Los Angeles area, and investigators are working around the clock to figure out exactly what sparked the ferocious blazes. Thousands of acres have been scorched as wildfires continue to rip through parts of Los Angeles County. Five people have died, according to Nicole Nishida, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Officials said 130,000 residents are under evacuation orders because of the fires, and thousands have been displaced. What do we know about the start of the LA-area fires? Little is still known about how the fires started. The Los Angeles Fire Department’s arson investigation team is currently investigating the cause, Margaret Stewart, Los Angeles Fire Department public information officer, told NewsNation on Thursday.

(AP Photo/Ethan Swope) Online chatter, including from Elon Musk, has circulated speculation that arson could be the cause of the Sunset fire that sparked in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, but Stewart said that is still unknown. 'The cause of the fire will be investigated. Whether that's arson or not, that is to be determined,' she said. 'Our arson investigators are the ones that investigate the cause of the fire. That doesn't mean that it's an arson fire, it's a cause investigation.' Though it’s unclear what started the fires, it is more clear how they spread so quickly. How do wildfires start, and how long do they last? Weather conditions determine how much a wildfire grows, according to National Geographic. Wind, high temperatures and little rainfall can all leave trees and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays a big part, as well, as flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill. The Los Angeles wildfires are being fueled by what the National Weather Service said could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in over a decade, coupled with a prolonged drought in the area. 'It’s been bone dry from about Santa Barbara southward, only a few sprinkles since last season. So we’re going on 9 to 10 months now without meaningful rain,' Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, told NewsNation affiliate KTLA. What is being done to find out the cause of the LA fires? Stewart said the fire department is employing all resources to stop the fires and determine their cause, but winds have been challenging. How to help victims of LA wildfires 'The wind conditions that we are facing prevented us from being able to use all of our resources in the way that we would aim to use them, specifically our air assets. Since yesterday morning, all of our fast air assets have been working, and we've been in 24-hour operations, and so that will continue,' she said. How long could the fires last? While some of the five separate fires have been contained, it is still unknown how long the larger ones could last. The Sunset fire is 'under control,' Stewart said, adding that there are no more evacuations in the areas affected. The Woodley fire, which has burned 30 acres, is 'controlled,' and the Lidia Fire was 40% contained by Thursday morning. But it could be days and even weeks before the monstrous Palisades fire is taken down. As of Wednesday afternoon, the rapidly moving wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area has spread to more than 17,234 acres.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/how-la-wildfires-started/	2025-01-09T10:36:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/wildfire_homepage_1.jpg?w=900
LA County wildfires halt television production schedules	(NewsNation) — The wildfires that continue to burn around Los Angeles County have halted the production of several popular television shows including 'Grey’s Anatomy,' 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' 'NCIS' and 'Hacks' and have resulted in the cancellation of several Hollywood events. Film LA, which is the permitting agency for production shoots around Los Angeles, said in a statement that due to the wildfires that have brought 'unprecedented risk to life and property,' 'personnel resources ordinarily available' to support film production may not be available due to the local state of emergency. The statement also said that the Los Angeles Fire Department has specifically instructed that all permits for filming across Los Angeles communities of Altadena, La Crescentia, La Canada/Flintridge and unincorporated Pasadena be withdrawn. The agency said that other permits may be revoked. Winter storm producing snow, ice moves across the South Variety reported that although the sound stag;les where production has been halted are not affected directly by the fires themselves, the air quality is dangerous to the health of local residents. Several production companies, including NBC Universal, which includes shows including 'Hacks,' 'Loot' and 'Suits: LA;' CBS Studios ('NCIS', 'After Midnight' and 'The Neighborhood'); Warner Bros. ('Abbott Elementary,' 'All American') have closed due to the fires, Variety reported. NBC Universal officials told Variety that all of the major motion pictures the company has in production are currently being filmed outside of Los Angeles, the report indicated. Disney-20th Century Fox which produces 'Grey’s Anatomy' and 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' has also shut down production, the report said. The halt in production of the hit TV shows comes just more than a year after a nearly five-month strike that affected filming schedules around Hollywood. An agreement was reached in November 2023 after five days of marathon negotiations between unionized screenwriters and studios. Variety also reported that several premiers and other Hollywood events have canceled events due to the wildfires, which have burned tens of thousands of acres and are responsible for at least five deaths.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/wildfires-halt-television-production/	2025-01-09T10:24:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25007793599711.jpg?w=900

LA fires: Crews nationwide head to California to aid firefighters	LOS ANGELES (NewsNation) — Several states have responded to calls for help, sending fire crews to California to combat wildfires in Los Angeles. Firefighters from neighboring states are already on the ground helping to contain the growing blaze. Air operations in the Palisades resumed Thursday as multiple wildfires ripped through parts of Los Angeles County. The death toll from the wildfires has risen to five, according to Nicole Nishida, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Officials have said more than 100,000 people are under evacuation orders because of all the fires. Oregon sends 300 firefighters to LA. On Wednesday, strike teams from Oregon mobilized 15 teams consisting of 300 firefighters and 75 engines. 'We've been able to help them in the past and we're standing ready to get in these rigs and go down there today to help return the favor yet again,' said Forest Grove Fire Operations Chief Sgt. Patrick Wineman. How to help victims of LA wildfires Teams from Nevada, Washington, and Arizona are also en route. The Phoenix Fire Department is expected to be in Los Angeles within days as they wait for further instructions. Those extra crews will join California firefighters already working around the clock. Nearly 7,500 firefighters battling blaze Governor Gavin Newsom announced that with federal, state, and local help, nearly 7,500 men and women are now battling the fires. Officials stress they need all the help they can get. ‘Devil winds’: Steve Guttenberg details Palisades fire devastation 'We're getting as many resources as we can get from throughout the state of California. We can always use more, especially with this strength of wind. We could put an engine at every house and still have trouble with these 80-mile-an-hour gusts. the more the better. We will take as much as we can get. I know there's more resources on the way as we speak,' said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Brent Pascua. States along the East Coast, from New York to Florida, have also offered to assist if needed. What's the federal response to these fires? President Joe Biden has approved a major disaster declaration for California. The US Forest Service has air tankers working and extra ones on the way. Federal firefighting helicopters are there and ready as long as the winds allow, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved a grant to reimburse the state for firefighting costs. The California National Guard has also been deployed, and Navy helicopters with water delivery buckets are being sent to the area.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-fires-crews-nationwide-california-aid-firefighters/	2025-01-09T06:41:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192430789.jpg?w=900

How do wildfires start, and how long do they last?	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles wildfires are being fueled by what the National Weather Service said could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in over a decade. What's the cause of the LA fires? Cal Fire reports the actual cause of the fires is still under investigation. Los Angeles has declared a state of emergency as winds reach 35-55 mph, with higher gusts in the mountains and foothills. What to know about smoke from LA wildfires The death toll from the wildfires has risen to five, and more than 100,000 people are under evacuation orders, according to officials. Click here to view the LAPD’s interactive evacuation zone map. NewsNation's Chris Cuomo, who has covered wildfires for decades, believes we are 'nowhere near the end of it.' 'The reason the fires are growing in a way that we have rarely seen is that they are each and all being turbocharged by winds that are too much for everything and everyone,' Cuomo said. 'Nothing fuels fire like air. ... And the air is doing the most damage. The winds caused everything that we're seeing right now.' What causes wildfires? A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in wildland vegetation, often in rural areas, according to National Geographic. A lightning strike, or a human-made spark, are common causes of wildfires. However, it is often the weather conditions that determine how much a wildfire grows, according to National Geographic. Where are the Los Angeles area wildfires? Wind, high temperatures and little rainfall can all leave trees and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays a big part, as well, as flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill. In cities with roads near wildlife, such as in Southern California, it is very common for vehicles to accidentally ignite a fire, Luca Carmignani, a fire adviser from the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, previously told USA TODAY.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/cuomo-show/how-wildfires-los-angeles-start/	2025-01-08T21:28:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/gettyimages-2192423453-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Fast-moving Sunset Fire erupts in Hollywood Hills, evacuations or...	LOS ANGELES (KTLA) - A fast-moving wildfire erupted in the Hollywood Hills, prompting a mandatory evacuation order for a wide area of the historic Hollywood entertainment district. Crews with the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to reports of the flames at 2350 Solar Drive, near Astral Drive, just after 5:30 p.m. Fire officials estimated the wildfire had charred at least 20 acres in the Runyon Canyon area as of 6:30 p.m., and upgraded it to 50 acres at around 8:15 p.m. A map showing evacuation zones for the Sunset Fire in Hollywood as of 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 8, 2024. (LAFD) Immediate mandatory evacuation were issued for residents on 'Laurel Canyon Blvd to the west, Hollywood Blvd to the south, Cahuenga Blvd/101 Fwy/Highland Ave. to the east and Mulholland Drive to the north,' officials said. The L.A. Emergency Alerts system advised residents near the fire to prepare for possible evacuation orders. 'This could be a critical situation. If you look at the top of the ridges where the embers are blowing off, the smoke is moving sideways, everything is moving horizontally, which means it’s going to be sending those embers way downrange,' Retired L.A. County Fire Cpt. Bob Goldman told KTLA. Aerial footage from Sky5 captured the balcony of one structure on fire, near Franklin Avenue and Vista Street, though firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze before it caused too much damage. Footage also showed water-dropping aircraft making runs at the flames on the southwestern side of the Sunset Fire where officials said the most intense activity was occurring. 'At the heel of the fire, active flames have been extinguished, though smoldering continues within the interior,' L.A. County Sheriff's officials said in a post to X. An evacuation shelter was established Pan Pacific Recreation Center, located at 7600 Beverly Blvd, L.A., 90036. An additional evacuation shelter has been set up at Hollywood High School, located at 1521 Highland Avenue, L.A., 90028. A voluntary evacuation zone was announced for a portion of Beverly Hills, according to the fire department, in areas north of Sunset and east of Coldwater Canyon Dr. Sheriff's officials in West Hollywood also advised residents to make way for emergency personnel.

Fire crews were already stretched incredibly thin while battling several other ongoing wildfires, including the nearly 16,000-acre Palisades Fire, which has destroyed an estimated 1,000 structures and the 10,600-acre Eaton Fire in Altadena and Pasadena that has, so far, claimed the lives of five people. While battling the Palisades Fire, crews struggled with poor water pressure and, in some cases, no water coming from fire hydrants that 'went dry' due to high demand on the city's water infrastructure. It is unclear if firefighters are still dealing with the issue.

Celebrities among those who lost homes as devastating Los Angeles...	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Wildfires that are burning in and around Los Angeles have burned the homes of several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Paris Hilton. California firefighters are battling wind-whipped fires tearing across the area, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled and straining resources as the fires burned uncontained Wednesday. Crystal and his wife, Janice, released a statement Wednesday saying their home of 45 years in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood was lost. 'Janice and I lived in our home since 1979. We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can’t be taken away. We are heartbroken of course but with the love of our children and friends we will get through this,' the Crystals wrote in the statement. Their neighborhood is a hillside area along the coast dotted with celebrity residences and memorialized by the Beach Boys in their 1960s hit 'Surfin’ USA.' In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways became impassable when scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases. 'Evacuated Malibu so last minute,' wrote Hamill in an Instagram post Tuesday night. 'Small fires on both sides of the road as we approached (the Pacific Coast Highway).' Less than 72 hours before, Hollywood’s highest-wattage stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes’ red carpet, the first major event of the exuberant and, for many, triumphant awards season. The revelry of awards season had quickly been snuffed out, too: Premieres of contenders like 'Better Man' and 'The Last Showgirl' were canceled, the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations were announced via press release instead of at a live event and weekend events like the AFI Awards were preemptively scrubbed. The Oscar nominations are also being delayed two days to Jan. 19 and the film academy has extended the voting window to accommodate members affected by the fires. Here's how celebrities and entertainment companies are being impacted by the fires burning in and around Los Angeles: Stars who lost homes in the wildfires Moore lost her home in the Altadena neighborhood near Pasadena. 'Honestly, I’m in shock and feeling numb for all so many have lost, including my family. My children’s school is gone. Our favorite restaurants, leveled. So many friends and loved ones have lost everything too,' the actor-singer wrote on Instagram in a post that included video of devastated streets in the foothill suburb. 'Our community is broken but we will be here to rebuild together. Sending love to all affected and on the front lines trying to get this under control,' Moore wrote. The Crystals expressed a similar sentiment about the Palisades. 'The Pacific Palisades is a resilient community of amazing people and we know in time it will rise again. It is our home,' they wrote. Elwes, the star of 'The Princess Bride' and numerous other films, wrote on Instagram Wednesday that his family was safe but their home had burned in the coastal Palisades fire. 'Sadly we did lose our home but we are grateful to have survived this truly devastating fire,' Elwes wrote. Hilton posted a news video clip on Instagram and said it included footage of her destroyed home in Malibu. 'This home was where we built so many precious memories. It’s where Phoenix took his first steps and where we dreamed of building a lifetime of memories with London,' she said, referencing her young children. 'The devastation is unimaginable. To know so many are waking up today without the place they called home is truly heartbreaking,' she wrote. Stars who have evacuated due to Palisades fire Jamie Lee Curtis said Wednesday on Instagram that her family is safe, but she suggested her neighborhood and possibly her home is on fire. She said many of her friends lost their homes. 'It's a terrifying situation and I'm grateful to the firefighters and all of the good Samaritans who are helping people get out of the way of the blaze.' Other stars who have homes in the area include Adam Sandler, Ben Affleck, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Many are awaiting word on whether their homes survived the flames. James Woods posted footage Tuesday of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Later, he confirmed he had evacuated and added: 'It tests your soul, losing everything at once, I must say.' Impact of the fire so far Officials didn’t give an estimate of structures damaged or destroyed in the wildfire, but they said at least 70,000 residents were under evacuation orders and nearly 30,000 structures were under threat. The fire burned down Temescal Canyon, a popular hiking area surrounded by dense neighborhoods of multimillion-dollar homes. Flames jumped famous Sunset Boulevard and burned parts of the Palisades Charter High School, which has been featured in many Hollywood productions including the 1976 horror movie 'Carrie,' the 2003 remake of 'Freaky Friday' and the TV series 'Teen Wolf.' The Palisades fire also destroyed the historic ranch house that belonged to Hollywood legend Will Rogers. It was among multiple structures destroyed at both Will Rogers State Historic Park and Topanga State Park. The historic Topanga Ranch Motel, built by William Randolph Hearst in 1929, also burned down. Rogers’ ranch, built on land he bought in the 1920s, occupied some 359 acres in what is now Pacific Palisades. It included a 31-room ranch house, a stable, golf course and riding trails. His wife donated it to California State Parks in 1944. The Critics Choice Awards, originally scheduled for Sunday, have been postponed until Feb. 26. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park closed for the day due to the smoky and windy conditions and the J. Paul Getty Trust said two of its museums, the Getty Villa and Getty Center, would remain closed for the next few days. Universal Studios also canceled shooting for numerous series, including 'Hacks,' 'Ted Lasso' and 'Suits LA.' The Walt Disney Co. closed its headquarters in Burbank, and canceled production on several series, including 'Grey’s Anatomy' and 'Doctor Odyssey.' ABC’s 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' which tapes in Hollywood, was canceled for Wednesday and will instead air a repeat. The production pauses added to further disruptions to the film and TV industry in Los Angeles, including the cancellation of the premiere to Universal’s 'Wolf Man' and postponement of the American Film Institute awards gala, scheduled for Friday. ___ AP Entertainment Writers Jake Coyle, Jocelyn Noveck, Lindsey Bahr and Jonathan Landrum Jr. contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/ap-celebrities-among-thousands-evacuated-in-los-angeles-fires/	2025-01-08T20:31:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/677f5234199e20.31130196.jpeg?w=900

The 'quad-demic': What is it, and how can you stay healthy?	(NewsNation) — Staying healthy in the New Year presents a new challenge for Americans who are coping with what health officials are calling a 'quad-demic,' which involves a quartet of infectious viruses that are making the rounds. Each of the maladies can target different groups and age ranges, but here’s what you need to know to avoid contracting these illnesses and some tips for remaining healthy. What is the quad-demic? Although the trifecta of flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are commonly paired, norovirus outbreaks around the United States have added to concerns of a quad-demic. 'All of the viruses are here, it’s just they’re affecting different areas a little bit differently,' Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told Fortune. What is HMPV, and should we fear another pandemic? Flu Cases of influenza, or the flu, reached 40 million between 2023-2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Most people recover from the flu within days to a couple of weeks, but some cases can become severe. Approximately 28,000 people died last flu season. Flu symptoms include: Fever or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue COVID-19 COVID-19 has become a part of life just as the flu once did. Cases are nowhere near as high as they were when the virus was first introduced, but the U.S. is still seeing positive tests, hospitalizations and deaths. COVID-19 antigen home tests indicating a positive result are photographed in New York. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) Between Oct. 1, 2024, and Dec. 14, 2024, the CDC estimates there were between 2.7 and nearly 5 million illnesses. Hospitalizations in major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York were all up sharply as the year came to an end and as 2025 began. COVID-19 symptoms include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sore throat Congestion or runny nose New loss of taste or smell Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea COVID-19 and flu symptoms are similar, but they are caused by different viruses. 'You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same,' the CDC advises. Anyone experiencing symptoms should take a COVID-19 test, which can be found at testing sites, your doctor’s office or over-the-counter at pharmacies. RSV RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs, usually peaking in December and January. The symptoms are similar to the common cold and other respiratory infections like the flu and COVID-19. Get fact-based, unbiased news coverage 24/7 with the NewsNation app. Download it here. Infants and older adults are most susceptible. RSV can cause other illnesses like bronchiolitis, which is the inflammation of the lungs’ small airways, and pneumonia. RSV symptoms include: Runny nose Congestion Decrease in appetite Coughing Sneezing Fever Wheezing The CDC warns not all symptoms will appear at once and may come in stages. Infants may experience only irritability, decreased activity and breathing difficulties without the other symptoms. Norovirus The stomach bug is striking again. Norovirus is highly contagious, spreads through contact and causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines. This electron microscope image provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a cluster of norovirus virions. (Charles D. Humphrey/CDC via AP, File) The CDC reports about 19 to 21 million annual cases. People of all ages can get norovirus, but more severe infections occur in children younger than 5 years old, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Norovirus symptoms typically develop within 12-48 hours of exposure. They include: Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Fever Headache Body aches Dehydration What areas are affected? The illnesses are hitting various pockets of the country, according to Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director for the Infection Control and Prevention program at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Increases in flu cases have been the most problematic around the country, Hawkinson told NewsNation. New cases of COVID-19 are also being reported after the number of positive cases dropped following a spike over the summer months, he said. How to prevent getting sick Doctors are encouraging Americans who have not gotten a flu shot or the latest COVID-19 vaccine to avoid contracting one or more of the prevalent viruses. According to the CDC, 40.8% of adults have gotten the flu vaccine, while just 20% of Americans have been vaccinated for COVID-19 this season. A vaccine for RSV is also available for residents who are 75 years of age or older or those who live with certain health conditions. RSV vaccines are generally available to anyone 60 years of age or older, Hawkinson said. However, if residents got the RSV shot last year when the vaccine was first released, they do not need to get a second dose. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } There is currently no vaccine for norovirus, but doctors say the best way to avoid this virus is to follow good hygiene practices, including regular handwashing. Hawkinson told NewsNation it is not too late to get a flu shot. On average, 10 to 14 days are normally required to build up immunity to a virus after a vaccine has been administered. Flu shots that are administered now can still be effective, Hawkinson said. Are masks making a comeback? Masks became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic, and usage in places like hospitals, doctor's offices and dental practices remained in place. Now, some of those requirements are making a comeback. Amid threats of the quad-demic, hospitals such as Duke Health in North Carolina and Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts updated their masking and visitor guidelines, the Daily Mail reported. Hospitals in at least eight states including Wisconsin, California, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey and New York are either requiring or strongly recommending masks in their facilities, the report said.

While requirements and mandates in medical facilities are changing, masks in public places like restaurants, bars and gyms remain a personal preference.

It is terrifying': Pacific Palisades resident details evacuation	(NewsNation) — Tricia Cosentino does not yet have much information to go on, but she fears the worst about the status of her Pacific Palisades home and tutoring business as several Los Angeles County wildfires rage on. Cosentino told NewsNation she has received text messages that suggest Palisades Village, a local shopping center, 'is totally gone' and the block where her business is located 'doesn’t exist anymore.' How to help victims of LA wildfires As far as her Palisades home goes, that too is unknown. Cosentino said she watched the wildfire before first responders arrived and did not believe it would be problematic. Thirty minutes later, she was running through her home to collect her belongings, including family mementos. Cosentino lives in Palisades Highlands, a canyon neighborhood located in the Santa Monica mountains. Even when her neighbors were ordered to evacuate, she said she was still not all that worried. As time passed, though, she said the situation intensified. Cosentino said she and family members had wet towels on their faces and that both hillsides were on fire as the family tried to make their way out of the neighborhood. 'I realized I couldn’t see, and I had no choice but to turn around and go back,' she said. An hour later, Cosentino said her family realized they were not safe at home. The family entered a long line that was part of the police escort and felt they were out of danger. As the family was escorted to the beach, Cosentino told her son to cover his face to shield him from seeing what was happening around them. 'When you looked behind (you), the hills were burning,' Cosentino said. She said her neighborhood is now in flames and that the reservoir that typically provides water to firefighters is empty. She said she has friends who have lost their homes along Pacific Coast Highway. LA wildfire evacuee abandons car, told ‘run for your life’ She says smoke is now billowing over the Pacific Ocean. 'It is terrifying,' Cosentino said. Cosentino said every time she receives a text message, it is from another person who has lost their home. Her tutoring center serves 150 students, Cosentino said. With their schools now gone, she said she hopes to help the pupils in any way she can. Cosentino said her husband owns a home in Ojai, 65 miles from Pacific Palisades, and that he is safe. But her community as she knows it — including historic buildings and the local theater where her daughter participated in plays — is now gone. She said she does not know if her home is still standing. 'That community — we are like a family,' Cosentino said. 'We are all displaced. … It’s really hard to wrap your head around the fact that everything you have and everyone you know is in the same situation.' 'It’s a nightmare, and we’re going to get through it,' she said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/terrifying-pacific-palisades-details-evacuation/	2025-01-08T13:19:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25008142636991.jpg?w=900
Biden visited Los Angeles area fire station for wildfire briefing	(NewsNation) — President Joe Biden visited a fire station in the Los Angeles area for a briefing as firefighters continue to battle the raging wildfires that have engulfed the area. Biden was joined by First lady Jill Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom at the Santa Monica Fire Station #5 for the brief visit. The president posted on X Tuesday that he would be providing any 'federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire.' 'Earlier tonight, FEMA approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support areas that are impacted and help reimburse the state of California for the immediate firefighting costs. My Administration will do everything it can to support the response. I urge the residents of the Pacific Palisades and the surrounding areas of Los Angeles to stay vigilant and listen to local officials,' he posted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/biden-to-visit-los-angeles-area-fire-station-to-provide-briefing-on-wildfires/	2025-01-08T11:10:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25008697179403.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — A Pacific Palisades resident says their community has 'lost' so much as wildfires continue to ravage the Los Angeles area. Pacific Palisades community council member Sue Kohl told NewsNation that embers from the massive wildfires blew over their entire town igniting much of the area. 'We've lost our churches, schools, pharmacies, restaurants, both supermarkets. hundreds and hundreds of homes,' she said. LA area wildfires: Two dead,’high number’ of injuries reported 'Those of us who live down below and what was always considered the safer areas, the place you not in the hills, these embers because of the winds blew out of those hills and went over the entire town.' Multiple wildfires are ripping through parts of Los Angeles County, all at 0% containment as of Wednesday morning. Two people were reported dead in the Eaton Fire, which is in the Angeles National Forest and Altadena area of Los Angeles County and Pasadena, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said. Officials have said more than 80,000 people are under evacuation orders because of all the fires. Kohl said she and many of the residents evacuated Tuesday, but the town still needs more firefighters to help battle the massive blaze. 'We don't have enough LAPD firemen and frankly with the winds the way they are, I mean, I don’t know what enough would look like because they're fighting an impossible battle,' Kohl said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/pacific-palisades-resident-says-community-lost-much/	2025-01-08T10:56:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25008142636991.jpg?w=900
Where are the Los Angeles area wildfires?	(NewsNation) — Multiple wildfires are ripping through parts of the Los Angeles, California, area, scorching thousands of acres. There have been two deaths reported in the Eaton Fire, located in the Angeles National Forest and Altadena area of Los Angeles County and Pasadena. Wildfires in California Wildfires began on Tuesday, Jan. 7 and tore through Los Angeles. A significant number of people are injured, and more than 100,000 people are under evacuation orders, according to officials.

UnitedHealth units ordered to pay $165M for misleading consumers	(NewsNation) — Three UnitedHealth-owned insurance companies must pay more than $165 million for deceptive conduct that misled thousands of consumers into unknowingly buying supplemental health insurance in Massachusetts. In a December order, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Helene Kazanjian said penalties stem from marketing practices between 2012 and 2016 by HealthMarkets and its two subsidiaries, The Chesapeake Life Insurance Company and HealthMarkets Insurance Agency, which were found to violate the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. The ruling follows a non-jury trial to assess damages after the companies were already deemed liable. What kind of masks protect from wildfire smoke? Kazanjian said sales agents were trained to hide policy costs from consumers, calling it 'egregious,' and 'targeting vulnerable consumers who could least afford their products. The nearly $50.1 million in restitution and $115.1 million in civil penalties awarded by Kazanjian was less than the $368 million sought by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell's office. Campbell hailed Kazanjian's decision, saying it awarded the state the largest civil penalties it has ever recovered under the state's consumer protection law. Want to avoid the stomach flu? Here's how to do it In a statement, UnitedHealthcare said it would appeal the decision, which is 'clearly unsupported by the evidence and contrary to established Massachusetts law,' according to Reuters. In 2020, Campbell's predecessor, now-Governor Maura Healey, accused HealthMarkets of a deceptive scheme cheating more than 15,000 residents out of more than $43.5 million since 2011, violating a 2009 settlement. In 2022, a different state court judge found HealthMarkets liable, leading to a damages trial in 2023.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/unitedhealth-units-pay-165m-misleading-consumers/	2025-01-08T08:46:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6733dc0fd18934.56547248.jpeg?w=900
LA County Fires: Evacuate as soon as you can, councilmember says	(NewsNation) — As wildfires ravage parts of southern California, Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president of the Los Angeles City Council, says people should leave the picture-taking to the professionals. 'We have people out trying to get videos for Tiktok and to help Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook or Instagram. We don't need your video on this,' Harris-Dawson told 'Morning in America' Wednesday. 'There's plenty of footage from the professionals — go inside, go to a place that is safe, and stay off the roads as much as possible.' While Harris-Dawson can understand some people also want to stay to protect their property, the problem with that is the potential danger to neighbors. Photos: Los Angeles wildfire engulfs Pacific Palisades 'Emergency resources may have to come and pull you out,' Harris-Dawson said. Tens of thousands of people are evacuating as three wildfires rip through parts of Los Angeles County. They were all at 0% containment as of Wednesday morning. 'We advise everybody, when there's an evacuation order, or even if you think there might be danger, evacuate as soon as you possibly can,' Harris-Dawson urged. 'Other than that, we're asking everybody that can stay off the roads so that our roads are open for emergency vehicles.' For those living in the neighborhoods affected by the fires, 'it is completely terrifying,' Harris-Dawson said. 'This is one of the mightiest sets of fires that we've seen in Southern California,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/la-county-fires-evacuate-soon-councilmember/	2025-01-08T07:23:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25008142636991.jpg?w=900
Cybertruck driver used ChatGPT to plan Las Vegas attack, police s...	LAS VEGAS (KLAS) – Police found a six-page manifesto on Matthew Livelsberger’s phone and said he used ChatGPT to plan his New Year's Day bombing at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a news conference Tuesday. Livelsberger, 37, shot himself in the head just before fireworks and other explosive material detonated in the back of a Tesla Cybertruck parked at the front entrance of the hotel. Livelsberger, a Green Beret in the U.S. Army Special Forces, was home on leave in Colorado Springs, Colorado, when he rented the Cybertruck and drove to Las Vegas. The explosion was set off using racing fuel and birdshot, the ATF said Tuesday. The blast was not triggered by a detonator but by an unknown 'flame,' which could include the gunshot Livelsberger used to kill himself. Cybertruck tracking in Las Vegas case raises privacy concerns Police suspect Livelsberger initially planned an attack at the Grand Canyon, potentially to launch off the glass skywalk there, but diverted to Las Vegas, police said based off more documents discovered on his phone. LVMPD Asst. Sheriff Dori Koren said police still do not know why he chose Trump Tower instead. During a news conference last week, FBI Special Agent In Charge Spencer Evans said Livelsberger didn't hold any animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump or Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In the manifesto, police found a 'variance of grievances' including political and social issues, such as criticisms of the current administration. Livelsberger wrote he had 'graphic encounters' replaying in his head from the Army and that he only intended to harm himself. Asst. Sheriff Koren said this added to the evidence previously discussed that Livelsberger likely suffered from PTSD. Vegas Cybertruck explosion driver ID’d as Army soldier from Colorado: Source Police also said Livelsberger used ChatGPT to help plan out the attack. A few of the entries posted in the application included 'How much Tannerite is equivalent to 1 pound of TNT?' and 'What pistol could set it off?' Other questions asked to ChatGPT included where to buy fireworks and the location of the largest gun store in Denver. 'We are saddened by this incident and committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly,' a spokesperson from OpenAI, who owns ChatGPT, said in a statement. 'Our models are designed to refuse harmful instructions and minimize harmful content. In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities. We're working with law enforcement to support their investigation.' 'This investigation is far from over,' McMahill, adding there was still a laptop, another phone, and a smartwatch to go through data on.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/cybertruck-driver-used-chatgpt-las-vegas-attack/	2025-01-08T03:37:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Untitled_1e3208-e1736297913812.png?w=800
Fierce overnight winds expected to fuel Pacific Palisades fire	(NEXSTAR) – Tens of thousands of residents were placed under evacuation orders Tuesday after a rapidly-spreading wildfire ripped through the affluent Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, according to Nexstar's KTLA. During a press conference Tuesday afternoon, California Gov. Gavin Newsom confirmed that he saw 'many structures' already destroyed by the fire and warned residents that intense, Santa Ana winds were expected to continue overnight between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. 'By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,' Newsom said. The Palisades fire was first reported around 10:30 a.m. PDT Tuesday in the 1100 block of North Piedra Morada Drive. By 3:30 p.m., the fire had exploded to more than 1,200 acres and was expected to keep growing amid strong Santa Ana winds.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel) There was no containment as of Tuesday afternoon, according to CalFire. By sundown, the fire had exploded to more than 2,900 acres and was expected to keep growing amid strong Santa Ana winds. Over 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders Tuesday evening. Evacuations were ordered for the entire community down to the Pacific Ocean, according to CalFire. The evacuation order also included areas of Malibu east of Las Flores. Evacuees were urged to travel south toward Pacific Coast Highway utilizing Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,' Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour.' The blaze ignited on a day when fire officials were bracing for gusts of up to 100 miles an hour, a speed the National Weather Service described as 'life-threatening,' 'extreme' and 'destructive.' The high winds combined with unseasonably dry conditions to make the situation even more combustible. Interactive 3D map shows Palisades Fire perimeter, evacuation zones More than 100 firefighters and pre-positioned strike teams were battling the blaze Tuesday, David Ortiz of the LAFD said. 'This is pretty much the worst possible scenario for a firefight,' said Ortiz. There was no initial estimate for the number of structures damaged or destroyed. However, news footage showed several homes ablaze. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Ortiz described the fire as a blowtorch and urged residents to follow orders if asked to leave. 'Do not stand in the way of this fire,' Ortiz said. Video from Alert California showed a large plume of smoke rising over the Santa Monica Mountains. KTLA spoke with actor Steve Guttenberg who said he was helping to move cars along Palisades Drive so fire trucks could get through and evacuees could leave. 'There are families up there, there are pets up there, there are people who really need help,' Guttenberg said. 'It's really important for people to help each other ... don't worry about your personal property, just get out. I have friends up there that can't get out right now and they've been given evacuation orders.' Fire crews have even resorted to using a bulldozer to move parked cars out of the way. The fierce Santa Ana winds driving the blaze arrived Tuesday along with morning snow in mountainous communities and inland rainfall, making for 'a rather bizarre forecast,' KTLA meteorologist Henry DiCarlo said. Pacific Palisades is located about 10 miles from Malibu, where the Franklin Fire burned more than 4,000 acres and burned several homes after erupting during similar windy conditions in December.

What could Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ look like?	President-elect Trump said that Republicans are working to craft a 'powerful' piece of legislation to advance his agenda. Republicans had already begun preparing to use a special procedure known as budget reconciliation to bypass Democratic opposition in the Senate to extend expiring provisions in Trump’s signature 2017 tax law. But calls have grown in the party in recent months to use the maneuver to enact other parts of Trump’s agenda, including border security. Divides have emerged among Republicans over how to act on those priorities, including whether a two-package or one-package approach is preferable, as leadership faces a tall task to keep the party unified behind a strategy — particularly the narrow House GOP majority. Here are some of the ideas that Republicans have floated including. Tax cuts Extending key parts of Trump’s signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been a top-of-mind issue for many congressional Republicans as they chart out their reconciliation wishlist. That includes individual provisions that are set to expire later this year, which, if lapsed, would mean higher income tax rates for most earners, a lower standard deduction, and a rollback of the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, among other changes. Republicans have signaled there could be some added tweaks, with Trump also reiterating his proposal to end taxes on tips. 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before,' he wrote on his Truth Social site this week. 'We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even better - NO TAX ON TIPS.' Border security Border security has also emerged as a key provision of whatever reconciliation bill Republicans attempt to pass. But they disagree on whether to pass it in one package with tax provisions, or in a separate, smaller package that can be done more quickly. 'Delaying border security is a dangerous idea,' Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. 'If you can do it all in April, maybe it works, but I’m very leery.' Republicans have floated funding for border wall construction and additional detention beds, though specifics are still under discussion. Trump, who said on Tuesday that he thinks he was elected 'largely because of the border,' has indicated he prefers one large bill, but signaled openness to a two-package approach. 'I like one big beautiful bill and I always have,' Trump said on Tuesday. 'I always will, but if two is more certain, it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff.' Trump additionally voiced support for taking action on areas like energy and defense as part of the potential package.His comments come as some Republicans have also raised concern over how tax reforms would fare under the two-pronged given the difficulty of moving two budget reconciliation packages, particularly when considering the party’s slim control in the House. Debt limit Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on Tuesday that part of the plan is for Republicans to act on the nation’s debt limit using the reconciliation process. 'The intention is to handle the debt limit in reconciliation in the process, and that way, as the Republican Party, the party in charge of both chambers, we then get to determine the details of that,' Johnson told reporters. 'If it runs through regular order or regular process and as a standalone, or as part of the appropriations, for example, then you have to have both parties negotiating, and we feel like we’re in better stead to do it ourselves,' he also said. Trump previously called on Republicans to act on the nation’s debt ceiling as part of a bipartisan deal that averted a government shutdown in December. But that effort fell flat as Democrats and some conservatives pushed back on the demand. The party out of power — which Democrats are this year — can demand major concessions in return for agreeing to raise the debt limit. Republicans successfully used the strategy in the last Congress to secure a deal with President Biden that suspended the debt ceiling through the end of 2024, along with caps on some federal spending. Spending cuts Republicans have also discussed the prospect of a deal to pair a $1.5 trillion increase in the debt limit with $2.5 trillion in spending cuts using budget reconciliation. At the time news broke of the handshake agreement last month, Republicans said the focus of the cuts would be mandatory spending, which also covers entitlement funding. Democrats seized on the news at the time, accusing Republicans of wanting to set sights on Social Security, but the special budget maneuver cannot be used to make changes to the program. Johnson appeared to rule out Republicans pursuing Medicare cuts as part of the reconciliation process when asked by CNN recently. 'No,' the Speaker said, adding Trump 'has made very clear, Social Security and Medicare have to be preserved and we are not, no one is coming in with the intention of cutting benefits in any way or anything.'

Tax cuts Extending key parts of Trump’s signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been a top-of-mind issue for many congressional Republicans as they chart out their reconciliation wishlist. That includes individual provisions that are set to expire later this year, which, if lapsed, would mean higher income tax rates for most earners, a lower standard deduction, and a rollback of the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, among other changes. Republicans have signaled there could be some added tweaks, with Trump also reiterating his proposal to end taxes on tips. 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before,' he wrote on his Truth Social site this week. 'We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts, which were the largest in History, but we will make it even better - NO TAX ON TIPS.' Border security Border security has also emerged as a key provision of whatever reconciliation bill Republicans attempt to pass. But they disagree on whether to pass it in one package with tax provisions, or in a separate, smaller package that can be done more quickly. 'Delaying border security is a dangerous idea,' Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. 'If you can do it all in April, maybe it works, but I’m very leery.' Republicans have floated funding for border wall construction and additional detention beds, though specifics are still under discussion. Trump, who said on Tuesday that he thinks he was elected 'largely because of the border,' has indicated he prefers one large bill, but signaled openness to a two-package approach. 'I like one big beautiful bill and I always have,' Trump said on Tuesday. 'I always will, but if two is more certain, it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff.' Trump additionally voiced support for taking action on areas like energy and defense as part of the potential package.His comments come as some Republicans have also raised concern over how tax reforms would fare under the two-pronged given the difficulty of moving two budget reconciliation packages, particularly when considering the party’s slim control in the House. Debt limit Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on Tuesday that part of the plan is for Republicans to act on the nation’s debt limit using the reconciliation process. 'The intention is to handle the debt limit in reconciliation in the process, and that way, as the Republican Party, the party in charge of both chambers, we then get to determine the details of that,' Johnson told reporters. 'If it runs through regular order or regular process and as a standalone, or as part of the appropriations, for example, then you have to have both parties negotiating, and we feel like we’re in better stead to do it ourselves,' he also said. Trump previously called on Republicans to act on the nation’s debt ceiling as part of a bipartisan deal that averted a government shutdown in December. But that effort fell flat as Democrats and some conservatives pushed back on the demand. The party out of power — which Democrats are this year — can demand major concessions in return for agreeing to raise the debt limit. Republicans successfully used the strategy in the last Congress to secure a deal with President Biden that suspended the debt ceiling through the end of 2024, along with caps on some federal spending. Spending cuts Republicans have also discussed the prospect of a deal to pair a $1.5 trillion increase in the debt limit with $2.5 trillion in spending cuts using budget reconciliation. At the time news broke of the handshake agreement last month, Republicans said the focus of the cuts would be mandatory spending, which also covers entitlement funding. Democrats seized on the news at the time, accusing Republicans of wanting to set sights on Social Security, but the special budget maneuver cannot be used to make changes to the program. Johnson appeared to rule out Republicans pursuing Medicare cuts as part of the reconciliation process when asked by CNN recently. 'No,' the Speaker said, adding Trump 'has made very clear, Social Security and Medicare have to be preserved and we are not, no one is coming in with the intention of cutting benefits in any way or anything.'

LA wildfire evacuee abandons car, told 'run for your life'	(NewsNation) — Ellen Bacher abandoned her car while fleeing the wildfire in Pacific Palisades Highlands after police approached her and said, 'Get out of your car, run for your life, and head toward the ocean.' Bacher, who has lived in the Highland section for 38 years, said her community knows there's only one road in and one way out, though they’ve always had a fire lane. 'The problem with this particular fire is the fire lane was on fire,' Bacher said during a Tuesday appearance on 'Banfield.' 'The bottom of Palisades Drive was on fire, so most people were trapped.' Bacher compared her day to the aftermath of 9/11, expressing gratitude for reaching safety with her family now safe in Long Beach. Palisades fire causes state of emergency declaration The rapidly moving blaze has spread to more than 2,900 acres, prompting mandatory immediate evacuations of nearby residents. There are 250 LAFD firefighters on scene, along with 46 engines, three trucks and five helicopters, officials said. Roughly 30,000 residents from 10,000 households have been ordered to evacuate.

How to stay safe during Southern California’s latest Santa Ana wind event 'Angelenos should be advised that the windstorm is expected to worsen tonight through tomorrow morning and to heed warnings, stay vigilant and stay safe,' the city recommended. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he reached out to President Joe Biden, who was in California when the blaze began and has started the process for receiving emergency funds. Newsom has declared a state of emergency.

What kind of masks protect from wildfire smoke?	(NewsNation) — With nearly 3000 acres burning in Califonia, health experts say N95 respirator masks offer the best protection against harmful wildfire smoke, provided they are worn correctly and fit properly. The masks, readily available at hardware stores and pharmacies, can filter out fine particles found in smoke that can irritate eyes, nose, throat and lungs, according to public health officials. However, they do not protect against hazardous gases sometimes present in smoke. Health officials emphasize that proper fit is crucial. The mask should have two straps that go around the head, seal tightly to the face, and be certified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 1,260 acres in hours Single-strap paper dust and surgical masks do not adequately protect from wildfire smoke. The most effective protection remains to stay indoors and limit outdoor activity during smoky conditions. Those who must be outside should take frequent breaks, as breathing through respirator masks requires more effort. Health officials warn that masks should be discarded when breathing becomes difficult, if they become damaged, or if the inside becomes dirty. They also note that respirator masks are not approved for children and will not work effectively for people with facial hair.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/masks-protect-wildfire-smoke/	2025-01-07T19:25:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/03/Masks-1-1-1.jpg?w=900
Migrant group being held near Acapulco by Mexican officials	(NewsNation) — Nearly 100 migrants who were part of a larger caravan moving from southern Mexico toward the U.S. southern border are being held in the coastal resort of Acapulco as part of an effort to keep them from crossing into the United States illegally. The migrants, who were part of a larger group who began traveling from Tapachula, Mexico, were originally traveling toward Juarez, Mexico, which is located just miles from the border and El Paso, Texas. However, as part of an operation known as 'Operation Carousel,' government officials are now breaking up migrant groups and are negotiating with them to travel to other Mexican states, sources told NewsNation. Facebook to end fact-checking, boost political content The dissolving of migrant caravans comes just two weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. The effort is being carried out to disperse migrants throughout the country to keep them far from the U.S. border, The Associated Press reported. The breaking up of the caravans also keeps large groups from accumulating in any one place. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has addressed the issue of deportations prior to Trump’s second term, making a surprising reversal on previous policy promises. Last month, Sheinbaum said Mexico would push the United States to send non-Mexican deportees to their countries of origin — now, she’s announced that Mexico is open to accepting foreign nationals. The policy of 'dispersion and exhaustion' has moved to the forefront of Mexican government officials’ immigration policy in recent years, according to the AP. Last year, it significantly reduced the number of immigrants reaching the U.S.-Mexico border, a former government official told the AP. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico over the migration of immigrants into the United States illegally. As part of Operation Carousel, Mexican authorities allow immigrants to walk for days before offering them a bus to various cities. Once there, they are promised to have their immigration status reviewed, the AP reported. A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told NewsNation the agency consistently monitors reports of mass migration to the U.S. southern border and stands ready to address any potential increase in migrant encounters. 11 migrants found locked in U-Haul in rural New Mexico President Joe Biden signed an executive order last year geared at securing the border. Under the presidential proclamation and the securing the border rule, noncitizens who cross into the United States without authorization will generally be ineligible for asylum. Migrants can face significant consequences, including removal from the United States, a five-year bar to return to the U.S., and potential additional criminal penalties that remain on their permanent record for years. 'We are aware of recent reports of a migrant caravan that has materialized in Southern Mexico, as we hear about several times per year,' the CBP spokesperson said. 'These reported caravans generally travel very slowly and often splinter before they make progress moving northbound towards the southwest border. The spokesperson said that the agency will continue to monitor developments in coordination with our foreign and interagency counterparts as we have with previous movements of migrants.' Although there has been a drop in encounters between illegal immigrants and immigration officials, smugglers and other 'bad actors' are continuing to spread false information that disregards the safety of vulnerable migrants, CBP officials said. 'The fact remains: the United States continues to enforce immigration law, and our borders are not open for those without a legal basis to enter the country,' the spokesperson said.

LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — A wind-whipped brush fire is burning in Pacific Palisades, and large plumes of smoke can be seen for miles, but one well-known actor is jumping in to help. Residents evacuating the area were met with slow traffic along Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard near Highland Village. Numerous fire engines were in the area as crews battled the nearby flames. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 770 acres in hours During this time, many have jumped into action, like actor Steve Guttenberg who lives nearby. The actor told NewsNation affiliate KTLA that he has friends who are unable to evacuate because of the traffic jam on Palisades Drive. 'There are people stuck up there. So we're trying to clear Palisades Drive and I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars,' he revealed, pointing up to the hill where traffic was slowly making its way down. 'There are families up there, there are pets up there. There are people who really need help,' he said with worry in his voice. Wearing a facemask, the 'It Takes Two' actor explained how important it is for everyone to 'band together' during this time of need. Steve Guttenberg at the Golden Gala: A Celebration of Excellence at The Beverly Hilton on January 3, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Gilbert Flores/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty Images) 'Don't worry about your personal property. Just get out. Get your loved ones and get out.' He told KTLA that he's urging people who have left their cars on Palisades Drive to leave their keys behind so they can move the cars to make room for incoming fire trucks. Rapidly growing Los Angeles wildfire explodes to 770 acres in hours 'What's happening is people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot. We really need people to move their cars,' the 'Police Academy' actor explained. 'If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.' Generally, officials recommend people stay in their cars while evacuating and advise against abandoning their vehicles.

Los Angeles prepares for ‘most significant windstorm in more than...	Wild weather – including rain, snow, high winds and dangerous fire conditions – is how Southern California is starting 2025, and officials in the L.A. are taking no chances ahead of the adverse conditions. The National Weather Service has described the windstorm hitting SoCal as 'life-threatening,' 'extreme' and 'destructive,' and snow flurries were seen Tuesday morning in mountain communities; further inland, rain showers caused slick roadways. In L.A., Mayor Karen Bass announced Tuesday morning that the city has activated its Emergency Operations Center to a Level 2 to ensure the safety of all Angelenos. Rapidly growing wildfire spreads in Los Angeles area 'Parts of the Los Angeles region will potentially face one of the most significant windstorms in more than a decade, and I urge Angelenos to continue monitoring the storm and stay vigilant and safe,' Mayor Bass said in a statement. 'Power outages as a result of downed power lines, increased fire risk and falling trees and debris should be expected during this time and the impacts and dangers of a windstorm should be taken seriously.' The mayor’s office released a list of resources and helpful information for residents to use during the windstorm: Reporting and tracking power outages: Visit www.ladwp.com/outages or call 1-800-DIAL-DWP (1-800-342-5397) Reporting blocked roadways: Service can be requested through www.lacity.gov/myla311 or by calling 311; Angelenos are also encouraged to download the MyLA311 mobile app Red Flag Warning updates: Check www.lafd.org/redflag for the latest updates; Red Flag parking restrictions have been in place since 8 a.m. Tuesday and are set to last until further notice Outage updates: LADWP will regularly update their X page to inform residents of power outages Weather updates: Click here for the hyperlocal forecast for your community, or visit the National Weather Service for the regional forecast In case of emergency: Dial 911 How to stay safe during Southern California’s latest Santa Ana wind event In addition to downing trees and causing power outages throughout the region early Tuesday morning, the dangerously high winds are already fueling brush fires in the area, including one that erupted and was later contained in the Santa Ana Riverbed in Colton around 5 a.m. A much larger and more rapidly spreading vegetation fire broke out around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday in L.A.’s upscale Pacific Palisades neighborhood. By noon, area residents were being told to prepare to evacuate as it spread to over 200 acres in about an hour.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/los-angeles-windstorm-santa-ana/	2025-01-07T13:03:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25007638542773.jpg?w=900

Ex-President Jimmy Carter's body begins journey to Washington	(NewsNation) — The body of former President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Tuesday, where it will lie in state ahead of Thursday’s funeral at Washington National Cathedral. Carter, who died at the age of 100 last week, had been lying in repose at the Carter Center in Atlanta before the 39th president’s remains were taken to Dobbins Air Force Base on Tuesday. Inclement weather on the East Coast delayed transporting Carter’s body to Washington by about 90 minutes Tuesday. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know A small ceremony with Carter’s family took place at the Georgia Air Force Base before Carter’s remains were to be flown to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where another ceremony was scheduled to be held. Carter was scheduled to be taken to the U.S. Naval Museum before the former president's remains will be transported to the U.S. Capitol. Carter served in the Navy before he became a Georgia state senator and the state's governor. Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver a eulogy at a ceremony for lawmakers Tuesday afternoon before public viewing at the Capitol Rotunda begins. President Joe Biden will deliver a eulogy at the national funeral ceremony Thursday, which will coincide with a national day of mourning. The most recent national day of mourning was held in 2018 following the death of President George H.W. Bush. Carter will then be returned to his hometown of Plains, Georgia, where he will be buried next to his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter, who died at the age of 96 in 2023.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-body-washington/	2025-01-07T10:44:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25004778912187.jpg?w=900

Live: Trump speaks after sentencing delay denied in NYC case	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump may pursue a last-minute appeal after the New York judge overseeing his hush money case rejected his effort to delay sentencing, set for Friday. Judge Juan Merchan rejected a request to delay sentencing, keeping it just 10 days before Trump returns to the White House. 'This court has considered defendant's arguments in support of his motion and finds that they are, for the most part, a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past,' he wrote in a court filing Monday. Trump's attorneys had sought to postpone sentencing indefinitely, while they appealed. He has already been denied a dismissal in the case, which he argues could mark the 'end of the presidency as we know it' if upheld. Trump is expected to address the case on Tuesday during a news conference at 10 a.m. at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. Judge signals no punishment for conviction Merchan signaled he is inclined to impose no punishment for Trump’s 34-count felony conviction, given concerns about his immunity from criminal prosecution upon taking the oath of office. Should Selena's killer get parole? Responding sergeant says no He said an unconditional discharge 'appears to be the most viable solution' and would allow Trump to appear virtually. In May, a New York City jury found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Daniels was paid during the campaign to keep quiet about an affair she allegedly had with Trump, which he denies. Manhattan DA: Immunity doesn't apply with Trump not yet in office In a court filing this week, Trump's legal team argued for postponing sentencing, stating, 'The court should vacate the sentencing hearing until President Trump's immunity appeals are fully and finally resolved, which should result in a dismissal of this case, which should have never been brought in the first place.' They contend the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity should apply, citing jury evidence like social media posts and testimony from aides from Trump's time as president. NYC subway arson suspect set to be arraigned They also argue that immunity should extend since Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. However, the Manhattan DA's office opposes delaying sentencing, asserting that immunity shouldn't apply while Trump is out of office. Merchan has previously suggested he is unlikely to sentence Trump to prison.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/trump-investigation/trump-react-judge-denying-delay-hush-money-case/	2025-01-07T06:57:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24345686164055.jpg?w=900
NYC subway arson suspect set to be arraigned	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — The man accused of burning a woman alive while she was asleep on a New York City subway is set to be arraigned Tuesday on murder and arson charges. Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, will appear in a Brooklyn courtroom around 9:30 a.m. local time. Authorities plan to unseal the indictment Tuesday following his court appearance. NYPD identifies the victim as Debrina Kawam Zapeta-Calil is accused of using a lighter to set a woman's clothes on fire while she was asleep on a stopped F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn around 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 22. Prosecutors say Zapeta-Calil intensified the blaze by fanning it with a shirt before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned to death. Officers at the station reportedly smelled and saw smoke and observed the victim in the train car fully engulfed in flames, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The fire was extinguished, and the woman was pronounced dead. Could fandom cause jury nullification in Luigi Mangione trial? The victim was identified as 57-year-old Debrina Kawam, according to the New York Police Department. Zapeta-Calil was arrested on Dec. 23, after being taken into custody the previous day. He’s charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and arson. According to police, there is no connection or prior interaction between the suspect and the victim, though the indictment, set to be released later Tuesday, may reveal additional details.

Bill O'Reilly was in a 'Cabinet meeting' during Mar-a-lago visit	(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says President-elect Donald Trump is 'laser-locked' on fulfilling campaign promises and significantly more prepared for the presidency than during his first term following a recent private meeting at Mar-a-Lago. The author, who said he has met nine presidents so far, got a 'summons' from Mar-a-Lago and felt obligated to go as a journalist despite not knowing what he was called for. 'When a president says, 'Hey, come on over,' you go on over,' O'Reilly said Monday on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' O'Reilly described sitting in on a 'literal Cabinet meeting' at Trump's Florida estate, where he observed discussions about tariffs and other policy matters. Bill O’Reilly: ‘Woke movement is anti-American’ O'Reilly, who celebrated his 50th year in journalism, said Trump's grasp of presidential responsibilities has evolved considerably since 2017. 'Eight years ago, Donald Trump really didn't know what he was looking at as President of the United States, and he leaned on people for advice. That's gone. He knows exactly what the job is.' The meeting included former Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Peter Navarro along with Howard Lutnick and others, O'Reilly said. He described detailed discussions about using tariffs to pressure companies like Apple to move manufacturing from China to the United States. While Trump appears more knowledgeable about governance, O'Reilly predicted the next administration would face internal conflicts despite promises of strict discipline from incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Jimmy Carter ‘wasn’t a good president but tried’ to be: Bill O’Reilly 'The first year of every single presidential administration has been a bloodbath behind the scenes, and this one will be too,' O'Reilly said. 'People are going to try to stab each other to death, not literally, but figuratively.' O'Reilly's observations came from what he described as a three-hour visit to Mar-a-Lago, including both the meeting and dinner with Trump. '[Trump] certainly comes in in a very, very strong position, the strongest position of any president since maybe JFK,' O'Reilly said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/bill-oreilly-cabinet-meeting-mar-a-lago-visit/	2025-01-06T17:31:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-2.jpg?w=900
New migrant caravan heads toward US as Trump return draws closer	(NewsNation) — Sources in Mexico tell NewsNation a caravan of migrants has just taken off from Tapachula, Mexico, with hundreds heading north to Chiapas, Mexico, on foot. The majority of migrants are Venezuelan, sources say. The ultimate destination is reportedly Juarez, Mexico, located just miles from the border, and El Paso, Texas. It's the 10th such caravan to form in the southern municipality since October. According to Mexican immigration authorities, they expect even more of these caravans to form and depart in the coming days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump and his 'border czar,' Tom Homan, have promised to carry out mass deportations on a historical scale, decrying sanctuary cities and their leaders who plan to oppose such actions. New international rail bridge ‘milestone’ connecting Laredo, Texas, to Mexico completed The chances of the caravan reaching the United States' southern border are slim to none as Mexican immigration authorities continue to step up their efforts to deter and block migrant groups from even reaching Mexico City. Sources tell NewsNation authorities have dubbed this 'Operation Carousel' and that they are breaking up migrant groups and negotiating with them to travel to other Mexican states. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has addressed the issue of deportations prior to Trump's second term, making a surprising reversal on previous policy promises. Last month, Sheinbaum said Mexico would push the United States to send non-Mexican deportees to their countries of origin — now, she's announced that Mexico is open to accepting foreign nationals. Border patrol to be front and center at inauguration parade The stance shift comes as the Mexican government promises to open 25 new shelters to house deported migrants. Immigration attorney Rolando Vazquez, who primarily represents Venezuelan nationals, said these shelters will lead to self-deporting from Mexico. 'These foreign nationals are going to find it more desirable to be in their home country than it is to be in Mexico, and they'll eventually go back to their home country,' Vazquez said. 'And that's what we've seen in the past in the last Trump administration when they implemented the MPP program.' Sources in Tijuana and Matamoros tell NewsNation they expect migrants to rush the border in the final days before Trump's inauguration, as they fear the CBP One app will end at that point.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/migrant-caravan-tapachula-mexico/	2025-01-06T15:49:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Border-wall-Hidalgo-041423.jpg?w=900
Could fandom cause jury nullification in Luigi Mangione trial?	(NewsNation) — Increasing public sympathy for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, could pose the possibility of jury nullification despite the overwhelming evidence mounted against him, some legal experts say. Mangione faces multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism under federal and state charges in New York and Pennsylvania, after allegedly gunning down Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in Midtown Manhattan on Dec 4. The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Luigi Mangione’s fandom could lead to jury nullification Since his arrest, Mangione’s online fandom has rapidly grown, with supporters posting sympathetic messages, creating fan accounts and even raising thousands on crowdfunding sites to pay for his legal defense fund. To these sympathizers, Mangione’s alleged crime symbolizes a rejection of the American health care system. That, coupled with him being easy on the eyes, has turned Mangione into a 'modern-day Robin Hood,' former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told NewsNation. 'I have never seen a criminal defendant, much less an accused murderer, receive as much sympathy both on traditional media and social media. He is a folk hero of sorts to many,' Rahmani said. Who is UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione? Rahmani said there is a 'very high possibility' of jury nullification in his case where a sympathetic juror could hold out for Mangione. This photo, provided by the Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, shows Luigi Mangione, a suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, receiving a citation for failing to observe a posted closed-area sign, in Honolulu, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2023. (Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources via AP) Jury nullification occurs when a jury returns a not guilty verdict even though jurors believe beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has broken the law. This may happen when jurors disagree with the law or the punishment. If that happens, there is a high probability of a mistrial, which happens when jurors aren't able to reach the same verdict, Rahmani said. A nullifying juror could also convince other jurors to choose an acquittal. Defense lawyers will lean in Mangione’s defense lawyers, like any defense attorneys, will try to utilize any possibility of nullification, former federal prosecutor Joel Cohen said. 'That’s their job,' he said, to find those nullifiers and keep them on the jury, and in this case, there is a real possibility of it happening. With the seemingly overwhelming evidence against Mangione, jury nullification could be what gets him acquitted or results in a mistrial, so the defense will lean into this, he said. Luigi Mangione classmate: ‘A lot of families are hurting’ In most cases, people come in with some sort of bias, and even when they say they are capable of putting that aside for the case, it still manages to creep in, Cohen said. While a juror does not have the right to nullify, once they are seated, they have the power to do it, he added. 'Most jurors who have that nullifying feeling are not going to be honest about it most of the time, so it's really hard to get into their heart and soul to find out what they're really thinking and what the reason is for wanting to be on the jury,' he said. That’s where judges and prosecutors really need to step up and do their best to weed it out, he said. The evidence will prevail over jury nullification Not all legal experts see nullification as a potential threat. 'I think it's very unlikely that a case like this is going to confront something like jury nullification,' Gregory Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law, said. 'Most of us hate insurance companies and have had difficult experiences dealing with insurance companies, but that doesn't mean we think people should be going around murdering insurance executives in the street.' Germain said it’s unlikely potential nullifiers will be able to hide that level of bias during the jury selection process. He adds that while Mangione does have a large fanbase, most 'people who want to live in a civilized society are not going to find him to be an appealing defendant.' 4 Luigi Mangione documentaries planned The mountain of evidence that appears to be against him will be too great for jurors to fling aside, he said. 'It just sounds like such an overwhelmingly strong case of murder that I just would be shocked if a jury came back with a not guilty verdict.' The larger dangers of jury nullification in Mangione case Jury nullification in the Mangione case could set a dangerous precedent that undermines the legal system, Rahmani said. 'If we can't convict murderers who are caught in broad daylight in Manhattan because of the nature of the victim, it's going to be a problem,' Rahmani said. Our legal system is based on fair, impartial juries, so anything that threatens that will pose issues. The sentiment is shared by Cohen, who said there are several 'dangers' of jury nullification, especially if it was done through deception during the jury selection process. If people think they will get off the hook because a victim is unsympathetic, that may lead to similar attacks, he said. In the Mangione case, it’s even more concerning because this appears to be a planned attack.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fandom-jury-nullification-luigi-mangione-trial/	2025-01-06T14:48:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6769efd59b9de0.24500426.jpeg?w=900
First US bird flu death confirmed in Louisiana	(NewsNation) — The Louisiana Public Health Department has reported the first bird flu-related human death in the United States. The patient, who was over 65, contracted bird flu after coming in contact with both a backyard bird flock and wild birds. That person was the first to contract a severe case of the illness in the nation, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient was 'reported to have underlying medical conditions,' health officials said in the release. Feeling sick? Here’s what you might have 'The Department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient’s family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one.

Trump pitches 'merged' US, Canada after Trudeau resignation annou...	(The Hill) - President-elect Trump pitched the idea of a 'merged' United States and Canada after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, noting there would be no tariffs if the two countries were one. 'If Canada merged with the U.S., there would no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them,' Trump posted to his Truth Social site. 'Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!' Congress formally certifies Trump’s election win Trudeau announced Monday that he would be resigning before general elections later this year. His Liberal Party is polling poorly as tensions with Trump have risen over the issue of tariffs. 'This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I’m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,' Trudeau said. After Trudeau’s announcement Monday, Trump touted the idea that many Canadians would 'LOVE' the idea of being the '51st State' of the U.S. He said the merger would be beneficial for the U.S., because it would 'no longer suffer' from 'massive Trade Deficits' and subsidies that it provides to Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces resignation 'Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,' Trump said. Trudeau has served as Canada’s prime minister for nine years and led the Liberal Party for 11. He has faced mounting crises, including the resignation of a top minister and a confrontation with Trump’s 25 percent tariff plan, among other issues.

What is HMPV, and should we fear another pandemic?	(NewsNation) — China has reported a surge in cases of human metapneumovirus, particularly among children, with some online claiming hospitals are overwhelmed. China has pushed back on those claims and said the increase in cases is due to an increased ability to detect and identify HMPV. What is it? HMPV is a virus that causes upper respiratory symptoms, with some cases also leading to lower respiratory symptoms like pneumonia. Woman warning others after accidentally gluing eye shut with nail glue It's part of the same genus of viruses as RSV and the symptoms of the two can be similar. Most people contract HMPV before the age of five, and although it is possible to be infected again, subsequent infections are usually milder. A first-time HMPV infection is more likely to cause severe illness, which is why worse cases are often seen in children. What are the symptoms? HMPV is similar to the common cold for most people. Symptoms include a stuffy or runny nose, coughing, shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, wheezing and a rash. For most people, the illness will be mild. Children are at most risk from HMPV, as well as those over 65 or those with weakened immune symptoms. 19 of 20 US counties with lowest health insurance coverage located in Texas HMPV can also aggravate existing conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How is the virus spread? Like most viruses, HMPV is spread by coming into contact with an infected person or from objects contaminated with the virus. Coughing, sneezing, shaking hands, kissing and touching easily contaminated objects like doorknobs and phones are all ways the virus can be spread. Proper handwashing, covering your mouth when you sneeze or cough, avoiding touching your face, staying home when sick and social distancing can help avoid spreading HMPV. Masking is also effective in curbing the spread, with China mandating masks in some regions hit hard by the virus. Where is the virus spreading? The majority of cases reported right now come from northern China. In light of the outbreak, some other countries have also stepped up monitoring. Intermittent fasting could slow down hair growth: Study The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does monitor HMPV so an uptick in the U.S. should be caught by scientists. However, it is not on the list of diseases that states are required to report to the CDC. Will this become another pandemic? Experts say there is no need to be concerned about another COVID-19 situation with HMPV. One major reason is that the disease has been circulating for decades and many adults have already been exposed, building up some immunity, something that wasn't the case with COVID. Experts also say there has been no evidence that HMPV has been mutating into a more serious illness, though it will require additional testing to confirm this is the case. What to do if you think you have HMPV? There are no treatments for HMPV, but there may be supportive care for severe cases, including oxygen therapy, IV infusions and corticosteroids. Recall issued for cold and flu medicine sold at some Costco locations In most cases, people can manage symptoms at home by drinking lots of fluids to stay hydrated and using over-the-counter medications. If you or your child experience symptoms lasting more than a few days, call your doctor. If you or your child is having trouble breathing, has blue lips or nails or has a fever above 103, go to the ER immediately.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/what-hmpv-chances-pandemic/	2025-01-06T10:29:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192249820.jpg?w=900

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces resignation	(NewsNation) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will resign as Liberal Party Leader and prime minister of Canada once the party selects a new leader. The prime minister also announced he had prorogued the current session of Parliament, which has been paralyzed, until March 24. He had served as the party's leader since 2013, having taken the reins when the Liberals were suffering difficulties in the House of Commons. Jan. 6: Security preparations in DC on anniversary of Capitol Riots The prime minister said he discussed his decision with his family last night. In a news conference, he said that it had become clear to him that he can't be the best option for Canada while fighting internal battles within the party. He also said a regret of his time in leadership was his failure to introduce electoral reform, specifically failing to allow Canadians to pick their second and third choices in elections, whe he said would reduce political division. Trudeau's resignation came ahead of a key national caucus meeting set to be held on Wednesday. His departure leaves the party without a permanent leader as polls show it is likely to lose badly to Conservatives in an election set for Late November.

Biden to visit New Orleans after deadly Bourbon Street attack	NEW ORLEANS (NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' After signing the Social Security Fairness Act, Biden was asked Sunday by journalists what his message would be to the families he would meet. He responded, 'I’ve been there. There’s nothing you can really say to somebody that’s just had such a tragic loss, my message is going to be personal if I get to get them alone.' First Lady Jill Biden will accompany the president, according to the White House. All victims have been ID'd Investigation continues into what authorities are calling a New Year’s Day 'act of terrorism' in New Orleans’ bustling Canal and Bourbon Streets in which a car drove into a crowd, killing 14 people and injuring at least 35 more. Officials said Thursday that all victims have been identified, and their families have been notified by New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. New Orleans attack suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack. FBI Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil said Sunday that Jabbar traveled to New Orleans in late October and in November. During his first trip, Jabar stayed at a rental home for at least two days beginning on Oct. 30, Myrthil said. The second trip took place on Nov. 10 but FBI officials 'are still piecing together details of that trip.'

Congress gears up for snowy certification of Trump's election win	Congress is gearing up for a snowy certification of President-elect Trump’s election win on Monday, as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) vows to plow ahead with the vote despite a snowstorm set to hit Washington, D.C. The House and Senate are scheduled to convene in a joint session at 1 p.m. on Monday to certify Trump’s victory, a process that is mandated by the Constitution and federal law. On Monday, however, the nation’s capital is bracing for as many as 10 inches of snow, a weather event that could make it difficult for lawmakers to arrive at the Capitol. Johnson, however, has said the operation will go on 'whether we’re in a blizzard or not,' citing federal law and Trump’s 'landslide' win. It comes exactly four years after a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Biden's election win. Also this week, the debate over the best strategy to carry out Trump’s legislative wish list is expected to heat up, after the president-elect endorsed moving one reconciliation bill rather than two — a stance that directly contrasts with that of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and others. And some of Trump’s cabinet nominees will likely visit the Capitol this week to meet with senators, including Tulsi Gabbard — Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence — who is slated to speak with Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. For Johnson, the road gets rougher from here Additionally, the late-President Jimmy Carter will lie in state in the Capitol, as Washington begins a days-long commemoration of the 39th president’s life. Congress to certify Trump’s election win amid snowstorm The certification of Trump’s election win is set to take center stage in Washington on Monday, as lawmakers trudge through the snow to participate in the process that is taking place exactly four years after a violent mob descended on the Capitol and interrupted the procedure. Despite the inclement weather — which some forecasts say can include up to 10 inches of snow — Congress is still expected to meet to certify the election. 'The House intends to certify President Trump’s election tomorrow as scheduled in accordance with federal law,' Johnson spokesperson Taylor Haulsee wrote in a statement on Sunday. The House and Senate adopted a concurrent resolution last week that set Jan. 6 as the day Congress would certify the election, in accordance with the Electoral Count Act, which lawmakers passed and Biden enacted in 2022 following the Capitol riot. Both chambers are scheduled to convene in a joint session at 1 p.m. on Monday, kicking off the quadrennial procedure. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the House chamber. Trump asks for military aircraft protection amid Iran threat: Reports Because that timeline is laid out in federal law, lawmakers would have to pass another law rescheduling the procedure if needed because of the snow. There is some precedent for such a move: In 2013, Congress voted to certify former President Obama’s election victory on Jan. 4 because Jan. 6 fell on a Sunday. Johnson, however, has indicated that he does not plan to change the date. The Speaker told 'Fox News Sunday' 'I hope we have full attendance,' noting that GOP leaders encouraged their colleagues to remain in Washington over the weekend because of the forecasts. 'President Trump had a mandate, a landslide, you know, so many electoral votes. And we get to count them all. And we cannot delay that certification,' Johnson said. Some lawmakers are vowing to attend no matter the conditions. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), for example, wrote on X: 'I’m here and will walk to the Capitol if I have to.' Monday’s certification is taking place in the shadow of the 2021 riot, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and interrupted the counting of Biden’s electoral victory. In light of the events of four years ago, Democrats have said they do not plan to stage election protests that they have in the past. Reconciliation debate to heat up in the Senate The debate over how to execute Trump’s sprawling legislative agenda is poised to heat up in the Senate this week after the president-elect said he prefers moving one large reconciliation package rather than two — a stance that directly contrasts with that of Thune and conservative House Republicans. Trump officially announced on Sunday night that he prefers a single reconciliation bill, writing on X: 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before.' The package will include border and energy policy and extend the 2017 tax cuts, Trump said. Trump’s statement came one day after Johnson told House Republicans at a retreat that the president-elect preferred the one-track strategy. That stance, however, is not landing well in some Senate GOP circles, where a two-bill approach is preferred. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Budget Committee, said Sunday on Fox News that he was 'very worried' about moving a single bill. 'I'm very worried that, if we don't put border first and get it done, it's going to be a nightmare for our national security,' Graham said, later adding: 'I will try to be a team player here, but I want to tell the American people, from my point of view, the number one job is to secure the nation for the federal government.' Attention will be focused on Thune this week to see how he reacts to Trump’s statement, which runs counter to his strategy. The majority leader laid out a reconciliation plan last month that included two bills: The first would tackle border security and defense, and the other would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which include a number of provisions set to expire at the end of 2025. Additionally, the House Freedom Caucus is likely to take issue with Trump’s comments. Last month, the conservative group wrote a letter to Johnson endorsing the two-bill strategy. Johnson, for his part, laid out an ambitious timeline to tackle the reconciliation package during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. He said the House will look to pass a budget resolution in early February, then move the entire package the first week of April. 'Everything’s got to move in the right sequence. And along the way, I think we're going to keep those trains moving in the right direction and on time,' Johnson said. 'And if that happens, we will get it out of the House in early April, maybe as soon as April 3, and then move it over to the Senate. That would put that bill on the president's desk for signature by the end of April. That would be fantastic.' Soda manufacturers push to keep sugary drinks on SNAP list Notably, the first week of April is also when Florida is holding two special elections to replace former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and outgoing Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), who is becoming Trump’s national security adviser on Jan. 20 — two likely GOP holds that will give the conference an extra vote in the House. One person who is likely to celebrate Trump's preferred strategy is Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who had been publicly pushing for one reconciliation bill rather than two. Administration nominees back on Capitol Hill — including Gabbard Trump’s cabinet and administration nominees are expected to be back on Capitol Hill to meet with senators this week, as the picks gear up for their confirmation hearings and eventual votes. That group includes Gabbard, Trump’s selection to be director of national intelligence, who is slated to meet one-on-one this week with Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Gabbard is seen as one of the more controversial nominees Trump has put forward, with questions being raised about her 2017 meeting with Bashar al-Assad, and comments she has made about the Russia-Ukraine war that echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talking points. Aside from meetings with nominees, the Senate is expected to adopt an organizing resolution this week, as the 119th Congress gets underway. Senators were sworn into office last week, and Thune officially began his tenure as majority leader. President Carter to lie in state The late-President Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the Capitol this week, as Washington honors the life and legacy of the 39th president. An arrival ceremony for Carter’s remains is scheduled for Tuesday at 2:45 p.m., followed by a Congressional tribute for the late-president, which Johnson, Thune and other members of leadership are slated to take part in. Then, beginning Tuesday, a viewing period will begin in the Capitol Rotunda for members of the public to pay their respects to Carter. The first viewing period is on Tuesday from 7 p.m. through midnight, then another beginning on Wednesday at 7 a.m. through Thursday at 7 a.m. Thursday morning, congressional leaders will attend a ceremonial departure for Carter’s remains. The late-president’s state funeral is scheduled for Thursday at Washington National Cathedral. Biden is expected to give a eulogy after he said Carter asked him to deliver one.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/congress-trump-certification-election-win/	2025-01-06T05:01:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/dome_capitol_060721gn3_w.jpg?w=900
This is just the beginning': Gov. Beshear urges Kentuckians to s...	Video note: Despite this article's time stamp, the above video is the latest forecast from The Weather Authority. FRANKFORT, Ky. (FOX 56) — Winter Storm Blair has brought what The Associated Press deemed the 'heaviest snowfall in a decade.' On Sunday evening, Gov. Andy Beshear issued an update regarding the storm's impact on the Commonwealth. First major winter storm of 2025 hits US, heavy snow moving east 'This next period of time where we're going to see ice across the Commonwealth is perhaps the most concerning,' Beshear said. Over 38,600 homes and businesses are without power as of 8 p.m., and this number is expected to rise as snow turns to ice across the bluegrass. 'This is just the beginning,' Beshear cautioned, noting that the most dangerous phase of the storm is still ahead. On Sunday, the governor's office stated Kentucky saw anywhere from six to eight inches of snow. Central Kentucky, including Louisville, Lexington, and Frankfort, faces the highest risk through Sunday evening, with ice accumulations potentially reaching dangerous levels, up to three-quarters of an inch. ‘Multiple traffic crashes’ close I-70 in Illinois Beshear emphasized that the storm is expected to persist through Monday night, piling a blanket of snow on top of a glaze of ice in central Kentucky that's expected to stick around due to an 'arctic blast' that's expected midweek. More than 2,300 state transportation workers and over 100 National Guard members have been deployed, with the Guard presence expected to grow up to 400 as the situation develops. 'Each one of those individuals has a family that they left to try to protect us,' Beshear said. 'So please stay home, let them clean the roads, and be really careful. Residents are advised to prepare for extended power outages, stock emergency supplies, and locate nearby warming centers if needed. 'Let's get through this latest thing Mother Nature's thrown at us, and let's get through it together,' Beshear signed off.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/mid-south/kentucky-snow-storm-weather-warning/	2025-01-05T19:08:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-05-200537.jpg?w=900

Man behind New Orleans attack visited the city twice before: FBI	The man behind the New Orleans attack visited the city at least twice in the months before the attack, FBI Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil said in an update on Sunday. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who was identified as the man shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack on Bourbon Street, traveled to New Orleans in late October and in November. New Orleans attack victims: What we know so far During his first trip, Jabar stayed at a rental home for at least two days beginning on Oct. 30, Myrthil said. While in New Orleans, Jabbar used Meta glasses to record video of the French Quarter as he rode on a bike through the neighborhood. The FBI showed video of Jabbar on the trip with his glasses and encouraged the public to contact them if they saw or interacted with him on that trip. 'Meta glasses appear to look like regular glasses, but they allow the user to record photos and videos hands free. They also allow the user to potentially live stream their video,' Myrthil said at the briefing, adding that Jabbar was wearing the glasses during the attack but did not live stream footage from that day. The second trip to New Orleans, Myrthil said, took place on Nov. 10 but FBI officials 'are still piecing together details of that trip.' Jabbar also traveled to Cairo, Egypt from June 22 to July 3 of 2023, and, a few days later, flew to Ontario, Canada on July 10, returning to the U.S. on July 13. 'Our agents are getting answers as to where he went, who he met with, and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here in New Orleans,' Myrthil said at the briefing. Officials still say Jabbar, a U.S. citizen from Houston, acted alone when he killed 14 people early on New Year’s Day. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States, but we are still looking into potential associates in the U.S. and outside our borders,' said FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia of the counterterrorism division. 'In any complex terrorism investigation, as we uncover new leads, receive tips from the public, examine electronic devices, and interview witnesses, the information as we know it evolves into a clearer picture and provides more answers,' he continued. 'We are much further along than we were just two days ago and continue to develop a more detailed picture of exactly who Jabbar was.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/new-orleans-attack-suspect/	2025-01-05T13:19:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/new-orleans_attack_01012024_GettyImages-2191517913.png?w=900
Kansas City Chiefs stuck on tarmac for hours after winter weather...	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (WDAF) — Hundreds of flights have been delayed or all out canceled this weekend as a massive winter storm snarled traffic across the country. Among those impacted were the Kansas City Chiefs, who were trying to leave Kansas City on Saturday ahead of their Week 18 matchup against the Denver Broncos. Severe winter weather was sweeping through Kansas City on Saturday, NewsNation affiliate WDAF reported. That, paired with a broken-down treatment truck, forced Kansas City International Airport to shut down its airfield. Officials cited 'rapid ice accumulation' in a statement shortly before 3 p.m. The shutdown also grounded the Chiefs' flight, which was prepared to take off for Denver, the WDAF sports team confirmed. The Chiefs originally planned to leave before the storm could affect their travel plans, however, the plane they were set to fly aboard was delayed in arriving at KCI. There were initially concerns the Chiefs-Broncos game, scheduled for a 3:25 p.m. CT kickoff on Sunday, would be rescheduled. However, shortly before 5 p.m. on Saturday, City Manager Brian Platt said KCI runways would 'reopen and resume normal operations in about 30 minutes.' The Chiefs were eventually able to take off and later landed in Denver at around 7 p.m. CT — nearly three and a half hours later than scheduled, according to FlightAware.com. The flight likely encountered heavy snow en route as well, as snowy conditions stretched across the central U.S. from both coasts. While the Chiefs have already clinched the top seed in the AFC, Sunday's game in Denver could have big playoff implications. The Cincinnati Bengals, who kept their playoff hopes alive with a 19-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday, need the Patrick Mahomes-less Chiefs to beat the Broncos and for the New York Jets to secure a win or tie against Miami Dolphins to grab the final playoff spot in the AFC. On the other side of the field, the Broncos will be playing for their first playoff spot since 2015.

Jan. 6: Security preparations in DC on anniversary of Capitol Rio...	(NewsNation) — Congress is expected to certify the election results on Monday, Jan. 6, officially granting Donald Trump a second non-consecutive term as president four years since the 2021 Capitol riots. The counting of ballots is now considered a national security event, and police are preparing for potential unrest on the fourth anniversary. The anticipated day comes after two other violent events occurred on New Year's Day. In New Orleans, a man, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, drove his car into a crowd of tourists on Bourbon Street on New Year’s Day, killing 14 and injuring dozens of others in what the FBI deemed a terrorist attack. Protective barriers were not in place on the streets. Also on New Year’s Day, Army veteran Matthew Livelsberger caused a Tesla Cybertruck to explode outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas as a 'wakeup call' to society. Seven people nearby were injured, and the suspect died. With the two attacks, protests during Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, the Capitol riots and Trump’s two assassination attempts in mind, the Secret Service and other security officials are on high alert. Judge denies Jan. 6 rioter’s bid to attend Trump inauguration NewsNation national security contributor Tracy Walder joined 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning to discuss the possible security preparations. 'One of the things that they will have is an extra police presence and sort of a heightened presence, which we have already seen in the nation's capital as a result of this,' said Walder, a former CIA officer and FBI special agent. Walder said she expects the perimeter will be farther back than in the past. Trump will hold a celebratory victory rally on the eve of his inauguration. The inauguration ceremony will be Jan. 20. Unlike in New Orleans where bollards were not in place, there will likely be ones in D.C. for the upcoming presidential events. Why bollards weren’t in place before New Orleans deadly attack 'I think you're going to have more than one security checkpoint. You may have a metal detector entering, then in the original perimeter, the farthest out one. And then you're going to have ones once people enter the arena as well,' Walder said. 'And I do think the bulletproof glass in this case, we have to remember there's been two assassination attempts against President Trump. I think that's a good idea here.' The FBI warned law enforcement last week of potential copycat attacks in an internal bulletin. 'I suspect that there will be copycats,' Walder said. The dead suspect in the New Orleans attack supported the terrorist organization ISIS, according to the FBI. 'The former director of the FBI has been talking a lot about these vehicle-type attacks that ISIS was engaging in, and ISIS told us that they were going to do it back in 2015,' Walder said. 'I think we just sort of forget that they really are encouraging individuals to do this because it's very cheap, it requires basically no training, and it doesn't require individuals who have to go overseas to take part in training.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/transition/january-6-capitol-riots-anniversary-security-preparations/	2025-01-05T10:08:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/677966b713d2e8.37640597.jpeg?w=900
Feeling sick? Here's what you might have	(NewsNation) — Mild sicknesses tend to spike during the winter months, but this season, public health experts are warning of a 'quad-demic.' The unofficial term 'quad-demic' encompasses four infectious diseases: influenza, COVID-19, RSV and norovirus coexist in high numbers. Add in whooping cough, walking pneumonia and bird flu, people are getting sick and may not know how to distinguish among overlapping symptoms. Here's what to know. Are mask mandates making a comeback? Flu Cases of influenza, or the flu, reached 40 million between 2023-2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Most people recover from the flu within days to a couple of weeks, but some cases can become severe. 28,000 people died last flu season. Symptoms include: Fever (some, not all) or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness) One cigarette can decrease life expectancy by 20 minutes: Data COVID-19 COVID-19 has become a part of life just as the flu did. Cases are nowhere near as high as they were when the virus was first introduced, but the U.S. is still seeing positive tests, hospitalizations and deaths. Between Oct. 1, 2024, and Dec. 14, 2024, the CDC estimates there were between 2.7 to nearly 5 million illnesses. Symptoms include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sore throat Congestion or runny nose New loss of taste or smell Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea COVID-19 and flu symptoms are similar, but they are caused by different viruses. 'You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same,' according to the CDC. Anyone experiencing symptoms should take a COVID-19 test, either at a testing site, doctor's office or over-the-counter sold at pharmacies. Testing mice revealed this about getting older: Study RSV RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs, usually peaking in December and January. The symptoms are similar to the common cold and other respiratory infections like the flu and COVID-19. Infants and older adults are most susceptible. RSV can cause other illnesses like bronchiolitis, which is inflammation of the lungs' small airways, and pneumonia. Symptoms include: Runny nose Congestion Decrease in appetite Coughing Sneezing Fever Wheezing The CDC warns that not all symptoms will appear at once and may come in stages. Infants may experience only irritability, decreased activity and breathing difficulties without the other symptoms. University of Michigan lab develops blood test to identify HPV-related cancers Norovirus The stomach bug is striking again. Norovirus is highly contagious spread through contact and causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines. The CDC reports about 19 to 21 million annual cases. People of all ages can get norovirus, but more severe infections occur in children younger than five years old, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. US surgeon general urges cancer warnings on alcohol labels Symptoms typically develop within 12-48 hours of exposure. They include: Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Fever Headache Body aches Dehydration Other illnesses to watch this winter Bird flu, walking pneumonia and whooping cough are also on doctors' radars. Bird flu: An outbreak of bird flu, or H51N avian influenza, popped up in poultry and dairy cows. The disease is common in wild birds worldwide, but it was recently diagnosed in humans. The CDC confirmed 66 reported cases in the U.S. since last April, detecting the first severe human case in Louisiana on Dec. 13. ‘Bird flu symptoms’: Online searches spike after first severe case in US Infected people may not experience any symptoms, but if they do, symptoms can include an eye infection on the mild side to pneumonia and death in more severe instances. No person-to-person spread has occurred, according to the CDC. Walking pneumonia: Atypical, or walking, pneumonia is a mild lung infection that can develop from bacteria, viruses or mold. Its name comes from the idea that people often don't know they have it and can carry on with daily activities despite the symptoms. People typically are not hospitalized, unlike with severe cases of pneumonia. The CDC reports about two million infections each year, with cases increasing in the later months of last year. Symptoms, similar to those in a bad common cold or the flu, include: Sore throat Fatigue Chest pain or discomfort Low-grade fever (less than 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) Mild chills Cough Sneezing Headache What is ‘walking pneumonia’? Whooping cough: Lastly, whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is especially concerning for children who are too young to have completed vaccinations. The highly contagious respiratory tract infection causes a severe hacking cough, following by a 'whoop' sound with an intake of breath, according to the Mayo Clinic. More than 10,000 cases are reported annually, according to the CDC. Symptoms, which begin about five to 10 days after exposure and occur in stages, include: Runny or stuffed-up nose Low-grade fever (less than 100.4°F) Mild occasional cough Vomiting during or after coughing fits Fatigue in between coughs Difficulty sleeping Struggle to breathe	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/infectious-diseases-winter-season-flu-rsv-covid/	2025-01-05T10:05:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1124732633-1-e1700596920935.jpg?w=800
First major winter storm of 2025 hits US, heavy snow moving east	(NewsNation) — Millions of Americans woke up Sunday morning to winter storm and blizzard warnings -- a system that forecasters are calling one of the strongest winter storms in more than a decade. The storms span from Colorado to Washington, D.C., and the worst of it is still to come across the Midwest and Mid-South before heading east toward Philadelphia and the I-95 corridor. Heavy snow from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic will bring 'damaging ice' and 'freezing rain' through late Monday night, according to the National Weather Service. Snow started falling in Utah Saturday, and then began moving east through the Rockies. Salt Lake City picked up more than a foot of snow in a matter of hours. The first few bands of winter weather caused travel disruptions from Denver through Kansas, creating a bit of a headache for the Kansas City Chiefs football team, whose plane got stuck on the tarmac Saturday for more than three hours due to icy conditions. What to know as snow, freezing rain and bitter cold heads through much of the US The Chiefs landed in Denver late Saturday night ahead of their game Sunday afternoon against the Denver Broncos. Crews were working in Kansas City to get the roads ready as people rushed to the stores to stock up on groceries, water and other essential items. As much as 20 inches of snow is forecast around the Kansas City metro area. 'Shelves are empty. These lines are long. Honestly, all we’re trying to do out here is be as nice to each other as possible because we’re all doing the same thing,' said Caitlynn O’Hara, an Instacart shopper. 'I'm telling you, when the milk truck showed up, we were doing everything in our power to get it stocked,' said Karla Quandt, store director of Hy-Vee Grocery Store in Shawnee, Kansas. 'The refrigerated truck with the eggs, we were literally pulling that and just stocking as fast as we can.' Should you set your thermostat to ’emergency heat’ when weather is very cold? Blizzard warnings are in effect for Kansas City and points west until 3 a.m. local time Monday, and winter storm warnings are in effect for parts of 15 states. The storm system stretches from the Kansas-Oklahoma border to the Atlantic and is only just ramping up. State officials as far east as Virginia are already urging residents to prepare for a long week. The winter storm will not directly impact any major airline hubs, so cities like Chicago, Minneapolis and Atlanta will they spared, although conditions at the smaller regional airports may create a trickle-down effect. Other areas are seeing flight cancellations, however. Across the Midwest, more than half of all flights into and out of Kansas City and St. Louis are canceled Sunday. Cincinnati, Ohio, is also seeing delays piling up. States of emergency are in effect in Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana as many kids are returning to school from winter break.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/major-winter-storm-blizzard-warnings/	2025-01-05T10:00:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6779d285a733d9.18901221.jpeg?w=900
Higher Social Security payments coming for millions of people fro...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs. Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis. The bill rescinds two provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset — that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government. The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit. Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security’s regular cost-of-living adjustments. The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner 'shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account' changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action. Edward Kelly, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said firefighters across the country are 'excited to see the change — we've righted a 40-year wrong.' Kelly said the policy was 'far more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.' The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change. 'Now firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,' Kelly said. Sherrod Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy. 'Over two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,' Saunders said in a statement. 'Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.' National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is 'a historic victory that will improve the lives of educators, first responders, postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.' And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation, others, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against it. 'We caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis,' Tillis told The Associated Press last month. Still, Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees. The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits. The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration, which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency, currently under a hiring freeze, has a staff of about 56,645 — the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program’s insolvency date by about half a year. ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-higher-social-security-payments-coming-for-millions-of-people-from-bill-that-biden-is-signing/	2025-01-05T09:54:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/677ac8a082ac39.21103709.jpeg?w=900
Johnson tells House GOP Trump wants one reconciliation package	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told House Republicans on Saturday that President-elect Trump wants to pass one reconciliation package, a strategy that runs counter to the two-bill effort several other GOP lawmakers had been pushing for. Johnson made the announcement during a private House GOP meeting at Fort McNair, five sources in the room told The Hill, as the conference gathered to discuss plans for moving legislation through the budget reconciliation process. The Republican trifecta — taking full control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in the 2024 election — is looking to use it to bypass Democratic opposition and pass many of its priorities. Johnson told lawmakers that the president-elect wants to pass 'one big beautiful bill,' according to two of the sources. Biden to award Medal of Freedom to 19 people, including Pelosi, Gore, Ledecky and Bloomberg Trump’s stance directly contrasts with the preference of many Republicans up on Capitol Hill, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), who laid out a plan last month that includes two reconciliation packages. The first would focus on border security and defense, and the other centered on extending the Trump-era tax cuts, which have some provisions that are set to expire at the end of 2025. Additionally, the conservative House Freedom Caucus endorsed the two-track plan in December, writing in a letter to Johnson that the House should move on one package focused on the border, and a second encompassing taxes and other matters. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, reiterated that position as recently as Saturday morning. 'There are a group of us who support breaking it up into two pieces,' Harris told Fox News in an interview. 'The first piece, a very small border piece where we give the president the money that he needs to secure our southern border and start deporting illegal, criminal aliens.' 'The president needs some funds now and that’s the quickest way to do it, and that’s the way, again, a group of us think we should do that,' he added later. 'Saving the large, big, beautiful bill till the summer because it will take time to iron out.' Judge denies Jan. 6 rioter’s bid to attend Trump inauguration Stephen Miller, Trump’s incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, has also endorsed the two-package approach. Trump’s position, however, does align with that of House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), who has been adamant that Congress should plan for one reconciliation package, not two, citing previous legislative undertakings and the razor-thin margin Republicans have in this Congress. 'There have not been two reconciliations that have been signed into law in the same year,' Smith said last month. 'And why would we think in a majority of 219 to 215 that we would over perform?'

WASHINGTON (AP) — In the East Room of the White House on a particularly frigid Saturday afternoon, President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aroused a standing ovation from the crowd as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the event by her husband former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor in a White House ceremony. 'For the final time as president I have the honor bestowing the Medal of Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honor, on a group of extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,' Biden said in his opening remarks. 'Let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done to help this country,' Biden said Saturday. Four medals were awarded posthumously. They went to George W. Romney, who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and urban development; former Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy; Ash Carter, a former secretary of defense; and Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Kennedy is father to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for health and human services secretary. Biden said, 'Bobby is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him dearly.' Romney is the father of former Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, one of Trump's strongest conservative critics. Biden has days left in the Presidential office and has spent the last few days issuing awards and medals to valiant military veterans, courageous law enforcement officials and exceptional Americans. The White House said the Medal of Freedom recipients have made 'exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.' Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American chef José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of the world's most recognized food relief organizations, and Bono, the front man for rock band U2 and a social justice activist. Soros' son Alex Soros accepted the medal on his father's behalf. In an emailed statement, Soros said: 'As an immigrant who found freedom and prosperity in America, I am deeply moved by this honor.' Sports and entertainment stars recognized include professional soccer player Lionel Messi, who did not attend the event; retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin 'Magic' Johnson; actor Michael J. Fox, who is an outspoken advocate for Parkinson’s disease research and development; and William Sanford Nye, known to generations of students as 'Bill Nye the Science Guy.' Other awardees include conservationist Jane Goodall; longtime Vogue Magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; American fashion designer Ralph Lauren; American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr.; entrepreneur and LGBTQ+ activist Tim Gill; and David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group global investment firm. Lauren is the first fashion designer to receive the honor. Last year, Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 19 people, including the late Medgar Evers, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor Michelle Yeoh. The Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded 654 times between 1963 and 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. Notable Medal of Freedom recipients from the past include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou and Mother Teresa. ___	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-hillary-clinton-george-soros-and-denzel-washington-will-receive-the-highest-us-civilian-honor/	2025-01-04T15:36:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6779c6d278c895.89390030.jpeg?w=900
Carville reflects on failed prediction that Harris would defeat T...	Democratic political strategist James Carville, who has been openly critical of the Harris campaign since Democrats' 2024 election losses, reflected on his failed prediction that Vice President Harris would win against President-elect Trump, calling it 'very depressing.' In an interview Saturday with CNN's Michael Smerconish, Carville was asked about a recent op-ed in The New York Times in which he blamed the economy for the vice president's defeat, leaning heavily on his famous catchphrase: 'It's the economy, stupid.' The news host read a comment from a reader in response to the essay, who argued that the U.S. doesn't seem to base its vote on the character, honesty or decency of the candidate. The veteran strategist concurred. 'I totally agree with that person. It’s very depressing,' Carville, who spent much of his career as an adviser to former President Clinton, responded in the interview, highlighted by Mediaite. 'But if you’re doing political strategy, you know, if you have an airplane crash, you’ve got to go back and find out what went wrong. You don’t say, well, let’s just forget about it and move on.' 'No, was the flap set in the right setting or, you know, was there something that the pilot didn’t pay attention to? I don’t know, but it is sort of depressing,' he continued. 'But, you know, Michael, there’s the simple, basic rule of politics is voters want an election about them. They don’t want an election about you or your opponent. And for too much, we lost that. I lost it myself.' Carville argued that Democrats gave Trump too much of the spotlight, leaving voter concerns and desires in the dark. 'We didn’t make it about voters. And that’s all. It’s never a good idea. And how could I, at 80 years old, been doing this for 50 years, lapse into that level of stupidity? You know, I’ve got to ask myself,' he said. 'But I think we did. And, you know, let’s learn from this. It’s a disaster,' Carville continued. 'I agree, it’s depressing, but to have an event like this and not learn from it, I think is the biggest mistake we can make.' In a recent interview with The Hill's 'Rising' show, Carville also slammed Democrats for bucking what he called 'NPR language' — referring to language previously deemed 'politically correct' — during the campaign cycle. These phrases, such as 'defund the police' and 'LatinX' were memorable. 'What you look for with politics revolves around things we call sticky, things that you remember, like ‘Defund the police,’ three stupidest words in the history of the English language,' he told guest host Niall Stanage. 'But it stuck.' The Louisiana Democrat has also been critical of the Harris campaign for its 'unfathomable spending' which has been under scrutiny since she conceded the race to Trump.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/james-carville-harris-trump-election/	2025-01-04T11:45:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/James-Carville-Kamala-Harris-01.04.png?w=900

Johnson faces tough road on Trump agenda after dramatic Speaker v...	Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) kept his gavel amid a threat from the right flank of the House GOP, but managing the House GOP is not going to get any easier from here. The dramatic Friday Speaker vote on the House floor – in which three Republicans nearly kept Johnson from the gavel before two of them reversed course to support him – showcased the challenges ahead as Johnson aims to usher President-elect Trump’s ambitious legislative agenda through a razor-thin House majority. Around a dozen Republicans had withheld support for Johnson ahead of the vote, demanding that Johnson make commitments on spending reductions and a more open process for crafting major legislation. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who had withheld support for Johnson up to the vote, referenced widespread frustration with how Johnson handled a December short-term spending bill while issuing a warning. 'If anything happens like happened before – right before Christmas, there will be consequences,' Roy told reporters after Johnson’s election. The point of a number of members initially withholding votes for Speaker, Roy said, 'was about making clear to the conference that there's a block of folks who are going to want to make sure that we actually deliver.' Johnson, for his part, did release a public statement shortly before the vote making commitments on working groups to implement government-reducing reforms. And after securing the gavel, he projected openness to scrutiny from members. 'It’s a very different situation than the last Congress was, and they can hold me accountable for that,' Johnson told reporters after the vote. 'We’re going to have a member-driven, bottom-up process for this really important legislation, and we must succeed. We have no margin for error.' Johnson’s top priority, now, will be crafting one or two bills jam-packed with Trump agenda items – such as extending Trump’s tax cuts and addressing border security – which they aim to pass through a party-line 'reconciliation' process that bypasses the threat of a Democratic filibuster. But getting the fractious House GOP behind the package could prove to be as tall of a task for Johnson as it was to secure the votes to be reelected Speaker. In the razor-thin House majority, opposition from just a member or two can sink any party-line measure. The House currently has 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats, with that margin set to get even slimmer when a number of House members join the Trump administration. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), in an interview with NBC’s Kristin Welkerfor 'Meet the Press' that was conducted as the House was choosing its Speaker, said that Johnson has 'a really, really tough job' with that margin. 'He's got a lot of folks that are headed in different directions,' Thune said. 'I mean, as you know, that with a narrow margin like that, any individual member of the House of Representatives can have a huge impact.' 'We will need to be as a Senate and with the White House working closely as a team, if we're going to get an agenda done that we want to accomplish for the American people,' Thune said. Plans for that massive bill of Trump priorities also got a new wrinkle last week of Trump’s surprise demands last month to raise the debt ceiling. To meet Trump’s request, House Republicans in December struck a handshake agreement to raise the debt ceiling in the reconciliation bill by $1.5 trillion while pairing it with $2.5 trillion spending cuts. But figuring out those cuts and meeting those steep spending demands will be very tough, as forecasted by Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) – one of the Republicans who voted for a candidate other than Johnson before switching to support him. 'When the reconciliation bills come up and people have to sacrifice, because every dollar spent up here has got an advocate, fight for it,' Norman said of what he expects from the Speaker. 'If the cut is defined as a reduction of the increase, that's not going to sit well for a lot of us, and we're not putting up with that,' Norman added. Rep. Keith Self (Texas), the other Republican who switched his vote from another candidate to Johnson, said that commitments from Johnson on who will be designing that massive bill helped win him over. 'We shored up the reconciliation team, because we know this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation package,' Self said. 'So, we shored up the negotiating team. That’s all we did.' Self declined to elaborate on who the negotiating team would be, but said that it would include members beyond the leadership, including members of the House Freedom Caucus. House Republicans are set to hold an all-day planning session for that Trump agenda bill on Saturday. Johnson’s struggles do not stop there. Eleven board members of the hard-line conservative group, including Roy, also sent a warning shot to Johnson in the form of a letter. The members said that while they voted for Johnson to be Speaker 'because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors,' they had 'sincere reservations regarding the Speaker’s track record.' The members made a number of requests in the letter, including that the reconciliation package should reduce spending and the deficit, that members must be allowed to offer amendments to legislation, and that leadership should abide by a 72-hour rule to give members time to read and debate proposed legislation. The number of members on that letter is notable given the new 9-member threshold on triggering a snap vote on ousting the Speaker, known as the 'motion to vacate.' If the 11 banded together, they could force Johnson out of the Speakership. Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), one of the 11 who signed that letter, said that the threat of ouster is an important accountability measure. 'You got to be careful. Nobody wants to have, you know, sword over their head, but we have a motion to vacate for a reason,' Ogles said of Johnson. 'He's been given a job. He's got to go do that job.'

TIME TO WAKE UP!' Tesla Cybertruck driver left messages before L...	LAS VEGAS (KLAS) -- 'This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake up call,' a note found on a phone inside the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded on New Year’s Day outside the Las Vegas International Trump Hotel said, according to police. At a news conference Friday, law enforcement officials gave additional details on the events that led up to Matthew Livelsberger, 37, driving a Tesla Cybertruck to the hotel and detonating explosive materials inside it. Livelsberger died from a gunshot wound to the head just before the explosion, the coroner's office ruled Thursday. LVMPD Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Livelsberger was positively identified by a number of things, including tattoo comparisons, showing a tiger arm tattoo on a photo of Livelsberger that matched one found on his body. Photos provided by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are shown comparing the tattoos of the person found at the scene of the explosion at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, and those of Matthew Livelsberger.Photos provided by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show the tattoos of the person found at the scene of the explosion at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.Photos provided by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are shown comparing the tattoos of the person found at the scene of the explosion at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, and those of Matthew Livelsberger. 'While the body was still in the vehicle, we were unable to identify those specific tattoos until we were able to remove some of it,' McMahill said. Additionally, the Department of Defense provided Livelsberger’s dental records to the LVMPD and the Clark County coroner’s office used those to positively identify him. Livelsberger’s family also provided DNA to the LVMPD which also positively matched him to the body. A surveillance photo showed Livelsberger in Colorado wearing a distinctive jacket, which police matched to a surveillance video in Las Vegas, law enforcement added. Matthew Livelsberger is shown is a screen capture from security camera video provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Video from public areas, call data records, financial records, and Tesla charging station records were used to determine the route Livelsberger took as well as determine that he was the only person in the Cybertruck. 'It’s evident that [Livelsberger] considered, planned, and thoughtfully prepared for this act alone,' FBI Special Agent Spencer Evans said. Evans added that despite the public nature of the incident, it 'ultimately appears to be a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily decorated combat veteran who was suffering with PTSD and other issues.' Livelsberger likely suffered from PTSD and police said they were aware of potential family issues or personal grievances that might have been contributing factors, Evans said. Law enforcement recovered two cell phones from the vehicle and the LVMPD was able to access the data in one of them. Police said as of Friday, there is still a lot of data to go through on the cell phones and an additional laptop recovered, as well as outstanding search warrants, subpoenas, and interviews around the world, but were able to share some of the information found on the phone. A note-taking application revealed a note titled 'surveillance log,' which contained 'a journal of activity' started around 10 days before the bombing, Asst. Sheriff Dori Koren, who oversees the LVMPD counter-terrorism unit, said. In the note, police were able to identify locations on the route Livelsberger took to Las Vegas as well as activity police saw on surveillance video, such as Livelsberger purchasing firearms and camping equipment. Screenshots provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show excerpts of documents found in Matthew Livelsberger devices.Screenshots provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show excerpts of documents found in Matthew Livelsberger devices.Screenshots provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department show excerpts of documents found in Matthew Livelsberger devices. In the app, police found two letters, which contained a variety of 'grievances and issues, some political, some personal,' Koren said. Police shared the following excerpt from the first letter: 'Fellow servicemembers, Veterans, and all Americans. TIME TO WAKE UP! We are being led by weak and feckless [sic] leadership who only serve to enrich themselves.' Evans said Livelsberger held no animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump. An excerpt from the second letter read: 'This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake up call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives? Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.' Late Friday afternoon, Las Vegas Metro police released the full letters found in the vehicle which are provided below. PO-003a-01-03-25-Livelsbergers-Letters-1Download Law enforcement added that they were 'very well aware of a podcast that is going around today and the contents of a letter in that podcast.' That podcast in question is 'The Shawn Ryan Show,' one hosted by a former Navy SEAL. The podcast released an interview Friday morning with a former intelligence analyst who said he received an email from Livelsberger in the days before the explosion. The analyst said Livelsberger’s letter was about Chinese drones. Special Agent Evans said they had not verified the validity of the email as of Friday.

(LVMPD) The guns found in the Cybertruck were purchased lawfully on Dec. 27 at a gun store in Colorado by Livelsberger, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper said. Livelsberger picked them up alone in the Cybertruck on Dec. 30. Tesla engineers helped Las Vegas police extract a chip from the truck and learned that the vehicle was not in self-driving mode at any time during the incident. There is no evidence that the bombing in Las Vegas and the terrorist attack in New Orleans are connected, Evans said. The only things connecting the two events are 'coincidental similarities,' he added. Those similarities include the vehicles being rented from the same company and both subjects served in the military. 'We’ve identified no telephonic or emails between the subjects,' Evans said. 'No information that they knew each other, that they were assigned in the same unit, that they were ever assigned at the same place at the same time.' He added that there was no connection between Livelsberger and 'any other terrorist organization.' Anyone with information was asked to contact the FBI at 800-CALL-FBI.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/time-to-wake-up-tesla-cybertruck-driver-left-messages-before-las-vegas-bombing/	2025-01-03T18:25:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/vlcsnap-2025-01-01-21h09m10s214_3557d4.png?w=900
Capitol Hill's newest faces ready for bipartisan collaboration	(NewsNation) — Dozens of new lawmakers were sworn in, and Mike Johnson retained his position as House speaker Friday as the 119th Congress convened. Freshman Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, told NewsNation it is a 'real honor to serve the people of Alaska here in Washington, D.C.,' just an hour before he was sworn in Friday, Begich defeated incumbent Democrat Mary Peltola with 48.5% of the vote. The businessman previously lost twice to Peltola in 2022. In the 2024 general election, President-elect Donald Trump endorsed him. 'I think we’ve got a lot of opportunity with a unified House and Senate and presidency,' Begich said. 'We’ve got the trifecta, we’ve got to use that to deliver on the America First Agenda.' The agenda, he said, consists of tightening border security, monitoring inflation and resolving world conflicts. New Year’s Day incidents fuel fears around inauguration security Begich said he spent his first day 'meeting and getting to know a lot of my Republican colleagues,' adding that he has the next two years to interact with Democratic lawmakers. 'At the end of the day, the American people want to see results, and that’s going to take working across the aisle when it makes sense,' Begich said. Across the aisle, the House's youngest female member, Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., entered Congress with both excitement and apprehension. 'It's been a long journey to get to this point, and after a grueling campaign and immense amount of hard work that went into this, I am really excited,' Ansari said. Ansari won her seat — formerly held by now-Senator Ruben Gallego — with 73.3% of the vote against Republican Jeff Zink. She acknowledged it's a challenging time 'to go into Congress, with a trifecta minority for Democrats. So, my team and I have been working really hard together to prepare on all fronts what we hope to get done legislatively.' Federal appeals court strikes down Biden net neutrality rules The daughter of immigrants, Ansari asserted that the United States' 'pro-immigration' stance is 'what makes us special, that’s what makes us unique, that is what helps our economy thrive.' Ansari will serve as the Democratic freshman class president and has already planned to meet with her Republican counterpart. 'I believe in bipartisanship. I think that if what Republicans have said is important to them — issues like the economy, I’m all in ... I’m ready to work with whoever, I want to make sure at least within my class we can create those bipartisan relationships,' Ansari said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/capitol-hills-newest-faces-collaboration/	2025-01-03T15:01:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2191716265.jpg?w=900
Why conspiracy theories exist over Las Vegas explosion	(NewsNation) — Within hours of a Tesla Cybertruck exploding in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, theories surrounding a former Green Beret's involvement in the blast began to surface on social media. Las Vegas-area investigators say Matthew Livelsberger placed firework mortars and camping fuel canisters in the back of the vehicle, which exploded within 17 seconds after he parked the truck, injuring seven people. The explosion and investigation produced similarities with the deadly attack in New Orleans, which killed 14 people and injured dozens more. At this time, the FBI says no evidence exists to link the two incidents despite Livelsberger and Shamsud-Din Jabbar both renting vehicles from the same company and both serving with the U.S. Army. Diddy’s ‘inner circle’ breaks silence in new documentary But unanswered questions in the Las Vegas case have left some delving into self-investigations about Livelsberger’s motivations. What conspiracy theorists are saying The Clark County, Nevada, coroner determined Livelsberger, 37, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound before the explosion took place. Investigators also said that the explosives found in the back of the Cybertruck, and not the vehicle itself, prompted the explosion. But investigators admitted Friday that they are still struggling to determine Livelsberger's motive. However, people behind X (formerly Twitter) accounts like @EndWokeness pointed to Livelsberger’s military experience as a Green Beret and military bomb expert and wondered online why he would have used 'amateur explosives.' 'Did someone put his corpse in the car? Remember, the car is fully self-driving,' one said. A photo of Matthew Alan Livelsberger is shown as Sheriff Kevin McMahill talks to the news media at Metropolitan Police Department headquarters in Las Vegas Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025, regarding the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded at the Trump International Hotel. (K.M. Cannon/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Elon Musk, who posted to his X account several times in the hours after the explosion, responded directly to the theory, debunking the notion that Livelsberger could have been killed elsewhere. Musk wrote that the Cybertruck’s autopilot function would not have worked as it requires a 'functioning person' in the driver’s seat. Other posters on X questioned why, if Livensberger's body was burned beyond recognition, his passport and military identification card survived the blast. And there are questions about why Livensberger would shoot himself just before he knew the explosion was going to take place. 'The entire narrative makes absolutely ZERO sense to me,' the X poster wrote on their account. Adam Housley, a former journalist and senior television news correspondent, said that based on Livensberger's experience as a Green Beret, investigators' explanation of this week's explosion, 'does not pass the smell test'. Others questioned in social media posts why a veteran with Special Forces experience would use a bulletproof and fireproof vehicle to carry out such a 'mission' and why Livelsberger would reportedly communicate with his ex-girlfriend about the vehicle he had rented.

(AP Photo/Ty ONeil) Some theorists have focused their speculation on politics, including Livelsberger choosing a hotel owned by Trump as the destination for the explosion. His family described him as a 'Rambo-type' who loved Trump. Livelsberger’s uncle, Dean Livelsberger, told The Independent that he believed initially that the Cybertruck’s battery short-circuited. But when he found out what had caused the explosion, Dean Livelsberger said his nephew would have been able to construct a 'more sophisticated explosive' than what was used. Former ‘Home Improvement’ star Zachery Ty Bryan jailed He said that Matthew Livelsberger could have created an explosive that would have destroyed half the hotel if he 'seriously wanted to hurt others.' He added: 'Think of Oklahoma City. (Timothy) McVeigh was just a normal soldier. Not a Tier 1 operator like Matt.' Why conspiracy theories exist Joseph Uscinsky, a University of Miami political science professor who specializes in conspiracy theories, told NewsNation his polling shows that, on average, between 10% and 35% of Americans are conspiracy-minded. Historically, the only event in which at least 50% of Americans believed a conspiracy was at play was the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, he says. But when events like this week’s take place and garner high doses of media coverage, people begin to consider different opinions. 'Some humans are inclined toward conspiracy theories. They just see the world through that lens,' Uscinsky said. 'So when they see the coverage (of an event) they think, 'Ah, this thing happened so it must be a conspiracy where other people will look at it and say. 'Oh, that was incompetence or accident’ or God did it, or angels or demons. Everyone has their own worldview, and that’s what leads them to reach certain conclusions.' Conspiracy theories are not limited to large-scale events. For those who constantly look at daily events and conclude that someone or something that they don’t like is conspiring against them, Uscinsky says an event’s notoriety does not matter. In most cases, conspiracy theories don’t have a great deal of detail or evidence to back them up, Uscinsky said. Current societal norms play a role. Although social media platforms like X and TikTok give voice to certain theories, they don't add to the population of those who believe, the Miami professor said. The shelf life of most conspiracies remains short-lived. The notable exception is the Kennedy assassination, which — 51 years after the fact — remains debated, with at least half of Americans believing Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. However, in cases like this week’s Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas and deadly attack in New Orleans, the tendency is that prevailing conspiracy theorists will move on when something else happens, Uscinsky said.

Motive remains elusive in Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion	LAS VEGAS (NewsNation) — The central question now is why would Matthew Livelsberger rent the Cybertruck in Denver on Dec. 28 and drive 1,000 miles to Las Vegas? It’s a mystery to those investigating the explosion outside of the Trump International Hotel — and those who knew him. Authorities tracked Livelsberger’s movements through Tesla charging stations in Albuquerque on New Year’s Eve and Kingman, Arizona, in the early morning hours of Jan. 1. With fuel canisters and large firework mortars in the back, the Cybertruck was parked for 17 seconds before it exploded, according to investigators. 'I’m comfortable calling it a suicide with the bombing that occurred immediately thereafter,' said Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill. 'I’m not giving it any other labels.' New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities Spencer Evans, a special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas Division, said they’re still investigating a motive. 'Obviously, we're always concerned in these sorts of events to ascertain what the motive is,' he said. 'We understand that's at the forefront of everyone's thoughts. So looking into exactly what the motivation is remains our No. 1 priority.' As federal authorities continue to investigate Livelsberger’s home in Colorado Springs, a neighbor tells NewsNation he seemed a typical family man. 'His wife … we just started working out together at the gym, not intentionally, but just coincidentally,' said neighbor Keni Mac. 'She just had a baby … a newborn. We didn’t see him as much as we saw her, but he is around. All I can say is that they're a very normal family, and so it's very strange to me that this would be the case.' Livelsberger’s LinkedIn profile shows a decorated Army veteran in the Special Forces who enlisted at 18 and spent nearly two decades in the career. Menendez brothers’ family meeting with new LA district attorney The New York Post reports that his wife had recently left him over accusations of infidelity. Livelsberger’s former girlfriend claims he sent her texts out of the blue. 'I rented a Cybertruck. I feel like Batman or Halo,' he texted one, according to The Denver Gazette. She said the texts from Livelsberger were playful and lighthearted. 'I just want everyone to know that Matt was the kindest man I ever knew.' Livelsberger’s former girlfriend said that his behavior changed after he returned from a tour in the Middle East and that he suffered from a traumatic brain injury five years ago.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/las-vegas-cybertruck-explosion-motive/	2025-01-03T12:50:28-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2191605454.jpg?w=900
Live updates: Memo detailing Johnson 'fails' circulating among Re...	A five-page, 26-point memo detailing 'fails' under Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) leadership is circulating among House Republicans as the first ballot draws near. A copy of the document obtained by The Hill reads: 'The House must be organized to deliver on the historic mandate granted to President Trump and Republicans. It currently is not – as demonstrated many times over the last year and, most recently, the week before Christmas.' Johnson has a narrow margin for error in Friday's Speakership vote. Assuming all members are present and voting for a candidate, Johnson can afford to lose only one GOP vote — and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) is widely seen as an immovable 'no.' Roughly a dozen other conservative Republicans are undecided. The election of the Speaker must be completed before the House can take any other actions, including swearing in its members, adopting a rules package and, eventually, certifying President-elect Trump's victory Monday. On the other side of the Capitol, senators anticipate far less drama but will also see new members sworn in on the first day of the new Congress. Follow along with live updates below.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/live-updates-gaetz-predicts-johnson-will-win-speakership/	2025-01-03T08:07:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/johnsonmike_122024gn13_w.jpg?w=900
Live: LA district attorney on meeting Menendez brothers' family	(NewsNation) — Family members of Erik and Lyle Menendez met with the new Los Angeles District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, to advocate for a 'fair and just resentencing' for the brothers on Friday. Hochman addressed the public Friday evening in a press conference. 'As we prepare to meet with DA Hochman, our family is hopeful for an open and fair discussion. Despite the abuse they endured as children and the unfairness of their current sentence, Erik and Lyle Menendez have spent the last three decades taking responsibility for their actions and contributing positively to their community through leadership and rehabilitation,' a statement from the family said. Over 20 members of the family are set to speak with Hochman, during which they will 'share their perspective on Erik and Lyle's immense personal growth over the last 35 years and the ways in which we plan to support them in their next chapters,' the statement said. 'We hope that this meeting will put us a step closer to spending next Christmas reunited as a family,' the statement said. Police identify Livelsberger as driver in Vegas Cybertruck explosion Menendez brothers resentencing hearing Jan. 30 The Menendez brothers were convicted in the murder of their parents and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 without possibility of parole. Their first trial ended in a mistrial. While the brothers' attorneys never denied they killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, they argued the pair acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father. A resentencing plea is set to be heard at a hearing on Jan. 30. Los Angeles prosecutors had recommended the resentencing, saying they demonstrated good behavior and rehabilitation in prison. Attorneys presented new evidence of the sexual abuse the brothers said they suffered, and filed a habeas corpus petition in May 2023 asking a judge to consider it. New evidence includes a letter Erik Menendez wrote in 1988 to his uncle about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of his father. In addition, Roy Rossello, a former member of the Latin pop group Menudo, said Jose Menendez drugged and raped him as a teen. Jose Menendez was chief operating officer at RCA Records, where Menudo was signed. New Orleans attack was ‘very traumatic’: Survivor Freedom for the brothers is now possible with a resentencing plea eligible to be heard at a hearing set for Jan. 30. Renewed public interest in the case came after a Netflix drama and documentary were released. Former Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón, who lost re-election to Hochman, asked the judge to give the Menendez brothers a new sentence of 50 years to life which could make them immediately eligible for parole.

Here’s what Congress’s first day will look like	The 119th Congress kicks off Friday as lawmakers return to Washington with a long January to-do list and a packed first day. Confirmation hearings for President-elect Trump’s Cabinet nominees are set to get rolling in the coming weeks, and Trump himself will be inaugurated in less than three weeks. But first, House Republicans have some business to attend to: picking a Speaker. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is in line to lead the House once again, but the path to get there is tricky as hard-line conservatives have thrown up roadblocks and he has almost no room for error. Here’s a quick look at what to expect on Congress’s first day of work in 2025. Electing a Speaker Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) talks briefly to reporters just before a vote on an interim spending bill to prevent a government shutdown after President-elect Trump abruptly rejected a bipartisan plan at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 19, 2024. The vote failed to pass. (Greg Nash) The first vote of the year in either chamber will take place in the House, and that will be to select a new Speaker. It is scheduled to take place at noon EST. Put simply, no business in the House can take place without selecting a Speaker. Members can’t be sworn in, and they can’t be paid. A rules package can’t be adopted, nor can committees be seated. This became all the more evident after the multiple battles surrounding the Speakership over the past two years. It took 15 ballots over five days for Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to win the gavel — a period during which no business was conducted. Similarly, the House came to a standstill for about three weeks after McCarthy was removed from the top spot, with the chamber unable to consider legislation, among other things, during that stretch until Republicans elected Johnson. At this point, it is unclear whether Johnson can get the requisite 218 votes needed to hold the gavel. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has insisted he will vote for someone other than Johnson, meaning the Speaker cannot lose any other votes from Republicans. There are expected to be 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats, with one vacancy. Trump has thrown his weight behind the Speaker and said that he will lobby conservatives individually 'if necessary.' Notably, it is in Trump’s interest to get the Speaker race over and done with. Why? Because come Monday, a joint session of Congress will convene to certify the results of the presidential election, and without a Speaker that cannot take place. Swearing in members, adopting a rules package Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) gives a speech following his election to Speaker in the House Chamber on Oct. 25, 2023. (Greg Nash) House members will be sworn in en masse on the House floor, but that can’t take place until after the Speaker is elected. All told, there will be 65 new members being sworn into office. After that, lawmakers will need to pass a package of rules that would govern the operations of the House. This would allow the formation of committees and for bills to be debated and considered on the floor, among other things. There are also some notable changes included in the 119th Congress’s rules package. The headliner is that the threshold to trigger a motion to vacate the Speaker is increased from a single member to nine members, giving Johnson more breathing room if he is able to secure the gavel. Additionally, there are a pair of name alterations for committees and language that would greenlight panels to create electronic voting rules. What’s the Senate schedule look like? Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) addresses reporters after the weekly policy luncheon, July 9, 2024. (Greg Nash) The Senate will also kick off the 119th Congress, though without much of the fanfare happening in the House. The upper chamber will officially adjourn the 118th Congress sine die in the morning, before quickly turning around at noon and opening the new Congress. Headlining the day is the swearing in of members. That will officially take place with Vice President Harris on the Senate floor and be done as a group. That will be followed by individual swearing-in ceremonies for members alongside their families inside the Old Senate Chamber. The vice president will also conduct those. The Senate could adopt an organizing resolution as early as Friday that will lay out committee allocations and establish other procedures for the chamber in the next two years. Unlike in the House, Senate leadership elections are handled away from the floor; those are all settled, with Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) set to take on the role of majority leader. The one change that will go into effect on the floor, however, is for Senate pro tempore, which is commonly held by the senior-most member of the majority party. That will happen via a simple resolution. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) will once again helm that role, having done so from 2019 until 2021. He has been in the Senate since 1981. When will confirmation hearings start for Trump’s Cabinet selections? Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump's nominee to be Defense secretary, is seen at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 5, 2024. (J. Scott Applewhite, Associated Press file) The bigger question on the Senate side is when Trump’s selections to fill out his Cabinet will appear at hearings as the chamber tries to tee up confirmation votes shortly after the president-elect takes the oath of office Jan. 20. Those are expected to start the week of Jan. 13, with hearings to be notified a week in advance. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice to lead the Pentagon, is expected to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee starting Jan. 14.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/heres-what-congresss-first-day-will-look-like/	2025-01-03T06:34:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/johnsonmike_102523gn38_w.jpg?w=900
House Speaker vote: Johnson faces key leadership test	For complete coverage of the Opening Day of Congress and the vote for House Speaker, tune into a Special Edition of The Hill tonight at 6p/5C. WASHINGTON D.C. (NewsNation) — House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., faces a pivotal moment Friday as he fights to retain his position amid growing backlash from conservatives unhappy with his leadership style. Despite Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Johnson’s chances for a second term rest on a razor's edge, with opposition from within his own party. The House Speaker vote Friday is expected to be a close contest. To remain Speaker, Johnson will need the support of every Republican to secure the position, as he can only afford one 'no' vote from his colleagues. New Orleans attack was an ‘act of terror’: FBI Johnson faces opposition within GOP Ahead of the vote, Johnson is expected to make more phone calls and possibly hold more meetings to try and ease concerns fellow Republicans may have about him keeping the gavel. NewsNation has learned around a dozen Republicans are demanding commitments from Johnson for things like spending cuts and more involvement in negotiations. President-elect Donald Trump endorsed Johnson on Monday, and Johnson expressed confidence about his chances ahead of the vote on Thursday. 'People are talking through process changes they want and those kinds of things and I'm open to that, and I think tomorrow's going to go well,' Johnson said. 'We need to stay unified so we can save the country. and I think that's an important message.' GOP holds slimmest House Majority since 1930 House Republicans have the slimmest majority in nearly a century, meaning Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote — assuming all Democrats vote against him and every House member casts a vote. Part of the uncertainty in Friday's vote comes as Rep. Tom Massie, R-Ky., has said he plans to vote against Johnson, criticizing him for approving Ukraine aid and his approach to negotiating government spending. Some of the key people to watch on Friday, include Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, who has described himself and several other Republicans as undecided, as well as Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz, who called on Johnson to present a plan for implementing Trump’s agenda. On Monday, Spartz released a list of requirements to earn her vote, including a push for spending audits. Lastly, Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, former Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry, and Congressman Andy Biggs remain undecided. Trump tests influence over GOP with Johnson Speakership vote 'It irritates us that these people undermine our leadership and the vast majority of us who want to get things done, but you got to optimize. You got to find consensus. If you had 220 people demanding your way on everything, you're going to get nothing done,' said Nebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon. The House will remain at a standstill until a Speaker is elected, and Republicans hope to avoid the turmoil surrounding former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who secured the post after 15 rounds of voting over four days in January 2023. The longer it takes to elect the Speaker, the more it could delay the certification of Trump's election win scheduled for next Monday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/mike-johnson-house-speaker-vote/	2025-01-03T04:42:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/johnsonmike_111224gn17_w.jpg?w=900
New Orleans deadly attack: A timeline of what is known	(NewsNation) — Bourbon Street is again open for business just a day after 14 people were killed and 35 injured in a deadly attack. On Thursday, just more than 36 hours after police said Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a rented truck onto a crowded Bourbon Street, city officials were given back control of the popular tourist destination ahead of the evening's Sugar Bowl as investigators continue to piece together information. As of Thursday morning, all of the victims have been identified and their families notified by New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said officials hope to provide a detailed timeline of what exactly took place in the deadly attack but said doing so this early into what remains an active investigation would be premature. Here’s what is known thus far. Shamsud-Din Jabbar travels to New Orleans The FBI said that Jabbar rented a Ford truck in Texas on December 30 and began the nearly 350-mile drive between Houston and New Orleans on New Year’s Eve. Turo, an online car rental platform, issued a statement Wednesday indicating there was nothing in Jabbar’s background that would show he was a threat. FBI officials said that while traveling between Texas and New Orleans, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook in which he pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, aka ISIS. In the first video, Jabbar said that he initially planned to harm his family and friends. However, he was concerned that the news headlines would not focus on the war between 'the believers and the disbelievers.' The FBI confirmed Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year's Day attack. The FBI said video footage showed Jabbar placing two coolers, each of which contained an improvised explosive device (IED), along Bourbon Street sometime between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. Investigators initially reported that they had reviewed video footage of two men and a woman placing devices on the street. However, the FBI said that those people were bystanders who stopped to look at the coolers before they walked away. Still, investigators are still hoping to speak with anyone who knew Jabbar and who may have spent time with him in the 24 hours leading up to the attack. Both of the devices located in the coolers were rendered safe, and reports of other devices that surfaced on Wednesday turned out to be misinformation, the FBI confirmed. The FBI said that the videos were posted to Facebook beginning at 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m. The Bourbon Street attack begins New Orleans police said officers responded to reports of a vehicle driving into a crowd on Bourbon Street at 3:17 a.m. Multiple people were struck before the vehicle crashed. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that the driver, who was later identified as Jabbar, got out of the truck and began firing at police. Two officers were struck by gunfire and were hospitalized. Jabbar was shot and killed by police. New Orleans Police said at a news conference Wednesday that Jabbar drove the rented truck up onto the sidewalk at Bourbon and Canal Streets, which were being blocked off by a police vehicle and officers. A bollard system, which had been installed in 2017 as part of a $40 million safety project, was being replaced at the time of the New Year’s Day attack. Who is Las Vegas explosion suspect Matthew Livelsberger? 'We had a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there,' Kirkpatrick said. 'And (Jabbar) got around it. She added: 'We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.' Airbnb residents forced to evacuate Residents at an Airbnb property located 1 1/2 miles from the scene of the attack were forced to evacuate around 8 a.m. on Wednesday after a fire broke out at the property. Witnesses told NewsNation that they had seen a white truck parked in the driveway of the property but that no one reported seeing Jabbar.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) The FBI said Thursday that the agency has secured that property and is conducting a search for potential evidence connected to the attack. FBI turns over control of Bourbon Street to New Orleans Cantrell said that the FBI returned control of Bourbon Street to the city late Wednesday night and that city crews began cleaning the street around 2 a.m. on Thursday. The cleaning process was completed by 8 a.m. to ensure that the street could be open as fans began to prepare for Thursday’s College Football Playoff quarterfinal game. 'I want to reassure the public that the city of New Orleans is not only ready for Game Day today, but we’re ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city because we are built to host at every single turn,' the mayor said. Bourbon Street was set to reopen to pedestrian traffic around 2 p.m. Thursday but was opened ahead of schedule as football fans and visitors alike returned. Louisiana Mayor Jeff Landry said that although the memory of the 14 victims will live on, it would be a tragedy for their memory to be 'snuffed out by fear.' 'The city will be back. We’ll be open for family, friends and loved ones who want some time to relax from the pressures of life,' Landry said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-attack-timeline/	2025-01-02T15:00:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001598416234.jpg?w=900
New Orleans attack, Las Vegas explosion share similarities	(NewsNation) — FBI investigators cannot definitively link the deadly attack that occurred early New Year’s Day in New Orleans with the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, but several similarities have been found between the two men involved, officials said Thursday. A NewsNation source identified the driver of the Tesla truck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel on Wednesday morning as Matthew Livelsberger, an active Army soldier from Colorado. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said at a news conference that they are still not 100% able to confirm the driver’s identity after his body was burnt beyond recognition in the explosion. Dog shot in face after months on run in Denver adopted into foster family But investigators said that tattoos found on the body matched those belonging to Livelsberger. A military identification card and passport belonging to Livelsberger were also found at the scene of the explosion, police said. Investigators believe that he was the only person to be inside the truck, which was rented in Colorado. The FBI, meanwhile, identified the driver of a rented Ford truck that killed 14 people and injured at least 35 others in Bourbon Street as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who also had a military background in the U.S. Army. Here is what is known about the similarities between Livelsberger and Jabbar. Liveslberger and Jabbar served in the United States Army The Department of Defense confirmed that Livelsberger was a Special Operations sergeant with the Green Berets and that he spent much of his time in the Army at Fort Carson in Colorado and in Germany. The Army told NewsNation that Livelsberger was assigned to the 10th Special Forces Group in Stuttgart, Germany. The spokesman also said that Livelsberger received several awards, including the Bronze Star Medal with Valor and other awards and commendations. A Tesla Cybertruck caught fire at the entrance of Trump Int'l Tower in Las Vegas on Jan. 1, 2025. (Credit: Alcides Antunes) Livelsberger enlisted as an 18X and served in active duty from January 2006 to March 2011, a spokesman said. He then joined the National Guard from March 2011 through July 2012. After that, Livelsberger was in the Army Reserve until December 2012, when he entered active duty as an Army Special Operations soldier. Las Vegas police said Thursday that Livelsberger served at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Afghanistan in 2009. Investigators said that like Livelsberger, Jabbar also served at Fort Bragg and in Afghanistan in 2009. However, it is not yet known whether the two men were part of the same unit or in the same region of Afghanistan during their deployment. Investigators said Thursday they are working to confirm specific details about the two men's military careers that could place them in the same unit at Fort Bragg. Jabbar was part of the regular Army from March 2007 to January 2015 as a human resource specialist (42A) and information technology specialist (25B) before transitioning to the Army Reserve as an IT specialist from January 2015 to July 2020, an Army spokesperson told NewsNation. The FBI confirmed Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year's Day attack. He deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010 and held the rank of staff sergeant at the time of his discharge, according to the spokesperson. Before serving in the Army, Jabbar enlisted in the Navy in August 2004 under a delayed entry program but was discharged a month later, a Navy official said. Like Livelsberger, Jabbar was the recipient of several Army medals and commendations, including the Global War on Terrorism Medal and two Army Good Conduct medals. Livelsberger and Jabbar rented vehicles from Turo Investigators have confirmed that both the Ford truck used in the New Orleans attack and the Cybertruck that exploded in front of the Las Vegas hotel were rented through Turo, an online car rental app. Las Vegas police said Thursday that Livelsberger picked up the truck in Denver on December 28. Investigators then used Tesla charging station data to track the vehicle’s movements. Police said that the truck was charged in Monument, Colorado, on Dec. 30 and then was charged in Colorado and New Mexico on New Year’s Eve. NYPD presence increased at Trump Tower, Times Square On New Year’s Day, the truck was charged at three locations in Arizona, including in Kingman at 5:33 a.m. before it was first spotted in Las Vegas at 7:29 a.m. The FBI confirmed Thursday that Jabbar picked up the rented truck in Texas on December 30 and then drove the vehicle from Houston to New Orleans on New Year's Eve. Investigators said that during the trip, Jabbar posted five videos to Facebook, pledging his allegiance to ISIS.

(Photo by Matthew HINTON / AFP) (Photo by MATTHEW HINTON/AFP via Getty Images) In a statement issued by Turo, the company said that they are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in Las Vegas and New Orleans and that the company’s prayers are with victims and their families. 'We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,' the statement said. The timing of the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion New Orleans police officers responded to Bourbon Street at 3:17 a.m. on New Year’s Day for a report of a vehicle that had driven onto Bourbon Street and struck pedestrians. The FBI said Jabbar’s final video to Facebook was posted at 3:02 a.m., which was just 15 minutes before police were called to Bourbon Street. Investigators determined that Jabbar drove the truck between Houston and New Orleans on Dec. 31, but they did not provide a definite timeline for his arrival into the city. The truck believed to be driven by Livelsberger was first spotted in Las Vegas at 7:29 a.m. Surveillance footage shows the truck pulling into the Trump hotel valet parking area before it left and traveled along Las Vegas Boulevard. It was then spotted parked at a business on the boulevard near Flamingo Road. At 8:39 a.m., the truck was spotted near the Sands Hotel and Casino before it returned to the Trump Hotel valet parking area, where the explosion took place within 17 seconds later, police said.

Who is Las Vegas explosion suspect Matthew Livelsberger?	(NewsNation) — Las Vegas police said the driver of a Cybertruck that exploded in front of a Trump hotel in the city has been preliminarily identified as Matthew Livelsberger. Investigators said they are waiting on DNA to provide 100% identification. How did authorities identify Matthew Livelsberger? Investigators said a military ID, passport and credit cards found in the vehicle belonged to Livelsberger and were used to identify him. New Orleans attack was an ‘act of terror:’ FBI They said there are also photos of Livelsberger driving the Cybertruck from Colorado to Las Vegas. Police also used remnants of tattoos visible on the burned body to make the preliminary identification. Who is Matthew Livelsberger? Livelsberger was a master sergeant in the Army, most recently serving in Stuttgart, Germany, with the 10th Special Forces Group. He was also deployed to Afghanistan in 2009. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives confirmed that all the components of the improvised bomb were made from items that can easily be purchased, including consumer fireworks, fuel enhancers and exploding targets. The two firearms found in the truck were also purchased legally, the ATF said. He has no criminal record, and no information about his background prior to joining the military or his personal life has been released. Matthew Livelsberger's military service Livelsberger enlisted as an 18X and served in active duty from January 2006 to March 2011, according to an Army spokesperson. He then joined the National Guard from March 2011 through July 2012. After that, Livelsberger was in the Army Reserve until December 2012, when he entered active duty as an Army Special Operations soldier. New Orleans attack was an ‘act of terror:’ FBI 'Livelsberger was assigned to the command and on approved leave at the time of his death. USASOC is in full cooperation with federal and state law enforcement agencies, but as a matter of policy, will not comment on ongoing investigations,' the spokesperson said. Livelsberger received a number of awards during his service, including multiple Bronze Stars, Army commendation and achievement medals and a Meritorious Service Medal. What do officials think motivated the attack? Investigators have said they have not ruled anything in or out when it comes to the motivation behind the explosion. Las Vegas police did deem the attack a suicide mission and said the driver had a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head that occurred immediately prior to the explosion. Is Matthew Livelsberger connected to New Orleans suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar? Both Livelsberger and the suspect in a New Orleans attack on New Year's Day, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, served in the Army. Two stabbings at two NYC subway stations occurred New Year’s Day Both men were stationed at Fort Bragg during their careers, and both were stationed in Afghanistan in 2009. At this time, authorities say there is no evidence the two men were in the same unit at Fort Bragg or that they were even there during the same years. Investigators have also not uncovered any information to indicate the two men were in the same unit or location in Afghanistan during their deployments.

President-elect Trump vows to rid America of 'violent scum'	(NewsNation) — President-elect Donald Trump is blaming President Joe Biden and other federal agencies for the nation's violent crime, including the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside a Nevada hotel, and has vowed to rid the country of 'violent scum'. Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that Biden, the Department of Justice and the FBI had devoted too much time focusing their attention on him rather than radical Islamic terrorism and other violent acts. The posts, which appeared on Trump’s Truth Social account after the deadly attack in New Orleans and the truck explosion, said that violent crime has become so bad in America that 'it will become hard to even imagine or believe.' The FBI said Thursday that Shamsud-Din Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account while driving from Houston to New Orleans, pledging his allegiance to the Islamic State. What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack On Wednesday night, Trump wrote Biden and his 'election-interfering thugs' have done to the country will not soon be forgotten. In the post, Trump accused the Department of Justice, FBI and Democratic state and local prosecutors of not doing their jobs. 'They are incompetent and corrupt, having spent all of their waking hours unlawfully attacking their political opponent, ME, rather than focusing on protecting Americans from the outside and inside violent SCUM that has infiltrated all aspects of our government, and our Nation itself,' Trump wrote. Biden did not respond to questions directed at him as he returned to the White House from the New Year holiday at Camp David on Thursday. Biden met with national security officials on Thursday to be briefed on the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion. The president was also briefed several times during New Year's Day on the incidents. Biden told reporters on Wednesday that his response to the New Orleans attack was 'one of anger and frustration.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-rid-america-violent-scum/	2025-01-02T11:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2188144000.jpg?w=900
NYPD presence increased at Trump Tower, Times Square	(The Hill) - New York City Mayor Eric Adams said there will be a heightened security presence in Times Square and at Trump Tower following the two deadly attacks in New Orleans and Las Vegas on New Year's Day. 'After the attacks in New Orleans and Las Vegas, @NYPDPC and I have been in constant communication,' Adams wrote in a Thursday post on the social media platform X. 'While there are no immediate threats to our city at this time, out of an abundance of caution, we have heightened security and have increased NYPD presence at relevant locations, including at Trump Tower and in Times Square.'

Sugar Bowl security to equal Super Bowl: New Orleans police	(The Hill) -- The New Orleans Police Department revealed Thursday that the annual Sugar Bowl will feature heightened security after a man drove directly into a crowd on Bourbon Street earlier this week, leaving 15 dead. 'We are going to have absolutely hundreds of officers and staff lining our streets,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said Thursday morning in an interview on NBC's 'TODAY.'

Police said the act was intentional. Gas canisters, camping fuel and firework mortars were found in the bed of the truck after the fire was extinguished, Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. However, police did not find any devices that would have been used to ignite the explosion, and are unsure at this time how it ignited.

Sources told NewsNation local affiliate 8 News Now that the cybertruck was rented in Colorado Springs through carsharing company Turo. 'We are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,' a Turo spokesperson said in a statement. 'We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.

Biden, Trump respond to deadly attack in New Orleans	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — As federal investigators investigate the deadly New Year's Day attack in New Orleans, President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump had starkly different reactions. At least 15 people were killed and dozens more injured after a vehicle drove into a crowd on Canal and Bourbon Streets early Wednesday morning in what the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism. The White House said Biden has held multiple briefings with federal law enforcement and U.S. Department of Homeland Security leaders. The Department of Justice also sent agents and other resources to New Orleans to help investigators. What is Turo? Car rental app used in New Orleans and Las Vegas Biden said there is 'no justification' for what he described as a 'despicable act.' 'I know while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of New Orleans will never be defeated. It will always shine forth. We've seen it time and time again throughout its history, and I know we'll see it again,' Biden said during an address from Camp David. Trump also weighed in on the violence, writing on Truth Social, 'Our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' Lawmakers want answers from DHS, FBI Meanwhile, some lawmakers are weighing in on the security failures that led to the incident, demanding more answers from federal authorities. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is asking the Senate Homeland Security Committee to call on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray to testify before they leave office. ‘90%’ sure New Orleans attacker was living in Airbnb: Neighbor In a letter sent Wednesday to the incoming chairman of the committee Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Hawley said the Mayorkas and Wray should give a 'full account of this attack' and report any department failures. Hawley added that Biden administration officials 'cannot shirk public accountability' as Biden’s term ends. Meanwhile, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., claims the New Orleans attack shows the need for the Senate to confirm Trump's national security team as soon as possible, adding that lives could depend on it.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-trump-respond-deadly-attack-new-orleans/	2025-01-02T06:38:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2191488826.jpg?w=900
Two stabbings at two NYC subway stations occurred New Year's Day	(NewsNation) — Two stabbings unfolded just minutes apart at two different subway stations in New York City on New Year's Day morning, leaving two hospitalized, police reported. Before 10 a.m. on New Year’s Day, the stabbings occurred on opposite sides of the city. The victims are in stable condition in the hospital. The attacks are part of a recent series of unrelated violent incidents occurring on or near subways. 10 people shot outside Queens night club on New Year’s Day: NYPD On New Year’s Eve, a man was pushed onto the tracks as a train was approaching, leaving him in critical condition. Days before Christmas, a man intentionally set a woman on fire while she slept on a train. The severity of these recent subway attacks has made riders, including tourists and residents, more fearful of the nation's largest transit system. But city officials are quick to point to data that shows the overall number of reported crimes on the subway system is the lowest year-to-date since 2010, exempting the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. There were 10 murders in 2024, which ties for a record 25-year high in 2022. The more violent attacks have typically occurred during peak hours and in nonviolent areas of the transit system.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/nyc-subway-stabbings-new-years-day/	2025-01-02T05:42:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/66291d431b0353.01473606.jpeg?w=900
What is an immersive explosive device (IED)?	(NewsNation) — Improvided explosive devices, or IEDs, were among the weapons found in the vehicle of the suspect in the attack that killed 15 people and injured 30 others in New Orleans on New Year's Day. IEDs are 'homemade bomb(s) and/or destructive devices to destroy, incapacitate, harass or distract,' according to the Department of Homeland Security. Examples include small pipe bombs which can be made to be more sophisticated in order to cause a lot of damage and loss of life. What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack Other attacks that used IEDs include the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Olympic Park bombing in 1996 and the London bombings in 2005. Police suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar as the person responsible for what the FBI has deemed a 'terrorist attack' after allegedly driving his vehicle into a crowd on the tourist-heavy Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning. Law enforcement is still searching the area for improvised explosive devices, according to the FBI. Other potential IEDs were also located in the French Quarter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/what-immersive-explosive-devices-ied/	2025-01-02T04:39:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2178157082.jpg?w=900
What we know about the Cybertruck explosion at Las Vegas Trump Ho...	LAS VEGAS (NewsNation) — Firework mortars and camp fuel canisters were found in the back of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Las Vegas Trump International Hotel Wednesday, killing one person, injuring seven others, and sparking an intense investigation into possible terrorism. The act was intentional, police said, adding that video shows the vehicle parked next to the hotel’s front doors as it explodes into flames. Police did not find any devices that would have been used to ignite the explosion in the truck and are unsure at this time how it ignited, authorities said. Cybertruck arrived in Vegas one hour before blast Clark County firefighters and Las Vegas Metropolitan police responded to the explosion and fire around 8:40 a.m. in the 2000 block of Fashion Show Drive, across from Fashion Show Mall and just west of the Las Vegas Strip. FBI investigating New Orleans attack as ‘act of terrorism’ Police tracked the truck through cameras at Tesla charging stations and found that it arrived in Las Vegas around 7:30 a.m. The truck then drove up and down Las Vegas Boulevard for about an hour before pulling into the Trump Hotel entrance. The truck sat in front of the hotel for about 15-20 seconds before it exploded, McMahill said. The blast went upwards, so the hotel's glass doors did not break. Have any suspects been identified? The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone. Both the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded in Las Vegas and the pickup truck used in New Orleans were rented from Turo, authorities said. Police have identified the person who rented the cybertruck but have not yet released the name. Social posts including a person’s name were incorrect, a source told NewsNation affiliate KLAS. 'We believe this is an isolated incident. We do not believe that there is a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this. We don't believe there's any other danger to the community right now. Over the next few hours and days, we will continue to do our best to research as much as we can and get to the bottom of this. and we won't stop until we're 100% certain as to what happened and why,' said FBI Acting Special Agent-In-Charge Jeremy Schwartz. In a statement, Turo said it was working with authorities. 'We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,' the statement said. Musk: Explosion was caused by fireworks or bomb Tesla founder Elon Musk, who is working with the FBI, said Wednesday afternoon on X that 'we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.' In an earlier post on the platform, Musk said that his entire senior term was investigating the explosion, adding, 'We’ve never seen anything like this.' Musk suggested that the explosion might also be an act of terrorism, noting that the truck involved was rented through the same app used in the New Orleans attack. However, the FBI has not confirmed this theory. What is Turo? The cars in both the Las Vegas explosion and the attack in New Orleans were rented on the app Turo, authorities say. Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace, often described as the Airbnb for cars. It allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles by listing them on the platform, where they can set rental prices, availability, and specific guidelines. Renters can browse local options, choose a vehicle that suits their needs, and complete the transaction securely through Turo’s system.

90%' sure New Orleans attacker was living in Airbnb: Neighbor	(NewsNation) — A neighbor says he is '90% sure' he encountered the suspect in the New Year's Day Bourbon Street attack at a New Orleans Airbnb that is now an FBI crime scene, just 1.5 miles from where the incident occurred. Wylie Whitesides, who lives two doors down from the rental property in the St. Roch neighborhood, claimed he noticed a suspicious man who matched the description of Shamsud-Din Jabbar days before the attack. Sources told NewsNation investigators believe the Airbnb was rented by the suspect in the Bourbon Street attack and despite heavy law enforcement presence, authorities have not confirmed this detail. 'He was a little bit taller than me, not a big guy, goatee beard, African American or Islamic,' Whitesides said of the man before seeing the suspect's photo. He said the encounter left him with a 'sketchy feeling.' What we know about the suspect in the New Orleans attack A white pickup truck, potentially connected to the suspect, was parked in front of Whitesides' home in recent nights he said. Another neighbor reported seeing someone repeatedly moving garbage cans up and down the street over several days. Early Wednesday morning, a fire broke out at the Airbnb, prompting the evacuation of dozens of residents around 8 a.m. The scene drew a massive law enforcement presence, including FBI special agents, Homeland Security investigators, ATF agents and New Orleans police and fire departments. Approximately 40 law enforcement officials were at the scene throughout the day, according to witnesses. While residents were initially evacuated, authorities began allowing them to return home around 8 p.m. CT, though the Airbnb remains cordoned off as an active FBI crime scene. Officials searching for more IEDs after deadly New Orleans attack The New Orleans Fire Department announced plans for a news conference Thursday morning to provide additional details about the investigation. Whitesides has spoken to the FBI and shared the same information.

New Orleans attack victims: What we know so far	(NewsNation) — Investigation continues into an overnight 'act of terrorism' in New Orleans' bustling Canal and Bourbon streets after a car drove into a crowd, killing 15 people and injuring at least 35 more. The FBI said it would issue a statement about the victims once all families have been notified. New Orleans attack suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, has been identified as the man who was shot and killed by police after the deadly New Year’s Day attack. In a Wednesday news conference, agency officials said they do not believe Jabbar acted alone. The Associated Press reported that investigators have reviewed video of three men and a woman placing possible explosives in the area where Wednesday’s attack took place. New Orleans attack: Suspect identified, Sugar Bowl postponed New Orleans attack victims Tiger Bech Tiger Bech, 28, died in a hospital following the attack, NewsNation local affiliate KLFY confirmed.

Excellent father, very supportive brother, supportive son, life of the party, great sense of humor, the one that made everybody laugh,' Jackson said. She tells NewsNation it's 'unfair and unjust' for Hunter's life to be taken so early. 'We had heard that he was shot. That's, that's what we were going on. So I'm praying that, you know, maybe they're doing surgery ... that's when the doctors informed us that he succumbed to his internal injuries and that he was deceased.' Hunter died from injuries sustained when he was run over, not by gunshot wounds, Jackson said. At the hospital, she witnessed multiple families receiving similar news about their loved ones who were killed or injured in the attack.

Why bollards weren't in place before New Orleans deadly attack	(NewsNation) — New Orleans law enforcement officials said bollards typically used to prevent traffic on Bourbon Street were not operable when a 42-year-old Texas man entered the popular tourist destination at a high rate of speed early Wednesday, killing 15 people and injuring 35 more. The man, who was identified as Shamsud Din Jabbar, drove a rented Ford truck onto Bourbon Street just after 3 a.m. in what the FBI is characterizing as an act of terrorism. 1 dead, 7 injured in Tesla fire, explosion at Las Vegas Trump International Hotel on New Year’s Day Police officials are now facing questions about why bollards that have been used to close off the street from traffic were not in place on New Year’s Eve and into early Wednesday when the attack took place. What is a bollard? Bollards are short, vertical posts that are used to serve as physical and visual barriers and are typically constructed of stainless steel, aluminum or concrete. According to the New Orleans Department of Public Works, the existing bollards along Bourbon Street were being removed and replaced as part of a project that began in November. Work was scheduled to continue into February and included replacing the current bollards with new removable bollards made of stainless steel. According to Fox 8 in New Orleans, the installation of the bollards in 2017 was part of a $40 million safety plan. The system consisted of four sets of barriers placed on either side of Bourbon Street intersections. The station said that the inner two columns can be pushed back when it is unlocked by a ground-level control panel. The new bollard system would have allowed the devices to be locked behind each crosswalk, the city said. During the recent construction project, the old bollards were removed and replaced by asphalt patches that allowed vehicle access. Bollards were not in place at time of deadly attack Witnesses told NewsNation on Wednesday that barricades were not in place at the time of the attack. At a news conference on Wednesday, New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that Jabbar drove the truck up onto the sidewalk, which gave him access to Bourbon Street. The bollard replacement project began less than eight years after they were installed. Shortly after being installed, the bollards began to malfunction, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. The city said that the bollard replacement project began in preparation for the city hosting the Super Bowl in early February. Bollards were not in place Wednesday because the project was nearing completion, Cantrell said. Kirkpatrick said that police officials have been aware of issues with the bollard system for some time. She said that because the bollards were not operable, police vehicles were parked at Bourbon Street to prevent traffic from getting through on New Year's Eve. Human remains found near Electric Forest music festival site However, she said Jabbar drove around the vehicles and onto the sidewalk to carry out the attack. 'We had a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there,' Kirkpatrick said. 'And (Jabbar) got around it. She added: 'We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it.' Kirkpatrick said that if bollards had been in place, they would have prevented ambulances and first responders from reaching victims killed or injured during the attack. However, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno said that the absence of the bollards was not the reason the attack took place. 'This person was determined to inflict pain and death and harm on Bourbon Street, and I think he would have done that anyway he could,' Moreno said, according to MetroWest Daily News.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/bollards-new-orleans-attack/	2025-01-01T14:34:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001469314526.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — Members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua are reportedly attacking border agents with knives and tire irons. The New York Post reported that border officials are preparing for a potential gang attack on Wednesday. Alfonso Aguilar, the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship, believes the gang is taking advantage of the time remaining before President-elect Trump assumes office on Jan. 20. 'We’re seeing criminal organizations, members of Tre de Aragua, trying to get to the southern border and doing everything they can to enter the country because they know as soon as the Trump administration starts, it's going to be almost impossible to enter the country and be released into the community as it has happened during these past four years,' he said.

New Orleans attack suspect may not have acted alone: Ex-FBI agent	(NewsNation) — As police continue to piece together clues into what the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism in New Orleans, the suspect who was shot and killed by police may not have acted alone, a former FBI special agent told NewsNation. Stuart Kaplan said investigators won’t need long to identify the suspect who drove into a crowd on Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning, killing 10 and injuring 35. Given investigative tools available to police, suspects can't go unidentified for very long and Kaplan believes the suspect may have already been identified by law enforcement. Investigative technology may provide leads into where the man may have come from before carrying out Wednesday's attack. FBI: Homemade explosives seizure at Virginia farm largest in its history 'I would suggest this may be a byproduct of our unfortunate open border policies,' Kaplan told NewsNation, adding, 'Unfortunately this is the catastrophic result of an individual who was able to now create panic and fear.' Kaplan's sources suggest that the man may have entered the country illegally in the last week, and FBI investigators are working quickly to identify other 'potential bad actors' that may have been involved in the attack. Kaplan, citing sources, said government surveillance would have been able to place the suspect in Wednesday’s attack with other individuals who may have been involved. The sources indicate that the attack may be part of a bigger, more coordinated plot toward other venues and that 'other attacks may be coming our way.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/new-orleans-suspect-may-not-acted-alone/	2025-01-01T08:24:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25001471685675.jpg?w=900

FBI: Homemade explosives seizure at Virginia farm largest in its ...	SMITHFIELD, Va. (WAVY) — Virginia residents in Isle of Wight County worried about the large FBI presence and numerous explosions heard off of Foursquare Road in mid-December finally have answers. According to federal court documents, agents had just uncovered a massive trove of pipe bombs, and deemed them too unstable to transport — so they blew them up. The FBI said it believes it's the largest amount of homemade explosives it has encountered in its history. Brad Spafford, 36, was taken into custody at his Isle of Wight County home on Dec. 17 and charged with a weapons violation. The FBI executed a search warrant and uncovered the 'improvised explosive devices,' along with bomb-making instructions and materials and a jar full of a homemade high-explosive stored in the family freezer.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'FBI bomb technicians, who X-rayed the devices on scene, assessed them as pipe bombs,' the newly filed document reads. 'The majority were found in a detached garage, organized by color. ... Some were hand-labeled 'lethal.' 'Some were preloaded into an apparent wearable vest,' it continued. 'In the garage were also found numerous tools and materials for manufacturing explosives, a home-made mortar, and riot gear.' The filing also describes how the the pipe bombs were made — with two layers of plastic tubes. '[I]n between the tubes were metal spheres which 'would enhance the fragmentation effect of the device upon its explosion.' it quotes an FBI analysis of one bomb. 'The lab concluded that the device was 'capable of causing property damage, personal injury and/or death.'' Spafford was released on $25,000 bond earlier this week. The new details in this case come from new filings from the defense, arguing to block his release. Spafford's attorney argued that he never posed a threat to anyone. A motion by the defense describes him as 'a hard-working family man with no criminal record.' '[T'he government has been investigating and carefully watching Mr. Spafford for approximately two years through the use of a confidential human source who was a friend and confidant,' it reads. 'During all of that time, there is no evidence or allegation that Mr. Spafford committed or attempted to commit any act of violence.' Spafford's original, and so far only charge, is for violating the National Firearms Act — for possessing a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16 inches. His Dec. 30 preliminary hearing found enough evidence to allow the case to move forward. The prosecution's filing worried about Spafford's ability to access weapons and the danger he might pose even to the officers who have to check up on him before trial. They acknowledged that new charges for the bombs — each one carrying 10 years — were almost certainly impending. Lawsuits, FBI probe engulf South Dakota doomsday bunker complex 'The defendant has the undisputed know-how, resources, and extreme inclination to manufacture and stockpile improvised explosive devices,' it reads. 'Even after losing his own fingers as a result of his homemade explosive materials, he made the apparent remarkable decision to keep an extraordinarily danger explosive material in the home's freezer next to food items that could be accessed by the entire family.' Most of the evidence prosecutors relied on for the firearms charge came from a person Spafford apparently believed he was friends with. He showed the man his illegal rifle and the two went shooting together. '[The source] also noted that the defendant was using pictures of the president for target practice at shooting at a local range, stated that he believed political assassinations should be brought back, and that missing children in the news had been taken by the federal government to be trained as school shooter,' the prosecution's filing reads. Spafford also allegedly joked about someone assassinating then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The document describes a casual meeting at his newly-purchased farm. 'He also discussed fortifying the property with a 360-degree turret for a 50-caliber firearm on the roof, and noted how he could block the driveway with a vehicle so no other vehicles could access,' it reads.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/fbi-homemade-explosives-isle-of-wight-county/	2025-01-01T02:59:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-545129710-1.jpg?w=900
Israeli strikes kill 12 in Gaza as war grinds into the new year	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said Wednesday, as the nearly 15-month war ground on into the new year with no end in sight. One strike hit a home in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory, where Israel has been waging a major operation since early October. Gaza’s Health Ministry said seven people were killed, including a woman and four children, and at least a dozen other people were wounded. Another strike overnight in the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed a woman and a child, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The military ordered people to evacuate an area near Bureij overnight, saying it would strike there in response to recent rocket fire by Palestinian militants. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know A third strike early Wednesday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital and the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting around 250. About 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not say how many of those killed were militants. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are living in tents on the coast as winter brings frequent rainstorms and temperatures drop below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night. At least six infants and another person have died of hypothermia, according to the Health Ministry. American and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over the militants. Military blames ‘weakening of discipline’ in death of archaeologist who entered Lebanon with troops In a separate development, the Israeli military blamed 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' in the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist who was killed in southern Lebanon along with another soldier while visiting a combat zone in November. According to Israeli media reports, Zeev Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a 'fallen soldier' when it announced his death. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Media reports at the time of his death said he entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier who was killed with him has expressed anger over the circumstances of his death. The military launched an investigation after they were killed in a Hezbollah ambush. A separate probe is looking into who allowed Erlich to enter. The military said the entry of civilians who are not military contractors or journalists into combat zones is not widespread. Still, there have been multiple reports of Israeli civilians who support a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon entering those areas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Biden doesn't believe he should have dropped out of race: Source	NewsNation) — President Joe Biden has told aides he believes he should not have ended his presidential campaign and that he could have defeated Donald Trump, a source has confirmed to NewsNation. Biden, who will leave the White House after Trump’s inauguration on January 20, said in the conversations that he believes he could have won the November election despite low approval rankings, sources confirmed. He also said he should have remained in the race despite the debate performance that many believe led to Biden dropping out of the race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris was defeated by Trump, who won both the Electoral College and popular vote en route to his capturing a second term in the White House. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know After the election loss, Harris vowed for a peaceful transfer of power during her concession speech. The Washington Post was the first to report the conversation between Biden and his aides. A NewsNation source with knowledge of the conversations between Biden and the aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that other associates believe Biden should have never dropped out of the race. Biden has not criticized Harris in the conversations, the source said. Biden said that Americans needed to keep the faith after Trump's victory and commended Harris for a 'whole heart effort.' 'The struggle for the soul of America, since our very founding, has always been an ongoing debate, and still vital today,' Biden said. 'I know for some people, it’s a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it’s a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-doesnt-believe-dropped-race/	2024-12-31T11:03:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2170948834.jpg?w=900
Drone discovers 'narco tunnel' between Arizona, Mexico	NewsNation) — Mexican law enforcement officials have discovered what they believe is a tunnel designed to smuggle drugs or people between the United States and Mexico after a drone detected the passageway. Photos of the tunnel were posted on a Facebook account operated by the State Public Secretary of Security in Sonora, Mexico. Investigators believe that the discovery will disrupt the construction of the tunnel. The agency said that the entrance of the tunnel was found in San Luis, Rio Colorado, in Mexico, which is located south of Yuma, Arizona. The tunnel stretched across the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a report by Arizona’s Family. The report indicated that a drone that was being used during a joint operation between Mexican authorities and U.S. Customs of Border Protection and discovered the tunnel's entrance just south of the border wall. ‘Common sense’ law requires congressional scrutiny, oversight of border security contracts Mexican police believe that the tunnel was in the early stages of construction. However, if completed, authorities believe the passageway would have been used as a 'narco tunnel' to smuggle drugs or people under the border wall and into the United States. 'Implementing the Border Security Protocol and using technology critical points were identified to strengthen surveillance in the area,' the Facebook post said. The police agency said that the tunnel was the third of its kind found near Yuma this year. The report said the Yuma Border Patrol did not have information about this specific tunnel. However, the agency reported it works with the Mexican police to combat border crimes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/drone-narco-tunnel-arizona-mexico/	2024-12-31T10:47:50-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/08/64e0c45ad05201.50438490.jpeg?w=900
Lawsuits, FBI probe engulf South Dakota doomsday bunker complex	(NewsNation) — An investigation into resident unrest at a South Dakota residential bunker complex, marketed to doomsday preppers, has uncovered multiple problems. South Dakota News Watch found the Vivox xPoint bunker complex, located eight miles south of Edgemont, is at the center of lawsuits, complaints to the state attorney general, a near-fatal shooting, and an FBI inquiry. Developed in 2016 on a former Black Hill Army Deport munitions storage facility, the complex features 500 above-ground concrete bunkers. While owner Robert K. Vicino claims more than 200 of the bunkers are leased and the community is thriving, many residents who sought to make it their permanent home disagree. At least 16 lawsuits underway Over the past four months, South Dakota News Watch uncovered 16 lawsuits involving Vivos xPoint, with actions filed both by and against residents, Vivos management, and its subcontractors. Five complaints have also been lodged with the South Dakota Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division, and two former residents confirmed FBI interviews. South Dakota doomsday city built at former Army base The lawsuits include eviction disputes, demands for refunds, and claims Vivos failed to deliver promised amenities, security, and services. Vivos owner Robert Vicino blamed 'bad apples' for the disputes, stating legal actions arise only if residents violate the 99-year lease or community rules. Residents pay up to $55,000 upfront, $3,000 for water, and ongoing fees, but they do not own their bunkers. Leases include non-disclosure clauses prohibiting media contact under penalty of fines or eviction. Attorney J. Scott James noted that evicted residents risk losing their investment, and any improvements made, with Vivos able to re-lease the bunkers. Residents interviewed by FBI The FBI's San Diego office has interviewed at least two former residents of the bunker complex, according to the South Dakota News Watch. One former resident, Elliott, told the outlet that FBI agents questioned him in November about Vicino 'dealing with problems in an illegal way.' Another ex-resident, David Streeter, told the outlet he was interviewed twice regarding leases, finances, and other allegations against Vicino. Streeter, who shot a Vivos subcontractor in August but wasn't charged, is involved in lawsuits against Vivos over evictions and defamation while also facing eviction himself. The FBI declined to respond to South Dakota News Watch's request for comment regarding the investigation or confirm if active investigations were underway. Vicino said he was unaware of any inquiry but welcomed it. Other issues residents are unhappy with At least three current and former Vivos residents told South Dakota News Watch they are concerned about two on-site subcontractors with criminal records Amenities promised by Vivos — prominently advertised on signs and its website — remain incomplete years after the complex opened. Residents report paying upfront for bunker leases or improvements that can take years to finish, if ever, while still being charged monthly fees for common area amenities. Doomsday prepping: Inside elite underground survival bunker One resident, Roehm, filed a complaint with the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office, citing issues such as an improperly installed septic system, unfinished roof repairs, and unfulfilled promises of security systems and personnel. In November, Michelle Collins, a Virginia resident, sued Vivos, alleging multiple contract breaches. According to her lawsuit, she paid $35,000 for a bunker lease, $3,000 for water, and $94,000 for improvements, while also covering annual land fees and monthly maintenance and security charges. Residents wanted a peaceful, stable life: Attorney Vicino said his son, Dante Vicino, who oversees operations at the complex, is in contact with the state attorney general's office. According to Robert Vicino, officials at the attorney general's office have praised their compliance, stating they're 'doing it by the book.' However, some residents have raised concerns about the response and protection provided by the Fall River County Sheriff's Office regarding complaints about the complex and its subcontractors. James said his clients are frustrated and disappointed, as they only sought a peaceful, stable life but have instead ended up in court. He said he hopes the state attorney general or another law enforcement agency will investigate the situation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/lawsuits-fbi-probe-engulf-south-dakota-doomsday-bunker-complex/	2024-12-31T10:28:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/12/south-dakota-doomsday-city.jpg?w=900

Nearly all of Puerto Rico is without power on New Year's Eve	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A blackout hit nearly all of Puerto Rico early Tuesday as the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate New Year’s, leaving more than 1.3 million clients in the dark. Officials said it could take up to two days to restore power. The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on. 'It had to be on the 31st of December!' exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. 'There is no happiness.' Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here. Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution. Luma said in a statement that it appears the outage was caused by a failure of an underground power line, saying it is restoring power 'in the quickest and safest way possible.' A Luma spokesman told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation. The blackout fanned simmering anger against Luma and Genera PR, which oversees the generation of power in Puerto Rico, as a growing number of people call for their ouster. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón, who is set to be sworn in on Jan. 2, has called for the creation of an 'energy czar' to review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found. Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he was in touch with Luma and Genera PR, adding on X that 'we are demanding answers and solutions.' Puerto Ricans began to plan ahead. 'I'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,' Raúl Pacheco said with a shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot. Julio Córdova, a municipal worker, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles. 'This affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?' he said, shaking his head as he raked leaves. While blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the island struggles with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in September 2017. The system, however, was already in decline after years of lack of maintenance and investment. Only recently did crews start making permanent repairs to Puerto Rico’s power grid following Hurricane Maria. The island continues to depend on generators provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to help stabilize the grid. Former President Jimmy Carter’s state funeral: What we know In November, Puerto Rico’s government asked U.S. officials for permission to keep using more than a dozen portable generators for two additional years. Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride. 'They're part of my everyday life,' said Enid Núñez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority struggles to restructure more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of the island's government agencies. © Copyright 2024 Associated Press.

Center of the universe.' Mar-a-Lago preparing for NYE bash	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The cars begin lining up early in the morning to be screened by Secret Service agents under white tents near the fence that surrounds President-elect Donald Trump’s vast south Florida estate. Famous figures such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Tesla and X owner Elon Musk pop up at breakfasts, luncheons and other social gatherings held daily at the opulent Mar-a-Lago club. Over the weekend, Mike Love, one of the original members of the Beach Boys, performed the band’s greatest hits under an outdoor tent there as Trump, trailed by Secret Service agents, wandered through the crowd, swinging his fists to the music, according to videos posted online. At other parts of the evening, he stood next to his wife, Melania, near the pool, bobbing his head to the music. Kevin Cramer’s son sentenced to 28 years over chase, fatal car crash The resort is the 'Center of the Universe,' Trump declared on social media Friday, adding, 'Bill Gates asked to come, tonight.' Representatives for Trump and Gates didn't clarify if the Microsoft co-founder did indeed join the parade of figures making the trip to Mar-a-Lago. But the president-elect's post reflects the way his resort, where he's largely been holed up since the election, has become a salon and celebration for his movement. For the people he's selected for his administration — and those who seek to get jobs or curry favor with the incoming president — it's the place to be. Sightings of those turning up there, usually in photos posted online or in the occasional public event, offer a glimpse into the workings of Trump’s incoming White House and how he is setting priorities for office. They are also renewing concerns about transparency as the meetings are largely shrouded in secrecy, and raising questions about how Trump benefits financially as club members seeking to influence the new administration stay and eat there. 'It’s kind of unreal,' said James Fishback, an investor who has in recent days launched an investment fund in the club’s tea room and dined at the courtyard. 'This is the power center.' He recalled standing by the pasta table exchanging words with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has chosen to lead the Health Department. The winter holidays have been another occasion for Trump's celebrations and for big names to come visit. Jimmy Carter’s hometown pays tribute to late president A representative for Zuckerberg confirmed he joined Trump for a dinner the night before Thanksgiving. A Christmas Eve video showed Trump in one of the resort's ballrooms full of guests, dancing to one of his favorite songs, the Village People's 'Y.M.C.A.,' while his daughter Ivanka sat in a gilded chair nearby. It's not clear what Trump planned for New Year's Eve — he has traditionally held a bash at the resort — but in his social media post on Friday, he boasted, 'New Year’s Eve is going to be AMAZING!!!' During dinners with friends and family, Trump uses the Spotify account on his tablet to play many of the same tunes that were ubiquitous at his campaign rallies. One night, his guest of honor was Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Another night, the honor went to Akie Abe, the widow of slain Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. And, yes, that was Argentine President Javier Milei doing Trump's 'Y.M.C.A.' dance between the tables at a gala dinner. During the day, Trump often golfs at his nearby course with friends, relatives and allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Overall, the vibe is a mix of south Florida's monied social scene overlaid with the power dynamics of an executive job fair. 'He’s surrounded by a lot of old friends,' Graham said. 'I just know that everybody I know wants some job.' Musk has been a constant presence at the club, so much so that Trump’s granddaughter, Kai, wrote on X that he was 'achieving uncle status.' Trump has tasked Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy with leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental task force formed to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. Kevin Roberts, president of the think tank behind Project 2025, spoke at a December event with investors at the club. One of the guests at the small function was health care executive Dr. Peter Lamelas, later tapped by Trump to be U.S. ambassador to Argentina. Biden doesn’t believe he should have dropped out of race: Source Sometimes Trump relaxes for dinner alongside club members and guests under the yellow and white awnings in the courtyard. Other times, he will address large groups for black-tie events in the ballrooms. At a recent gala for a nonprofit led by Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, the song ″God Bless the U.S.A.,' a favorite of Trump's, cued the president-elect's entrance. 'We’re off to a really good start,' Trump told people gathered for the event. He then inquired about the whereabouts of Tom Homan, whom he has tapped to be border czar, and joked that Homan was from 'central casting.' 'Just relax, Tom. I want you to relax and get ready for the big push,' Trump said. Trump shared with the party guests that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom he threatened with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless she does more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows, 'has made progress.' At another recent event at Mar-a-Lago, this one hosted by the America First Policy Institute, the ballroom was full of recognizable Trump-world figures such as Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to the president, and Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and founder of Turning Point Action. A copy of the president-elect’s latest book was sitting on the chairs for guests as they arrived in gowns and tuxedos. As he entered the ballroom, Musk was swarmed by guests, including Kash Patel, whom Trump would later select to lead the FBI, before the tech billionaire took his seat at the center table of the ballroom. Musk was later joined there by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance. Trump tests influence over GOP with Johnson Speakership vote 'It’s the place to be and the place to be seen,' said Damian Merlo, a political strategist who advises the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele. Merlo was at that event as well as another event hosted by the Conservative Political Action Committee. At a news conference Trump held recently at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect noted the changed mood compared with his first term, saying, 'Everybody wants to be my friend.' Besides Zuckerberg, Trump has hosted other Silicon Valley executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. 'The top executives, the top bankers, they’re all calling,' Trump said. 'It’s like a complete opposite.' Actor Russell Brand traveled this month to the club to speak at an event, where he sat with actor Mel Gibson, former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson and others. Later in the evening, he stood by a palm tree on the lawn, listening to a bagpiper in a kilt. Brand later posted a video to X about his experience. 'Pretty amazing,' he said. 'Is this real life, or am I in a dream?' ___ Associated Press writer Mary Claire Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-trump-calls-it-the-center-of-the-universe-mar-a-lago-is-a-magnet-for-those-seeking-influence/	2024-12-31T04:02:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6773dde82ecae7.96267896.jpeg?w=900
Jimmy Carter had a UFO encounter. What to know	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, left behind a unique legacy of openness about UFO sightings, including his own encounter in 1969, and a message to potential alien civilizations that continue to travel through space. As a rising politician in Georgia, Carter reported seeing an unidentified flying object outside a Lions Club in Leary, Georgia. He described a bright orb that changed colors from blue to red to white, moving toward and away from the group of about 25 witnesses before disappearing beyond the pine trees, per History.com. 'I've never believed that it came from Mars,' Carter told GQ magazine in 2005. 'I know enough physics to know that you can't have vehicles that are tangible in nature flying from Mars, looking around, and then flying back.' Carter said, 'And all of a sudden, one of the men looked up and said, ‘Look, over in the west!’ And there was a bright light in the sky. We all saw it. And then the light, it got closer and closer to us. And then it stopped, I don’t know how far away, but it stopped beyond the pine trees. And all of a sudden it changed color to blue, and then it changed to red, then back to white.' Lawmakers push to expand agencies’ power to cope with drones In 1973, then-Governor Carter filed an official report with the International UFO Bureau, according to History.com. During his 1976 presidential campaign, he promised to release all government UFO information if elected. However, after winning the presidency, Carter backed away from this pledge, citing national security concerns, per History.com. During his presidency, Carter maintained a fascination with space exploration. In 1977, he contributed a message to NASA's Voyager spacecraft mission, and carried on golden records into deep space, per the Daily Mail. 'We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations,' Carter wrote in the message, which continues to travel beyond our solar system along with recordings of Earth's music, languages and images, according to USA Today.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/jimmy-carter-ufo-encounter/	2024-12-30T19:14:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/02/bc343e0d27a14458bec7bff674e83888.jpg?w=900
How Jimmy Carter paved way for craft beer	(NewsNation) — Former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, was known to be a teetotaler. However, his name and legacy continue to buzz throughout the beer industry. In fact, without the 39th president's help, America's bustling craft beer scene might not even exist. When prohibition ended in 1933, the federal government rolled back most jurisdictions on home alcohol production — but left beer in a legal gray area. Homebrewing remained off-limits for decades, allowing big names like Anheuser-Busch, Schlitz, Pabst and Coors to dominate the market with light, mild lagers. Social Security: When are benefits being sent out in 2025? By the late 1970's, just five large breweries controlled about three-quarters of America's beer volume. Meanwhile, a small community of homebrewers was quietly experimenting with more flavorful, European-inspired style such as IPAs, porters and pale ales. Everything changed in 1978 when Carter signed HR 1337, legalizing homebrewing for personal use. The move allowed Americans to brew up to 100 gallons per person and 200 per household tax-free. Basement hobbyists becoming legitimate gave rise to the craft beer boom. From humble homebrew setups to full-scale operations, these small breweries have transformed the industry. Today, craft beer makes up over 13% of the US market. Experts say more than 90% of craft brewers began as homebrewers, proving just how pivotal the legislation Carter approved became. Before 1978, there were about 100 breweries across the United States. Now there's upwards of 10,000 and it's an industry that's still growing. Ironically, the former president himself rarely drank alcohol and famously never served little liquor in the White House, and yet his signature on that 1978 legislation laid the foundation for today's vibrant craft beer landscape.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/how-jimmy-carter-paved-way-for-craft-beer/	2024-12-30T17:22:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/651495e9c46199.52547691-e1722778856683.jpeg?w=800
Allman Brothers’ Chuck Leavell details Jimmy Carter’s musical leg...	(NewsNation) — Former Allman Brothers Band member Chuck Leavell, who has been the Rolling Stones' principal touring keyboardist since the 1980s, shared fond memories of the longest-living president's musical passion and genuine kindness on 'NewsNation Now.' He described first meeting Jimmy Carter in 1973 when the future president was still Georgia's governor. While Leavell and his bandmates expected Carter's gubernatorial visit to be nothing more than a quick photo-op, Carter sat with them for two hours, asking 'really great questions about the state of the music business in Georgia.' 'He was such a likable human being. He really was, you know, when you were in his presence, he made you feel comfortable. He was a great listener,' Leavell added, describing Carter as someone who had more than 'just a casual love of music.'

China hacked Treasury Department earlier this month: Officials	(NewsNation) — A Chinese state-sponsored hacker accessed U.S. Treasury workstations and stole documents in a 'major incident' in early December, a letter sent to lawmakers and reviewed by NewsNation confirmed. The Treasury Department was notified on Dec. 8, 2024, that a bad actor had 'gained access to a key' used by a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust. 'Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor,' the letter reads in part. Hackers have posted some RIBridges data on the dark web, McKee says With this key, the hacker was able to override security measures, remotely access workstations and access 'certain unclassified documents' from users. The Treasury Department said it is working with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'fully characterize the incident and determine its overall impact.' A BeyondTrust spokesperson shared the following statement with NewsNation: 'BeyondTrust previously identified and took measures to address a security incident in early December 2024 that involved the Remote Support product. BeyondTrust notified the limited number of customers who were involved, and it has been working to support those customers since then. No other BeyondTrust products were involved. Law enforcement was notified and BeyondTrust has been supporting the investigative efforts. BeyondTrust posted information regarding the incident and the on-going investigation on its website on December 8, 2024, including a summary, timeline, and indicators. The security advisory has been updated since then as part of BeyondTrust’s commitment to updating customers through the completion of this matter.' As of Dec. 30, the BeyondTrust service is offline, according to the letter. The department also assured lawmakers that 'there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/china-treasury-department-hack-security/	2024-12-30T14:19:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/cdfb1daf1c2e440291361ecca0562d4b.jpg?w=900
Northern lights could be seen in continental US on New Year's Eve	(NewsNation) — The solar system is putting on its own New Year's Eve show, with the northern lights potentially visible as far south as Oregon and Illinois on Dec. 31. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center issued a geomagnetic storm warning for New Year's Eve that could bring the aurora borealis much farther south than usual. The warning comes after several other solar storms made the northern visible to much more of the U.S. than typical in 2024. NASA spacecraft ‘safe’ after closest-ever approach to Sun The sun is currently in a period of solar maximum, where coronal mass ejections send plumes of plasma and magnetic field into space, triggering geomagnetic storm conditions to the Earth's magnetosphere. When CMEs come into contact with the magnetosphere, electrically charged particles collide with atmospheric gases and release energy that manifests as lights, giving us the colorful light show known as the aurora borealis. Weather forecast for viewing the northern lights Cloud cover could make viewing difficult in several states, including Washington, Oregon, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Those in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and parts of Idaho, on the other hand, have the best chance of catching a light show, though cloud cover could still be an issue. For the best chance of viewing the natural light show, head outside to a place with as little light pollution as possible. If you're struggling to see, your phone may help, as sensitive phone cameras can sometimes capture more of the lights than are visible to the naked eye.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/northern-lights-new-years-eve/	2024-12-30T14:11:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/670a1332285440.89773874.jpeg?w=900
Trump border czar Tom Homan to migrants: 'Stay home'	(NewsNation) — Immigration officials and agents at the U.S.-Mexico border insist there is still time for a potential surge of immigrants to cross into the country illegally before President-elect Donald Trump takes office and cracks down on border entries. Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan, have pledged to begin mass deportation efforts on Day 1 of Trump’s second White House term. But with three weeks before Trump’s inauguration, federal immigration officials believe they could be facing an influx of migrants who attempt to find safety in the United States before the border is closed. Homan, however, is warning them not to come. Several caravans of immigrants have broken free from Mexico’s southernmost point in Tapachula near the Guatemalan border. However, those groups of migrants have not yet reached the U.S.-Mexico border. Migrant crisis added to record-level US homelessness: HUD Instead, smaller segments of those caravans have arrived in Eagle Pass, Texas, before Trump takes office. Since President Joe Biden took office in 2021, more than 8 million migrants have been encountered at the southern border. The majority were given a court date to appear at an immigration hearing, which can take years to materialize. Homan told NewsNation that immigrants who cross illegally and then enter the process seeking asylum should not get comfortable living in the United States. 'They need to hear, they need to understand, ‘Do not sell everything you own to give it to the criminal cartels to be smuggled into the United States because you’re not going to stay,’' Homan said. Homan said that the Trump administration will be ending the federal 'catch and release' program, which allows immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country as long as they are in the process for asylum. 'Stay in your homeland,' Homan told NewsNation. 'Be safe. Crossing into this country illegally is very dangerous.' Trump ‘border czar’ says he will override sanctuary city roadblocks Homan said that a record number of migrants have died attempting to cross into the United States and that a record number of Americans are dying from fentanyl. Homan blamed both the migrant and American deaths on the Biden administration and its approach to the border. Texas Department of Public Safety officers encountered two unaccompanied girls who were abandoned by a smuggler in Eagle Pass before the smuggler fled back to Mexico. Texas DPS said that the girls were ages 5 and 9 and were from El Salvador. Both children had a note that included an address and phone number. While Homan wants migrants to remain safe, he told NewsNation that many are ignoring warnings in an attempt to get family members across the border before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Homan’s warnings come at Mexico government officials announced they would open 25 detention centers for immigrants who were sent back across the border once they were detained by U.S. immigration officials. With a tougher stance coming once Trump takes office, Homan said there is one solution for migrants looking to remain safe. 'Stay home,' Homan said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/homan-migrants-stay-home/	2024-12-30T13:56:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/AP24159796496621.jpg?w=900

Dec. 27, 2024, should have been Smith's 22nd birthday. Instead, her family pleaded for the public's help in finding her nearly three years after she disappeared in a Los Angeles area notorious for gang violence and prostitution.

Former President Jimmy Carter's state funeral: What we know	(NewsNation) — The state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, will be held on January 9 at Washington National Cathedral, the White House has announced. Jimmy Carter's funeral NewsNation confirmed on Monday that President Joe Biden, who addressed the nation on Sunday night after Carter's passing, is expected to deliver the eulogy at the funeral. More details are expected to be announced soon. The funeral will take place three days after Carter’s body is flown to Washington from Atlanta, where the former president will lie in repose on Saturday and Sunday at the Carter Center. The Carter Center announced on Sunday that public observances for the 39th president will be held in Atlanta and Washington before private interment will be held in Plains, Georgia. A state funeral is a national tribute that is traditionally reserved for a head of state, according to the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region and the U.S. Military District of Washington. The United States conducts the funerals on behalf of all people who hold, or who have held, the office of president, president-elect, and other people who have been designated by the president. A state funeral is typically made up of three stages and typically lasts 7-10 days. In former President Carter’s case, however, this week’s New Year’s holiday will delay the start of the process. Stage 1 of the state funeral takes place in the former president’s state of residence. The New York Times reported that Carter’s body will be taken by motorcade from Plains to Atlanta, which is the site of the Carter Center. Stage 2 includes ceremonies that are held in Washington before the state funeral culminates with interment. The Washington ceremonies may involve Armed Forces color guards, elite military bands and other representatives from service academies, the JTR-NCR/USAMDW said. Any services held outside of Washington include Washington-based honor guards and local service units as well as active duty, National Guard and Reserve for logistical, military band or salute guns support. Who will attend Jimmy Carter’s state funeral? State funerals are typically expected to be attended by other former presidents, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The New York Times reported it is not yet known whether President-elect Donald Trump will attend the funeral, which will take place 11 days before Trump’s inauguration.

Bush at the National Cathedral, Dec. 5, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Biden has also declared January 9 as a National Day of Mourning. Biden ordered all flags across the nation to remain at half-staff for the next 30 days. ABC News reported Carter asked Biden in 2023 to deliver his eulogy upon his passing. Biden endorsed Carter as the Democratic nominee for president during his first term as a U.S. senator and was the first member of Congress to do so. 'I think that what Jimmy Carter is an example of is just simple decency,' Biden said about Carter. 'And I think that’s what the rest of the world looks to America for.' NewsNation has confirmed that in addition to Biden speaking at the state funeral, eulogies will also be delivered by Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson who is the chairman of the board of the Carter Center. Other eulogies will be delivered by the son of former President Gerald Ford and the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale. Mondale was Carter’s running mate when Carter defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election. The national funeral will be the first to be held since former President George H.W. Bush died in 2018. What will happen before and after the national funeral? Once Carter’s body arrives in Washington on January 6, the former president will lie in state at the Capitol, where presidents dating back to Abraham Lincoln have been publicly remembered. Thousands of people are expected to pass through the Capitol Rotunda to pay their respects. The Carter Center issued a statement on Monday saying that the U.S. Congress graciously extended an invitation to allow the former president to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Washington National Cathedral is located just a few miles north of the White House and has been the venue used for several state funerals, ABC News reported. Other former presidents whose service was held at the church have included Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Carter will be returned to Georgia by military flight for burial after the national funeral. The New York Times reported that Carter’s body was initially set to be returned to Georgia by train, but that the former president objected. 'If you take my cold, dead body across the U.S. by train, I’ll haunt you until the day you die,' he told a staffer, according to the report. Carter is expected to be buried next to his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter, who died last year at the age of 96. The Carter Center family has asked that in lieu of flowers, donations are asked to be made to the nonprofit Carter Center, which is located at 453 John Lewis Freedom Parkway, N.E. in Atlanta.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/former-president-jimmy-carters-state-funeral-what-we-know/	2024-12-30T10:14:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/66ebe9a74477d4.41431495.jpeg?w=900
Judge blocks Biden admin from selling border wall materials	DALLAS (NewsNation) — A federal judge in Texas has ruled that the Biden administration must stop selling border wall materials that the outgoing president has refused to install. The Biden administration agreed to stop selling further border wall materials over the next 30 days. In a Truth Social post, President-elect Trump celebrated the blocked sale, calling the ruling 'a major, crucial WIN for America.' 'The Judge has also ordered an investigation into the illegal selling of the materials, which will expose just how corrupt and anti-American Radical Democrats are,' Trump added. What are the pros and cons of incremental budgeting? Texas AG applauds judge blocking sale The effort, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, began amid reports that the Biden administration was selling border wall materials. 'We have successfully blocked the Biden administration from disposing of any further border wall materials before President Trump takes office,' said Paxton, who has said he wants to help the incoming Trump administration with mass deportation efforts. Materials auctioned cheaply: Texas officials This battle over the border wall materials has been going on for years. In 2023, Congress ordered the U.S. Department of Defense to sell off remaining border wall materials. Some were sent to border states and federal agencies, while others were sold to a private auction company GovPlanet.com for pennies on the dollar, according to Texas officials. This December, Paxton filed a motion to halt further sales. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick celebrated the decision on X, calling it 'a huge win for Donald Trump and Texas!' 'The border wall that Joe Biden was attempting to auction off for pennies on the dollar in secret has been stopped,' he added. Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly planning to issue an executive order releasing funds to restart building the border wall, potentially on day one of his presidency.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/judge-blocks-biden-admin-selling-border-wall-materials/	2024-12-30T07:12:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-2155622941.jpg?w=900
Homelessness in US at record high levels: HUD	(NewsNation) — According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's annual assessment report, overall homelessness in America rose by 18% in 2024. The report found more than 770,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, a 33% increase from 2023. The number of homeless older Americans also rose, with more than 140,000 people over the age of 55 going unhoused in the U.S. this year. Nearly half of these older Americans reported living in places not meant for humans. Can you fly with pot? Here’s what the TSA says 'No American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe and quality housing they deserve,' HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement. HUD officials noted that the report reflects information collected a year ago, and likely does not represent current circumstances. It also misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own. 'While this data is nearly a year old, and no longer reflects the situation we are seeing, it is critical that we focus on evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness,' Todman said. Black Americans were overrepresented among the homeless population at about 32%, despite making up 12% of the overall population. While nearly every demographic in the U.S. reported record levels of homelessness this year, veterans saw a drop in their numbers. 'We know what works, and our success in reducing veteran homelessness by 55.2% since 2010 shows that,' Todman said. In addition, major cities such as Dallas, Texas and Los Angeles, as well as Chester County, Pennsylvania, saw declines in homelessness.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th US president, has died at 100	ATLANTA (AP) — Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, endured humbling defeat after one tumultuous term and then redefined life after the White House as a global humanitarian, has died. He was 100 years old. The longest-lived American president died on Sunday, roughly 22 months after entering hospice care, at his home in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died at 96 in November 2023, spent most of their lives, The Carter Center said. 'Our founder, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia,' the center said on the social media platform X. It added in a statement that he died peacefully, surrounded by his family. As reaction poured in from around the world, President Joe Biden mourned Carter’s death, saying the world lost an 'extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian' and he lost a dear friend. Biden cited Carter’s work to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil and human rights, promote free and fair elections and house the homeless as an example for others. 'To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility,' Biden said in a statement. Biden spoke later Sunday evening about Carter, calling it a 'sad day' but one that 'brings back an incredible amount of good memories.' 'I’ve been hanging out with Jimmy Carter for over 50 years,' Biden said in his remarks. He recalled the former president being a comfort to him and his wife Jill when their son Beau died in 2015 of cancer. The president remarked how cancer was a common bond between their families, with Carter himself having cancer later in his life. 'Jimmy knew the ravages of the disease too well,' said Biden, who scheduled a state funeral in Washington, D.C., for Carter on Jan. 9. Biden also declared Jan. 9 as a National Day of Mourning across the nation and ordered U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for 30 days from Sunday. Businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world — Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation’s highest office. The 39th president leveraged his ambition with a keen intellect, deep religious faith and prodigious work ethic, conducting diplomatic missions into his 80s and building houses for the poor well into his 90s. 'My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,' Carter once said. A president from Plains A moderate Democrat, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and technocratic plans reflecting his education as an engineer. His no-frills campaign depended on public financing, and his promise not to deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia. 'If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,' Carter repeated before narrowly beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who had lost popularity pardoning Nixon. Carter governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. His most acclaimed achievement in office was a Mideast peace deal that he brokered by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy. Yet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan. Carter acknowledged in his 2020 'White House Diary' that he could be 'micromanaging' and 'excessively autocratic,' complicating dealings with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. He also turned a cold shoulder to Washington’s news media and lobbyists, not fully appreciating their influence on his political fortunes. 'It didn’t take us long to realize that the underestimation existed, but by that time we were not able to repair the mistake,' Carter told historians in 1982, suggesting that he had 'an inherent incompatibility' with Washington insiders. Carter insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to 'protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully' and 'enhance human rights here and abroad' — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term. And then, the world Ignominious defeat, though, allowed for renewal. The Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind base of operations, asserting themselves as international peacemakers and champions of democracy, public health and human rights. 'I was not interested in just building a museum or storing my White House records and memorabilia,' Carter wrote in a memoir published after his 90th birthday. 'I wanted a place where we could work.' That work included easing nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, helping to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiating cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, The Carter Center had declared at least 113 elections in Latin America, Asia and Africa to be free or fraudulent. Recently, the center began monitoring U.S. elections as well. Carter’s stubborn self-assuredness and even self-righteousness proved effective once he was unencumbered by the Washington order, sometimes to the point of frustrating his successors. He went 'where others are not treading,' he said, to places like Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had wandered across the border in 2010. 'I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on projects that please me and reject the ones that don’t,' Carter said. He announced an arms-reduction-for-aid deal with North Korea without clearing the details with Bill Clinton’s White House. He openly criticized President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also criticized America’s approach to Israel with his 2006 book 'Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.' And he repeatedly countered U.S. administrations by insisting North Korea should be included in international affairs, a position that most aligned Carter with Republican President Donald Trump. Among the center’s many public health initiatives, Carter vowed to eradicate the guinea worm parasite during his lifetime, and nearly achieved it: Cases dropped from millions in the 1980s to nearly a handful. With hardhats and hammers, the Carters also built homes with Habitat for Humanity. The Nobel committee’s 2002 Peace Prize cites his 'untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.' Carter should have won it alongside Sadat and Begin in 1978, the chairman added. Carter accepted the recognition saying there was more work to be done. 'The world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place,' he said. 'The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched by equal understanding and mutual respect.' ‘An epic American life’ Carter’s globetrotting took him to remote villages where he met little 'Jimmy Carters,' so named by admiring parents. But he spent most of his days in the same one-story Plains house — expanded and guarded by Secret Service agents — where they lived before he became governor. He regularly taught Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church until his mobility declined and the coronavirus pandemic raged. Those sessions drew visitors from around the world to the small sanctuary where Carter will receive his final send-off after a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral. The common assessment that he was a better ex-president than president rankled Carter and his allies. His prolific post-presidency gave him a brand above politics, particularly for Americans too young to witness him in office. But Carter also lived long enough to see biographers and historians reassess his White House years more generously. His record includes the deregulation of key industries, reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cautious management of the national debt and notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health. He focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictators to release thousands of political prisoners. He acknowledged America’s historical imperialism, pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders and relinquished control of the Panama Canal. He normalized relations with China. 'I am not nominating Jimmy Carter for a place on Mount Rushmore,' Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic policy director, wrote in a 2018 book. 'He was not a great president' but also not the 'hapless and weak' caricature voters rejected in 1980, Eizenstat said. Rather, Carter was 'good and productive' and 'delivered results, many of which were realized only after he left office.' Madeleine Albright, a national security staffer for Carter and Clinton’s secretary of state, wrote in Eizenstat’s forward that Carter was 'consequential and successful' and expressed hope that 'perceptions will continue to evolve' about his presidency. 'Our country was lucky to have him as our leader,' said Albright, who died in 2022. Jonathan Alter, who penned a comprehensive Carter biography published in 2020, said in an interview that Carter should be remembered for 'an epic American life' spanning from a humble start in a home with no electricity or indoor plumbing through decades on the world stage across two centuries. 'He will likely go down as one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history,' Alter told The Associated Press. A small-town start James Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains and spent his early years in nearby Archery. His family was a minority in the mostly Black community, decades before the civil rights movement played out at the dawn of Carter’s political career. Carter, who campaigned as a moderate on race relations but governed more progressively, talked often of the influence of his Black caregivers and playmates but also noted his advantages: His land-owning father sat atop Archery’s tenant-farming system and owned a main street grocery. His mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns. Seeking to broaden his world beyond Plains and its population of fewer than 1,000 — then and now — Carter won an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946. That same year he married Rosalynn Smith, another Plains native, a decision he considered more important than any he made as head of state. She shared his desire to see the world, sacrificing college to support his Navy career. Carter climbed in rank to lieutenant, but then his father was diagnosed with cancer, so the submarine officer set aside his ambitions of admiralty and moved the family back to Plains. His decision angered Rosalynn, even as she dived into the peanut business alongside her husband. Carter again failed to talk with his wife before his first run for office — he later called it 'inconceivable' not to have consulted her on such major life decisions — but this time, she was on board. 'My wife is much more political,' Carter told the AP in 2021. He won a state Senate seat in 1962 but wasn’t long for the General Assembly and its back-slapping, deal-cutting ways. He ran for governor in 1966 — losing to arch-segregationist Lester Maddox — and then immediately focused on the next campaign. Carter had spoken out against church segregation as a Baptist deacon and opposed racist 'Dixiecrats' as a state senator. Yet as a local school board leader in the 1950s he had not pushed to end school segregation even after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, despite his private support for integration. And in 1970, Carter ran for governor again as the more conservative Democrat against Carl Sanders, a wealthy businessman Carter mocked as 'Cufflinks Carl.' Sanders never forgave him for anonymous, race-baiting flyers, which Carter disavowed. Ultimately, Carter won his races by attracting both Black voters and culturally conservative whites. Once in office, he was more direct. 'I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,' he declared in his 1971 inaugural address, setting a new standard for Southern governors that landed him on the cover of Time magazine. 'Jimmy Who?' His statehouse initiatives included environmental protection, boosting rural education and overhauling antiquated executive branch structures. He proclaimed Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the slain civil rights leader’s home state. And he decided, as he received presidential candidates in 1972, that they were no more talented than he was. In 1974, he ran Democrats’ national campaign arm. Then he declared his own candidacy for 1976. An Atlanta newspaper responded with the headline: 'Jimmy Who?' The Carters and a 'Peanut Brigade' of family members and Georgia supporters camped out in Iowa and New Hampshire, establishing both states as presidential proving grounds. His first Senate endorsement: a young first-termer from Delaware named Joe Biden. Yet it was Carter’s ability to navigate America’s complex racial and rural politics that cemented the nomination. He swept the Deep South that November, the last Democrat to do so, as many white Southerners shifted to Republicans in response to civil rights initiatives. A self-declared 'born-again Christian,' Carter drew snickers by referring to Scripture in a Playboy magazine interview, saying he 'had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.' The remarks gave Ford a new foothold and television comedians pounced — including NBC’s new 'Saturday Night Live' show. But voters weary of cynicism in politics found it endearing. Carter chose Minnesota Sen. Walter 'Fritz' Mondale as his running mate on a 'Grits and Fritz' ticket. In office, he elevated the vice presidency and the first lady’s office. Mondale’s governing partnership was a model for influential successors Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden. Rosalynn Carter was one of the most involved presidential spouses in history, welcomed into Cabinet meetings and huddles with lawmakers and top aides. The Carters presided with uncommon informality: He used his nickname 'Jimmy' even when taking the oath of office, carried his own luggage and tried to silence the Marine Band’s 'Hail to the Chief.' They bought their clothes off the rack. Carter wore a cardigan for a White House address, urging Americans to conserve energy by turning down their thermostats. Amy, the youngest of four children, attended District of Columbia public school. Washington’s social and media elite scorned their style. But the larger concern was that 'he hated politics,' according to Eizenstat, leaving him nowhere to turn politically once economic turmoil and foreign policy challenges took their toll. Accomplishments, and ‘malaise’ Carter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres of Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and nonwhite people to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. He appointed Paul Volker, the Federal Reserve chairman whose policies would help the economy boom in the 1980s — after Carter left office. He built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy. But he couldn’t immediately tame inflation or the related energy crisis. And then came Iran. After he admitted the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979 by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Negotiations to free the hostages broke down repeatedly ahead of the failed rescue attempt. The same year, Carter signed SALT II, the new strategic arms treaty with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, only to pull it back, impose trade sanctions and order a U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Hoping to instill optimism, he delivered what the media dubbed his 'malaise' speech, although he didn’t use that word. He declared the nation was suffering 'a crisis of confidence.' By then, many Americans had lost confidence in the president, not themselves. Carter campaigned sparingly for reelection because of the hostage crisis, instead sending Rosalynn as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Carter famously said he’d 'kick his ass,' but was hobbled by Kennedy as Reagan rallied a broad coalition with 'make America great again' appeals and asking voters whether they were 'better off than you were four years ago.' Reagan further capitalized on Carter’s lecturing tone, eviscerating him in their lone fall debate with the quip: 'There you go again.' Carter lost all but six states and Republicans rolled to a new Senate majority. Carter successfully negotiated the hostages’ freedom after the election, but in one final, bitter turn of events, Tehran waited until hours after Carter left office to let them walk free. 'A wonderful life' At 56, Carter returned to Georgia with 'no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.' Four decades after launching The Carter Center, he still talked of unfinished business. 'I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,' Carter told the AP in 2021. 'But it’s turned out to be much more long-lasting and insidious than I had thought it was. I think in general, the world itself is much more divided than in previous years.' Still, he affirmed what he said when he underwent treatment for a cancer diagnosis in his 10th decade of life. 'I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,' he said in 2015. 'I’ve had a wonderful life. I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.' ___ Sanz is a former Associated Press reporter.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/ap-us-news/ap-jimmy-carter-the-39th-us-president-has-died-at-100/	2024-12-30T03:11:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67728079b742c0.37109972.jpeg?w=900
Jimmy Carter is an example of ‘simple decency': Joe Biden	President Biden said former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday, 'lived a life measured not by words but by deeds.'

'His life was dedicated to others,' Biden said, listing some of his efforts which included working to fight disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections around the world, and build housing for the homeless with his own hands. The outgoing president noted how loss, and in particular, cancer, had brought his family closer to the Carters over the years. Jimmy Carter ‘wasn’t a good president but tried’ to be: Bill O’Reilly 'What I find extraordinary is millions of people around the world feel they lost a friend as well even though they never met him,' Biden said. Asked if there were any lessons President-elect Trump could take from Carter, Biden said, 'Decency, decency, decency,' adding that Carter would never neglect someone in need or demean them based on their looks. 'We could all do well to be a little more like Jimmy Carter,' said Biden.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jimmy-carter-joe-biden/	2024-12-30T02:50:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/biden_joe_12192024_AP_AP24354085957476.jpg?w=900
