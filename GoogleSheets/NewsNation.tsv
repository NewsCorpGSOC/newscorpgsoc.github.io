Lawmakers denied entry into Department of Education	(NewsNation) — Democratic members of Congress were denied entry into the Department of Education on Friday morning. The doors were locked and a security guard could be seen having a tense conversation with a lawmaker. 'They are blocking members of Congress from entering the Department of Education! Elon is allowed in and not the people? ILLEGAL,' Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., wrote on X. In another post, he said armed federal officers were called to the scene. 'We aren't dangerous,' Frost wrote. 'We are here to represent our people. To defend public education. This is an authoritarian regime.' Does DOGE have your personal information? The incident happened as Trump reportedly considered using an executive order to abolish the department, an issue he campaigned on during the 2024 election. 'We’re ranked number one in cost per pupil, so we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we’re ranked at the bottom of the list,' Trump has previously said. 'We’re ranked very badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools.' Shutting down the Department of Education would require an act of Congress. The department administers funding for K-12 schools that is appropriated by Congress; provides oversight for schools; administers student loans and grants; and can also create federal rules. Along with the Education Department, Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk moved to eradicate the U.S. Agency for International Development. Democrats tried Monday to enter USAID headquarters, but were blocked from this building as well by officers. This story is developing. Refresh for updates.

Illinois, Chicago sued by DOJ over sanctuary city status	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit Thursday against Chicago, Cook County and the state of Illinois, accusing officials of interfering with immigration enforcement efforts. The suit comes on the heels of a federal judge blocking President Donald Trump's executive order preventing the children of migrants without legal status from receiving birthright citizenship for the second time this week. Chicago and Illinois leaders vow to fight DOJ Local leaders are pushing back against the Trump administration, asserting the city maintains its welcoming status despite federal pressure. The DOJ's lawsuit argues Chicago's state and local laws — such as the Illinois Way Forward Act, the Illinois Trust Act and Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance, which limit local police cooperation with ICE agents — interfere with the federal government's immigration enforcement. Federal buyout deadline extended as Trump plans USAID cuts Additionally, it argues the supremacy clause of the Constitution gives the federal government the right to create and enforce laws without interference from states. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker defended the laws. 'Unlike Donald Trump, Illinois follows the law,' he said, adding that the Trust Act was signed into law by a Republican governor and 'has always been compliant with federal law and still is today.' 'We look forward to seeing them in court,' Pritzker said. Sheriff: Illinois Trust Act ties our hands Some local law enforcement officials, such as Winnebago County Sheriff Gary Caruana, argue the current legislation prevents their ability to do their jobs effectively. 'The Trust Act does not allow us to call immigration and say this person has an issue and could be dangerous — and this is where I'm concerned about public safety — this person could be dangerous, you might want to take a look at this. We can't do that,' he said. Senate installs Russell Vought as Trump’s next budget chief In a social media post, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit is under review by the city's law department and reaffirmed the city's commitment to protecting residents. Earlier this week, Johnson accused the Trump administration of trying to undermine Chicago's humanity and called for Congress to pass immigration reform.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/doj-sues-illinois-chicago-sanctuary-city/	2025-02-07T06:17:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25027710663013.jpg?w=900
Trump's birthright citizenship order going in front of third judg...	(NewsNation) — A third federal judge is weighing President Donald Trump's push to end birthright citizenship Friday after a second judge ordered a nationwide pause earlier this week. At issue is whether birthright citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution. So far, judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents have said the 14th Amendment grants birthright citizenship. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland put an injunction on Trump's executive order. In Seattle on Thursday, U.S. District John Coughenour issued his own injunction, accusing Trump of trying to change the Constitution 'under the guise of an executive order.' What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown praised the judge's decision, saying that 'time and time again, (Trump) has shown a disdain for the United States Constitution.' Meanwhile, the Trump administration is focusing on a four-word phrase in the 14th Amendment: 'subject to the jurisdiction.' Per the 14th Amendment, 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.' Trump administration officials say this means people in the U.S. illegally, visiting or on a visa are not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. — and, therefore, their children are not citizens. Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship would overturn more than a century of precedent It may be an uphill fight, with precedent set at a Supreme Court case more than a century ago. Back then, the high court ruled children born in the U.S. to Chinese parents — who were prohibited from becoming citizens at that time — could be citizens under the 14th Amendment. Trump's executive order was set to go into effect on Feb. 19 but now will remain blocked unless both courts are overruled. More than two dozen states and organizations are part of at least nine different lawsuits challenging the order. Friday's hearing in Boston is set to start at 10 a.m. ET, and a fourth case will be heard Monday in New Hampshire.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-third-judge/	2025-02-07T05:51:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196996771.jpg?w=900
Federal buyout deadline extended as Trump slashes USAID staffing	(NewsNation) — Nearly 2 million U.S. federal employees now have until the weekend to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration, which is seeking to dramatically reduce the federal workforce, after a judge delayed Thursday's deadline. The move coincides with President Donald Trump's plan to cut staffing for U.S. aid projects worldwide as part of efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, leaving fewer than 300 workers of its current 10,000-employee workforce. These workers would be responsible for managing U.S. humanitarian efforts abroad. According to reports, only 12 staff members would oversee projects in Africa and eight in Asia. A lawsuit filed by the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees seeks a federal court order to stop the USAID cuts. Catholic aid group downsizes by nearly 50% amid USAID freeze Labor unions are fighting the buyouts for federal workers, arguing the plan is an illegal scam unauthorized by Congress and warning federal workers to read the fine print. 'What we've been urging is for people to look at these offers with caution because there's legal uncertainty,' said John Hatton of the National Active and Retired Federal Employee Association. 'We don't know what that means in terms of, do you still lose your job, do you waive all legal rights under this offer as well.' Buyout offer extended after judge’s ruling Millions of U.S. government employees had been facing a Thursday deadline to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration. Those who choose to stay still risk being laid off. U.S. District Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. ruled in favor of several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan spearheaded by Trump adviser Elon Musk. The judge did not express an opinion on the legality of the buyouts and directed administration officials to extend the deadline to apply until after a hearing scheduled for Monday. Saving USAID not the hill Dems should die on: Commentator Trump’s push to reduce the size of the government is unprecedented, causing turmoil in Washington and triggering protests and union concerns over potential legal violations. So far, more than 60,000 employees, about 2% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout, with more expected to join. It remains unclear how many of the federal government’s 2.3 million civilian workers will ultimately agree to the offer. What’s included in the buyout offer? On the surface, the Office of Personnel Management's offer seems straightforward: federal workers who resign will receive pay and benefits through September. However, the situation may not be that simple. The deal limits employees’ ability to address any issues if things go wrong. Even after workers accept the buyout, the government still has the right to rescind the offer. The buyout impacts not only employees at domestic agencies such as the Department of Labor, which has long drawn criticism from Trump’s supporters, but also those in intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Unions and some lawmakers are urging federal workers to reject the buyout offer, cautioning that, with government funding set to expire in March, their pay and benefits could be at risk. The move has sparked protests in Washington and across the nation. What happens if federal workers don’t accept the buyout offer? Federal workers who do not accept the offer may face job losses and miss out on the pay and benefits offered by the buyout. Did USAID money lead to Trump impeachment? The Office of Personnel Management has warned several federal agencies could downsize in the coming months, though this does not apply to military personnel or workers in immigration enforcement, national security and the U.S. Postal Service.

Ellen Greenberg's death staged to look like suicide: Neuropatholo...	(NewsNation) — Dr. Wayne Ross, a forensic neuropathologist hired by the family of Ellen Greenberg, believes the teacher's 2011 death was staged to look like a suicide, he told NewsNation senior national correspondent Brian Entin. He cites a towel placed next to her, clean despite her 20 stab wounds, as evidence of the staging. The case was originally ruled a homicide, then changed to suicide. Greenberg's family has long found her passing suspicious, with her father saying he believes she was strangled. Attorney: Ellen Greenberg’s family hasn’t heard from her fiancé Ross agrees: 'To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she was strangled. Yeah, I would testify in the court of law.' The medical examiner who initially investigated the case released new legal verification indicating he believes the ruling of a suicide is inaccurate. Just days ago, the family of Ellen Greenberg reached a settlement agreement with Philadelphia officials to reopen the investigation. And Ross has an idea of what they might find — from bruises on her wrists and legs, to conflicting blood splatter evidence. Former DHS employee arrested for kidnapping child, falsifying documents Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who worked as Philadelphia district attorney when Greenberg was found dead, addressed the case Thursday. 'There's nothing I wanted more than to give these parents some finality, some answers, some clarity, and we received more evidence, more information during the course of our investigation that ... pointed toward a suicide,' Shapiro said. Ellen Greenberg's death Greenberg was found dead Jan. 26, 2011, in the kitchen of her apartment by her fiancé. The 27-year-old woman had been stabbed 20 times. Cost to sequester Megan Boswell jury thousands per day Philadelphia Medical Examiner Marlon Osbourne initially ruled the death a homicide due to the large number of stab wounds, including 10 on the back of Greenberg’s neck. But police challenged the finding and he changed his assessment to suicide. Osbourne did not offer an explanation for the change at the time, but a new statement showed he made the change after acquiring additional information from her case file and consulting with another doctor.

(NewsNation) — Bill O'Reilly tells NewsNation he doesn't fear any uprising led by Elon Musk, as he believes the Tesla billionaire doesn't actually 'have any power' in the administration. 'I'm not worried that he's going to do a coup d'état,' O'Reilly said. 'I'm not worried because he doesn't have any power. He can't subpoena anybody. He's just is an adviser.' Does DOGE have your personal information? 'He presents to Trump,' O'Reilly added. 'Trump does what he wants.' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been active since President Donald Trump took office and signed an executive order creating the organization just more than two weeks ago. After Musk vowed to cut $2 trillion from federal government spending, the tech billionaire has come under fire from Democrats questioning Musk’s authority to act. Its investigations — most notably into the U.S. Agency for International Development — have drawn ire from protestors and politicians alike who fear he has too much influence and power for an unelected official. 'Think this is just a hyped-up story. Doesn't mean very much. I'm happy if Elon Musk uncovers wasteful spending,' O'Reilly said. Elon Musk's role DOGE has been controversial from the start. Though it is not an agency or a Cabinet-level position, it has been treated similarly. Rep. Val Hoyle: I’m leaving DOGE Caucus because of Musk’s actions Because it is not an agency, Musk has not had to go through a Senate confirmation hearing that would typically be required for someone at that level of power.

Rep. Val Hoyle: I’m leaving DOGE Caucus because of Musk’s actions	(NewsNation) — Rep. Val Hoyle, D-Ore., who was on the Department of Government Efficiency Caucus, announced live on NewsNation air that Elon Musk’s behavior has forced her to leave DOGE. 'It's like trying to replace your roof when someone is throwing dynamite through the window into your living room. It's just not possible,' Hoyle explained. 'So, I'm leaving the DOGE Caucus.' 'Right now, I just don’t think it’s possible with what’s happening,' Hoyle said, clarifying that the caucus doesn't directly work with Musk. Joe Rogan cheers Musk’s ‘business approach’ to government cuts 'President Trump handed over the keys to the White House, to the Treasury, to government, to an unelected billionaire, and you know, it's, quite frankly, very disturbing,' Hoyle said. Hoyle told 'CUOMO' that, while those involved in the caucus want to be 'good stewards of taxpayer dollars,' Musk is 'accountable to no one' and has made it impossible to get work done. She adds that neither she nor her Republican colleagues have any influence in efficiency operations. What powers does Elon Musk have? DOGE has been controversial from the start.

Federal workers need more time on buyout decision: Money expert	(NewsNation) — A financial expert says he has many 'reservations' around the Trump administration’s buyout offer to federal employees because the staffers don't have enough data or time to make an informed, 'irrevocable' life-altering decision. 'We understand what he's trying to do here, but there's a way to do it where people can make educated and good long-term decisions in another month or two to get all that data,' Doug Flynn, co-founder of Flynn Zito Capital Management, told NewsNation. So far, more than 60,000 employees, about 2% of the federal civilian workforce, have accepted the buyout with more expected to join them. It remains unclear how many of the federal government’s 2.3 million civilian workers will ultimately agree to the offer. Federal employees accepting buyouts ‘rapidly growing’ Millions of U.S. government employees had been facing a Thursday midnight deadline to decide whether to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration or remain in their position. Those who chose to stay still risked being laid off. However, a federal judge delayed that deadline until Monday after ruling in favor of several labor unions that had requested a temporary restraining order against the plan spearheaded by Trump adviser Elon Musk. Flynn said buyouts are presented in the corporate world with much more information and assurances along with ample time so an employee is able to make an informed decision, When private companies 'do that, they lay out everything that you're going to get, and they've run it through all the legal channels, and so you can have it looked at by an employment attorney, but it's probably already run through as the best deal you're going to get,' he said. 'And they give you more than nine days to make an irrevocable, lifelong decision.' While it may seem beneficial to some employees who are near retirement, for others, the decision is much harder because they may not be able to secure the same kind of employment again, he added. 'It does make a big difference in these people's lives in terms of planning.'

NCAA changes participation policy on transgender athletes	NewsNation) — The National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Board of Governors voted to change its policy on transgender athletes, restricting women’s sports to those athletes who were assigned female genders at birth. The announcement comes one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to keep men from participating in women’s sports. The change also comes on the heels of three University of Pennsylvania swimmers suing the school and the NCAA, claiming their rights were violated after they were teammates with a transgender swimmer on UPenn’s women’s swimming team. White supremacist found guilty of planning power grid attack The updated participation policy allows college athletes who were assigned male genders at birth to practice with women’s teams and receive benefits such as medical care while practicing, the NCAA said in a statement. Men’s sports remain open to all eligible student-athletes. Under the new policy, schools are directed to foster welcoming environments on all of its campuses. The NCAA is an organization made up of 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states that collectively enroll more than 530,000 student-athletes, the organization said. 'We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,' NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. 'To that end, President Trump's order provides a clear, national standard.' The lawsuit filed by the three former UPenn swimmers involved their former teammate, Lia Thomas, who won an NCAA championship in 2022 in the 500 freestyle while part of the school’s women’s team. Thomas was originally part of the school’s men’s swimming team before transitioning. As part of Thursday’s NCAA policy change, the Board of Governors also directed NCAA staff to assist all of its member schools foster respectful and inclusive collegiate athletic cultures.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/ncaa-participation-transgender-athletes/	2025-02-06T14:00:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67683998f0b576.83202384.jpeg?w=900
Three UPenn teammates of Lia Thomas sue university	(NewsNation) — Three swimmers and former teammates of transgender competitor Lia Thomas have sued the University of Pennsylvania and others, alleging that the school violated their rights. Former UPenn swimmers Grace Eastabrook, Ellen Homquist and Margot Kaczorowrski filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts this week. The Ivy League Council of Presidents, the NCAA and others are listed as defendants. Thomas was banned from competing in elite swimming competitions, including the Olympics. Thomas swam for the University of Pennsylvania and won an NCAA title in meets that are outside the World Aquatics competitive system, in which she was not registered. Federal workers fear mass firings as buyout deadline looms The World Aquatics governing body added a new gender inclusion policy in 2022, banning biological male athletes from competing in women’s elite races unless they transitioned by the age of 12 or before experiencing male puberty. It also created an 'open' category for transgender athletes. Thomas gained national recognition after she won the 2022 NCAA championship in the 500 freestyle and was named an All-American in three of the women’s swimming and diving championships. In the lawsuit, the three former UPenn swimmers who all competed at the 2022 Ivy League Women's Swimming and Diving championships, said that before the season began, the school's swimming coach, Mike Schnur bragged that he had a 'secret weapon.' They said before the Ivy League championships, Thomas' dominance over women's swimmers 'meet after meet' had become international news. They claim that the Ivy League Council of Presidents, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, met behind closed doors to 'strike a public blow for trans-identifying men competing in women's sports.' The lawsuit said that the 2022 Ivy League meet was to be the culmination of the league's public campaign to 'manipulate public opinion and change the NCAA Division I collegiate sports landscape' for trans-identifying men who wanted to compete in women's competitions. In a statement provided to NewsNation by an NCAA spokeswoman, the organization said, 'College sports are the premier stage for women’s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women’s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships.' An email sent to the University of Pennsylvania seeking comment was not immediately returned. Thomas is the first known male-born athlete to win an NCAA Division I women’s title. Thomas previously competed for the university’s men’s team before transitioning to a woman. One of Thomas’ teammates spoke to NewsNation, which agreed to allow the teammate to remain anonymous. 'This is a problem that needs to be fixed,' she told NewsNation. The lawsuit filed by the swimmers comes on the heels of President Donald Trump signing an executive order stopping men from competing in women's sports. But Thomas's former teammate told NewsNation that she feels a lot of her teammates are 'really scared' to speak out. She said that the first time she saw Thomas compete with UPenn’s women’s team, she felt shocked and said the team was just forced to accept it because no one was in place to do anything about it. This is a developing story. NewsNation will update it as more information becomes available.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/sports/upenn-teammates-lia-thomas-sue/	2025-02-06T08:24:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/10/6705bfba0300c8.02293859.jpeg?w=900
Nearly a third of those in ICE custody have criminal convictions	(NewsNation) — Data from the Department of Homeland Security indicates nearly 30% of those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody have criminal convictions. In addition, just over 33% have a final order of removal. In the wake of President Donald Trump's actions to make good on campaign promises of mass deportations, there are more than 41,000 in ICE custody. Judge cements block on Trump’s order restricting birthright citizenship ICE has also targeted members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. A recent action in Colorado resulted in the arrest of 10 people, though sources told NewsNation information about the action was leaked, potentially affecting results. Local officials did not help because Colorado law prohibits them from doing so, leaving federal officials to conduct immigration raids. Most of those detained are housed in an area under the purview of the New Orleans field office with the most beds in the system, with roughly 9,400 in custody. While the average length of custody is 90 days, some have been in custody for three months or more. The administration has started releasing deportation flights to other countries, including Colombia, Mexico and India. Newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the administration has been in talks with El Salvador about the country accepting deportees of different nationalities. ICE raids heighten fear among NYC street vendors Tom Homan, who the administration has placed in charge of the effort, says congressional funding is needed for more beds but that the agency is doing what it can with the resources available. Recently, the Trump administration announced a plan to house people flagged for deportation at Guantanamo Bay. The facility, infamous for its use to indefinitely detain people during the war on terror, would be able to house 30,000 immigrants who have been marked for deportation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/nearly-third-ice-custody-criminal/	2025-02-06T08:22:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195569259.jpg?w=900
Trump to sign order sanctioning International Criminal Court	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court for targeting the United States and its allies, a White House official told NewsNation. NewsNation previously reported on the order, originally set to be signed Tuesday and pushed back due to a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The order will put financial and visa sanctions on individuals and family members who help the ICC investigate U.S. citizens or allies. DOJ sues Illinois, Chicago over ‘sanctuary city’ laws The U.S. has never accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC and is not a party to the Rome Statute. In a fact sheet, the administration said the statute gives the ICC broad power that poses 'a significant threat to United States sovereignty and our constitutional protections.' The court was created in 2002 to facilitate international justice for war crimes, crimes of aggression, genocide and crimes against humanity. The Trump administration said the court has been politicized, citing its issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli officials and Hamas officials at the same time. The administration claims the court constrains democratic nations from exercising the right of self-defense while failing to hold other regimes, such as Iran, accountable. The administration says investigations into the U.S. and Israel 'undermine its credibility as an impartial arbiter of international justice.' Trump has also decried the cost of the court, which has had expenditures of more than $2 billion. However, the U.S. has not been a regular contributor to ICC funding, with Congress typically blocking any efforts to give funds. Rand Paul knocks Trump Gaza takeover plan: ‘I thought we voted for America First’ Trump previously sanctioned the ICC during his first administration, freezing assets and banning officials from entering the U.S. after the court opened an investigation into American actions in Afghanistan. Trump's recent move comes after he suggested the U.S. 'take over' the Gaza Strip, a proposal that global leaders have rejected and that some have suggested is illegal. This is a developing story.

'What he's trying to do is essentially destroy our agencies, destroy the social safety net, and then take all of that, pretend it's savings, so then he takes all of that hard-earned wealth of working-class people from across the country and redistributes it to himself his billionaire friends and his own companies,' said Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif. Army recruiting hits record highs after Trump’s win In response to these concerns, the Office of Personnel Management defended the buyout offer, stating, 'This is a rare, generous opportunity — one that was thoroughly vetted and intentionally designed to support employees through restructuring.' What happens if federal workers don't accept the buyout offer? Federal workers who do not accept the offer may face job losses and miss out on the pay and benefits offered by the buyout. The Office of Personnel Management has warned several federal agencies could downsize in the coming months, though this does not apply to military personnel or workers in immigration enforcement, national security and the U.S. Postal Service.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-workers-firings-buyout-deadline/	2025-02-06T04:36:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2196938721.jpg?w=900
Does DOGE have your personal information?	(NewsNation) — Current and former officials have been raising the alarm after a team led by Elon Musk was granted access to the Treasury's payment systems, which include sensitive data on millions of Americans. The White House says that Musk, a South African tech billionaire, has a security clearance to access the system; however, the agency typically restricts access to a very small number of senior personnel because of the sensitivity of the information. Musk says DOGE will make ‘rapid safety upgrades’ to air traffic control system What is DOGE? President Donald Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) through an executive order, renaming what was previously the Office of Digital Services and moving the office to be under the Executive Office of the President from the Office of Management and Budget, where it was previously located. The office is tasked with modernizing government technology, and Trump has also directed Musk, who heads DOGE, to review finances. Why has DOGE been controversial? DOGE has been controversial from the start. Though it is not an agency or a Cabinet-level position, it has been treated similarly. Because it is not an agency, Musk has not had to go through a Senate confirmation hearing that would typically be required for someone at that level of power. The White House has classified Musk as a special government employee with a limited contract, which means he is exempt from certain regulations regarding financial disclosure and transparency. DOGE employees identified, prosecution possible: US Attorney DOGE has also made unilateral changes to certain agencies, most notably USAID. The organization is responsible for providing humanitarian assistance abroad, and after accessing systems, DOGE put the majority of employees on administrative leave, recalled those stationed overseas and blocked staff from accessing the Washington, D.C., office. Musk and Trump have alleged the agency is 'criminal' and a 'fraud' though there has been no evidence offered to back up any of those claims. What information does DOGE have access to? The Treasury Department's payment system includes the systems that control money for federal grants, payments for Social Security and Medicare, tax information and payments to government contractors. That means DOGE employees have access to the Social Security numbers of millions of Americans, along with sensitive tax information and banking accounts for direct deposit. Trump and Musk have maintained that DOGE is conducting a financial audit. However, audits do not typically include (or require) direct access to the payment system. Trump also fired the inspector general whose role includes auditing government programs and who has extensive experience doing so. What could DOGE do with that information? The Trump administration claims Musk has read-only access to the system, but critics have still raised the alarm about what Musk could do. What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Theoretically, with access to the payment system, DOGE could cut off any payments it or the president decides should be cut. That could range from broad moves, like cutting off the funds for school lunch programs, or granular ones, like deciding which individual Americans should or should not recieve Social Security payments. DOGE also has access to information on government contractors, including a 'Do Not Pay' list that prevents ineligible individuals or companies from receiving federal funds. Headed by Musk, whose companies are heavily subsidized by government funds, DOGE could blacklist his competitors and make them ineligible for contracts or remove companies owned by his allies that are currently blacklisted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/does-doge-have-personal-data/	2025-02-05T16:31:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP24318569633728-e1731532012925_3d1ae4-e1732493115731.jpg?w=800
Musk says DOGE will make 'rapid safety upgrades' to air traffic c...	Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday said the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will make 'rapid safety upgrades' to the air traffic control systems with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 'With the support of President @realDonaldTrump, the @DOGE team will aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,' Musk wrote Wednesday on the social platform X, which he owns. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? 'Just a few days ago, the FAA’s primary aircraft safety notification system failed for several hours!' he added, likely referring to an outage of the FAA's Notice to Air Mission system over the weekend. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN over the weekend that the system allows pilots to download flight details ahead of a trip and is required for planes to fly. Shortly before Musk's post on Wednesday, Duffy posted on X that he spoke with the DOGE team, who will 'plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.' The Department of Transportation (DOT) did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for more details on what these upgrades could look like. When asked about the upgrades, a White House spokesperson doubled down on DOGE's mission. 'DOGE is fulfilling President Trump’s commitment to making government more accountable, efficient, and, most importantly, restoring proper stewardship of the American taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars,' the spokesperson said. 'Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.' 'The ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change,' the spokesperson added. 'While change can be uncomfortable, it is necessary and aligns with the mandate supported by more than 77 million American voters.' DOGE actions ‘long overdue, much welcomed’: House speaker Musk owns SpaceX, a leading aerospace company, along with electric vehicle maker Tesla and the social media company X. His remarks come nearly a week after a deadly midair collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport between a passenger plane and a military helicopter. All 67 people aboard the American Airlines plane and helicopter were killed. The crash prompted scrutiny of the FAA, along with the Trump administration's plans to reduce federal bureaucracy. FAA employees were reportedly sent an offer to resign with eight months' pay one day before the collision, but an official with the Office of Personnel Management later said controllers were not eligible for the offer, The Associated Press reported. There is no evidence the efforts to reduce the federal workforce played a role in the collision, and a shortage of air traffic controllers had been an issue long before President Trump took office or began DOGE. Democrats accuse DOGE of going after NOAA Thousands of federal workers have been offered the buyout as Trump, Musk and DOGE look to slash government spending and bureaucracy. On his first day in office, Trump issued a federal government hiring freeze that applies to much of the federal government, but air traffic controllers were not included in this freeze, the AP noted. Musk made headlines this week after his team pushed for access to the Treasury Department's payment system, and DOGE staff has been involved at the Small Business Administration and the Government Services Administration. Musk has also been a vocal proponent of gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D) quickly slammed Duffy's announcement of DOGE's work. 'They have no relevant experience. Most of them aren't old enough to rent a car. And you're going to let them mess with airline safety that's already deteriorated on your watch?' she wrote on X. House Republican eyes Medicare, Social Security for DOGE cuts Some of the DOGE staff members are reportedly young adults, some of whom have reportedly not graduated from college. Duffy clapped back, writing on X, 'Madam Secretary, with all due respect, 'experienced' Washington bureaucrats are the reason our nation's infrastructure is crumbling. You need to sit this one out.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-doge-air-traffic-control/	2025-02-05T15:51:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/muskelon_01202025ap_837cbb.jpg?w=900
DOGE actions 'long overdue, much welcomed': House speaker	(NewsNation) — House Speaker Mike Johnson is defending the actions being taken by the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency amid complaints from Democrats over whether the newly formed agency is wielding too much power. The agency, more commonly known as DOGE, has been active since President Donald Trump took office and signed an executive order creating DOGE just more than two weeks ago. After Musk vowed to cut $2 trillion from federal government spending, the tech billionaire has come under fire from Democrats questioning Musk’s authority to act. Asked if Musk and DOGE had been given powers that fall under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution that grants Congress various enumerated powers and the right to pass laws necessary to carry out those powers, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, defended the agency. ‘Corrupt’ FBI staff in Jan. 6 probe should worry: Justice Dept. Johnson told reporters that the executive branch of the government has the right to evaluate how agencies within the branch operate. He said by pausing the work of federal agencies that are now under evaluation, DOGE ensures that American tax dollars are being used wisely.

They spoke about 'election integrity,' which has been one of the former president's top issues. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) 'That is a long overdue, much-welcomed development,' Johnson said. 'That’s what the American people demand and deserve.' Johnson said that Congress views DOGE’s evaluation of agencies such as the U.S. Department of Education and other federal offices as an 'active, engaged, committed' exercise in what the executive branch was designed to do. Johnson said that DOGE has 'broad discretion' on how federal funding is used. '(DOGE) is using that authority right in a way that hasn’t been used in a long time,' the House speaker said. 'So it looks radical. It’s not. This is not a usurpation of authority in any way. It’s not a power grab. I think they’re doing what we’ve all expected and hope and asked that they would do.' Democrats gathered Tuesday for what was characterized as a 'Nobody Elected Elon' rally outside of the U.S. Treasury, ABC News reported. The group accused Musk of abuse of power. Musk was appointed a 'special government employee,' which subjects him to less stringent rules on ethics and financial disclosures than other workers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said that Musk is 'seizing power that belongs to the American people.' Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats, plan to introduce legislation that would block 'unlawful meddling' in the Treasury Department’s payment systems, ABC News reported. Texas Dem says he’ll bring articles of impeachment against Trump This week’s rally comes as DOGE took control of the finances of the U.S. Agency for International Aid, had employees locked out of their workplaces and accessed classified information, NewsNation reported this week. Meanwhile, federal lawmakers were told by a U.S. Treasury official that DOGE will only have 'read-only' authority over the government’s payment system. Two large unions representing current and retired government employees filed a lawsuit against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, saying DOGE broke privacy laws by entering the agency’s payment system, according to The Associated Press. Johnson told reporters that he expects more legal challenges to come over DOGE activity. Johnson called the nation’s $36 trillion debt load 'a serious threat' to the future and security of the nation and said that action needed to be taken. 'We’ve got to spend money better, and if this executive branch and this White House is going to take the initiative to dig in and expose it, we applaud it,' Johnson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-actions-overdue-speaker/	2025-02-05T14:23:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
What school programs remain even if Dept. of Education is gutted?	(NewsNation) —President Donald Trump is considering shuttering the Department of Education, but several federal school programs that are not under that department could remain after a potential gutting. The Education Department was established by Congress so it would also require an act of Congress to shut it down, but Trump is preparing to slash it to the full extent of his power, directing his administration to cut spending while pressuring employees to quit. But several school programs could remain intact even if the Education Department gets gutted. What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Head Start Head Start is an early education program that serves some of the nation’s neediest families and children and is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. Head Start serves the nation’s neediest families, offering preschool for children and support for their parents and caregivers, according to the agency. Many of the people it serves come from low-income households, are in foster care or are homeless. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 23: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters after signing a series of executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on January 23, 2025. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) While the program is not under the Education Department, Trump’s executive order to freeze federal grants has put it on hold. Administrators around the country last week discovered they were locked out of a government website used to access grant funding for Head Start. What does the Department of Education do? The website went back online for many operators. But a week later, 45 Head Start grant recipients across the country reported problems accessing their funding, said Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association. School Lunch Program The National School Lunch Program is a federally assisted meal program that is administered by the Department of Agriculture. The program provides 'nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children each school day,' according to the agency. It largely serves districts in high-poverty areas, allowing them to distribute meals at no cost to the students. The program served 4.7 billion lunches in 2023, and nearly 241 billion lunches since 1969, according to the UDSA. What does get cut with the Dept. of Education? The Department of Education administers funding for K-12 schools that is appropriated by Congress. The largest are the Title 1 program, which helps educate children from low-income families, and the IDEA program, which helps students with disabilities. Funding for both of those programs accounts for around $28 billion a year. While it’s a significant dollar amount, it only amounts to roughly 10% of funding. It’s not clear how schools would be expected to make up for the loss in funds if those funds were to be eliminated. The Education Department also provides oversight for schools, notably through the Office of Civil Rights, which investigates discrimination complaints filed against colleges and K-12 schools. It can also create federal rules, which have been used to protect minority populations. If the department is dismantled, it’s unclear how anti-discrimination policies would be made or enforced or if such policies would continue to exist. Student loans and grants for higher education are a big part of the department’s work and several aid programs could be eliminated. Currently, federal student loans are provided and serviced by the department. If the government decides to reduce or eliminate its role in lending for education, students who need help to afford college would have to rely on private lenders. Those who already have student loans would likely see a disruption in servicing as the loans would have to be transferred elsewhere, potentially to the Treasury Department. That would include payments for students who are currently enrolled. The Department of Education also provides oversight when it comes to for-profit colleges. That could enable for-profit schools to operate with less stringent standards, which could leave students with amounts of loan debt despite receiving an inadequate education.

Texas Dem says he’ll bring articles of impeachment against Trump ...	Texas Democratic Rep. Al Green said Wednesday he plans to bring articles of impeachment against President Trump after he suggested the U.S. should take over Gaza. 'The movement to impeach the president has begun,' Green said on the House floor. 'I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done.' Arab nations decry Trump proposal for US to take over Gaza On Tuesday, as Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he floated the idea of the U.S. taking over the Gaza Strip. He said Americans should be responsible for cleaning up and rebuilding the war-torn region, though he did not provide details about who would be able to live there. These are some of Trump’s most extreme comments on the matter and come after the start of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire last month. There are nearly 2 million Palestinians who hope to have their own state. Democrats, including Green, slammed the president for the remarks, calling the takeover idea 'ethnic cleansing' and likened it to throwing a match on an already volatile situation. 'Ethnic cleansing is not a joke, especially when it emanates from the president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, when he has the ability to perfect what he says, ethnic cleansing in Gaza is no joke, and the prime minister of Israel should be ashamed knowing the history of his people,' Green said. Green denounced Trump’s remarks and said he wanted to remind people that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was correct when he said 'injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' 'Injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America,' he said. Trump wants to take over Gaza. How would that work? Green was one of the lawmakers who initiated Trump’s first impeachment in 2017. He said Wednesday that he 'laid the foundation for impeachment' and will do it again. 'I know that it’s time for us to lay the foundation again. On some issues, it is better to stand alone than not stand at all,' he said. 'On this issue, I stand alone, but I stand for justice.' Protests against Trump, Project 2025 planned in cities across US Green called on the American people, noting that an impeachment movement must be a grassroots movement. 'The people have to demand it, and when the people demand it, it will be done,' he said. The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/texas-dem-al-green-gaza-articles-of-impeachment/	2025-02-05T12:51:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25003698518835-e1735932846136.jpg?w=900
Arab nations decry Trump proposal for US to take over Gaza	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested the U.S. 'take over' Gaza and handle cleanup, but Arab nations and their leaders in the region are rebuking the plan. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights' and said that what Trump wanted to do would be a 'serious violation of international law.' The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia says its commitment to a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering. What happens if the Department of Education is abolished? Abbas is meeting Wednesday with the king of Jordan. Trump said Jordan is one nation that could take in some Palestinians, but the country has said it does not support removing Gazans from the enclave. When questioned over whether the U.S. military would be involved in the 'takeover' of Gaza, Trump said: 'If it's necessary, we'll do that.' 'We're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs,' Trump said. At a press briefing Wednesday, though, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is not committed to having boots on the ground. 'His administration will work with partners in the region to reconstruct this region,' Leavitt said, adding that Trump will meet with the king of Jordan next week and that he already spoke with the king of Bahrain, crown prince of Saudi Arabia and president of Egypt. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? When asked whether Trump is prepared to remove Palestinians by force, Leavitt said Trump wants Gaza to be a place where all people can live. 'The president is prepared to rebuild Gaza for Palestinians and all people in the region,' Leavitt said. While Trump previously said Palestinians should be 'permanently' relocated out of Gaza, Leavitt said Wednesday the president is committed to rebuilding the region for all people who want to return to it 'once it is no longer a demolition site.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, says he supports Trump's proposal. Sources in Israel who spoke to NewsNation say Trump's announcement took them by surprise. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz. (Israeli Prime Minister's Office) It shocked world leaders as well. Asked in the House of Commons about Trump's remarks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes in Gaza. While Germany has been an ally of Israel, its Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement that the 'displacement of the Palestinian civilian population from Gaza would not just be unacceptable,' but also said it would go against international law. 'This would also lead to new suffering and new hatred,' Baerbock said.

Judge cements block on Trump’s order restricting birthright citiz...	GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge Wednesday furthered a block of President Trump’s executive order preventing the children of migrants without legal status from receiving birthright citizenship. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman at the conclusion of a hearing in Greenbelt said Trump’s order 'runs counter to our nation’s 250-year history of citizenship by birth' and likely violates an 1898 Supreme Court decision on the issue. 'The United States Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected the president’s interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment,' Boardman said. 'In fact, no court in the country has ever endorsed the president's interpretation. This court will not be the first.' A separate federal judge in Seattle previously put Trump’s executive order on hold. But that ruling will expire Thursday, when that judge will hold another hearing. Boardman’s ruling, unless overturned by an appeals court, will remain intact until she can issue a final ruling on the merits of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, which is likely to take months. Trump on his first day in office signed the executive order narrowing birthright citizenship so that it doesn’t extend to children born on U.S. soil to parents without permanent legal status, beginning with babies born Feb. 19. It is part of a flurry of immigration actions Trump has taken during his first few weeks in office. Eric Hamilton, deputy assistant attorney general for the civil division, insisted at the hearing that the Trump administration’s position aligned with the 1898 Supreme Court precedent central to the case, United States v. Wong Kim Ark. 'We have not taken a position that Wong Kim Ark is bad law. We think it is consistent with the rule that we have laid out for the Citizenship Clause,' Hamilton said. But Boardman rejected that notion and said a ruling blocking Trump’s order nationwide was necessary to protect the public interest. 'Today, virtually every baby born on U.S. soil is a citizen upon birth. That is the law and tradition of our country. That law and tradition will remain the status quo pending the resolution of this case,' said Boardman, an appointee of former President Biden. 'The government will not be harmed by a preliminary injunction that prevents it from enforcing an executive order likely to be found unconstitutional,' she added. Wednesday’s proceeding in Maryland is the first in a blitz of hearings set to take place across the country over the next week in most of the nine lawsuits challenging Trump’s birthright citizenship order. The case in Maryland was brought by two immigrant rights organizations and five anonymous expecting mothers without permanent legal status. The other cases involve 22 Democratic state attorneys general, the American Civil Liberties Union and Santa Clara County, Calif., among other groups. The challengers emphasize that the courts have only recognized few exceptions to the 14th Amendment’s birthright citizenship guarantee for all people born on U.S. soil: children of diplomats, people born on foreign ships, children of enemies in hostile occupation and Native American tribe members. 'Generations of children have grown up with that promise,' Joseph Mead, special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, which is representing the Maryland challengers, said at Wednesday’s hearing.

Army recruiting hits record highs after Trump's win	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The U.S. Army announced its record-breaking recruitment numbers, marking its most productive December in over a decade, with some crediting President Donald Trump for the boost. This marks a significant turnaround for the branch, which has faced challenges in recent years in recruiting enough young people and has implemented major changes to its recruitment programs. Officials now say December 2024 was their best December in 15 years, with nearly 350 soldiers enlisted every day that month. Army recruiters shared on X, 'Our recruiters have one of the toughest jobs – inspiring the next generation of #Soldiers to serve. Congratulations and keep up the great work!' USPS resumes accepting packages from China, Hong Kong In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, the Army met its recruiting goal of 55,000 and began to rebuild its delayed entry pool. About 24% of those recruits came out of the Future Soldier Prep Course. Army to add more training units The Army, hoping to ride this high, is set to significantly expand the number of recruits they can send to spring training. By April, the service reportedly expects to add 10 more training units, which could accommodate up to 9,600 new recruits annually. In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000. The following year, the service brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, widely missing its publicly stated 'stretch goal' of 65,000. In 2023, there were several initiatives to try and help lower-performing recruits — including adding courses like the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, to help them meet the military academic and physical standards to move on to basic training. Is the Trump administration taking credit for the change? Pete Hegseth, Trump's newly confirmed secretary of defense, touted the Army's recruitment numbers, writing on X, 'BOTTOM LINE: America's youth want to serve under the bold &amp; strong 'America First' leadership of @realDonaldTrump.' He also attributed the rise in recruitment to the new administration during his confirmation hearing. 'We’ve already seen it in recruiting numbers,' Hegseth said. 'There’s already been a surge since President Trump won the election.' Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the Associated Press last month that the Army is on track to meet its 2025 enlistment goals, expecting 81,000 new recruits. She said she expects the Future Soldier Prep Course will contribute about 30% of this year’s recruits. Here’s how the Pentagon could change under Hegseth Hegseth has promised to remove 'woke' programs from the military, referring to an over-emphasis on diversity. But Army leaders have stated that 'wokeness' hasn't played a role in the recruitment increase. According to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total in August 2024 before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers. NewsNation reached out to the Pentagon for comment on Hegseth's remarks, but they declined to provide any additional information at this time.

USPS restores accepting inbound packages from China, Hong Kong	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Postal Service reversed course Wednesday, announcing it will continue accepting inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong, a day after it suspended service from those regions. 'The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery,' the USPS wrote in a notice posted to its website. The USPS did not state a reason for the suspension in a brief announcement, but it came after President Donald Trump imposed an extra 10% tariff on all imports from China. CIA offering buyouts for its workforce The USPS announced Tuesday it would stop accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong 'until further notice.' Trump’s order to impose new taxes on Chinese goods coming into the United States ended duty-free handling of parcels, which had previously been considered 'de minimis' shipments. Trump recently threatened tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada, three countries that he said were not doing enough to crack down on the production and distribution of deadly fentanyl. The U.S. and the latter two countries reached border-security agreements to pause the tariffs. In retaliation, Chinese officials announced they were raising tariffs on certain U.S. goods coming into China.

ICE raids heighten fear among NYC street vendors	NEW YORK (NewsNation) — Nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations are unsettling some New Yorkers — and some street vendors, fearing arrest, are staying home. The sense of fear in the New York City community is palpable and visible. Following ICE raids across the area, fewer vendors are on the city's streets. It comes as the agency's 25 field offices were reportedly ordered to enhance 'routine operations' to meet a quota of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests per day. Since taking office, Trump has ordered other federal law enforcement agencies to assist with immigration efforts and scrapped restrictions at schools, churches and hospitals. ICE raids rattle NYC street vendors One of the first raids under the new administration targeted a fish wholesaler in Newark, New Jersey, and the most recent took place at the Bronx Terminal Market. ICE isn't just going after undocumented workers with criminal records; it's also detaining people who haven't committed crimes, including U.S. citizens and veterans. This has created widespread anxiety among restaurant owners and staff, many of whom view their teams as family and are now afraid that anyone could be swept up in a raid. USPS suspends acceptance of packages from China, Hong Kong Street vendors, the majority of whom are immigrants, are in an even tougher position. With a strict city cap on vending permits, many operate without the proper license, and if caught, they risk a criminal summons, which could put them directly in ICE's path. As a result, some vendors have stopped working altogether to avoid being detained or deported. Those who continue to work have reportedly started forming messaging groups to warn each other about ICE sightings and to offer mutual support. Advocates call for more vending permits Immigration advocates and nonprofits, such as the Street Vendor Project, are backing legislation that would expand the number of available street-vending permits and reduce criminal charges for minor violations so that selling food without a license won't lead to deportation. According to the Immigration Research Initiative, 75% of mobile food vendors are forced to work without a license because of the city’s cap. The Street Vendor Project is also pushing for a shift in enforcement responsibility from the New York Police Department to the New York City Department of Sanitation, which technically oversees street vending, in hopes of reducing the risk of ICE involvement.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/nyc-street-vendors-ice-raids/	2025-02-05T05:35:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2192861754-1.jpg?w=900
Protests against Trump, Project 2025 planned in cities across US	A movement to oppose the early actions of President Donald Trump’s administration is taking off online, with plans to protest across the U.S. on Wednesday. The movement has organized under the hashtags #buildtheresistance and #50501, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one day. Many of the protests are planned at state capitols, with some in other cities. The movement has websites and accounts across social media. Flyers circulating online decry Project 2025, a hard-right playbook for American government and society, and include messages such as 'reject fascism' and 'defend our democracy.' In a coffee shop just a block from Michigan’s Capitol, organizers of a planned action there Wednesday pushed together tables, spreading out poster boards to write messages that read 'No Deportations Ever!' and 'Workers Unite!' What has Project 2025 said since Trump’s win? Kelsey Brianne, a key organizer of Michigan’s rally, called it a 'real grassroots effort.' She learned about the movement Sunday night and has been coordinating speakers and safety protocols. 'I got involved because I knew that there was a need, and I knew what I could do,' Brianne said Tuesday. 'But also I want to look back at this time and say that I did something and I didn’t just sit back.' Trump has signed a series of executive orders in the first couple of weeks of his new term on everything from trade and immigration to climate change. As Democrats begin to raise their voice in opposition to Trump’s agenda, protests have also begun. On Sunday, thousands of people marched against Trump's plan for large-scale deportations in Southern California, including in downtown Los Angeles, where protests shut down a major freeway for hours.

Stephen A. Smith: Trump 'like a Realtor' on Gaza ownership	(NewsNation) — Stephen A. Smith said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's suggestion to 'own' the Gaza Strip is 'ridiculous.' Trump 'sounded like a real estate agent,' Smith said during an appearance on NewsNation's 'CUOMO.' 'We shouldn't be hearing about real estate opportunities out of the mouth of the president of the United States.' Smith believes Trump's statement will likely be dismissed: 'I think it's a dangerous proposition and not something that should be entertained.' Senate confirms Pam Bondi to lead Justice Department The president welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, making him the first head of state to visit the White House in Trump's second term. The pair of world leaders addressed the media following what Trump called 'fantastic talks,' echoing an earlier suggestion that the 1.8 million Palestinians currently living in Gaza should be permanently resettled. Trump said he sees the United States engaging in 'a long-term ownership' of Gaza, telling reporters that the idea has received 'tremendous praise.' Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark said Trump's ownership idea would require 'strategic consent' to work. 'There are so many details of this, but the basic concept is a wonderful concept,' Clark said on 'CUOMO.' 'If we could just bring peace to the region. If we could just rebuild Gaza, if the people would just stop wanting to kill each other.' The president did not clarify whether his resettlement idea means he does not support a two-state solution. Last year, Trump’s son-in-law said Israel should bulldoze an area of the Negev desert and move Palestinians there, The Guardian reported. Jared Kushner praised the 'very valuable' potential of Gaza’s 'waterfront property' and suggested Israel should remove civilians while it 'cleans up' the strip Trump suggests ‘all’ Palestinians permanently move out of Gaza Trump said that the Gaza Strip 'should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have … lived a miserable existence there,' referring to Palestinians. 'Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts' and 'build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza,' the president said. When asked how many Palestinians should be resettled in an earlier address Tuesday, Trump said, 'All of them.' Trump suggested building enclaves for Palestinian Gaza residents in neighboring countries. He did not suggest the same for Israeli residents. When asked where Palestinians will go, Trump did not specify any countries. Regarding Palestinians moving back to Gaza once it is rebuilt, Trump said he envisioned Gaza becoming an 'international, unbelievable place' that includes Palestinians, though he did not provide a timeline for their return. Trump warns ‘no guarantees’ fragile peace in Gaza will hold The president also said the United States will take over the Gaza Strip, taking responsibility for dismantling bombs and cleaning out the debris in the region, which has been reduced to rubble since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. When asked if U.S. troops would go to Gaza to secure the area, Trump said, 'We will do whatever is necessary.' Trump and Netanyahu also talked about the need to contain Iran and make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.

Trump wants to take over Gaza. How would that work?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Tuesday that the United States will 'take over' the war-torn Gaza Strip. The president said he sees the United States engaging in 'a long-term ownership' of Gaza, telling the media that the idea has received 'tremendous praise.' Trump said he envisions the United States taking responsibility for dismantling bombs and cleaning out the debris in the region, which has been reduced to rubble since the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Can Trump take over Gaza Strip? Although Trump said he wishes for the United States to own the sought-after small territory, it's unclear how the U.S. would gain control of Gaza. His administration's deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus acknowledged the lack of information, telling NewsNation 'we'll have a lot of clarity for you in the coming days.' Trump warns he left instructions to ‘obliterate’ Iran if he is assassinated Sen. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told NewsNation he believes that Trump isn't suggesting planting an American flag in Gaza, but rather opening up the region to American businesses. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the 47th president's potential business dealings in the strip shouldn't come as a shock, as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, pointed to the high value of Gaza's 'waterfront property' last year. Will Trump send US troops to Gaza? When asked if U.S. troops would go to Gaza to secure the area, Trump said, 'We will do whatever is necessary.' He did not specify whether they would engage with Hamas, if needed. Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark believes that, while it might make sense to evacuate Gaza as construction begins, there are myriad questions that we don't have the answers to quite yet. 'Is Hamas going to be in charge? Do they want the U.S. troops in? Are Gazans going to leave or evacuate part of it? Who's going to take care of them? Who's going to give them food and so forth?' Clark asked Tuesday on 'CUOMO.' 'What happens when the first sniper kills an American soldier?' he added. Clark pointed to the lack of answers — and potential U.S. involvement in a major Middle East conflict — as concerning on a national level. 'It's not impossible, but it's not something you just wave your hand and say, 'Yeah, we're taking over. It's going to work,'' Clark explained. 'It may not work because you have to have strategic consent, resources and all the accompaniment to make it work. That doesn't come out of a press conference.' Senate confirms Pam Bondi to lead Justice Department Trump suggests ‘all’ Palestinians permanently resettle from Gaza The suggestion comes just hours after Trump first floated the idea that all 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza should be resettled elsewhere. In a Tuesday news conference, he said the Gaza Strip 'should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have … lived a miserable existence there,' referring to Palestinians. Trump suggested building enclaves for Palestinian Gaza residents in neighboring countries. He did not suggest the same for Israeli residents. Trump’s idea to clear Gaza is a real estate grab: Congressman But where would they go? Ortagus told NewsNation that one potential location is Saudi Arabia, which she said has 'one of the best deradicalization programs' in the world. Regarding Palestinians moving back to Gaza once it is rebuilt, Trump said he envisioned Gaza becoming an 'international, unbelievable place' that includes Palestinians, though he did not provide a timeline for their return. Gaza Ceasefire Talks Delayed Trump's 'takeover' idea comes as Netanyahu delayed talks for the second phase of a permanent ceasefire, which were scheduled to begin Monday. President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas days before leaving office. Though it occurred during the Biden administration, Trump has said he deserves credit for making the deal happen. Netanyahu told reporters Tuesday he believes the 47th president provided 'powerful leadership' but did not say who deserved credit for the deal. Trump has not been confident about the long-term prospects for the truce. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters Monday.

Israel to be 'very tough' in ceasefire negotiations: Consul	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, with discussions including the ceasefire deal with Hamas and the broader security situation in the Middle East. Ofir Akunis, the consul general of Israel in New York, joined NewsNation to discuss the meeting and Trump's recent executive order that puts 'maximum pressure' on Iran. 'That's the right thing to do, to put Iran under pressure, to put Hamas under pressure, to put Hezbollah, to put the hoodies under pressure, and not to be naive and to think that if you will only negotiate with them, be nice with them, and reflect a weakness in front of them, something good will happen to the world,' Akunis said. Trump warns he left instructions to ‘obliterate’ Iran if he is assassinated Akunis said Iran poses a threat not just to Israel and other nations in the region but to the larger world, including the U.S. 'So they are, Iran, it's the heart of the 'Axis of Evil,' and they're using their proxies to attack the Western world,' he said. Akunis said Israel is committing to getting hostages back from Hamas. A ceasefire deal negotiated by the Biden administration set the stage for the return of hostages, followed by talks that would lead to a permanent ceasefire. That framework included Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Since taking office, Trump has suggested Palestinians should be 'cleaned out' of Gaza, leaving the area open for development. Akunis referred to negotiating with Hamas as negotiating with the devil and said the group must be driven out of Gaza. 'We must be very tough during the negotiations about the second phase,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/israel-tough-ceasefire-negotiations/	2025-02-04T14:15:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25030457994335.jpg?w=900
Congress puts hold on Trump's $1 billion arms sale to Israel	Congress has placed a hold on a $1 billion arms sale package for Israel that was readied alongside President Trump welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington on Tuesday. Two congressional aides told The Hill on Tuesday that a hold has been placed on the arms sale package. President Trump to host Israeli PM at the White House The four top lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have the power to individually block arms sales orders when over a certain dollar amount. Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to visit Trump since he returned to the White House, generally a recognition of the importance of the relationship. A hold on arms sales to Israel signals a major flouting of convention, where U.S. military support for Israel is viewed as an investment in American national security. The Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. officials, reported that the $1 billion arms sale package includes 4,700 1,000-pound bombs, worth more than $700 million, as well as armored bulldozers built by Caterpillar, worth more than $300 million. The hold comes as Democrats have seethed over Trump’s actions a little over two weeks into his presidency. They pushed back on an initial federal aid freeze; are condemning a halt on U.S. foreign assistance; raising alarm over the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and opposing the president’s threats of tariffs on America’s neighbors Mexico and Canada, to name a few of the high-profile conflicts. But there are few options for Democrats to push back on Trump’s agenda absent Republican allies, given the GOP's majorities in the House and Senate. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have announced they will delay and stall Trump’s State Department nominees until the administration retreats on its efforts to break up USAID. Trump could try to override the Israeli arms sale hold. In 2019, he issued an emergency declaration to push through more than $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval. The Republican-controlled Senate at the time voted to block the sale. Arms sales to Israel are historically bipartisan, even as Democrats have increasingly raised alarm over Israel’s war conduct in the Gaza Strip and Netanyahu’s policies toward Palestinians. Amid Israel’s war against Hamas in response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, an estimated half of the nearly 47,000 Palestinian casualties are women, children and the elderly. Nearly all of the 2 million Gaza residents require humanitarian assistance, and 90 percent are displaced among widespread destruction. Still, Democrats in positions of power did not stand in the way of President Biden sending weapons to Israel or green-lighting arms sales. In June, Biden moved forward on a $18 billion arms sale to Israel. Netanyahu will meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday and is expected to visit Capitol Hill and meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. The U.S. provides about $38 billion to Israel as part of a 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU). That amounts to $3.3 billion in foreign military financing — generally a credit for Israel to purchase weapons systems in the U.S., and $500 million for missile defense programs annually. The MOU runs through fiscal 2028 and will need to be renewed in 2029.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/israel-arms-sale-congress/	2025-02-04T13:37:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump-Israel_040524_PhotoSplit_AP.png?w=900
Trump: ‘All’ Palestinians should be permanently resettled elsewhe...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday, making him the first head of state to visit the White House in Trump's second term. The pair of world leaders addressed press on Tuesday. Trump said, regarding the Middle East's future, 'we have the right man, we have the right leader' in Netanyahu. 'I think we have a combination that is unbeatable,' he added. Trump said 'I don't think people should be going back to Gaza,' adding that 'if they had an alternative,' no one would want to return. When asked how many Palestinians should be resettled, Trump said 'all of them.' 'It's all death in Gaza,' Trump said, adding that an ideal path forward lies in getting 'a beautiful area to resettle people permanently.' Trump warns ‘no guarantees’ fragile peace in Gaza will hold Gaza Ceasefire Negotiations for the second phase of a permanent ceasefire were supposed to start Monday, but Netanyahu delayed talks until he personally met with Trump. President Joe Biden announced a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas days before leaving office. Though it occurred during the Biden administration, Trump has said he deserves credit for making the deal happen. Netanyahu told reporters on Tuesday he believes the 47th president provided 'powerful leadership,' but did not say who deserved credit for the deal. Trump has not been confident about the long-term prospects for the truce. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters on Monday. The deal includes multiple phases. Phase one will include the release of 33 Israeli hostages, including all women, children and men over 50 years old. Under the deal, a permanent ceasefire would come with both sides agreeing on who will be in power when the fighting ends. Many families of the hostages who were taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 are concerned that the ceasefire deal could fall apart over contention about Gaza’s new leadership. Both Netanyahu and Trump say Hamas cannot remain in power. Hamas frees 4 female Israeli soldiers in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners as ceasefire holds Another tenant of that ceasefire deal is the total withdrawal of Israeli troops, which Netanyahu has been staunchly against. That leaves much to be hammered out before the deal can reach phase two. Netanyahu has already held meetings with national security adviser Michael Waltz and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle Eastern envoy. Trump is scheduled to meet one-on-one with Netanyahu before more meetings with both of their extended cabinet members. The two are expected to keep the focus on keeping the ceasefires intact in both Lebanon and Gaza.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-host-israeli-pm-white-house/	2025-02-04T12:54:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a1b79ba1e1d6.92732274.jpeg?w=900
Cartel war escalates, creates new threat at southern border	(NewsNation) — A violent new threat has emerged at the southern border as cartels weaponize drones as bombs to attack rival cartels. Border agents are also under threat, with many at the border feeling unsettled by current events as cartels enter desperation mode. They are a $13 billion-a-year industry smuggling people into the country, but their efforts are being stifled by President Donald Trump's border security. White House begins migrant flights to Guantánamo Bay NewsNation obtained video of these weaponized cartel drones dropping a bomb on what is believed to be a rival cartel. NewsNation believes this to be a cartel-on-cartel crime about four hours south of the Rio Grande Valley in Mexico. Border agents tell NewsNation they have always faced threats from Mexico, but the violence is escalating with these bomb-wielding drones, and the agency is taking it seriously enough to prompt warnings about them. US Coast Guard stops ocean smuggling operations off San Diego A memo went out agencywide among U.S. Customs Border and Patrol following NewsNation's reporting on the drones. Texas Department of Public Safety Lieutenant Chris Olivarez told Blake Burman on 'The Hill' that this latest warning shows what these criminal organizations have access to. Border agents tell NewsNation they need military assistance to be a force against Mexico and cartel members.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartel-war-new-threat-southern-border/	2025-02-04T12:04:27-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2194759987.jpg?w=900
Senate panel advances Tulsi Gabbard nomination for DNI	The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday advanced Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to become the next director of national intelligence (DNI), putting her in position to get confirmed by the full chamber after key senators threw their support behind her. The 9-8 vote was along party lines. It puts Gabbard only days away from being considered on the Senate floor after a roller-coaster process. 'The Intelligence Committee just voted for Tulsi Gabbard's nomination to be the Director of National Intelligence favorably to the full United States Senate,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told reporters after the closed-door vote. 'We look forward to her confirmation and working with her to keep America safe,' he added. The vote took place only hours after Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), a key GOP swing vote, announced that he would support her. During Thursday’s confirmation hearing, the Indiana Republican was visibly frustrated after Gabbard refused to call Edward Snowden, the former contractor-turned-leaker who fled the U.S., a traitor on multiple occasions. But on Tuesday Young said he secured a number of commitments from Gabbard regarding deterring Snowden-like whistleblowers, not pardoning Snowden and working to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 'I appreciate Tulsi Gabbard’s engagement with me on a variety of issues to ensure that our intelligence professionals will be supported and policymakers will receive unbiased information under her leadership,' Young posted on the social platform X alongside a letter Gabbard sent him of commitments in order to win his vote. 'I have done what the Framers envisioned for senators to do: use the consultative process to seek firm commitments, in this case commitments that will advance our national security, which is my top priority as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer,' he continued. 'Having now secured these commitments, I will support Tulsi’s nomination and look forward to working with her to protect our national security.' Gabbard had secured another big win on Monday as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that she would back her in the committee vote. Collins and Young had been seen as pivotal votes in committee, and winning over the pair likely also greases the skids for the former congresswoman on the Senate floor, where she can only afford to lose three Republicans. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is considered a likely 'no' vote, while Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) indicated following the hearing that he had more 'questions' about her confirmation. From the moment Trump announced Gabbard as his nominee to be DNI, questions have cropped up about her past views and statements. Those include her 2017 meeting with then-Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, which occurred as he was accused of using chemical weapons on his own people, as well as her stance on Russia given multiple comments she made about the war with Ukraine that were considered sympathetic to Moscow and were echoed on Russian state TV. Gabbard also faced numerous questions over her past defense of Snowden. A key moment during Gabbard’s hearing came when Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) asked whether she views Snowden as a 'traitor,' advising her that members of the Intelligence panel would feel a lot better about her nomination if she would do so. Instead, Gabbard sidestepped two questions about whether Snowden betrayed the nation, telling lawmakers she is 'focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again,' referring to Snowden’s theft of secret documents. Lankford said it should have been an 'easy question' to say it’s 'universally accepted when you steal a million pages of top-secret documents and you hand it to the Russians, that’s a traitorous act.' Privately, Gabbard had sought to assuage senators about her views on Snowden, saying she didn’t feel he had the proper channels to blow the whistle. The Gabbard move also comes about a week and a half after senators confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who lost three votes on the floor but got the greenlight thanks to a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Vance.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-panel-advances-tulsi-gabbard-nomination-for-dni/	2025-02-04T11:38:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/IMG_5427.jpeg?w=900
Trump oil tariffs expected to raise price at the pump	(The Hill) - President Trump’s tariff on Canadian oil is expected to raise prices at the pump for U.S. consumers, if it takes effect as planned after a 30-day delay. Analysts told The Hill that the 10 percent tariff set to be imposed under an executive order Trump signed over the weekend would lead to a pricing bump, though it ​would not be evenly distributed. According to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, consumers in the Midwest, Rockies and New England would see the greatest impacts. What is a sovereign wealth fund, and which countries have them? 'New England relies on refined products from Canada,' said De Haan, referring to products like gasoline that are processed at Canadian refineries. 'Refineries in the Midwest, Great Lakes and Rockies rely more on the Canadian crude oil for sourcing oil for their refineries,' he added. Ultimately, De Haan said, drivers in New England could see gasoline prices rise by 15 cents to 25 cents per gallon. In the Midwest, Rockies and Great Lakes, he predicted a hike of between 5 cents and 20 cents per gallon. He noted that people in New England could also see a price bump for home heating oil of 20 cents to 30 cents per gallon. Trump is planning to institute the tariff on Canadian oil and a larger 25 percent tariff on other goods from America’s northern neighbor. However, he announced Monday evening that the tariffs, which would have taken effect at midnight, will be paused for 30 days to see whether the U.S. and Canada can reach a ' final Economic deal.' He said that in the meantime, Canada has agreed to secure the U.S.-Canada border and try to prevent fentanyl from entering the U.S. Canada is the top supplier of U.S. oil imports, providing 60 percent of the nation’s crude oil imports last year. As of Monday, the average U.S. gasoline price stood at $3.01 per gallon. Oil produced domestically or from other countries couldn't simply be substituted for those imports because refineries in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains are currently set up to receive Canadian oil via pipeline. What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them? 'Canadian crude and the Midwest refinery system were made for each other. Neither one of them really has substitutes or somewhere else to go,' said Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’s energy security and climate change program. 'Our refineries need heavy oil to go with light oil that we mostly produce here at home,' he said. The refineries in question are set up to process the thicker 'heavy' oil — which can be sourced from Canadian oil sands. Seigle gave a more conservative estimate for impacts to the Midwest, a rise of between 7 cents and 15 cents per gallon in what he predicts will be the hardest-hit region. Here are some goods in the crosshairs of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China De Haan said it would be very difficult and expensive to rejigger existing infrastructure to suit the tariffs. 'It's like saying, can existing highway, you know, suddenly move and shift?' he said. De Haan warned that the energy tariffs could also have broader reaching impacts on the economy. '25 percent tariffs to your No. 1 trading partner, yeah, they could sink the economy,' he said. 'It could absolutely undermine the U.S. and Canadian economies at the same time.' Ironically, fuel prices could go back down in the case of an economic slump, as people will want to travel less and buy fewer items. 'Tariffs on gasoline could be offset … if we start to see a recession or a slowdown,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/trump-oil-tariffs-gas-prices/	2025-02-04T10:57:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Gas-prices_020425_AP_Jenny-Kane-e1738667433611.jpg?w=900
Federal employees accepting buyouts 'rapidly growing'	(NewsNation) — The number of federal employees who have agreed to accept buyouts to leave their jobs is 'rapidly growing,' and officials with the Office of Personnel Management expect that number to spike significantly as this week's deadline for a final decision approaches, NewsNation has learned. The Trump administration announced last week that employees who leave their jobs by a Feb. 6 deadline would receive eight months of salary. A spokesperson for OPM told NewsNation that the agency expects to see the largest surge in the number of workers accepting the buyout within 24 to 48 hours before the Thursday deadline. Trump to issue executive order relating to ICC sanctions Bloomberg reported Tuesday that 20,000 employees, which represent about 1% of the federal workforce, have signed up for the deferred resignations. Although the number is growing each day, the OPM spokesperson told NewsNation that the 20,000 figure is not up to date and that the agency expects the largest spike of resignations to come in the next two days. The buyout is being offered in an effort to shrink the government. The report indicated that President Donald Trump and billionaire CEO Elon Musk, who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), hope that as much as 10% of the federal workforce accepts the buyout. There are currently 2.3 million civilian federal employees, the report indicated. However, more than half of those employees who hold roles in civilian defense and intelligence employees, as well as law enforcement personnel and postal workers, are not eligible for the buyout, the Bloomberg report indicated. The report indicated that the federal buyout is different than those seen in the private sector. Workers who leave their jobs are free to take other jobs as long as they do not conflict with their current federal employees. They are also not permitted to sue the government over the deferred resignation. The federal government employed more than 3 million people as of November last year, which accounted for nearly 1.9% of the nation’s entire civilian workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. The average tenure for a federal employee is nearly 12 years, according to a Pew analysis of data from OPM.

DOGE employees identified, prosecution possible: US Attorney	(NewsNation) — After Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees were identified on X, those responsible could be prosecuted. Edward R. Martin Jr., U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, issued a statement Monday saying that he had evidence people 'committed acts that appear to violate the law in targeting' employees of DOGE. The statement added: 'We are in contact with FBI and other law-enforcement partners to proceed rapidly. We also have our prosecutors preparing.' Trump to issue executive order relating to ICC sanctions On Monday, Elon Musk quote tweeted screenshots of Reddit posts that fitted the description of Martin's statement, saying 'They have broken the law.' Musk also reposted a tweet reporting threats against the DOGE team on Tuesday, adding: 'Threatening or encouraging murder is a crime. Those who do so will go to prison.' It followed a public letter Martin wrote to Musk on Monday morning, where he insisted, 'We must keep all our American government employees safe,' offering his and his staff's services to protect those employees by pursuing legal action where necessary.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-employees-id-prosecution-possible/	2025-02-04T10:21:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2188387811.jpg?w=900
NTSB gives update on investigation into DC plane crash	(NewsNation) — The National Transportation Safety Board is giving an update on the investigation into a collision between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people last week. The crash happened after a Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers collided with an American Airlines plane that was approaching a landing at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. Those on board the plane included members of the U.S. and Russian figure skating communities. Of those on board, 55 have been positively identified so far. Crews began pulling wreckage from the Potomac River on Monday and began work to recover and identify additional victims. What is a sovereign wealth fund, and which countries have them? The cause of the crash is under investigation, with officials discouraging speculation even as President Donald Trump publicly blamed diversity, equity and inclusion efforts for the crash despite there being no evidence that DEI played any role. It's believed FAA staffing in the air traffic control tower was lower than ideal, and there is conflicting information about the helicopter's altitude before the crash. The crew did have night-vision goggles on board, but it is not known if they were wearing them at the time. Questions have also been raised about an increase in traffic into Reagan Airport even as the FAA has struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers. There have also been questions about why a helicopter was being allowed to operate in such close proximity to passenger planes. The FAA instituted temporary airspace restrictions around the airport following the crash. It is not clear how long they will remain in place.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ntsb-update-investigation-dc-crash/	2025-02-04T07:46:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196783522.jpg?w=900
Trump to issue executive order relating to ICC sanctions	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will issue an executive order on Tuesday relating to International Criminal Court (ICC) sanctions, a White House official told NewsNation. Trump is set to sign multiple executive orders today. The ICC has been bracing for these measures and reportedly paid salaries three months in advance to shield some of its staff. China counters with tariffs on US products Last month, the House of Representatives voted to punish the court for issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister regarding the war in Gaza. The move could have some tie to the Israeli prime minister visiting the White House later today. Netanyahu and Trump are set to discuss phase two of the ceasefire today, with Netanyahu saying Tuesday, 'The most important thing to President Trump is to get our hostages’ home.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-executive-order-icc-sanctions/	2025-02-04T06:35:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072294.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. faces first vote for Health and Human Services secretary	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The Senate Finance Committee will vote Tuesday on whether to send Robert F. Kennedy's nomination for secretary of Health and Human Services to the floor. Kennedy's confirmation faces uncertainty. Key senators to watch include U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a doctor who pressed Kennedy over his views on vaccines during confirmation hearings last week. In the hearings, Cassidy repeatedly asked Kennedy whether he would 'reassure mothers unequivocally and without qualification' that the measles and hepatitis B vaccines do not cause autism. Kennedy did not directly answer the question and instead replied, 'If the data is there, I will absolutely do that.' What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? Multiple studies by health organizations and medical experts have debunked claims about a connection between autism and vaccines. Cassidy told Kennedy his past remarks 'undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments' concerns him. On Monday evening, Cassidy said he had 'very cordial' conversations with Kennedy over the weekend but was 'still working through' the vote. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are also seen as potential 'no' votes because they voted against President Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. While Kennedy has sparked concerns about his record of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines, he has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, asserting he is not anti-vaccine and promising not to 'take away' shots if confirmed. Kennedy needs support from all but three Republicans if Democrats oppose him.

China counters with tariffs on US products	BEIJING (AP) — China countered President Donald Trump's across-the-board tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs on select U.S. imports Tuesday, as well as announcing an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures. U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday before Trump agreed to a 30-day pause as the two countries acted to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trump planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days. The Chinese response was 'measured,' said John Gong, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. 'I don’t think they want the trade war escalating,' he said. 'And they see this example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.' US businesses brace for Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to drive up costs This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind. This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter, with the government announcing a slew of measures that cut across different sectors of the economy, from energy to individual U.S. companies. Counter tariffs China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday. 'The U.S.’s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,' the State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement. 'It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.' China vows ‘countermeasures’ in response to Trump tariffs The impact on U.S. exports may be limited. Though the U.S. is the biggest exporter of liquid natural gas globally, it does not export much to China. In 2023, the U.S. exported 173,247 million cubic feet of LNG to China, representing about 2.3% of total natural gas exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. China imported only about 700,000 cars overall last year, and the leading importers are from Europe and Japan, said Bill Russo, the founder of the Automobility Limited consultancy in Shanghai. Further export controls on critical minerals China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they are essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption. The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium. 'They have a much more developed export control regime,' Philip Luck, an economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former State Department official, said at a panel discussion on Monday. 'We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others,' he said. 'So … they could put some significant harm on our economy.' US companies also impacted In addition, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement did not mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Trump’s 10% tariffs on China were to take effect. It is unclear how the probe will affect Google’s operations. The company has long faced complaints from Chinese smartphone makers over its business practices surrounding the Android operating system, Gong said. Otherwise, Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company. Google did not immediately comment. What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them? The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an unreliable entities list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, which is a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing could bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over 'improper Xinjiang-related behavior' after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton. The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute. However, the world is braced for further impact. 'A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,' Dover said. Wu reported from Bangkok.

Trump warns 'no guarantees' fragile peace in Gaza will hold	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end. Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters on Monday. The leaders' talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal and concerns about Iran's nuclear program, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda. Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next Netanyahu's arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump's second term comes as the prime minister's popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a 'witch hunt.' Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu’s standing. It's Netanyahu's first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defense minister and Hamas’ slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority over its citizens or territory. Netanyahu and Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu said in statement that the meeting with Witkoff and U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Waltz was 'positive and friendly.' The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel’s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week. Aid is surging into Gaza under the ceasefire. Is it helping? Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu’s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn’t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections. Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces’ full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may 'have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.' 'The president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That's what he got,' Resnick said. 'He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.' Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement. Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages — including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers — are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Should Trump or Biden get credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire? 'I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,' said Zangauker, who traveled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. 'We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.' Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza. Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu's desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. 'This push by Trump doesn’t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,' Telhami said. 'It's hard to see the Saudis going along with it.' Netanyahu on Monday met with Trump’s pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel. The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran's air defenses. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran's nuclear program. 'This is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,' said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. 'What’s at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.' Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

It's wide open': Journalist details US-Canada border concerns	(NewsNation) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday agreed to border security measures with President Donald Trump in exchange for a 30-day pause on sweeping tariffs. Canada will spend $1.3 billion to reinforce the U.S.-Canadian border with new helicopters, technology and personnel to target fentanyl trafficking and other crimes. The Canadian border, including what and who crosses it, is a problemover which journalist and 'No BS Newshour' host Charlie LeDuff has long raised red flags. 'I own it. You called me months ago saying you need to talk about what's happening up there,' NewsNation's Chris Cuomo said Monday, imploring LeDuff to share what he's learned in his investigation. Rubio says El Salvador offers to accept deportees from US of any nationality, including Americans LeDuff warned the U.S.-Canada border poses a threat to national security, one that is often overlooked due to the louder calls for change at the southern border. 'Canada and United States have a 5,500 mile border,' LeDuff said on 'CUOMO.' 'The Mexican border's 2,000 miles. In Mexico, on that border, 10 times the Border Patrol agents' as in the north. LeDuff told NewsNation that, in the last four years, around 500 people on the terror watch list crossed into the U.S. from the Mexico border. Those crossing from Canada totaled nearly 1,000, he said. 'It's not a good deal up there, man,' he said. 'It's wide open.' Trump’s tariff delay is ‘opportunity’ for Mexico: Ex-DEA chief LeDuff couldn't speak to Canada's fentanyl flow for certain, telling NewsNation that the border's porosity lends itself to unclear numbers. 'As you saw today, Trudeau bent. When you're throwing $1.5 billion for a fentanyl czar, you know something's up,' he said. Cartels make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona. Fentanyl can also be made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but apparently that's happening to a much lesser extent. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds (19.5 kilograms) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds (9,570 kilograms) at the Mexican border.

What is a sovereign wealth fund, and which countries have them?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. to start developing an American sovereign wealth fund and said it could be used to profit from TikTok. Trump's new order begins the process of creating a sovereign wealth fund, which is aimed at generating more money for the government by investing in assets like stocks, bonds and real estate. 'We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters Monday. Specific details were scarce, but Trump suggested the fund could be a way for the U.S. to buy the social media platform TikTok. Here's what to know about sovereign wealth funds and why Trump wants one. Trump orders creation of US sovereign wealth fund, says it could own part of TikTok What is a sovereign wealth fund? Sovereign wealth funds, SWFs, are investment vehicles owned by countries. Typically, they're set up to manage state-owned assets, according to the Center for Global Development (CGD), a Washington-based think tank. Different SWFs have different financial, economic and political objectives. Some function like a savings fund — nest eggs where current money gets invested for future generations. Those funds have decadeslong investment horizons and are often set up by commodity-rich countries to save a portion of their resource wealth for later on, according to The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. Other sovereign wealth funds are intended as stabilization funds, which governments can draw on to smooth the budget. Many funds have multiple objectives, mixing stabilization, savings and development. Trump didn't offer many details on the fund's strategic focus or where the money to start it would come from. Sovereign wealth funds typically start with a wealth surplus, but given the United States budget track record, relying on hypothetical future surpluses is unrealistic, experts at the CGD wrote in a recent report. What does it mean for TikTok? Trump said TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, was an example of what he could put in a new U.S. sovereign wealth fund. 'We might put that in the sovereign wealth fund, whatever we make, or we do a partnership with very wealthy people, a lot of options,' he said of TikTok. 'But we could put that as an example in the fund. We have a lot of other things that we could put in the fund.' As one of his first acts in office, Trump directed his Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April. The president has said he's looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of the popular social media platform. In theory, a sovereign wealth fund is one way the U.S. could acquire a stake in the company without nationalizing it. Trump’s executive order gives TikTok a reprieve. What happens next? Which countries have sovereign wealth funds? There are over 90 sovereign wealth funds around the world that manage over $8 trillion in assets, according to The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. Norway's $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund is the largest. The fund invests revenues from the nation's oil and gas production and is one of the world's largest investors, owning on average 1.5% of all stocks listed worldwide, according to Reuters. The Norwegian fund's current value corresponds to about $321,000 for every man, woman and child living in the country of 5.6 million people. Other countries with major sovereign wealth funds include China, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Trump predicted that the U.S. could eventually top Saudi Arabia’s fund size. 'Eventually, we’ll catch it,' he promised in the Oval Office on Monday. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, added: 'The extraordinary size and scale of the U.S government and the business it does with companies should create value for American citizens.' Which US states have sovereign wealth funds? The U.S. already has 21 sovereign wealth funds at the state level, according to the CGD. The largest ones are based in Alaska, New Mexico and Texas and are funded through the proceeds of oil, gas and mineral revenue. Those funds are primarily used to pay for in-state programs like education and state government operations, CGD said.

U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports paused with border security deal...	(NewsNation) — An impending trade war between Canada and the United States has been temporarily averted, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday after his country agreed to border-security measures with the United States. Trudeau and President Trump talked by phone at 3 p.m. Eastern time, and afterward Trudeau said Canada will spend $1.3 billion to reinforce the U.S.-Canadian border with new helicopters, technology and personnel to target fentanyl trafficking, among several measures. 'In addition, Canada is making new commitments to appoint a Fentanyl Czar, we will list cartels as terrorists, ensure 24/7 eyes on the border, launch a Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering,' Trudeau said on X. 'I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl and we will be backing it with $200 million.' The news of the agreement came hours after Mexico agreed to a similar plan to appease the Trump administration on border security to stave off threatened U.S. tariffs on imports. As with Mexico, the U.S.-Canada truce is good for 30 days. Canada had begun preparing a host of retaliatory tariffs of its own on U.S. imports, to counter the 25% tariffs Trump had threatened on many of its goods entering the United States (Canadian oil would have been subjected to smaller, 10% tariffs). Trump announces pause on Mexico tariffs after striking deal More than 60% of Canada's production is exported to the U.S., and 60% of the oil that the US imports comes from Canada, which could have meant higher prices at the pump, 30 to possibly 70 cents a gallon. Trump has been very clear that he intends to continue to use his strategy of tariffs to try and broker the kind of deals that he's looking for on some of these issues, particularly immigration. The White House is confident in that strategy because 77% of exports from Mexico go to the United States. For Canada, 75% of its exports come to the U.S. The U.S. relies on the Mexican and Canadian markets but to a much lower percentage (Mexico, 11% and Canada, 12%). Nevertheless, the President has acknowledged that there could be some pain that some consumers would be feeling if these tariffs do come to fruition. The Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs, if implemented on paper as they are right now, would shrink economic output by 0.4% and increase taxes by $1.2 trillion from 2025 to 2034 which would come to about $830 in taxes per US household in 2025. Canadian provinces ban US alcohol in retaliation for tariffs Following Trump's criticism of the European Union and the threat of tariffs against the body, European leaders have rebuked it and called for unity. 'I think that we have to do everything to avoid this totally unnecessary and stupid tariff wars or trade wars,' Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters on Monday. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said: 'First of all, we have to should stay united. No matter (if we are) talking about economic tariffs, we are talking about Greenland or other issues, we have to stay united.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-speaking-trudeau-canada-tariffs/	2025-02-03T12:31:36-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676e04041219b3.84887230.jpeg?w=900
Elon Musk-led DOGE effectively shuts down USAID	(NewsNation) —President Trump’s new DOGE task force is causing major shakeups within the federal government with the Elon Musk-run agency having effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development. The future of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) continues to remain uncertain as the Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has taken control of the agency's money, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership. Tech billionaire Elon Musk who runs DOGE announced that President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency down. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? 'USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die,' Musk posted to the social platform X, which he owns. USAID is in charge of administering U.S. humanitarian aid around the world. The agency employs around 10,000 people and has an annual budget of around $30 billion. Staffers of the agency were instructed to stay out of the agency’s Washington headquarters, and yellow police tape and officers blocked the agency’s lobby on Monday. USAID workers also said more than 600 additional employees had reported being locked out of the aid agency’s computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that 'at the direction of Agency leadership' the headquarters building 'will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.' Two top security chiefs at USAID were put on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk’s government inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. The major move has ruffled several feathers with Democratic lawmakers calling the DOGE takeover a major national security mistake. They stressed that aid from the agency is not charity but international money that goes to countries that the U.S. considers allies. The aid also provides a bulwark in defense of adversaries, they added. But Republicans say only about 10 to 20% of all USAID money goes to work on the ground, adding that much of the budget is inflated. What is USAID? Explaining the US foreign aid agency and why Trump and Musk want to end it Legal challenges to DOGE’s shutdown are likely as many Democrats contend that it's illegal for the president or anyone else to unilaterally shut down a government agency without congressional approval. Congress controls federal money and budgets. DOGE has become an x-factor in the federal government in the short time of its existence. The task force also obtained unrestricted access to the Treasury Department's highly sensitive payment systems, which pays out tax refunds, government contracts and Social Security and Medicare benefits.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-doge-shuts-down-usaid/	2025-02-03T12:11:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25031110042232.jpg?w=900
What is DOGE, and what’s it doing?	(NewsNation) — The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) created under President Donald Trump has reportedly gained access to sensitive and classified data, leading to questions surrounding what the nongovernment task force can and will do. What is DOGE? Under an executive order, Trump created a nongovernment agency called DOGE that he said would 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. On his first day, Trump renamed the 'U.S. Digital Service' as the 'U.S. DOGE Service.' It further directed that DOGE be established within the Executive Office of the President. What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it down? Making the new entity part of the government could allow it to more easily access information across agencies. It can also potentially do much of its work behind closed doors, even as some regulations on governmental disclosure will persist. Trump originally tapped tech billionaire Elon Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead DOGE after his reelection last year. Since then, Ramaswamy left DOGE. What is Elon Musk's role in DOGE? Musk is the sole head of DOGE after Ramaswamy, who is planning to run for Ohio governor in two years, left. The new administration hasn’t yet said if Musk will formally join the government as part of his work on DOGE. Musk had pledged to cut $2 trillion in government spending and restructure federal agencies with 'mass headcount reductions across the federal bureaucracy.' The idea for DOGE also appeared to have come from Musk, who discussed the need for a 'government efficiency commission' while campaigning alongside Trump. USAID leaders escorted out of building after blocking DOGE access to secure systems While it’s not completely clear what Musk has in store for DOGE, he has provided some clues. 'Incentives matter. There should be rewards for wise spending, but those who waste taxpayer funds cannot be allowed to keep doing so without consequences,' Musk posted on X of DOGE in November, hinting that cuts will be imminent under his guidance.

(Brandon Bell/Pool via AP, File) What are the limits of DOGE? Because DOGE is not an actual government agency, its power will be limited. While it can make recommendations on budget cuts, it can’t actually do that without congressional approval. 'They don’t have any authorities,' Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who’s president of the American Action Forum, told Politico. 'On my most cynical days, I think they’re just a think tank, and I run a think tank. I know how little power I have.' While Trump may be eager to carry out DOGE’s agenda, he will also need to work through Congress on the budgets as it makes decisions on federal funds. Elon Musk’s DOGE sued as Trump takes office: Report 'Because of DOGE’s inability to implement policy on its own, the leaders’ plan relies heavily on the president-elect who invited them to serve,' reported The Atlantic. However, Trump’s pick to run the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, has argued that Trump has the power of impoundment, the authority to refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress. The impoundment argument will likely be challenged in court, the outlet writes, but if the courts rule in Trump’s favor, DOGE may get the power it seeks. What has DOGE done so far? DOGE has already gained access to sensitive data from at least two government agencies. The task force got access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems, on Friday, The Associated Press reported. The news came after Treasury acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk resigned his position after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data. Musk on Saturday responded to a post on his social media platform X about the departure of Lebryk: 'The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.' He did not provide proof of this claim.

DOGE has also gained access to classified information with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Two top security chiefs at USAID are on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk’s government inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. DOGE eventually gained access Saturday to the aid agency’s classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk’s DOGE crew lacked high enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials — John Voorhees and deputy Brian McGill — believed themselves legally obligated to deny access. Lawsuits DOGE is facing DOGE was slapped with several lawsuits on Trump’s first day in office from groups saying the new nongovernment entity must abide by the same transparency as federal agencies. The suits were brought by progressive consumer watchdog Public Citizen, the American Public Health Association and National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm. The groups argue that DOGE should be considered a federal advisory committee, which falls under regulations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. DOGE faces early bumps with lawsuits and leadership shake-up The plaintiffs all argue that DOGE is covered by FACA, which mandates that federal advisory committees meet transparency requirements, such as having a charter, fairly balanced membership and a designated federal officer to call meetings. 'The suit challenges DOGE’s operating without complying with federal transparency laws,' the groups said in a statement. 'DOGE’s stacked membership, far from being fairly balanced, reveals that only one viewpoint is represented: that of ‘small-government crusaders’ with backgrounds in either the tech industry or Republican politics. This shortcoming renders DOGE’s membership imbalanced and unfit for the function it has been directed to perform,' the National Security Counselors’ lawsuit states.

Crews begin work to recover wreckage from DC plane crash	(NewsNation) — Following a plane crash in Washington, D.C., last week, divers and salvage workers are planning to remove the wreckage and recover the remaining bodies from the Potomac River. The mid-air collision between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter left 67 people dead. Authorities have identified 55 of the people who have been killed so far. There are 12 victims still left in the river, though officials have said they are confident they will be able to recover remains from all those who were killed in the crash. Black box recovered in Philadelphia medical transport jet crash: NTSB Salvage crews are preparing to lift the fuselage of the plane out of the water, which is where they believe the remaining 12 victims are located. Divers have not been able to recover the bodies with the wreckage still in the water. An investigation into the crash is ongoing, with many questions remaining about the cause of the crash, including why helicopters were allowed to fly in the same space where planes were landing. The FAA has put a no-fly zone around the Reagan National Airport, but it's not clear how long it will last. Trump announces pause on Mexico tariffs after striking deal Data from the crash shows conflicting altitude readings regarding how high the helicopter was flying. Information from the black box shows the Black Hawk helicopter at 325 feet, while readings from the control tower showed 200 feet. The pilots of the helicopter did have night vision goggles, but it's not clear if they were wearing them at the time of the crash.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/crews-work-recover-wreckage/	2025-02-03T10:05:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196783525.jpg?w=900
What are tariffs, and why does Trump want them?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is following through on his campaign promise to impose tariffs on America's top trading partners — a decision that could come at a high cost to U.S. consumers. Trump said Friday he would place a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% additional tariff on all imports from China. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower, 10% tariff. The president wrote on Truth Social that the tariffs are meant to end 'the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA' with regard to 'TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS.' The tariffs against Mexico have since been paused after Trump said he struck a deal with President Claudia Sheinbaum to supply 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border. What does the US import from Mexico, China and Canada? Nevertheless, Trump has acknowledged American consumers could bear some of the cost from the tariffs. 'We may have short-term, a little pain, and people understand that,' Trump told reporters on Sunday. Here's what to know about tariffs and how they could impact your wallet: What are tariffs, and how do they work? Tariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries. They are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. So, a 25% tariff on a $4 good shipped from Canada or Mexico would face an additional $1 charge. When companies import goods from abroad, they pay the tariffs to the U.S. government. However, economists warn those costs eventually get passed on to American consumers through higher prices. Who pays for tariffs? Companies — importers — pay tariffs on goods from abroad, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. If that sounds counterproductive, many economists argue that it is. When companies face higher costs, consumers usually end up footing the bill. For example, Trump imposed a tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018. Researchers estimate the price of washing machines increased by around 12%, about $86 per unit. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates Trump’s tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power. What executive orders has President Donald Trump signed? Even Trump has acknowledged Americans could feel 'some pain' from the emerging trade war. 'WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.' While companies pay tariffs, they can indeed hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies could cut prices to offset the tariffs to maintain their market share in the U.S. Why does Trump want tariffs? Trump argues tariffs are a way for the U.S. to strike back against foreign countries he sees as ripping off America in terms of 'TRADE, CRIME AND POISONOUS DRUGS.' The president defended his tariffs on Canada in a social media post on Sunday: 'We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true!' Trump went on to say Canada should become our 'Cherished 51st State.' Canada is the largest source of U.S. energy imports, and, last year, 60% of U.S. crude oil imports came from America's northern neighbor, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Subscribe Now Breaking News Alerts Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Previously, Trump said the tariffs against Canada and Mexico would remain until the countries crack down on the flow of drugs and 'illegal aliens' coming into the U.S. He said the additional tariff on China will stay until the country stops drugs, particularly fentanyl, from coming to the U.S. What impact do tariffs have on the economy? The effects of tariffs have long been debated, but economists on both sides of the aisle generally agree the costs tend to outweigh the benefits. Americans could see higher prices on a range of goods the U.S. imports from its top three trading partners, including vehicles, fruits and vegetables, smartphones, toys, laptops and even fuel at the pump. Tariffs can also lead to retaliation, with foreign countries responding by slapping their own taxes on goods from the U.S. After Trump's announcement, Canada immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs on American goods. Those who support tariffs often argue they prevent American businesses from offshoring jobs, but it’s not that simple. Workers who produce the specific goods covered by tariffs often benefit, but tariffs can also hurt workers in other industries that rely on those imports. In other words, a government tariff may be trading jobs in one industry at the expense of jobs in another. A 2024 paper by a group of top economists looked at Trump’s 2018 tariffs and found that 'import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment in newly-protected sectors.' However, retaliatory tariffs had 'clear negative impacts,' primarily in agriculture.

Trump announces pause on Mexico tariffs after striking deal	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump announced on Monday morning that he is immediately pausing tariffs on Mexico after reaching a deal with its President, Claudia Sheinbaum. In a post to Truth Social, Trump revealed he had spoken to Sheinbaum and negotiated assistance from Mexico to strengthen the United States' border sovereignty and deter drug trafficking into the country. 'It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,' Trump said. 'These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period [sic] during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it down? 'I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a 'deal' between our two Countries.' Sheinbaum also commented on the accord via X and during a press conference later Monday morning saying that it was a 'good conversation' with the president that lasted around 30 to 45 minutes. She confirmed that 10,000 members of Mexico's National Guard will be at the U.S. southern border, adding that the United States will work 'to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico' Sheinbaum added that efforts would begin today about security and trade between both nations It follows concessions made by Colombia following Trump's threat of tariffs on the South American country following a backflip on allowing deported migrants to return via U.S. aircraft.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-pause-mexico-tariffs-after-deal/	2025-02-03T07:54:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072190.jpg?w=900
JD Vance visiting East Palestine 2 years after train derailment	(NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance is in East Palestine, Ohio, on Monday, two years after a toxic train derailment scarred the town for generations. With Vance are Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, new Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted. Husted recently replaced the vice president in the Senate. After a train carrying chemicals derailed on the border of Pennsylvania and Ohio on Feb. 3, 2023, officials burned 116,000 gallons of vinyl chloride and forever changed the town. Vinyl chloride is still being detected in the area, and residents have been sick, reporting rashes and upper respiratory issues. What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it down? Independent testing found dioxins in Lori O’Connell’s home. Now, her husband has aggressive breast cancer. She said they were completely healthy before. O'Connell said Vance needs to realize 'these people still need help.' 'We still need health care monitoring. There are people who still want to be removed from this area, and they can't do it,' O’Connell said. 'Their hands are tied.' Tammy Tsai said she has recently had difficulty climbing stairs because of a 'lack of breath,' while her husband, Rick, says it’s been 'nothing but doctor's visits' and multiple diagnoses since the derailment. Ever since he tested East Palestine creeks for chemicals, Rick Tsai said, he’s had 'horrible acid reflux.' 'We’ve got people here on oxygen that were never on oxygen before,' Rick Tsai said on 'Morning in America.' 'So something is happening here.' A lawsuit was filed Monday containing the first seven wrongful death claims filed against Norfolk Southern railroad — including the death of a 1-week-old baby, The Associated Press reported. It alleges the railroad and its contractors botched the cleanup while officials at the EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on it and failed to adequately warn residents about the health risks. While the lawsuit provides some examples of lingering health effects families have seen, it doesn’t include details about the deaths, according to the AP. Temporary protection for about 350,000 Venezuelans to end: DHS A Norfolk Southern spokesperson declined to comment to the AP on the litigation. No public health emergency has been declared, and there is no long-term health monitoring plan. President Donald Trump has yet to sign a disaster declaration for East Palestine despite criticizing the Biden administration for not doing enough. The declaration is something NewsNation asked then-Sen. JD Vance about a year ago. 'I think it's shameful that (Biden) hasn't signed it,' Vance said then. 'I think the minute that Mike DeWine, the governor of the state asked for it, the president should have responded to it.' Rick Tsai said he hopes Vance talks to residents of East Palestine and not just the mayor. 'I pray it's not just the photo op,' Tsai said. '... I do believe that something tragic has happened here and is continuing to happen.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/ohio-train-derailment/jd-vance-east-palestine-2-years-later/	2025-02-03T06:26:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/06/6679e23c19ace5.21998976.jpeg?w=900
What is USAID, and why might the Trump administration shut it dow...	(NewsNation) — The future of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is uncertain amid changes under the Trump administration and a freeze imposed on billions of dollars in foreign assistance. A week after President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day pause on foreign aid, two top USAID security officials were removed after refusing to grant representatives of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency access to restricted areas, the Washington Post reported Sunday. Congressional Democrats have challenged the administration, fearing Trump may dissolve USAID's independence and merge the agency with the State Department. Here’s a closer look at USAID and its mission: What is USAID? USAID provides humanitarian assistance to other countries impacted by conflicts and assists developing countries, primarily by dishing out funds to nongovernmental organizations, foreign governments and international organizations, or other U.S. agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The agency has a budget of over $50 billion. President John F. Kennedy created the organization at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. USAID today is at the center of U.S. challenges to the growing influence of China, which has a successful 'Belt and Road' foreign aid program of its own. Trump defends tariffs as Mexico, Canada and China plan retaliation Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries. Why do some want USAID dismantled? USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. Several federal websites have also gone dark in recent days. The Trump administration and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID’s humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency’s leadership and staff in Washington. Tech billionaire Elon Musk said on X that he believes USAID is a 'criminal organization' that should 'die.' Musk was responding to the news that senior officials at USAID physically attempted to block people from Musk’s new department from having access to secure systems, NBC News reported. Musk calls USAID a ‘criminal organization’ that should ‘die’ The Trump administration is making USAID a target in its wide changes to the federal government. In a three-page letter last week, it was revealed Trump is considering merging the agency into a branch under the State Department. Democrats have slammed Trump over the reports about the merger, noting the agency is 'by statute, an independent establishment.' How are lawmakers reacting? Republicans and Democrats have long fought over the agency, arguing whether humanitarian and development aid protects the U.S. by helping stabilize partner countries and economies or is a waste of money. Democrats argue Trump has no legal authority to eliminate a congressionally funded independent agency and that the work of USAID is vital to national security. Trump and congressional Republicans claim much of foreign aid and development programs are wasteful and single out programs they say advance liberal social agendas.

EU warns Trump it would ‘respond firmly’ to tariffs	(The Hill) — The European Union (EU) said it will 'respond firmly' if President Donald Trump signs tariffs that could impact its member countries. A spokesperson for the union said that the 27-member group was not aware of any additional tariffs being imposed on EU products but said the use of tariffs is 'hurtful on all sides,' Bloomberg reported. Trump defends tariffs as Mexico, Canada and China plan retaliation 'The EU would respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods,' the spokesperson said. 'There is a lot at stake.' The remarks come just a day after Trump signed an executive order imposing significant tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. A 25 percent tariff will impact goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10 percent tariff will affect Chinese goods. They are set to take effect on Tuesday and Trump justified the impact on Americans by arguing the pain caused by economic fallout will be 'worth the price.' In December, Trump threatened tariffs in the EU unless the bloc buys large quantities of American oil and gas to make up for the growing deficit in the U.S. Trump reiterates Canada should become 51st state as tariffs loom Despite Trump’s threat, the EU purchases a large amount of American oil and gas, and no more would be available unless the U.S. increases its output. Tensions with the EU and U.S. are already heightened as the president has said he wants to acquire Greenland, which is owned by Denmark. Officials in Denmark have insisted that it’s not for sale and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had a 'fiery' call with Trump over the issue.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/trump-tariffs-eu/	2025-02-02T16:09:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25031808023751-e1738528773190.jpg?w=800

(NewsNation) — As President Donald Trump doubles down on his sweeping tariffs against the country's three biggest trading partners, leaders from Canada, Mexico and China are biting back. The levies of 25% on Canadian and Mexican and 10% on Chinese goods will take effect Tuesday. The affected countries say their strategy is to 'make Americans feel the same pain too.' President Trump laid out his motive on Truth Social, saying: 'We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Rep. Amo: Trump’s DEI remarks on plane crash ‘beneath the office of the president’ Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit back, announcing he will impose a 25% tariff on more than $100 billion worth of American goods, on everything from alcohol to perfume, clothing and produce. Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum ordered similar retaliatory tariffs, sharing the following message in part on X: 'If the United States government an d its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities.' And China has vowed to file a case against the United States with the World Health Organization, defending their record on fentanyl. But how will this affect American's wallets? This could raise the price on a lot of things. Some of the top imported products from the United States include cars, produce, alcohol, cellphones, clothes and shoes. Some Democrats also warn the tariffs could punch up the price of your Super Bowl party. 'I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax, with the big game coming next week. If you you know, avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, price is going to go up,' Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said on CBS News' 'Face the Nation' Rep. Donalds on Trump tariffs: ‘The risks are worth it’ The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates Trump’s tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power. Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates the tariffs would increase inflation, which was running at a 2.9% annual rate in December, by 0.4 percentage points this year. Daco also projects the U.S. economy, which grew 2.8% last year, would fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026 'as higher import costs dampen consumer spending and business investment.’’ The Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china/	2025-02-02T16:08:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/north-america_bernal_AssociatedPress.jpg?w=900

USAID security leaders on leave after trying to keep Musk's DOGE ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has placed two top security chiefs at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Elon Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Members of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, eventually did gain access Saturday to the aid agency's classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk's DOGE crew lacked high-enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials — John Vorhees and deputy Brian McGill — were legally obligated to deny access. The current and former U.S. officials had knowledge of the incident and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information. It comes a day after DOGE carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. Musk formed DOGE in cooperation with the new Trump administration with the stated goal of finding ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Panama City contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-usaid-security-leaders-on-leave-after-trying-to-keep-musks-doge-from-classified-info-officials-say/	2025-02-02T09:31:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679faceb64dbd0.40081108.jpeg?w=900
Is it a safe time to fly? Ex-Black Hawk crew chief says yes	(NewsNation) — Former Black Hawk helicopter crew chief Mark McEathron believes there has never been a safer time to board a flight. Despite two recent aircraft crashes McEathron insists they are unrelated and that there is no immediate threat to travelers. 'There's there's no relationship whatsoever. They're different air spaces, entirely different climate situations, entirely different aircraft, entirely different crews entirely and so that is completely unrelated,' McEathron told 'NewsNation Live Weekend.' NTSB: Helicopter’s black box recovered from DC crash site 'The truth is the safest time in history for aviation,' he said. 'These incidents are tragic, they're terrible, they're terrifying for viewers and for people who fly and participate in this, but it is just a statistical fact that it's the safest time we've ever had.' McEathron explained the various roles of a pilot and crew chief on a Black Hawk helicopter flight and what he believes occurred on the night of the crash. 'The pilots' jobs are to fly the aircraft. The crew chief's job is airspace surveillance and obstacle avoidance,' he said. 'That's the job of the crew chief, especially at the angle of the Black Hawks will fly. They fly nose down just before the main road, or to be able to pull it along. So, the pilots are looking straight ahead, looking down, or even looking in the aircraft for the tasks and duties they have to do. Virginia Attorney General asks Costco to end DEI policies 'Where the crew chief is the only one that could be looking up back, down [and] below. So they're the ones that really clear that airspace. 'Unfortunately, in this incident, we had one crew chief on the aircraft not to we don't always fly with two. That's not necessarily required, but there was only one in unfortunately, he was on the opposite side of the where this aircraft was coming from, and so he would have had no visibility of it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/is-it-safe-time-fly-black-hawk/	2025-02-02T09:20:08-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25031098531334.jpg?w=900
Here are some goods in the crosshairs of Trump's tariffs on Mexic...	President Donald Trump signed an order to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico, as well as China, starting Tuesday. Canada and Mexico quickly announced retaliatory tariffs, while China said it would take 'necessary countermeasures.' The business between the North American nations now exceeds China, totaling $1.8 trillion in 2023. That is far greater than the $643 billion in commerce that the U.S. did with China in that same year. Trump declared an economic emergency Saturday in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a lower 10% rate. Following are just a few imported goods whose prices may be hit first: A ‘grenade’ lobbed into auto production For decades, auto companies have built supply chains that cross the borders of the United States, Mexico and Canada. More than one in five of the cars and light trucks sold in the United States were built in Canada or Mexico, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility. In 2023, the United States imported $69 billion worth of cars and light trucks from Mexico – more than any other country -- and $37 billion from Canada. Another $78 billion in auto parts came from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. The engines in Ford F-series pickups and the iconic Mustang sports coupe, for instance, come from Canada. 'You have engines and car seats and other things that cross the border multiple times before going into a finished vehicle,’’ said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. 'You have American parts going to Mexico to be put into vehicles that are then shipped back to the United States. 'You throw 25% tariffs into all that, and it’s just a grenade.’’ China is also a major supplier of auto parts to the U.S. In a report Tuesday, S&amp;P Global Mobility reckoned that 'importers are likely to pass most, if not all, of this (cost) increase to consumers.’’ TD Economics notes that average U.S. car prices could rise by around $3,000 – this at a time when the average new car already goes for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. Higher prices at the pump Canada is by far America’s biggest foreign supplier of crude oil. From January through November last year, Canada shipped the U.S. $90 billion worth of crude, well ahead of No. 2 Mexico at $11 billion. For many U.S. refineries, there’s not much choice. Canada produces the 'type of crude oil that American refineries are geared to process,’’ Lincicome said. 'It’s a heavier crude. All the fracking and all the oil and gas we make here in the United States – or most of it – is a lighter crude that a lot of American refineries don’t process, particularly in the Midwest.’’ Of the tariffs on Canadian oil imports, Lincicome said, 'how the heck does that shake out? My guess is that it shakes out just through higher gas prices, particularly in the Midwest.’’ TD Economics figures that Trump’s tariffs could push up U.S. gasoline prices by 30 cents to 70 cents a gallon. Computers, Clothes and Toys Tariffs on China could impact a wide variety of consumer goods that Americans depend on. Cell phones, computers and other electronic devices were among the top imports from China last year, according to Commerce Department data. The U.S. also imported more than $32 billion in 'toys, games and sporting goods' from China last year, data shows. And Americans import billions of dollars a year in clothing from China. That includes more than $7.9 billion in footwear last year, according to Commerce Department data. Trouble in Margaritaville Tariffs could raise the price for those raising a glass of tequila or Canadian whisky. In 2023, the U.S. imported $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. The U.S. imported $537 million worth of Canadian spirits, including $202.5 million worth of whisky. Canada and Mexico were also the second- and third-largest importers of U.S. spirits in 2023, behind the European Union, the council said. The council said the U.S. is already facing a potentially devastating 50% tariff on American whiskey by the European Union, which is set to begin in March. Imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada could pile even more retaliatory action on the industry. Chris Swonger, the council’s president and CEO, said he appreciates the goal of protecting U.S. jobs. But tequila and Canadian whisky – like Kentucky bourbon -- are designated as distinctive products that can only be made in their country of origin. 'At the end of the day, tariffs on spirits products from our neighbors to the north and south are going to hurt U.S. consumers and lead to job losses across the U.S. hospitality industry, just as these businesses continue their long recovery from the pandemic,' Swonger said. Expensive avocados, just in time for the Super Bowl For American consumers still exasperated by high grocery prices, a trade war with Canada, Mexico and China could be painful. In 2023, the U.S. bought more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico –including 63% of imported vegetables and 47% of fruits and nuts. Farm imports from Canada came to $40 billion. A 25% tariff could push prices up. 'Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,’’ Lincicome said. 'They can’t eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them – 90% -- come from Mexico. You’re talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.’’ U.S. farmers are nervous, too, that Canada and Mexico will retaliate by slapping tariffs on American products such as soybeans and corn. That’s what happened in the first Trump administration. China and other targets of Trump tariffs hit back by targeting the president’s supporters in rural America. Exports of soybeans and other farm products dropped, so Trump spent billions of U.S. taxpayer money to reimburse farmers for lost sales. 'President Trump was as good as his word,’’ said Mark McHargue, a Central City, Nebraska, farmer who grows corn, soybeans, popcorn and raises hogs. 'It did take the sting out of it. That’s for sure.’’ But he would prefer to see the government push to open foreign markets to American farm exports. 'We would rather get our money from the market,’’ said McHargue, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau. 'It doesn’t feel great to get a government check.’’ ____ Associated Press Writers Josh Boak in Washington, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit and Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia contributed this story.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/ap-here-are-some-goods-in-the-crosshairs-of-trumps-tariffs-on-mexico-canada-and-china/	2025-02-02T08:32:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679f97de327124.54080138.jpeg?w=900
US businesses brace for Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and Chi...	WASHINGTON (AP) — From an ice cream parlor in California to a medical supply business in North Carolina to a T-shirt vendor outside Detroit, U.S. businesses are bracing to take a hit from the taxes President Donald Trump imposed Saturday on imports from Canada, Mexico and China — America’s three biggest trading partners. The levies of 25% on Canadian and Mexican and 10% on Chinese goods will take effect Tuesday. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a lower 10% rate. Mexico’s president immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs and Canada’s prime minister said the country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country’s government firmly opposes the move and will take 'necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.' The Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the 'wrongful practices of the U.S.' The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates Trump's tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power. Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates the tariffs would increase inflation, which was running at a 2.9% annual rate in December, by 0.4 percentage points this year. Daco also projects the U.S. economy, which grew 2.8% last year, would fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026 'as higher import costs dampen consumer spending and business investment.’’ The Penny Ice Creamery in Santa Cruz, California, has had to hike prices of its ice cream, including popular flavors 'strawberry pink peppercorn’’ and 'chocolate caramel sea salt,’’ repeatedly in recent years as an inflationary surge increased the cost of its supplies. 'I feel bad about always having to raise prices,’’ co-owner Zach Davis said. 'We were looking forward to inflation coming down, the economy stabilizing in 2025 ... Now with the tariffs, we may be back at it again.’’ Trump tariffs, Davis said, threaten to drive up the cost of the mostly made-in-China refrigerators, freezers and blenders he’ll need if Penny Ice Creamery goes ahead with plans to add to its six shops. He still has painful memories of the extra equipment costs the company had to absorb when Trump slapped massive tariffs on China during his first term. The new tariffs will also raise the price of a customer favorite — sprinkles — which Penny Ice Creamery imports from a company in Whitby, Ontario. Tacking a 25% import tax on even something as small as that can damage a small business like his. 'The margins are so slim,’’ he said. 'Being able to offer that add-on can maybe generate an additional 10 cents in profit per scoop. If a tariff wipes that out, that can really be the difference between being profitable and being break-even and even being underwater by the end of the year.’’ In Asheville, North Carolina, Casey Hite, CEO of Aeroflow Health, expects to take a hit because his company gets more than half its supplies, including breast pumps, from Chinese manufacturers, providing them to American patients through insurance plans. Aeroflow Health gets paid by insurers at pre-negotiated rates, put in place before Trump decided on his tariffs. Hite said the tax on Chinese imports would hit the company’s finances, forcing it either to purchase cheaper and lower-quality products or pass higher costs along via higher health insurance premiums. Those might take two years to materialize, Hite said, but eventually they would hit consumers’ budgets. 'It will impact the patients,' Hite said. 'In time, patients pay more for the products.' Even the made-in-USA absorbent incontinence pads Aeroflow Health buys aren’t safe from Trump’s import taxes. They may include pulp from tariff target Canada and plastics and packaging from China, according to the Aeroflow Health, which warns of 'turbulences' from the tariffs. 'Is this going to affect our business? You bet it is,’’ said Linda Schlesinger-Wagner, who owns skinnytees, a women’s apparel company in Birmingham, Michigan, north of Detroit, that imports clothing from China. She said the 10% tax would increase her costs, though she plans to absorb the extra expense instead of passing it along to customers. 'I don’t like what’s going on,’’ she said, referring to the broader impact of the tariffs. 'And I think people are going to be truly shocked at the pricing they’re going to see on the cars, on the lumber, on the clothes, on the food. This is going to be a mess.’’ William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that many companies that stocked up on imported goods ahead of time to avoid the tariffs. They will be able to draw on their piled-up inventories for weeks or a couple of months, delaying their customers’ pain. George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, an industry advocacy group, said construction companies have been hoarding materials in anticipation of Trump’s actions, but he worries about the possibility of inflation spiking in three to six months. 'Once that inventory starts to get low, we’re going to start feeling the effects,' Carillo said in a phone interview Saturday, ahead of the announcement. 'Developers and general contractors need to keep up with the pace and they’re going to start buying more products and it’s going to be at a higher price point.' All that will be exacerbated by an emerging immigration crackdown that is already spooking the construction industry’s labor pool, he said. 'You put tariffs and you put workforce instability, it’s going to create major delays in projects. It’s going to create an increase in prices because of the lack of availability,' Carrillo said. Then there are the industries that don't have the luxury of stockpiling, including supermarkets whose farm products will spoil. So the tariff impact will show up on grocery shelves within days. 'You don’t stockpile avocados,’’ Reinsch said. 'You don’t stockpile cut flowers. You don’t stockpile bananas.’’ In the tomato trading hub of Nogales, Arizona, produce vendor Rod Sbragia, who followed his father into the business nearly four decades ago, worries that the import levies will force some distribution companies out of business and 'would be detrimental to the American consumer, to the choices they have at the supermarket.' Sbragia voted for Trump in the past three elections and calls himself a 'staunch Republican.' The president, he said, must not have been properly advised on the matter. 'When we’re worried about cost to consumers, inflationary pressures and the overall health of our population,’’ he asked, 'why are we going to make it more difficult to get access to fresh fruits and vegetables?' American farmers are also likely to get caught in Trump’s trade tussle with Canada, China and Mexico. The president’s supporters in rural America make a tempting target for retaliatory tariffs. That is what happened in Trump’s first term when other countries, notably China, slapped back against the president’s tariffs with levies of their own on things like soybeans and pork. In response, Trump spent billions in taxpayer money to compensate them for lost sales and lower prices. Many farmers are now counting on the president to come through and protect them from reprisals. 'The Trump administration provided a safety net,' said former tobacco grower Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a collection of 700 farms that lawfully brings in foreign temporary laborers to work the fields through a federal visa program. Many of the association's farmers 'trust him that he’s going to take care of anybody who’s hurt by the tariffs, and that’s really all that we can ask for.' ___ Associated Press staff writers Mae Anderson and Cedar Attanasio in New York; Mike Householder in Birmingham, Michigan; Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina; Gabriel Sandoval in Phoenix; and Didi Tang and Christopher Rugaber in Washington, D.C., contributed to this story.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-us-businesses-brace-for-trumps-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-to-drive-up-costs/	2025-02-01T23:27:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679f1f32785695.91618378.jpeg?w=900
Democratic National Committee picks Ken Martin as new chair	(NewsNation) — Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, won the Democratic National Committee’s election to be the party’s next chair. He won in the first round with 246.5 votes out of 428 votes cast. (Delegates who live abroad are given half a vote, which accounts for the half percent of his total.) Martin, who also previously served as vice chair of the DNC, relied on his long-standing relationships with delegates to secure his win. He also touted his record of 25-0 in Minnesota state races while campaigning for the position. NewsNation’s Special Report: Crisis on the Border Martin beat Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democrats, and six other candidates. Wikler had received the endorsements of eight large unions as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but that support was not a match for the relationships Martin had built within the party as well as the endorsement of Representative James Clyburn. 'We're coming. This is a new Democratic Party. We're taking the gloves off. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people,' said Martin when asked by NewsNation about his message to President Donald Trump. Part of his plan to start winning races immediately includes creating a 'war room' that will focus on combating misinformation and disinformation. He also acknowledged that Republicans successfully spent three years defining Joe Biden and the Democratic Party before Democrats began revving up their communications infrastructure to respond. Martin wants to make sure that doesn’t happen anymore. Of Trump’s first weeks in office, Martin said his actions 'have shown us what happens when amateur hour meets demolition derby.' Federal websites told to purge content related to gender, climate Throughout the race, Martin said that under his leadership, the country can expect year-round campaigning that will prove to Americans that Democrats are the party that delivers for the working class. Martin plans to build up state parties and promised to take the 'great ideas from the other candidates' in the race and bring them to bear. With the race in the rearview mirror, Martin said it was time to unify, believing that Democrats are part of 'one team, one fight.' Martin has his work cut out for him. Democrats lost the White House and control of the Senate and remain in the minority in the House of Representatives after November’s elections. Meanwhile, Trump has moved swiftly to follow through on some campaign promises, particularly on immigration and dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Republicans in Congress are also working to show that their party is unified. Two big gubernatorial elections later this year, in Virginia and New Jersey, will test whether Republicans can keep up their winning streak or if Democrats are able to win back some of the working-class voters that have recently drifted away from the party.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/dnc-picks-ken-martin-chair/	2025-02-01T20:05:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25010861347457.jpg?w=900
NewsNation's Special Report: Crisis on the Border	(NewsNation) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations and arrests continued across the country this week with raids in Florida, New York, Colorado, California, Texas and Washington state. In a memo obtained exclusively by NewsNation, there are new warnings about calls to assassinate ICE agents, and the threats are growing on social media. The posts call for the murder of ICE agents and advise detainees to urinate and defecate in agent’s vehicles. Border czar Tom Homan spoke to NewsNation about the importance of officer safety, saying that operation secrecy remains critical after missions in Chicago and Aurora, Colorado, were leaked. 7 killed in Philadelphia medical transport jet crash 'We’ve got many target cities,' Homan said. 'We’ve got to keep our officers safe. Bad guys know we’re coming.' Meanwhile, President Donald Trump designated Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. U.S. Border Patrol has received new intel this week that cartels have authorized the use of weaponized, explosive drones against law enforcement officials. ICE agents, however, are pushing ahead, averaging more than 1,000 arrests per day. The agency is aiming for 1,500 daily arrests. The U.S. military has been leading deportation flights out of the country and fortifying the southern border. The Army, National Guard and the Marines are estimated to be 4,000 strong. Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warnings But with nearly 1.5 million undocumented immigrants set to be deported, where will they go? Trump said tens of thousands of migrants, considered 'the worst of the worst,' will be heading to Guantanamo Bay detention camp. 'We have 30,000 beds in Guantanamo to detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people,' Trump said. 'Some of them are so bad we don't even trust other countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So we're going to send them out to Guantanamo.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/special-report-crisis-on-the-border/	2025-02-01T17:36:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/NN_CRISIS-ON-THE-BORDER-PRIME-SPECIAL-Key-Art_1920x1080.png?w=900
Democrats electing new leader as party struggles to repair brand	OXON HILL, Md. (AP) — Democrats, desperately seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, are electing a new party leader Saturday in a low-profile race that could have big implications for their future. The new Democratic National Committee chair will succeed Jaime Harrison, who did not seek another term after a tumultuous 2024 election in which Trump became the first Republican to win the popular vote in two decades and made modest gains with core Democratic constituencies — African Americans, Latinos and working-class voters, among them. 'The world needs the Democratic Party to get up off the mat,' said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin state party head who is a top candidate, before the vote. He said the nation is facing a 'moment of Trumpian terror.' More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory were in suburban Washington for the election, which featured a group of candidates dominated by party insiders. The leading contenders, Wikler and Minnesota’s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They have promised to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party’s anti-Trump rapid response system. They have pledged not to shy away from Democrats' dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day party. But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, were elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011. Also in the race: former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O’Malley, and Faiz Shakir, who managed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ last presidential campaign. Candidate Marianne Williamson, an activist and author, surprised DNC members before voting began by endorsing Martin as 'our best chance to cut the court with the billionaire funded corruption that will otherwise obstruct and limit our possibilities.' Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong. The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand. Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party. Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC. But he has struggled to gain traction. Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons. By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food. Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections. Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party. 'As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t see a desire to change,’' said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair. ___	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-democrats-to-elect-new-leader-as-party-struggles-to-repair-brand/	2025-02-01T09:05:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679e559b47c053.16393703.jpeg?w=900
What are tariffs and how do they work?	WASHINGTON (AP) — Tariffs are in the news at the moment. Here's what they are and what you need to know about them: Tariffs are a tax on imports Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. U.S. tariff rates vary: They are generally 2.5% on passenger cars, for instance, and 6% on golf shoes. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump’s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. There’s much misinformation about who actually pays tariffs President Donald Trump, a proponent of tariffs, insists that they are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, it is importers — American companies — that pay tariffs, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That’s why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs. Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices — and sacrifice profits — to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy. What has Trump said about tariffs? Trump has said tariffs will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare. 'Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,’’ Trump said at a rally in Flint, Michigan, during his presidential campaign. As president, Trump imposed tariffs with a flourish — targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China. 'Tariff Man,' he called himself. Trump has promised even more and higher tariffs in his second term. The United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That shift has been a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered tree trade and an increasingly powerful China. Tariffs are intended mainly to protect domestic industries By raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices. Before the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue driver for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90% of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy. Tariffs fell out of favor as global trade grew after World War II. The government needed vastly bigger revenue streams to finance its operations. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government collected around $80 billion in tariffs and fees. That’s a trifle next to the $2.5 trillion that comes from individual income taxes and the $1.7 trillion from Social Security and Medicare taxes. Still, Trump wants to enact a budget policy that resembles what was in place in the 19th century. Tariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States. Trump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars. 'I can do it with a phone call,’’ he said at an August rally in North Carolina. If another country tries to start a war, he said he’d issue a threat: 'We’re going to charge you 100% tariffs. And all of a sudden, the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, ‘Sir, we won’t go to war.’ ' Economists generally consider tariffs self-defeating Tariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. They’re also likely to provoke retaliation. The European Union, for example, punched back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump’s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country. A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump’s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs 'neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment’’ where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found. Despite Trump’s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States. Worse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had 'negative employment impacts,’’ especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports. If Trump’s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. The study found that support for Trump and Republican congressional candidates rose in areas most exposed to the import tariffs — the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/ap-what-are-tariffs-and-how-do-they-work/	2025-02-01T08:06:56-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679e4786e50488.98303360.jpeg?w=900
First American hostage, 2 others freed from Hamas captivity	(NewsNation) — The first American hostage since the cease fire deal between Hamas and Israel went into effect two weeks ago was released from Gaza City Saturday morning, along with two Israeli hostages. Keith Siegel, 65, returned home to his family but not before an ominous fanfare as Hamas paraded him in front of a large crowd, as Hamas has done with each hostage release. Keith Siegel This undated photo provided by Hostages Family Forum shows Keith Siegel, who was abducted and brought to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. (Hostages Family Forum via AP) Siegel’s wife, Aviva, who was also taken hostage but released after 51 days, celebrated her husband's release. Throughout the more than 400 days he remained in captivity, she vocally called for his return. Telegraph reporter Jotam Confino joined NewsNation’s 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' after the exchange. 'He looks very fragile. He looks thin. He's being escorted by Hamas. It doesn't look like he's really able to walk fully by himself, but he's out now,' Confino said. His wife has spoken in Washington, D.C., multiple times with high-level officials to get Keith out and thanked President Donald Trump Saturday morning for finalizing the deal to get him out. Yarden Bibas Yarden Bibas, 35, and Ofer Kalderon, 54, were also released in an earlier handoff in Khan Younis, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, marking the fourth hostage-prisoner exchange of cease fire’s first phase. Hundreds gathered in Tel Aviv’s 'hostage square' to welcome the newly freed hostages, many appearing concerned and putting their hands together in prayer formation. 'His (Yarden Bibas’) family, mainly his wife and his two children, they have become somewhat of a symbol for Israel in this whole hostage strategy, mainly because they are very young,' Confino said. Bibas is 35, and his youngest child was nine months old when he was kidnapped. Bibas’ other son was four years old at the time of the kidnapping. 'Yarden does not know if his wife and two children are alive or dead,' Confino said. In November 2023, Bibas was forced to record a hostage video that his wife and children had been killed in an Israeli air strike, but it has not been confirmed. 'His nightmare is nowhere near ending,' Confino said. 'He's waiting for the Israeli government to find out more about his family.' Ofer Kalderson For Kalderon, he was reunited with his four children, two of whom were also held by Hamas. They were kidnapped from their home on Oct. 7, 2023, the first day of the now 15-month-long war. What's next in the Hamas-Israel cease fire? Hostage negotiations between Hamas and Israel resume on Tuesday as the second phase of the deal approaches. In this phase, Israel said it would pull troops from Gaza, but that remains to be seen. All male Israeli soldiers and more Palestinian prisoners are supposed to be released. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to meet with Trump at the White House. 'So many are worried that any second the whole thing could break down. (Hamas) could execute hostages, or they could renew fighting with Israel,' Confino said. 'So, we're really taking it day by day here in Israel.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/first-american-hostage-freed/	2025-02-01T08:05:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25032330708438.jpg?w=900
Trump fires the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bur...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden administration holdover. Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Chopra's tenure saw the removal of medical debt from credit reports and limits on overdrafts penalties, all based on the premise that the financial system could be fairer and more competitive in ways that helped consumers. But many in the financial industry viewed his actions as regulatory overreach. In a social media post Saturday about his departure, Chopra thanked people across the country who 'shared their ideas and experiences' with the government's consumer financial watchdog agency. 'You helped us hold powerful companies &amp; their executives accountable for breaking the law, and you made our work better,' Chopra posted above on X above pictures of his letter announcing that he would no longer lead the bureau. During Trump's first term, the Republican had picked Chopra as a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission. In his letter, Chopra noted that the bureau was ready to work with the Trump administration. He said the agency had prepared rules to block Russia, China and others from using data brokers to surveil Americans, and had put forth policies intended to prevent people from losing access to banking services for exercising their constitutional right to express their political or religious views. The letter noted the CFPB has also analyzed Trump's campaign proposal to cap credit card interest rates. Chopra was notified of his firing in an email, according to a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director. But he had publicly stated that he would leave his post if the new president asked. In many ways, Chopra exemplified some of the tensions between Trump's promises to curb regulations for businesses and his populist appeals to voters. When The Associated Press reported on Jan. 22 that Chopra remained in his job after Trump took the oath of office, his critics in the financial sector quickly said the president needed to dismiss him. 'The longer Director Chopra stays, the harder it will be for this pro-growth administration to undo the politically-driven, government-price setting agenda that former President Biden’s appointee has engaged in over the last several years at the Bureau,' emailed Weston Loyd, press secretary at the Consumer Bankers Association. Chopra is an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of Trump's favorite targets, and the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement that if Trump and Republicans 'decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.' She said the bureau under Chopra had held 'Wall Street accountable.' California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that Chopra's dismissal 'marks the end of an era of strong consumer protection and the beginning of a plan to end this important agency.' The bureau was created after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate mortgages, car loans and other consumer finance. It has long been opposed by Republicans and their financial backers. Last year, the Supreme Court rejected a challenged that could have undermined the bureau, ruling that the way it is is funded does not violate the Constitution. Unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on the annual budget process in Congress, but is funded directly by the Federal Reserve.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-politics/ap-trump-fires-the-director-of-the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau/	2025-02-01T07:55:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679e44004c2889.39592261.jpeg?w=900
2 hostages return to Israel after handover in southern Gaza	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Two hostages arrived in Israel after Hamas handed them over to the Red Cross on Saturday, while Palestinian authorities say Israel has agreed to release dozens of prisoners in the fourth round of exchanges during the Gaza ceasefire deal. The truce, which began Jan. 19, is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Hamas militant group. The fragile deal has held for nearly two weeks, halting the fighting and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory. The militants released Yarden Bibas, 35, and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, to the Red Cross after each climbed on a stage and waved to onlookers. Both had been abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Armed Hamas militants formed a line leading to the stage after chaotic crowds surrounded hostages during a handover Thursday, angering Israel. Another hostage, American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, is also set to be released Saturday and is expected to be handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza City to the north. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are expected to be freed in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners during the truce’s initial six weeks. Israel says it has received information from Hamas that eight of those hostages were either killed in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack or have died in captivity Also on Saturday, wounded Palestinians are expected to be allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt through the Rafah crossing. It had been the only exit point for Palestinians during the war before Israel closed it in May. A European Union civilian mission was deployed Friday to prepare for the reopening of the crossing. The reopening would mark another key step in the first phase of the ceasefire, which calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. The Health Ministry said 50 sick and wounded children are scheduled to be evacuated through Rafah crossing along with 61 companions. In Israel, the release of Bibas has brought renewed attention to — and concern for — the fate of his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons. All four were captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz. A video of their abduction by armed men showed Shiri swaddling in a blanket her two redheaded boys — Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old at the time. Kfir was the youngest of about 250 people taken captive on Oct. 7, and his plight quickly came to represent the helplessness and anger the hostage-taking stirred in Israel, where the Bibas family has become a household name. Hamas has said Shiri and her sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has not confirmed that, but a military spokesman recently acknowledged serious concern about their fates. Yarden Bibas is believed to have been held separately from his family. Photos taken during his abduction appeared to show him wounded. Like Bibas, Kalderon was also captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz. His two children and ex-wife, Hadas, were also taken, but they were freed during the 2023 ceasefire. In Kfar Saba, north of Tel Aviv, Kalderon's family hugged and cheered as they saw the images of him climbing onto the stage in Khan Younis and being transferred to the Red Cross. 'Ofer is coming home!' they said, arms lifted to the sky. Keith Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. She was released during the 2023 ceasefire and has waged a high-profile campaign to free Keith and other hostages. The dozens of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel on Saturday include people serving lengthy and life sentences. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in Nov. 2023. About 80 more hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third of them believed dead. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire are dead. Israel and Hamas are set next week to begin negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached. Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the latest ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu’s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire’s first phase. Hamas says it won’t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. In the Oct. 7 attack that started the war, some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory air and ground war, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-hamas-to-release-3-male-hostages-israel-to-release-dozens-of-palestinian-prisoners-under-ceasefire/	2025-01-31T23:19:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/679dc69d632525.81399269.jpeg?w=900
‘Heartbreaking’ search for those killed in DC air crash as army h...	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Police boats combed the banks of the Potomac River on Friday, slowly scanning the shoreline in the rain as investigators sought clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people and raised questions about air traffic safety around the nation’s capital. The black box from the Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a commercial jetliner and crashed into the Potomac River has been recovered, investigators announced. They are reviewing that flight data recorder along with two recovered earlier from the jet. No one survived the Wednesday night collision. The remains of 41 people had been pulled from the river as of Friday afternoon, including 28 that had been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference. He said next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families, and he expects all the remains to be recovered. The wreckage of the plane's fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get all the bodies, he said. 'This is heartbreaking work,' Donnelly said, noting that more than 300 responders were taking part in the effort at any one time, including teams of divers and two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, at least one of which carries a crane. 'It’s been a tough response for a lot of our people.' It was unclear how long the recovery operation would take. 'We’re working as fast as we can,' Donnelly said. 'We need your patience.' The American Airlines jet was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. The helicopter had three soldiers on board. Although Ronald Reagan National Airport reopened, two of its three runways remained closed to keep aircraft from flying over the crash scene, said Terry Liercke, the airport's vice president and manager. Roughly 100 flights were canceled Friday. The Federal Aviation Administration also heavily restricted helicopter traffic around the airport, the Department of Transportation said in a statement, hours after President Donald Trump claimed in a social media post that the Army Black Hawk had been flying higher than allowed. Investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder of the American Airlines jetliner, which collided with the chopper as the plane was coming in for a landing at the airport, which is just across the Potomac from Washington. The flight data recorder was in good condition and its information was expected to be downloaded shortly, National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman told reporters. He said water entered the cockpit voice recorder, and while that’s not unusual, it adds to investigators’ work. The helicopter’s data, contained in a single black box, was at NTSB headquarters and appears to be undamanged, Inman said. Investigators are examining the actions of the military pilot as well as air traffic control, after the helicopter apparently flew into the jet's path. NTSB investigations normally take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Military aircraft frequently conduct such flights in and around the capital to practice routes they would fly if key government officials had to be quickly moved during a major catastrophe or attack. Other potential factors in the crash, including the helicopter’s altitude and whether the crew was using night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel. On Friday the Army released the names of two of the soldiers who died: Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, the crew chief; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. Eaves was one of the pilots on the helicopter. But in an unusual move, the name of the third soldier is not being released for now at the family’s request, the Army said. The FAA on Friday barred helicopters from flying over a roughly 6-mile (10-kilometer) stretch of the Potomac and parts of its shoreline, including over the airport, according to the Department of Transportation statement. The new limits exempt helicopters on emergency medical flights, active law enforcement and air defense missions, and carrying the president. They are expected to remain in place at least until the NTSB finishes its preliminary report. Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas, carrying, among others, nine students and parents from Fairfax County, Virginia schools, a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and a group of hunters. Crash debris has drifted miles (kilometers) downriver. Dean Naujoks, who routinely patrols the Potomac for the environmental group Waterkeeper Alliance, found floating debris Thursday in a pair of shallow coves along the Maryland shore. The wreckage included pages from a flight manual, part of the plane’s cabin wall, a woman’s sweater and dozens of sugar packets with the American Airlines logo. Naujoks, who had law enforcement permission to take his motorboat about 2 miles (roughly 3 kilometers) from the crash site, turned the items over to the FBI. 'Everything is covered in jet fuel,' Naujoks said Friday. 'The sugar packets made me think of the flight attendants. I’m thinking of the people these things belonged to, and it’s a punch to the gut. It’s just a sad day on the river.' According to an FAA report obtained by the AP, one air traffic controller was responsible for coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes when the collision happened. Those duties are often divided between two people, but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic begins to slow down. On Wednesday, though, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called 'not normal.' However, a person familiar with the matter said tower staffing that night was actually normal. The positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away for breaks, shift changes or when traffic slows, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. Inman said investigators had interviewed at least one air traffic controller working at the time of the crash. He said interviews were ongoing, and it was unclear how many controllers were working at the time. 'Air traffic control interviews are critical,' Inman said. 'That’s the reason why there’s a process in place that began immediately after the accident.' Investigators will also examine staffing levels, training, hiring and other factors, in addition to looking at controllers' records. The FAA has long struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers. Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, said the helicopter crew was 'very experienced' and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around the city. The helicopter's maximum allowed altitude at the time was 200 feet (about 60 meters), Koziol said. It was not immediately clear whether it exceeded that limit, but Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor in the collision. A day after he questioned the helicopter pilot’s actions and blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air safety, Trump said Friday that the helicopter was 'flying too high.' 'It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump said in a post on the Truth Social platform. Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people aboard and five people on the ground. Experts often highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots. ___ Gomez Licon reported from Miami.

Foreign aid freeze could cut thousands of American jobs	(NewsNation) — After President Trump’s executive order freezing almost all foreign aid from the U.S., American businesses that help provide global assistance are furloughing employees. There’s grave concern that stated policy goals of the Trump administration, like American prosperity, strong national security and combating the rise of China, are at risk through these actions. Impact on U.S. businesses The foreign aid budget accounts for less than 1% of the federal budget or around $40 billion, according to the State Department, yet thousands of Americans are employed by businesses that work in the aid arena. For many, their jobs are on the line. Bodega owners, customers react to immigration crackdown in NYC For example, U.S.-based aid company Chemonics International directly employs 1,100 Americans and partners with more than 145 American companies. It’s enacted furloughs that could become permanent if funding is cut. 'As a result of the stop-work order that is affecting all of the USAID-funded programs we implement, we are taking several cost reduction measures, including furloughing many of our staff,' a Chemonics spokesperson said. According to the State Department’s cable issuing the stop-work order consistent with the President’s executive order, the initial timeline for this pause in funding is a minimum of 90 days. Many are concerned that the first 30 days are being used to create a review process instead of conducting reviews, delaying funding longer. A person familiar with USAID’s programs warned that if the State Department or Congress wants any foreign assistance programs to resume after this pause, it’s possible that partners who help implement the programs will no longer exist. USAID partners pay upfront for all costs of doing work on behalf of the U.S. government (like salaries, office leases, etc.) either with cash on hand or through a line of credit. If the government does not reimburse them within 30 days, lenders may not be willing to extend credit to partners again. And with no cash on hand, a business cannot survive. Trump launches aviation safety assessment ordering ‘competence’ over ‘DEI’ While Secretary of State Marco Rubio has signed some waivers that provide exemptions, like foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance, the work of aid organizations is vast, encompassing agriculture, education, health care, and more. The source said that many partners that implement USAID’s programs face financial insolvency within 30 to 60 days. Some U.S. small businesses that work overseas have already folded. The head of an American-owned small business explained that the order didn’t just pause current and new funds. The government has also stopped paying for work that’s already completed, including invoices submitted before the order was issued. That small business may have to file for bankruptcy. They, and others, don’t understand why the administration would not pay bills and freeze funds before a review process is in place, wondering if this is actually an excuse to gut the foreign aid budget and fold USAID into the State Department in a diminished capacity. National security and keeping China at bay The actions of the Trump administration are not just detrimental to these American businesses and their employees; they’re counterintuitive to the goals of the Trump administration, according to several sources. Sanctuary policies would be punishable under Tennessee bill The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a bipartisan group that includes almost 270 retired admirals and generals, provided several examples of where the freeze could harm U.S. interests. For example, security guards who were guarding thousands of ISIS militants at the Al Hol camp in Syria stopped showing up for work, leaving the camps largely unattended until the freeze on the specific camp program was lifted. Current U.S. foreign assistance programs to prevent, detect and respond to biothreats and global disease outbreaks are frozen, hurting America’s ability to halt health threats, like other pandemics, from reaching the U.S. In the tiny nation of Papua New Guinea, in a strategically important region to the U.S., China owns over 40 companies, and there are more than 1,800 foreign companies controlled by Chinese nationals or entities. With this funding freeze, Chinese influence can grow, and successful partnership opportunities with allies that advance U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific will shrink. Co-chair of the council, former CENTCOM Commander and Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, believes the freeze 'takes the U.S. off the playing field and diminishes America’s strength around the world.' At his confirmation hearing to be secretary of state, Rubio said he’ll focus on three questions: Does every dollar we spend make us safer, does it make us stronger, and does it make us more prosperous? USGLC Communications Director Josh Cohen not only believes that when it comes to international assistance, the answer to all three is 'yes,' 'but if we pull back from the world, China is itching to fill the vacuum.' Illinois governor blocks pardoned Jan. 6 rioters from state jobs Right now, funds are frozen, but no permanent cuts have been made, which is limiting criticism. Many of the people NewsNation spoke with were only willing to do so anonymously for fear of retribution in the form of permanent cuts. A State Department spokesperson justified the pause by saying it is impossible to evaluate programs on autopilot because participants don’t have an incentive to share details if they’re continuing to get funds. 'A temporary pause, with common-sense waivers for truly life-threatening situations, is the only way to scrutinize and prevent waste,' they said. Notably, all of the sources NewsNation spoke with agreed there’s value in a review process to get rid of waste and understand that the new administration wants alignment with what they perceive are America’s interests. But to pause funding without a review process in place is leaving thousands of Americans jobless and allowing China to step into the void. This could leave the country weaker, less secure and less prosperous. That’s the opposite of what voters said they wanted.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/foreign-aid-freeze-jobs/	2025-01-31T16:37:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/Foreign-aid_051124_Photo_AP.png?w=900
Multiple houses on fire after plane crash in Philadelphia	(NewsNation) — A small plane crashed in Philadelphia, causing an explosion and multiple house fires. Police say two people were on board the plane. The status of those individuals is unknown. Other injuries have been reported on the ground, and multiple homes are on fire. The FAA said in a statement 'a Learjet 55 crashed around 6:30 p.m. local time on Friday, Jan. 31, after departing from Northeast Philadelphia Airport. There were two people on board. The plane was en route to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri.' What can the ‘black box’ tell us about plane crashes? Gov. Josh Shapiro said he is offering all 'Commonwealth resources as they respond to the small private plane crash in Northeast Philly.' Flight data showed a small jet taking off from the airport at 6:06 p.m. and disappearing from radar about 30 seconds later after climbing to an altitude of 1,600 feet. It is not clear what led to the crash. This is a developing story. Check back for more details.

Federal websites told to purge content related to gender, climate	(NewsNation) — Portions of federal government websites have gone dark as agencies are being told to 'pause' them to remove content that doesn't comply with President Donald Trump's views. The U.S. Department of Agriculture was told to delete pages about climate change, according to an email from the agency's communications department. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's pages on HIV also went dark earlier in the day, but some content was later restored. Other health information and statistics used by clinicians and public health officials appeared to be removed. Sanctuary policies would be punishable under Tennessee bill The entire census.gov website also appeared to be down Friday evening. Officials from health departments and nonprofits who receive federal funds also say they've been told to get rid of mentions of gender and equity from their programs to comply with an executive order issued earlier this week. It's not clear how organizations will be able to comply with the instructions and what will happen to information about health programs specifically designed to address equity gaps or issues specifically affecting transgender people. An order banning pronouns in email signatures, initially only thought to extend to federal staff, may also reportedly be extended to groups getting federal grants.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-websites-purge-content-gender-climate/	2025-01-31T16:04:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/DT.jpg?w=900
Live: White House answers questions after DC plane crash	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump on Friday asserted the military helicopter involved in a deadly midair collision near Washington, D.C., was 'flying too high.' 'The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump posted on Truth Social. More than 60 people died after an American Airlines flight collided with a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on its final approach to Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Wednesday night. DC plane crash: Flight manifest expected to be released Friday The New York Times reported Thursday that the helicopter was supposed to be flying lower to the ground at the time of the crash, citing four people briefed on the issue. The Times reported that the helicopter had asked permission to use a route that would have allowed it to fly no higher than 200 feet. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Pentagon are investigating the cause of the crash. Since the collision took place on Wednesday night, Trump has vacillated between arguing the helicopter may have been at fault in the incident and claiming diversity efforts in hiring air traffic controllers may have played a role. 'The people in the helicopter should have seen where they were going,' Trump told reporters Thursday at the White House. 'What was the helicopter doing in that track? Very sad. But visually, somebody should have been able to see and taken that helicopter out of play and the should have been at a different height.' Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warnings But Trump has also repeatedly suggested without evidence that efforts to hire diverse individuals, including those with disabilities, had weakened federal aviation safety. 'We want the most competent people, no matter what race they are. … If they don’t have a great brain, a great power of the brain, they’re not going to be very good at what they do,' he said. The president also signed a memo Thursday to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the aviation sector and to assess airline safety, as well as an executive order to appoint a new head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in the wake of the incident.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-black-hawk-too-high-plane-crash/	2025-01-31T08:10:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25030597079190-e1738335463110.jpg?w=800
DC plane crash: Flight manifest expected to be released Friday	(NewsNation) — Officials are expected to release a flight manifest Friday with a list of those on board the American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members when it collided with a military helicopter carrying three soldiers at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. It's expected to be released as crews continue recovery operations. The DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services confirmed Friday morning that 41 bodies have been recovered from the crash site, including all three soldiers who were on the Army Black Hawk helicopter. During a Thursday news conference, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said the flight manifest for American Airlines Flight 5342 would be released after the families of those who were on the flight are notified. 'They are waiting for all of the families to be notified,' Kelly said. 'There are some folks on that plane who are from overseas. That's partially the reason for the delay. They expect we would likely have the manifest on Friday afternoon.' The 67 people on the plane and military helicopter are presumed dead. Investigators recover black boxes from plane in DC crash The National Transportation Safety Board is examining the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recovered Thursday from the passenger jet. Investigators will zero in on how the plane experienced a rapid loss of altitude on its approach over the Potomac. Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warnings Officials said their investigation 'will take some time' but intend to have a preliminary report on the crash within 30 days. Jennifer Homendy, board chair, said while it is an 'all hands on deck event,' they will allow first responders to complete their 'important safety mission.' To determine the cause of the crash, Homendy said the NTSB will look at several factors, including 'human, machine and the environment.' DC plane crash: What we know so far The midair crash occurred shortly before 9 p.m. local time Wednesday, shutting down the airport until 11 a.m. Thursday. Part of the investigation will revolve around an interaction with air traffic control in the final moments before the collision. According to investigators, the plane was cleared to land at a shorter runway just minutes before at Reagan National. The pilots acknowledged the change as well. Air traffic control also asked the helicopter if it could see the plane and if it could pass behind it, but, seconds later, the crash occurred. Diversity has ‘nothing to do’ with ATC hiring: Ex-FAA official There were 60 passengers and four crew members aboard American Eagle Flight 5342, according to American Airlines. The FAA said the plane was a Bombardier CRJ700 arriving from Wichita, Kansas. A U.S. Army official said the helicopter was a UH-60 Black Hawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, said both pilots were experienced and had flown the specific route before. The pilot-in-command had 1,000 flying hours, and their co-pilot had just under 500. Who are the victims of the DC plane crash? The victims include figure skaters and coaches, as well as members of the D.C. branch of the Steamfitters union. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts,' U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement. United Association Steamfitters said four members were on board the American Airlines flight. 'May they rest in peace,' UA Local 602, based in Prince George’s County, Maryland, said on X. Did night vision goggles play a role in DC plane crash? One of the crew members killed in the crash was First Officer Sam Lilley, his father Tim Lilley, confirmed to NewsNation.

Congress authorized more flights at Reagan National despite warni...	(NewsNation) — Congress added more daily flights to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport's schedule last year — and multiple other times over the past quarter century — despite warnings from the airport where 67 people died in a plane crash Wednesday night. The collision between an American Airlines commercial passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River is the worst air crash in the U.S. since 9/11. The crash was reminiscent of another on Jan. 13, 1982, when an Air Florida flight plowed into the Potomac due to bad weather, leaving 78 dead. Wednesday's crash has resurfaced concerns about the airport's proximity to the river, narrow landing space and overcrowding. Despite the geographic and logistical challenges, Congress authorized 10 additional 'slots,' or flights, to DCA's daily flight schedule. Investigators recover black boxes from plane in DC crash DCA (the airport's three-letter code) operates on a 'slot rule,' meaning the number of daily arrivals and departures is limited. Only four other high-density airports manage congestion this way: JFK and LaGuardia in New York, Newark in New Jersey and O'Hare in Chicago. Reagan National serves as the area's 'short-haul' airport, according to its website, as nonstop service is limited to a perimeter of 1,250 miles. However, nonstop service is offered beyond that limit to West Coast cities such as Los Angeles and Seattle due to recent federal exemptions. Through legislation passed by Congress, the U.S. Department of Transportation can issue 'beyond-perimeter' exemptions, allowing nonstop service to cities outside the 1,250-mile perimeter. Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act authorized 10 additional daily flights to DCA's schedule, all of which are outside the perimeter. This decision was made 'over the strong opposition of the Airports Authority,' DCA's website says. Congress also added 54 total slots spread across 2012, 2003 and 2000. What we know about the DC plane crash victims Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., opposed the increase. 'With this profoundly reckless decision, the (Commerce, Science and Transportation) Committee is gambling with the safety of everyone who uses this airport,' Kaine said in a statement last February. 'As we have said countless times before, DCA’s runway is already the busiest in the country.' Members of Congress travel frequently, using the two D.C.-area airports, Reagan National and Washington Dulles International Airport. 'Forcing the airport to cram additional flights in its already crowded schedule will further strain its resources at a time when air traffic controllers are overburdened and exhausted, working 10-hour days, six days a week,' Kaine said before a final bill was written last year. DC crash co-pilot ‘at the prime of his life’: Dad An FAA report obtained by the Associated Press said one air traffic controller was working two positions at the time of the crash, which was 'not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.' On May 25, 2023, nine days after the reauthorization act was signed into law, the FAA sent a memo to the Office of Government and Industry Affairs to provide an analysis of how the additional slots would impact delays and airport operations. 'Additional flights at DCA would likely have a negative impact on operational performance and passenger experience,' the memo said. About 20% of departures and 22% of arrivals at DCA experienced average delays of a little more than an hour from January 2022 through May 2023. Listen: Audio captures air traffic control at moment of DC plane crash The memo clarified slot limits are based on airport capacity, not demand. Whereas Congress successfully sought to increase the number of slots, the FAA 'imposes slot limits when demand exceeds capacity,' the memo said. 'I was so distraught when I heard this news last night,' Kaine told the New York Times on Thursday. 'I will not be able to rewatch the speech I gave on the Senate floor about it because it would make me too upset.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/congress-authorized-more-flights-reagan-airport-despite-warnings/	2025-01-31T01:25:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/04/americanairlines_dca_022323gn4_w.jpg?w=900
Did night vision goggles play a role in DC plane crash?	(NewsNation) — Investigators are looking at the factors that contributed to Wednesday's tragic plane crash in Washington, D.C., and they may consider whether night vision goggles played a role. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that a 'fairly experienced' crew was conducting an 'annual proficiency training flight' in the military helicopter when it collided with the civilian airplane. The helicopter operators were wearing night vision goggles. U.S. Rep Mark Green, R-Tenn., a former flight surgeon for the U.S. Army Night Stalkers, told NewsNation that flying in an urban environment with night vision presents challenges but moving lights, like those on a plane, should have been detectable. What we know about the DC plane crash victims 'If the [night vision goggles] are on, you should see those lights,' he told NewsNation's Leland Vittert on Thursday. Instead, the bigger issue may have been 'target fixation,' meaning the helicopter crew was focused on something else, like another plane. 'I've investigated crashes before where target fixation was the issue,' Green said. 'They get their eyes locked on one other thing and they miss the thing in their periphery.' Investigators recover black boxes from plane in DC crash Green also pointed out that the helicopter only had one crew chief, which may have made it harder to spot hazards. 'The aircraft that I flew in had two, one on each side, and those crew chiefs are literally outside the aircraft, especially in a situation where they're this low,' he said.

Diversity has 'nothing to do' with ATC hiring: Ex-FAA official	(NewsNation) — A former Federal Aviation Administration official said diversity has 'nothing to do' with air traffic control hiring, adding he takes exception to President Donald Trump’s claim it may have contributed to the deadly collision between a passenger jet and military helicopter Wednesday. 'There are very strict requirements for air traffic control. It's a two-year process. It's intensive. It's a lot of training,' Randy Babbitt, who served as the 16th administrator of the FAA, told NewsNation. 'You don't just go from the end of your two years to Chicago-O’Hare,' he said. Trump attacked the FAA’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies Thursday, claiming the agency had committed to adding employees with the 'most severe' disabilities because they are part of the 'most underrepresented' portion of the American workforce. He added air traffic controllers needed to be 'geniuses.' What we know about the DC plane crash victims However, Trump later said there is no evidence the collision could be blamed on DEI hires. 'It just could have been,' the president said. Babbitt pushed back on Trump, who blamed former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama for DEI policies. 'I would take great exception. I would also note that there were four years between Obama and Biden when President Trump was president, so I don't know what action he took there, but he certainly was in existence,' he said. When it comes to diversity in the FAA, Babbitt said it does not weigh heavier than skill. 'Airlines hire a lot of people, but not all of them are going to be pilots. The FAA hires a lot of people, not all of them can be controllers,' he said. 'They have very, very high standards to be an air traffic controller, and that's important to remember. Diversity has nothing to do with it.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/diversity-atc-hiring-standards-faa/	2025-01-30T17:39:29-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196164305.jpg?w=900

What is the role of air traffic control at US airports?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump criticized air traffic controllers for not properly directing the military Black Hawk helicopter that collided with an American Airlines passenger jet carrying 64 passengers and crew. Trump questioned the air traffic control tower in a Truth Social post, asking why it did not tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if the pilot saw the plane. 'This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented,' Trump wrote. 'NOT GOOD!!!' In a news conference Thursday, Trump said, 'We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas.' Trump said his administration would ensure 'nothing like this happens again.' What we know about the DC plane crash victims Trump told reporters that the angle of the helicopter was 'unbelievably bad' when the air traffic controller began telling the pilot what to do. Trump also cast blame on the helicopter pilot, claiming the pilot did the opposite of what he was told. 'For some reason, there weren't adjustments made,' Trump said. The role of air traffic control According to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, air traffic controllers ensure the safety of about 2 million passengers per day and about 1 billion per year. The industry’s workforce includes about 4,000 trained employees. Tower controllers are based in glass towers at the nation’s airports and manage air traffic at a range of 3 to 30 miles around the airport. Tower controllers provide pilots with taxiing and takeoff instructions, air traffic clearance and other instructions based on their observations and experience, the association said on its website. FILE - In this Friday Jan. 25, 2019, file photo is the air traffic control tower at LaGuardia Airport in New York. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) The controllers are tasked with providing separation between landing and department aircraft and transferring control of aircraft to the en-route center controllers. Employees at terminal radar approach control facilities work in radar rooms that are located in the airport towers, the association said. These workers are also responsible for the safe separation of departing aircraft, landing and aircraft maneuvering in the airport environment. NewsNation reached out to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association for comment Thursday, but an email was not immediately returned. Trump's executive order on hiring freezes Almost immediately after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that sparked the freezing of federal civilian employees into positions that were currently open. The order stated that the freeze affects all executive departments and agencies regardless of their sources of operational or programmatic funding. A day later, the White House said that hiring within the Federal Aviation Administration had betrayed the agency's mission 'by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence.' The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure issued a statement after, saying Trump had frozen the hiring of air traffic controllers along with other safety-critical positions.

(Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) In the statement, the committee, led by its ranking member, U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., said that the bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 directed the administration to hire the maximum number of air traffic controllers. He said that Trump's hiring freeze put air travelers at risk. DC plane crash: Trump suggests FAA’s diversity efforts caused safety issues 'Hiring air traffic controllers is the number one safety issue according to the entire aviation industry,' Larsen said in the statement. 'Instead of working to improve aviation safety and lower costs for hardworking American families, the (Trump) Administration is choosing to spread bogus DEI claims to justify this decision. 'I'm not surprised by the President’s dangerous and divisive actions, but the Administration must reverse course. Let’s get back to aviation safety and allow the FAA to do its job protecting the flying public.' Trump said Thursday that his executive order restored the 'very highest standards' of air traffic standards. 'We have to have our smartest people,' Trump told reporters. 'It doesn't matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. It matters intellect, talent. They have to be naturally talented geniuses.' Air traffic control job shortages In 2023, then Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told NewsNation that one of the biggest issues facing the aviation industry was a lack of air traffic controllers. 'We do see a concern in terms of the availability of enough air traffic control staffers, that you have backups if somebody calls in sick or if there’s a lot of pressure on a particular region or tower. And in some areas, we’re not at the staffing levels that I want us to see,' Buttigieg said in the interview. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg speaks before President Joe Biden during a visit to the U.A. Local 190 Training Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., Friday, Sept. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) On Thursday, Buttigieg criticized Trump's response to the crash, writing on X 'Despicable. As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. He continued: 'President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA. One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.' Black Hawk knew plane was in area before crash: Transportation chief In the 2023, interview, the former transportation secretary told NewsNation that he hoped to see more air traffic controllers in place. 'I'd like to see us have about 3,000 more (air traffic control) than we have right now,' Buttigieg said in 2023. 'Just to be clear, that doesn’t mean there are empty seats in a tower. But, what it does mean is you don’t have the kind of buffer, the kind of redundancy, that you want to.' Did the airport’s location matter? Because of the airport’s proximity to the White House and U.S. Capitol, the amount of restricted airspace around Reagan International Airport is much higher than in other cities, the BBC reported. Aviation consultant Phillip Butterworth-Hayes told the BBC that air traffic involving both commercial airliners and military aircraft makes managing the air space more complex. Butterworth-Hayes called the area 'the most secure' airspace in the world and said that it should be the safest considering the number of security and civilian safety organizations working there, the BBC reported. 'You are at the border of three or four aviation systems here,' he said. 'And it’s at those borders where most accidents tend to happen.' What air traffic controllers saw According to audio recordings of air traffic control conversations that took place, one air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the passenger jet in its sight less than 30 seconds before the collision took place. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told reporters Thursday that the helicopter pilot was at fault, asking why the aircraft had come into the path of the jet. Figure skating community reacts to loss after DC crash Moments after air traffic control asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight, it instructed the helicopter to 'pass behind' the jet,' The Associated Press reported. Air traffic control had directed the pilot of the American Airlines flight to 'take runway 33' at Reagan Airport. According to reports, no response was heard from the helicopter on the ATC audio, but the pilot’s response was heard on a different frequency that is designed for helicopters. The audio also picks up an air traffic controller saying, 'Crash, crash, crash. This is an alert three. Crash, crash, crash.' From there, air traffic controllers began diverting other air traffic away from the area. Audio picks up air traffic controllers saying that the collision took place over the Potomac River as the plane was approaching its assigned runway. One air traffic controller said that all runways were closed and that no planes were moving. 'I just saw a fireball, and then it was just gone,' audio picks up one air traffic controller saying. 'I haven't seen anything since they hit the river. But it was a CRJ and a helicopter that hit, I would say about a half-mile off the approach into 33.'.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/role-air-traffic-control-us-airports/	2025-01-30T11:38:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2196738835.jpg?w=900
‘He was a force of nature’: Father of DC crash victim mourns son	(NewsNation) — Douglas Lane, who lost his son, Spencer, in the Washington, D.C., plane crash, said he had dreams of competitive figure skating. '(Spencer) was really just kind of a force of nature,' said Douglas Lane. His father said that despite getting a relatively late start in figure skating, Spencer was determined to follow his passion. 'Even though people train since they're a small child, and it takes them years and years to develop skills, he just started,' said Douglas. 'And three years later, he's in Wichita, Kansas, on the national development team for U.S. figure skating, training with former world champions.' Trump suggests FAA’s diversity efforts caused safety issues in crash The FAA said the midair crash occurred before 9 p.m. ET in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over 3 miles south of the White House and the Capitol. American Airlines Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet and a speed of about 140 mph when it rapidly lost altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. Spencer’s coaches were also on board the flight, according to his father. 'Wonderful people,' Douglas said of the coaches. 'Former world champions from Russia and some other skaters. And so it's just devastating.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/dc-plane-crash-victims-father/	2025-01-30T10:58:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-16-1.jpg?w=900
Reagan Washington airport one of world's most complex airspaces	(NewsNation) — The airspace where a deadly mid-air crash between a passenger plane and a U.S. Army Black Hawk occurred late Wednesday night is one of the most complex and congested in the country. At least 28 bodies had been recovered from the scene Thursday morning. Officials said 27 bodies were recovered from the jet, and one was pulled from the helicopter. Officials expect no survivors from the crash, which would make it the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), located along the Potomac River outside of Washington, D.C., services both military helicopters and passenger planes every day. Audio captures air traffic control at moment of DC crash The airspace is further complicated by the area's two other major airports, multiple military bases and frequent high-profile political voyages. 'You are at the border of three or four aviation systems here — and it's at those borders where most accidents tend to happen,' Aviation consultant Philip Butterworth-Hayes told BBC News, adding that DCA is 'the most controlled bit of airspace in the world.' Ronald Reagan Washington Airport's traffic problem DCA is especially crowded, according to glass manufacturer SageGlass, which partook in renovations at the airport in 2021. The airport was originally designed to accommodate 15 million passengers annually — but it routinely sees more than 23 million passengers in a year. A 2021 Government Accountability Office report reported 88,000 helicopter flights within 30 miles of DCA from 2016-2019, including roughly 33,000 military and 18,000 law enforcement flights, Reuters reports. Despite its packed flight log, the airport has only three runways. The largest, Runway 1/19, is 7,169 feet long, per the airport's official website. The other two runways are around 2,000 feet shorter than 1/19, leading a large majority of incoming flights to utilize one runway. No officials have indicated that congestion caused Wednesday's crash. What we know about the DC plane crash victims Just last year, Congress approved the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act, which increased the number of flights to and from DCA, despite concerns from political and aviation officials. Tim Kaine, D-Va., warned of the safety consequences of more congestion while addressing Congress in May 2024. Kaine's concern came after an incident where two planes nearly collided on a runway, telling lawmakers: 'Thank God a collision and catastrophe was averted. But more and more planes on this busiest runway in the United States is just going to increase the chance of a significant incident.' No survivors expected in DC plane crash Operations at Reagan National Airport have resumed after an American Airlines regional passenger jet carrying 64 people en route from Kansas collided with a military Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, sending both aircraft into the icy Potomac River near Washington, D.C. At least 28 bodies had been recovered from the scene Thursday morning. Officials said 27 bodies were recovered from the jet, and one was pulled from the helicopter. 'We don’t believe there are any survivors,' D.C. fire and EMS chief John A. Donnelly said Thursday during a news conference. The midair crash occurred shortly before 9 p.m. local time Wednesday, shutting down the airport until 11 a.m. Thursday. Part of the investigation will revolve around an interaction with air traffic control in the final moments before the collision.

DC crash map: Paths of American Airlines Flight 5342, UH-60 Black...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The collision Wednesday night between a military helicopter and American Airlines Flight 5342 happened in some of the world's most tightly controlled airspace, just over 3 miles south of the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The collision happened at around 9 p.m. when a regional jet at the end of a flight from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter on a training exercise, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The helicopter was a UH-60 Black Hawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia flying south over the Potomac River as the American Airlines flight was flying north. A few minutes before the jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked American Airlines Flight 5342 if it could do so on a shorter runway, and the pilots agreed. Controllers cleared the jet to land, and flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. What we know about the DC plane crash victims Less than 30 seconds before the collision, an air traffic controller asked a helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later, saying, 'PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ' — apparently telling the copter to wait for the Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet to pass. There was no reply. Seconds after that, the aircraft collided. The plane’s radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the Potomac River.

(NEXSTAR) -- American former ice skater Nancy Kerrigan is speaking to the media after a deadly plane crash in Washington, D.C. left no survivors, including skaters from the Skating Club of Boston. Kerrigan, an Olympic medalist, is an alum of the club. Two teenage figure skaters, their mothers and two world champion coaches from Boston were among the 14 members of the skating community killed when an American Airlines flight collided with an Army helicopter Wednesday night and crashed into the frigid waters of the Potomac River. Skating Club of Boston CEO Doug Zeghibe said Thursday that skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane were among those killed, along with 1994 pairs world champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov. In all, 14 of the victims were coming back from a national development camp for promising young skaters following the U.S. Championships in Wichita, Kansas, Zeghibe said. 'Skating is a very close and tight-knit community. These kids and their parents, they’re here at our facility in Norwood, six, sometimes seven days a week. It’s a close, tight bond,' Zeghibe said.

Figure skating community reacts to loss after DC crash	(NewsNation) — The figure skating community has reacted with sorrow over the news that several members of U.S. figure skating were on board the passenger plane that crashed Wednesday night. The American Airlines passenger jet collided with an Army helicopter as it approached the runway at Reagan National Airport. The flight from Wichita, Kansas, had 60 passengers and four crew on board. Two on board were identified as Russian skaters Eveangia Shiskova and Vadim Naumov. The couple were pairs world champions 30 years ago and later became coaches.

Who are Evgenia Shishkova, Vadim Naumov? Championship skaters in ...	NEW YORK (PIX11) – Russian figure skaters Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov were aboard a plane that crashed Wednesday in the Potomac River, according to the Kremlin. Shishkova and Naumov were married and won a 1994 world championship in pairs figure skating. The skaters competed for Russia in the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Olympics, according to the Skating Club of Boston, where they are listed as coaches. The pair have been coaching since the late 1990s after their championship run. In addition to the 1994 win, they took home medals at championships worldwide throughout the 90s. Both studied in St. Petersburg, Russia. No survivors expected in passenger jet, Black Hawk crash near DC 'I like to share my passion and love for the sport of figure skating with my students,' Shishkova said in her coaching bio. Naumov spoke in his coaching bio about coaching his students on and off the ice. Both former champions have coached their students through regional and international championship placement. 'I love to create an environment where students have fun while working hard. I also believe that helping and guiding athletes through their emotional challenges, ups and downs during training and competing are coach’s responsibilities,' he said. The pair's death is a devastating blow to the figure skating community. 'The skating community is small - a lot of people know each other or know of each other What happened last night was devastating,' said figure skating analyst Jackie Wong. 'Please keep the families and loved ones of all involved in your thoughts. Be good to one another.' Audio captures air traffic control at moment of DC crash The Skating Club of Boston sent athletes to the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, which concluded Sunday. The crashed plane contained people coming from the Wichita competition. A jet with 60 passengers and four crew members collided with an Army helicopter Wednesday while approaching the Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington.

Army crew involved in DC crash was ‘fairly experienced’: Hegseth	(NewsNation) — A military helicopter involved in a collision with an American Airlines regional passenger jet near Washington, D.C., was conducting 'an annual required night evaluation,' according to Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth, who was sworn in as secretary Jan. 25, added in a video statement that the helicopter was flown by a 'fairly experienced crew' wearing night-vision goggles. Hegseth said relatives of the crew members aboard the helicopter have not yet been notified. What we know about the DC plane crash victims American Eagle Flight 5342 was en route Wednesday from Wichita, Kansas, with 60 passengers and four crew members aboard when it collided with a UH-60 Black Hawk carrying three soldiers. Both aircraft went into the icy Potomac River, prompting an extensive search and rescue operation. At least 28 bodies were recovered from the scene Thursday morning. Officials said 27 bodies were recovered from the jet and one was pulled from the helicopter. Officials in D.C. fear there are no survivors. Hegseth announced in a post on X that the Pentagon and Army 'immediately' launched an investigation into the collision, calling the incident 'absolutely tragic.' 'Search and rescue efforts still ongoing,' he said, adding, 'Prayers for all impacted souls, and their families.' Air space was closely monitored making collision ‘unimaginable’: Former NTSB official Hegseth said aviation operations from the U.S. Army in D.C. are on a 48-hour operational pause as the crash is reviewed. 'We anticipate that the investigation will quickly be able to determine whether the aircraft was in the quarter and the right altitude at the time of the incident,' he said. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is part of an investigation led by the National Transportation Safety Board. The FAA said it will quickly do what is necessary based on the evidence the probe uncovers.

American Airlines CEO expresses 'deep sorrow' for victims of plan...	ARLINGTON, Va. (WDCW) – Robert Isom, the CEO of American Airlines, has pledged the airline's cooperation with investigations into Wednesday night's crash near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Officials had already confirmed that the PSA Airlines plane (PSA Airlines being a wholly owned subsidiary of AA) was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members when it collided with a military helicopter with three people on board. The PSA Airlines flight had departed from Wichita, Kansas. 28 bodies recovered, no survivors expected in DC plane crash Officials confirmed Thursday morning that there were no survivors, and recovery efforts were underway. In the video statement, Isom shared his 'deep sorrow' for those involved. 'This is a difficult day for all of us at American Airlines. Our efforts now are focused entirely on the needs of our passengers, crew members, partners, first responders along with their families and loved ones,' said Isom.

'Anything we can do now we are doing and right now that means focusing on taking care of all passengers and crew involved as well as their families,' added Isom. American Airlines set up a special helpline (1-800-679-8215) for friends and family members who believe their loved ones were aboard Flight 5342. At a press conference on Thursday morning, officials confirmed that at least 28 bodies had been pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River, where the downed aircraft was located upside down, in three sections. Crews were still searching for other casualties but did not believe there were any survivors, which would make it the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years.

Here are some of the deadliest plane crashes in US history	An American Airlines jet with 60 passengers and four crew members aboard collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. Everyone aboard was feared dead, officials said Thursday. Fatal crashes of commercial aircraft in the U.S. have become a rarity. The deadliest recent crash was in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. All 45 passengers and the four crew members were killed when the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane crashed into a house. One person on the ground also was killed. The collision Wednesday of the Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine plane and UH-60 Blackhawk occurred over the Potomac River and the aircraft fell into the water. In 1982 an Air Florida flight crashed into the Potomac and killed 78. Here are some of the deadliest commercial plane crashes in the U.S. since the Air Florida disaster according to reports from the National Transportation Safety Board: — Feb. 12, 2009: A Colgan Air plane crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane, including 45 passengers, two pilots and two flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. — Aug. 27, 2006: A Comair aircraft crashed when taking off in Lexington, Kentucky, after it left from the wrong runway and ran off the end. Two crew members and 47 passengers were killed. — Nov. 12, 2001: Just after takeoff, an American Airlines flight crashed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York. All 260 people aboard the plane were killed. — Sept. 11, 2001: Nearly 3,000 people were killed as 19 al-Qaida hijackers seized control of four jetliners, sending two of the planes into New York’s World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the fourth into a field in western Pennsylvania. It remains the deadliest terror attack in history. — Jan. 31, 2000: An Alaska Airlines flight crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Anacapa Island, California. The crash killed 83 passengers and five crew members. — July 17, 1996: A Trans World Airlines flight crashed in the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on its way to Paris, France. All 230 people on board were killed, and the airplane was destroyed. — May 11, 1996: A Valujet Airlines flight crashed into the Everglades about 10 minutes after takeoff from the Miami International Airport. The crash killed all 105 passengers and five crew members. — Oct. 31, 1994: An American Eagle flight in Roselawn, Indiana, crashed, killing 64 passengers and four crew members. — Sept. 8, 1994: A USAir flight crashed while attempting to land in Pittsburgh. It killed 127 passengers and five crew members. The airplane was destroyed by the impact and fire. — July 19, 1989: A United Airlines flight experienced an engine failure and crashed while attempting to land in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 110 passengers and one crew member. — Aug. 16, 1987: A Northwest Airlines flight crashed just after taking off in Romulus, Michigan, striking light poles, a rental car facility and the ground. The crash killed 148 passengers and six crew members. — Aug. 2, 1985: A Delta Air Lines flight crashed when approaching to land at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport during a thunderstorm. It struck a car and two water tanks, and killed 134 passengers and crew members. — July 9, 1982: A Pan American World Airways flight crashed just after takeoff near New Orleans, Louisiana, and collided with trees and houses, killing 145 people onboard. — Jan. 13, 1982: An Air Florida flight plummeted into the Potomac, killing 70 passengers and four crew members. That crash was attributed to bad weather.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/ap-here-are-some-of-the-deadliest-plane-crashes-in-us-history/	2025-01-30T06:38:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/679b62de0491a5.11021252.jpeg?w=900
Live: RFK Jr. goes in front of Health committee for 2nd confirmat...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, is going in front of lawmakers for his second confirmation hearing Thursday. He faced senators in the Finance Committee on Wednesday — now he will be questioned by those on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Should Kennedy be confirmed, he will be in charge of a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees insurance for nearly half the country; funnels billions of dollars to the states for Medicaid; and provides health insurance for the nation’s older Americans through Medicare. HELP committee chair Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in his opening statements Thursday, said he agrees with Kennedy on some issues — such as being against ultra-processed food and wanting to reduce obesity. However, Cassidy added, 'it’s no secret I have some reservations about your past positions on vaccines and a couple other issues.' Wednesday's hearing was contentious, with Kennedy grilled over his past remarks on vaccines. Experts say he has a record of spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. What we know about the DC plane crash victims However, Kennedy has tried to downplay these past remarks. 'News reports have claimed that I am anti-vaccine or anti-industry — I am neither. I am pro-safety,' Kennedy said at Wednesday's hearing before being interrupted by a protestor, who was escorted out. Later, Kennedy said he supports the measles and polio vaccine. 'I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking any of those vaccines,' Kennedy said. Still, he made several false claims during the hearing, including about the COVID-19 vaccine, such as that children under six don't need it because they have a 'zero risk' of coronavirus infection. This isn't true: According to several studies, COVID-19 was a leading cause of death for children 1 to 4. The University of Oxford found it ranked seventh as a cause of death among that age group between 2021 and 2022. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends COVID-19 vaccines for those 6 months and older and says the inoculation is safe for children. Kennedy also inaccurately claimed Medicaid is fully paid for by the federal government when in reality, states and federal taxpayers fund it. When it came to the topic of Alzheimer's, Kennedy misstated the state of the science and research, falsely claiming the National Institutes of Health ignores 'any other hypothesis' for it than amyloid. The NIH's $3.8 billion budget for Alzheimer’s and similar dementias includes researching a range of other factors that may underlie how Alzheimer’s develops, the Associated Press reported.

Trump: DC plane crash ‘looks like it should have been prevented’	(The Hill) -- President Donald Trump weighed in on the Wednesday evening crash between an American Airlines plane and military helicopter in Washington, claiming it 'should have been prevented.' 'The airplane was on a perfect and routine line of approach to the airport,' he wrote on Truth Social. 'The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time.' 'It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn. Why didn’t the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane,' he continued. 'This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!!' Officials say ‘no survivors’ expected after crash at Reagan National Airport Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed the sentiment during a press conference Thursday morning. 'We are going to wait for all the information to come in from, from this vantage point, but to back up what the president said, what I’ve seen so far, do I think this was preventable? Absolutely,' he said. Duffy also confirmed that both aircraft had been located, and a federal investigation was underway. Their remarks come after a regional jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew collided with a military helicopter, which was on a training mission, just before landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport on Wednesday evening. American Airlines said the flight was en route from Wichita, Kansas. The two aircraft crashed mid-air as the plane was descending to the runway around 9 p.m. local time, according to officials.

Gabbard, RFK Jr., Patel hearings set to consume Capitol Hill	Hearing-mania is set to consume Capitol Hill on Thursday as a trio of President Trump's top allies appear for high-stakes confirmation showdowns with senators that could make or break their chances of getting across the finish line. Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Kash Patel will simultaneously appear for confirmation hearings Thursday morning, setting up a triple-box of events that are set to command the attention of Washington as GOP members try to keep their unblemished run of confirming Trump’s nominees. 'It’s huge,' said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which Kennedy will appear before. 'We’ll separate the men from the boys tomorrow.' Much of the attention will center on Gabbard, Trump’s pick to become director of national intelligence (DNI), whose confirmation odds are considered the shakiest of the president’s selections amid increasing questions from skeptical Senate Republicans, some of whom are on the Intelligence panel. Those questions had largely surrounded her 2017 meeting with since-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad and remarks she’s made about the war between Ukraine and Russia that were considered sympathetic toward Moscow. However, Senate Republicans have also noted concerns about Gabbard’s stance on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for the warrantless surveillance of foreign targets. Gabbard voted against reauthorizing the program as a member of the House and five years ago called for its repeal, but says she has since changed her stance. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), however, does not believe she has actually changed her position. Collins sits on the Intelligence Committee, which will hear from Gabbard on Thursday and then decide whether to advance her to the floor. Gabbard can’t afford to lose any GOP votes in committee, and with Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) also considered a swing vote on the panel Republicans say Gabbard must use Thursday as an opportunity to convince members she is right for the job. 'Hers will be the most watched right off the bat,' said Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) a friend of the DNI nominee. 'She’s going to be the biggest challenge to get through. I was really bullish about [Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth]. I’m very bullish on Kash. I’m very bullish on [Kennedy].' 'We’ve got a lot of work still to do with Tulsi,' Mullin added. 'I still think she can get confirmed, but there’s still some people to talk to.' Republicans are also keeping open the possibility of advancing Gabbard’s nomination to the floor even if she receives an unfavorable recommendation or no recommendation at all, according to Mullin, who is a close ally of both Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.). 'I think the president will want that floor vote,' Mullin added. As for Kennedy, he will appear for the second straight day before a panel of senators, after enduring a grilling from the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday over his nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The former independent presidential candidate-turned-Trump supporter will come before the HELP committee for what is expected to be a second day of intense questioning from Democrats, who targeted him over his history of comments on vaccines and abortion, among other topics. While Finance Committee Republicans, who will vote on his confirmation, appeared largely unmoved on his nomination, there remains one wild card: Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). Cassidy, who sits on the Finance Committee and chairs the HELP panel, and is himself a doctor, attended almost the entirety of Wednesday’s hearing — a rarity for a senator who isn’t chair. His questioning also revealed Kennedy’s unfamiliarity with Medicare and Medicaid, two health care programs he would oversee at HHS. The Louisiana Republican is also up for reelection in 2026 and is staring down a primary challenge after voting to convict Trump over his actions on Jan. 6, 2021. 'There’s a campaign to protect RFK,' one source close to the Trump team said. 'The MAGA verse has been laying down the line, particularly on Cassidy.' 'Cassidy may get the Joni Ernst treatment of, ‘Hey, you better vote for him or you’re going to have a problem,’' the source added, referring to Trump allies pressuring the Iowa Republican to vote for Hegseth’s confirmation. Cassidy declined to take questions about Kennedy after the hearing. Republicans who watched part of the hearing, however, believed Kennedy’s confirmation chances remain in a good spot and that he will ultimately get the green light on the floor. '[Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren] got in his grill pretty hard. He seemed to handle it fine,' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said, adding that Kennedy will be fine if a repeat of Wednesday occurs. 'I don’t think he did any harm to himself.' Patel is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee with the hopes of maintaining his level of GOP support to become the next FBI director in the coming weeks. For all of the comments that alarmed Democrats and some Republicans over the years, Patel has kept a low profile ever since Trump nominated him to the post in November, giving him a boost with GOP members that will control his fate. Democrats, though, have been trying to elevate him in recent weeks with the hopes of spurring the requisite four Republicans to oppose him. 'I think we got a taste of that from last week,' said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a member of both the Judiciary and HELP committees, pointing to Pam Bondi’s hearing to lead the Justice Department that included numerous mentions of Patel. 'I’m sure it will be this series of horror stories and lots of faux outrage,' Hawley continued. 'What he needs to do is … talk about how he’s going to get the FBI back to fighting crime.' Patel will need all of the help he can get on the GOP side as Democrats on the panel are promising a scorched earth affair in a long-shot attempt to take down his nomination. 'We’re going to introduce him to the American people,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), pointing to Patel’s 'enemies list' and plans to get retribution on them, among other reasons. 'And they’re not going to like him.'

Jocelyn Nungaray's mom: Deportations should have started years ag...	(NewsNation) — Alexis Nungaray, mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, says it's been a relief to see President Donald Trump's deportation flights begin. 'This should have happened years ago,' Nungaray told NewsNation's Blake Burman. 'These guys that took Jocelyn's life should have been on a flight just like that.' Nungaray's 12-year-old daughter, Jocelyn, was sexually assaulted and killed in Houston last June. Two Venezuelan men who were in the country illegally have been charged with capital murder for her death. Jocelyn Nungaray’s mom calls for changes at border Nungaray was at the White House on Wednesday as Trump signed the Laken Riley Act, calling the moment 'surreal' and 'bittersweet.' 'It's a tragedy that we have to be here in the first place,' Nungaray said. 'But it's so remarkable that we get to be here in honor of making change.' Deportation flights from the US to Colombia resume after a diplomatic spat The Laken Riley Act — named after a slain Georgia nursing student who was killed by a Venezuelan man in the country illegally — gives federal authorities broader power to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes. Nungaray said she's honoring her daughter's legacy by pushing for better border security: 'Anyone who has any sort of record doesn't belong here.' The Laken Riley Act received bipartisan support — a point U.S. Senator Ted Budd, R-N.C., emphasized in a conversation with NewsNation on Wednesday. 'Americans want our country safe, and they want us prosperous, and today was about safety,' Budd told Elizabeth Vargas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/jocelyn-nungarays-mother-deportations/	2025-01-29T17:23:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Alexis-Nungaray.jpg?w=852
Trump's return-to-work policy could impact a million federal work...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump’s executive order putting an end to remote work for federal workers is poised to change the job setup of more than a million employees. Half of the federal workforce had been allowed to work remotely as a part of a larger culture shift that occurred during the pandemic. Under new policies, officials estimate that more than 1 million federal workers could be now be impacted, reported The Washington Post. Few agencies have a high volume of employees who can work remotely, government data from the Office of Management and Budget showed. At the Environmental Protection Agency, nearly 98% of 16,000 employees are telework-eligible, with 15% working remotely, reported The Washington Post. In the Department of Veterans Affairs, 26% of 485,000 employees are eligible, with 8% working remotely. However, the Trump administration said it's looking to fill large federal facilities like the Department of Energy, where fewer than 1% of the office spaces are being used, according to the Public Buildings Reform Board. Trump ends remote work, impacting half of federal workers A 2023 Government Accountability Office report said that 17% of the 24 federal agencies are using as little as 9% of federal buildings and only as much as 49% of their building’s capacity. In addition to bringing workers back to the empty desks, Trump says he wants to sell unused federal buildings. However, the shift could cause strain on the agencies if employees leave. It could also hamper opportunities that have helped increase employment for underserved populations, according to a 2023 report from the Office of Personnel Management. Nearly 42,000 veterans and military spouses are teleworking, and 2,250 are doing remote work. About 131,000 individuals with disabilities are able to do telework, and 14,000 can work remotely, the outlet reported. Several unions have pushed back, including one that represents 800,000 federal workers. 'President Trump’s order is a blatant attempt to corrupt the federal government by eliminating employees’ due process rights so they can be fired for political reasons,' said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley. 'It will remove hundreds of thousands of federal jobs from the non-partisan civil service and make them answerable to the will of one man.'

Trump orders Guantanamo Bay readied for criminal migrants	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to make room at Guantanamo Bay for 'high-priority criminal aliens' who are rounded up during mass deportations. The United States has previously held a small number of migrants within Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Following the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S., a detention facility at the site has housed terror suspects and captured combatants. During a bill-signing Wednesday, Trump said there is potentially space for up to 30,000 migrants who are considered dangerous, but the exact capacity wasn’t immediately clear. What happens when you get deported? The Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo traditionally has held foreigners detained at sea, many from Haiti and Cuba, The Associated Press reported. 'I hereby direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to take all appropriate actions to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to full capacity to provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States,' the president said in a memo. Trump said the directive 'is issued in order to halt the border invasion, dismantle criminal cartels, and restore national sovereignty.' Cuba’s foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, blasted the announcement on the social media platform X, the AP said. 'The US government’s decision to imprison migrants at the Guantanamo Naval Base, in an enclave where it created torture and indefinite detention centers, shows contempt for the human condition and international law,' he said.

Many reported drone sightings were not drones: Ex-Navy pilot	(NewsNation) — Reported drone sightings across the country have left people with more questions than answers. The FBI has received more than 5,000 reports of drone sightings. However, John Slaughter, the director of the University of Maryland’s UAS Research and Operations Center, told NewsNation that many of the sightings he’s reviewed may not be drones. Did the Biden admin actually send $50M worth of condoms to Gaza? 'I can tell you if it’s a quarter-mile away or 30 miles away on a clear night, you can’t tell what you’re looking at,' Slaughter, who served as a Navy pilot for 30 years, said. 'All you know is what you see is a light, and the light is moving. But you don’t know how big it is, you don’t know how fast it’s moving, you don’t know what direction it’s traveling.' Spotting a drone versus other aircraft Because the vast majority of drone sightings took place at night, the darkness and the difficulty in accurately determining the distance from the ground make properly identifying an object more difficult, Slaughter said. The Federal Aviation Administration requires drones to fly at a maximum altitude of 400 feet, but only relying on the aircraft’s lights to gauge what an object is may lead to drones being misidentified, he said. This photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, N.J., on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Trisha Bushey via AP) While some who reported mysterious drone sightings said they saw objects the size of cars, drones would not fall into that category, Slaughter said. Lights on drones are typically white, red or green, according to the website Pilot Institute, which reported that a drone operator flying a drone at night without lights is difficult, if not impossible. The FAA only requires drones to have one flashing anticollision light on the aircraft, and all other lights are optional. Drones owned by the director of the University of Maryland’s UAS Research and Operations Center are used for both photography and scientific research. (Photo courtesy of the University of Maryland) According to FAA regulations, drones can only weigh up to 55 pounds, and Slaughter said that the flight of drones operated by his team at the University of Maryland typically measures 5 feet in diameter from rotor to rotor. The better indicator of a drone comes down to sound and flight behavior. Most of the multirotor drones, which are typically known as quadcopters, have a unique high-pitched sound when they are in flight. The sound is different from helicopters, which tend to be more low-pitched, Slaughter said. ‘Show of force’: Inside the National Guard training on the border Drones have the ability to stop immediately and execute sudden, sharp turns, which airplanes and helicopters are not capable of. Reports of drones flying in a pattern or a cluster were more than likely commercial aircraft waiting to land at a local airport. Meanwhile, aircraft that are in a holding pattern would fly in a racetrack pattern, he said. Are drone operators knowingly breaking the law? Some operators may be clueless about violating FAA rules. Others may understand that they are breaking the rules but don’t care. The criminal element, however, represents a 'tiny, tiny, tiny fraction' of operators, and those who are using drones for nefarious activities likely would do so without lights being turned on. Drone detection devices Drones built since 2023 require Remote ID technology, which transmits information about the drone’s location, latitude, longitude, flight direction and ground location of the drone operator. Some officials are calling for the U.S. military to shoot down drones seen over New Jersey and other states recently. Technology called Dedrone, used by the U.S. military, can detect this information. States like New York and New Jersey have requested access to this technology. For the average citizen, there are a handful of apps that can provide assistance to sky watchers and aircraft enthusiasts, but the effectiveness of the technology is not always reliable, Slaughter said. Trump to Musk: ‘Go get’ Starliner astronauts from ISS Although the information that is produced by mobile apps can be useful, a person’s level of knowledge of what they are looking at comes into play when the information is not reliable. Because many do not have aviation training and fall under the novice category, many people simply assumed what they were seeing were drones, Slaughter said. The search for answers On Tuesday, the White House confirmed that drones spotted in several states last year 'was not the enemy' but were authorized by the FAA for research and various other purposes. The FBI, FAA and other federal agencies determined that the objects being seen were not the property of the U.S. military or foreign governments. President Donald Trump promised to deliver a report on the drones after accusing former President Joe Biden and other federal agencies of not being transparent about drones with the American public. Slaughter told NewsNation he does not expect a definitive answer to arrive any time soon. 'I think we’ve got what we’re going to get,' he said. 'Some of them were drones, many of them were planes and other regular aircraft, and there were other phenomena and other unidentified flying objects later shown to be other things like weather balloons and planets.' Slaughter says that Congress needs to update laws giving more authority to the military and law enforcement to mitigate unauthorized drone flights in sensitive areas such as military installations and restricted airspace. He hesitates to put a percentage on the reported drone sightings that he believes were actually drones but believes it was limited in number. As a former pilot who often encountered other aircraft that he couldn’t immediately identify, the challenge in properly identifying what one is seeing is real, he said. 'Lights in the night sky are weird,' Slaughter said. 'And it’s just tough to tell what you’re seeing.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/drone-sightings-john-slaughter/	2025-01-29T13:31:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/GettyImages-486714640.jpg?w=724

Trump to target critical race theory, promote school choice	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Wednesday that would defund K-12 schools that teach radical gender ideology or critical race theory (CRT), according to White House documents obtained by NewsNation. According to the documents, the goal is to shift focus back to 'excellence and patriotism,' preparing students to become 'patriotic citizens ready for the workforce, not political activists.' The order mandates that within 90 days, the secretary of education must present a strategy to eliminate CRT and radical gender ideology in school lessons, the documents said.

RFK Jr. faces first confirmation hearing for health secretary	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, will face senators Wednesday for the first of two confirmation hearings. The hearing, set to take place before the Senate Finance Committee, is expected to focus on Kennedy's stances on vaccines and abortion. If confirmed, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country. Wednesday's confirmation hearing is set to begin at 10 a.m. ET. Kennedy's second hearing is set for Thursday before the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. What are RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines and abortion? Kennedy, a former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump, has sparked concerns about his record of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines. He has made claims linking vaccines to autism and has said that 'no vaccine is safe and effective.' Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump’s funding freeze However, more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, asserting he is not anti-vaccine and promising not to 'take away' shots if confirmed. Additionally, some Republicans are worried about Kennedy's past support of abortion rights. Former Vice President Mike Pence has suggested the Senate reject Kennedy based on his position. Caroline Kennedy slams RFK Jr. as a 'predator' Meanwhile, a searing letter to senators from Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, could bring fireworks. In the letter, Caroline Kennedy, former ambassador to Australia and Japan, called Kennedy a 'predator,' urging lawmakers to block his confirmation. She also made claims that he 'preys on the desperation of parents of sick children' and highlighted allegations of drug use and animal mutilation, warning he is addicted to power and thus disqualified from leading HHS. 'Unlike Bobby, I try not to speak for my father — but I am certain that he and my uncle Bobby, whogave their lives in public service, and my uncle Teddy, who devoted his Senate career to improvinghealth care, would be disgusted,' Caroline Kennedy wrote. Lara Trump: Caroline Kennedy’s comments on RFK Jr. ‘disgusting’ What are RJK Jr.'s chances of getting confirmed? Kennedy's confirmation remains uncertain, with some Republicans on both committees still not committing to a vote. He has received some support among Democrats for his stances on food regulations and removing dyes and additives.Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician and chair of the Senate Health Committee, has voiced concerns about Kennedy's past vaccine comments. He's said he's spoken with Kennedy but remains undecided. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who will participate in Wednesday's hearing, has raised concerns over Kennedy's abortion views. Other senators, including Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., have shown a willingness to support him. 'We don't agree on everything, but what we both agree is that America has some health problems, and we believe that the key to fixing that is nutrition, as well as decreasing their chronic exposure to toxins. So, I look forward to working with him,' Marshall said. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a polio survivor who has emphasized the importance of the vaccine, could be another key figure to watch.

Trump to Musk: 'Go get' Starliner astronauts from ISS	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump says he's told Elon Musk to retrieve two astronauts who have been stuck on the International Space Station for months longer than expected. It's unclear precisely what the plan is, since SpaceX was already slated to bring them home in March. Neither Trump nor Musk have clarified if the timing or mission have changed. 'I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to 'go get' the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration,' Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday night. 'They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!' Astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore rode a Boeing Starliner to the station in June 2024 for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission. But NASA had concerns about the Starliner after years of delays, plus leaks and thruster problems during its trip to the station, so it came back to Earth without them in September. SpaceX was planning to retrieve the pair in February aboard its Crew-9 capsule, but that was pushed back a month when NASA announced that crew's replacement would not make it to the station until March. 'This is my happy place. I love being up here in space,' Williams said when the vehicle left without them. 'This is not easy. NASA does a great job, the people at NASA do a great job making things look easy,' Wilmore said. 'It’s a very risky business, and things don’t always turn out the way you want.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/trump-musk-spacex-iss-starliner-astronauts/	2025-01-29T03:24:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/67522bf144c298.44822484.jpeg?w=900
Does bird flu make eggs unsafe to eat?	(NEXSTAR) — Eggs are expensive, if you can even find them at your local grocery store, and prices are only expected to climb this year. The main factor that has sent egg prices rising is the bird flu, which may draw a whole new concern to your mind: are eggs even safe to eat right now? Generally, yes. Are eggs cheaper under Trump? TikToker intends to hold administration accountable The U.S. Department of Agriculture also reports that the chances of eggs or poultry infected by the bird flu entering the food chain are 'extremely low.' A quick onset of symptoms in infected poultry, as well as flock testing and inspections, are able to reduce the likelihood of contaminated products reaching store shelves. Further, eggs, like poultry, that are prepared correctly and cooked properly are safe to consume, the USDA notes. That applies regardless of whether there's a bird flu outbreak or not. A sign asks customers to consider limiting their purchases of eggs at a PCC Community Markets grocery store due to shortages caused by avian flu on Jan. 27 in Seattle. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) When it comes to cooking, eggs and poultry should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. This will kill bacteria and viruses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, including avian influenza A viruses. Storing eggs properly — aka, in the refrigerator — is also important. While eggs in the U.S. are pasteurized in the shell, killing bacteria on the shell, the process can make the porous shells more vulnerable to bacteria. Food prices increase 2.4% annually: Bureau Labor Statistics Eggs can be frozen, but not in their shells, the Food and Drug Administration warns. Instead, the egg yokes and whites should be beaten and stored together. Egg whites can also be frozen on their own. Uncooked or undercooked eggs (or meat) can put you at risk of being infected with other diseases. Eggs, in particular, can carry salmonella. Still, proper storage and cooking can help protect you, officials explain. So far, most of the U.S.'s 67 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans have been linked to exposure from infected dairy cows. About two dozen were linked to infected poultry and one to a backyard flock, NewsNation affiliate The Hill previously reported. Earlier this month, the CDC confirmed the first human death linked to the virus. The CDC has recommended hospitals speed up testing patients seeking care for the flu for H5N1 bird flu while insisting the risk of humans becoming ill is low.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/bird-flu-eggs-expensive-unsafe/	2025-01-29T02:49:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25027861626893-e1738100231551.jpg?w=800
Lara Trump: Caroline Kennedy's comments on RFK Jr. 'disgusting'	(NewsNation) — Caroline Kennedy's attack on cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is 'part of that political game,' Lara Trump said during a Tuesday appearance on 'CUOMO.' Caroline Kennedy posted a video reading a scathing letter to senators about her family member, in which she called the Trump administration nominee a 'predator' who is distorting his father's legacy to 'advance his own failed presidential campaign.' Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and former co-chair of the Republican National Committee, believes the letter is just 'sour grapes' from a family of longtime Democrats. ‘He’ll go down’: RFK nomination won’t pass Senate, O’Reilly says 'There is no doubt that the reason Caroline Kennedy came out with this video in the time frame that she did was because she was probably encouraged by the Democrats to do it,' she said. The comments come ahead of RFK Jr.'s appearance before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this week, part of the path to confirmation as President Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Lara Trump told NewsNation she doesn't think Caroline Kennedy's comments will change his confirmation chances. 'I think that everybody should watch the confirmation hearing, listen to the answers that he delivers, and take them at face value ... So, I don't think it will be any different,' she said. Public confidence in US health agencies declines, survey says Caroline Kennedy calls RFK Jr. a 'predator' In a video posted to X, Kennedy said that her cousin 'lacks any relevant government, financial, management or medical experience' to qualify him to lead the nation’s health agencies — but added that his 'personal qualities' pose 'even greater concern.' 'I have known Bobby my whole life; we grew up together. It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,' she wrote in a letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance and HELP committees. Pence group uses Trump’s criticism against RFK Jr. in new ad 'I watched his younger brothers and cousins follow him down the path of drug addiction. His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse sense of despair and violence,' she wrote. Kennedy said she hadn’t previously denounced her cousin’s nomination because she had been U.S. ambassador to Australia and was also reluctant to publicly criticize a family member.

Public confidence in US health agencies declines, survey says	(NewsNation) — Public confidence in U.S. health agencies has dropped over the past 18 months, according to a new survey that also indicates some skepticism about President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. Fifty-three percent of the public said they trust the Food and Drug Administration to make accurate recommendations about health matters at least 'a fair amount' of the time, the Kaiser Family Foundation poll said. That’s down from 65% in June 2023 as the pandemic was ending, the organization said. Similarly, the share of people who said they trust their state and local public health officials fell from 64% in 2023 to 54% now, the survey said. Trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped from 66% to 61% over the same time frame. ‘He’ll go down’: RFK nomination won’t pass Senate, O’Reilly says The catch: The survey compilers found that people’s trust in health institutions tended to fall along party lines, with Democrats showing greater support for them, Republicans showing less and independents in the middle. Partisanship also factors into responses about President Trump, whose first term coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, and Kennedy, who has faced criticisms for his stances on vaccines and other health issues. Caroline Kennedy tells senators: RFK Jr. is a ‘predator’ The overall public trust in Trump and Kennedy to make the right recommendations on health issues was a little over 40%. The level of trust for both of them, however, was more than 80% among Republicans, the survey said. Kennedy faces his first confirmation hearings in the Senate beginning Wednesday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/public-confidence-drop-health-agencies/	2025-01-28T17:44:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/676df134764ef6.96609821.jpeg?w=900
Border officials anticipate escalation in cartel threats	(NewsNation) — The region of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas where suspected members of Mexican drug cartels exchanged gunfire with U.S. border officials Monday has been targeted by organized criminal organizations for drug and human smuggling for decades. But after no one was injured in an incident Monday when cartel members shot at Border Patrol agents, Lt. Christopher Olivarez, spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said he only expects more incidents to follow. Olivarez told NewsNation on Tuesday that Fronton, Texas, the area where the gunfire exchange took place, is one of the 'most active, violent' border regions that agents patrol. Was there an ICE raid at Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego? 'For decades, the Mexican drug cartels have used that area to facilitate drug smuggling, human smuggling,' Olivarez said. Olivarez said that in 2023, the state acquired a 123-acre parcel of land that was being used by cartels to seek refuge for criminal operations. Now, he said the state is investigating whether it can obtain the area where Monday’s gunfire exchange took place to keep incidents like Monday’s from taking place. 'We have seen encounters with the cartels where they do engage law enforcement. They shoot toward them,' he said. However, Olivarez said that as the crackdown on the U.S-Mexico border under President Donald Trump continues, he expects conditions could worsen. He said that as illegal border crossings drop under Trump, the cartels will have their bottom line impacted. 'With that, we expect to see an escalation in threats,' Olivarez told NewsNation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/border-escalation-cartel-threats/	2025-01-28T14:18:16-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GiWjQD4XEAALF34.jpg?w=360

Drones sighted in Northeast ‘not a threat’: White House When asked specifically if Medicaid would be affected by the pause, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied, 'I'll check back on that and get back to you.' A short time later, Leavitt posted on social media that the White House is aware of the Medicaid website portal outage. 'We have confirmed no payments have been affected,' Leavitt wrote on X. 'They are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly.' What is Medicaid? Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for some people with limited income and resources, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency said that Medicaid offers benefits that Medicare does not normally cover such as nursing home care and personal care services. Medicaid recipients typically do not pay anything for covered medical expenses but may owe a small co-payment for some items or services. As of October, more than 72 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid, according to data. What is the difference between Medicaid and Medicare? Medicare is federal health insurance for Americans who are ages 65 and older as well as for some people who are under 65 but suffer from certain disabilities or conditions, the Department of Health and Human Services said. Medicare is run by a federal agency known as the Centers for Medical and Medicaid Services. Medicare, because it is a federal program, has set standards for costs and coverage. This guarantees that a person's Medicare coverage will be the same regardless of where they live. White House press briefing discusses federal assistance, deportation Medicare-related bills are paid from two trust funds that are held by the U.S. Treasury, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The trust funds are sourced with payroll taxes and other funds that are authorized by Congress. Medicare recipients pay a portion of the costs through monthly premiums for medical and drug coverage, deductibles and co-insurance. As of March 2023, nearly 66 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, according to data. Who qualifies for Medicaid? According to Medicaid.gov, federal law requires that states cover certain groups of individuals. This includes low-income families, qualified women who are preganant and children as well as Americans who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Individual states also have additional options for Medicaid coverage and may choose to extend coverage to other groups such as residents who receive home and community-based services or children who are in foster care who otherwise are not eligible for coverage, the website said. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 provided the option for states to expand Medicaid to include nearly all low-income Americans who are under the age of 65. The website said that eligiblity for children was extended to at least 133% of the fedreal poverty level in every state. The Affordable Care Act also established new methods for determining Medicaid eligibility, which is based on Modified Adjusted Gross Income. This is a developing story.

Trump federal grant pause: Who could be affected?	(NewsNation) — The Trump administration is temporarily pausing grants, loans and other federal financial assistance starting Tuesday, an order that's set off confusion among the many groups that depend on federal funds. The directive from the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Matthew Vaeth, was sent out Monday instructing federal agencies to temporarily pause 'all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.' Vaeth's memo was light on specifics but clarified that federal assistance to individuals, like Social Security and Medicare, would not be impacted. Instead, the order is intended to make sure federal funding is aligned with Trump's recent executive orders. Trump administration freezes nearly all federal loans and grants 'The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,' Vaeth wrote. The pause, set to take effect Tuesday at 5 p.m. ET, could affect trillions of dollars, potentially disrupting health care research, education funding and other such programs. The memo calls on agencies to submit 'detailed information on any programs, projects or activities subject to this pause' to OMB by February 10. Here's what to know. List: All of Trump’s executive orders on the economy Who will be affected by the pause? The funding pause could affect trillions of dollars, but it's still unclear which programs will be impacted and how. Vaeth's memo is full of carve-outs and says OMB may grant exceptions that allow Federal agencies to 'issue new awards' or 'take other actions' on a 'case-by-case basis.' 'The vague and contradictory language makes it hard to know if funding is imperiled for public schools, community health centers, state and local law enforcement, veterans’ housing, health care through Medicaid, public services on tribal lands, etc,' wrote Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. In fiscal year 2021, $2.8 trillion in federal funding was distributed to states, communities, tribal governments and other recipients using Census Bureau data. Some of the top federal assistance programs funded health care, nutrition, highways, housing, school lunches, child care and COVID-19 assistance. The federal budget provides about 30% of state revenue, making it the single largest source of revenue in many states, according to the Federal Funds Information for States (FFIS). Will Social Security and Medicare be impacted? The memo says that federal assistance to individuals won't be affected, meaning Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and other such programs won't change. 'Nothing in this memo should be construed to impact Medicare or Social Security benefits,' Vaeth wrote. However, Medicaid, the health care program for low-income people and families, is reportedly having issues. 'My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze,' Oregon's senior US senator, Democrat Ron Wyden, wrote on X. What about student loans? The Education Department said the temporary pause does not impact assistance received directly by individuals, therefore students who rely on federal financial aid to cover tuition and other costs aren't expected to see any disruptions. 'Title IV, HEA funds that are provided to individual students, such as Federal Pell Grants and Direct Loans, are not impacted by yesterday’s guidance,' Madi Biedermann, spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education, told NewsNation. More than 40 million Americans have federal student loans, and about 7 million students receive Pell Grants each year in the United States. The Association of American Universities (AAU), composed of roughly 70 research universities, told NewsNation it's still working to assess the potential impact on research funding. Will the pause go into effect? The pause is scheduled to take effect at 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday, but a coalition of state attorneys general plans to file suit to block the order. New York Attorney General Letitia James is leading the charge and plans to ask a Manhattan federal court to intervene. 'My office will be taking imminent legal action against this administration's unconstitutional pause on federal funding,' James wrote on social media Tuesday. Other states joining the suit are California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, according to The New York Times. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell, a Democrat, called Trump's directive 'a reckless abuse of power.' 'This will hurt families. We're exploring prompt action to stop it,' Campbell said on X. This is a developing story that will continue to be updated.

Drones sighted in Northeast 'not a threat': White House	(NewsNation) — The White House said drones sighted across the Northeast are licensed by the FAA and are not a threat. Rumors and speculation circulated about the origin of large drones seen in the skies above New Jersey and other states, with fears they could originate from foreign adversaries. President Donald Trump vowed to get to the bottom of the issue and in a White House press briefing on Tuesday, the administration said the drones are no threat and are properly licensed by the FAA. The Biden administration had also worked to downplay concerns over the drones, identifying them as a mix of commercial and hobby drones.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/drones-northeast-not-threat/	2025-01-28T10:22:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/DronesNJ-e1734134961775.jpg?w=800
What to know about White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt	Karoline Leavitt is set on Tuesday to preside over her first briefing with reporters as press secretary for President Trump’s White House. Leavitt was Trump's top spokesperson along the 2024 campaign trail and has been one of his chief messengers during the early days of his second administration. Live: White House press briefing Here are four things to know about Leavitt ahead of her first briefing. Leavitt is the youngest person to ever serve in the role Leavitt, 27, is the youngest person to hold the position of press secretary since Ron Ziegler, who worked as President Nixon’s top press official and was 29 when he was hired. She was widely viewed as the favorite to land the press secretary gig. Several former Trump officials told The Hill after she was hired that Leavitt was the obvious choice, given her record defending Trump on the campaign trail and close relationship with the president. On Tuesday, she will be tasked with defending a flood of executive orders and actions handed down during Trump's first week in office and promoting the administration's agenda before what is expected to be a widely televised audience. Leavitt has teased a briefing room shake up Like other top allies of the president, Leavitt has suggested the White House could change the way business in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room is conducted or who gets to ask questions during press conferences. Leavitt has said during a number of media appearances she looks forward to taking questions from mainstream media reporters and will not be shy about pushing back on assertions or premises she disagrees with. 5 takeaways from Trump’s whirlwind week back at the White House 'We hope there will be decorum, certainly, and we will try to instill that,' she said during a Fox News appearance last month. 'But we’re not shy of the hostile media.' Leavitt worked in Trump's first White House Before joining Trump’s 2024 campaign, Leavitt was a top aide to Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), another Trump ally whom he chose to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Leavitt served as a press aide and speechwriter for Trump during his first administration under former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a Fox News host. McEnany has spoken glowingly about Leavitt's fitness for the role. Here are the 5 biggest issues facing the new Trump administration On Tuesday, Leavitt will find herself in the national spotlight as Trump's presidency enters its second week. Leavitt ran for Congress After working in Trump's first White House, Leavitt ran an unsuccessful 2022 campaign for New Hampshire’s 1st District, after winning a contested GOP primary.

Chicago will 'not forfeit our humanity': Mayor	(NewsNation) — An invitation for Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to appear before the House Oversight Committee is under legal review, according to the city's legal counsel. Appearing at a news conference Tuesday, Johnson said Chicago is standing firm in its status as a 'welcoming city' and will not be made to forfeit its humanity. 'We will not surrender that,' he said. ICE reports 3,500 arrests in first week of Trump’s presidency Immigration actions in Chicago The city's legal counsel said an invitation for Johnson to appear before Congress is under review but did not comment further on how the city might respond. Johnson detailed efforts to empower citizens, including the publication of 'Know Your Rights' guides and working with community organizations, schools, hospitals, businesses and houses of worship to ensure the needs of those groups are being met. So far, Johnson said there is no evidence that people have failed to report crimes because of fear of deportation. He said that no one should fear coming forward if they are a victim of a crime because they do not have documents. He urged citizens to familiarize themselves with the laws to protect themselves and their neighbors. City officials said they believe 100 people in the greater Chicagoland area have been detained as a result of immigration actions. Johnson also noted that people without documents who have been convicted of serious crimes have always been subject to deportation and reiterated that being a welcoming city simply means city authorities do not do the work of immigration enforcement that falls under the duty of the federal government. Trump administration freezes nearly all federal loans and grants 'We stand together firmly in our welcoming city status as well as our commitment to protecting all residents of the city of Chicago no matter where you come from or how long you've lived here,' Johnson said. Federal funding freeze Johnson also addressed the freeze put on federal financial assistance, noting that it could affect a wide variety of services that people rely on. The city said the order is under legal review to determine exactly what impact it will have on projects and funding. 'There's a real goal here to sow fear into the American people,' Johnson said. Johnson said President Donald Trump has failed to address the concerns of everyday Americans worried about how to afford rent, child care and groceries, all of which could be impacted by the freeze. 'There's no answer from this administration,' Johnson said, regarding Americans' concerns over basic needs. City officials said since the election, they have been working on ways to continue to protect and serve residents during changes put into place by the new administration. Mass deportations could hinder US agriculture 'I wish I had a better understanding of why this administration has shown such disdain for the working people,' Johnson said. He noted that American taxpayers expect a return on their tax dollars in the form of investment in society and programs that help people meet basic needs like child care and housing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/chicago-not-forfeit-humanity-mayor/	2025-01-28T09:56:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/GettyImages-2152121318.jpg?w=900
Live: White House press briefing	(NewsNation) — New White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the media from the White House for the first time now as President Donald Trump's administration carries out his deportation promises. Trump is telling members of his party that he will push to allow for the deportation of repeat criminal offenders who are in the country legally. He says it will cause crime nationwide to 'dry up.' 'I also will be seeking permission to do so,' Trump said during an address of House Republicans at their annual policy retreat in Florida on Monday. 'We're going to get approval, hopefully, to get them the hell out of our country, along with others, let them be brought to a foreign land and maintained by others for a very small fee, as opposed to being maintained in our jails for massive amounts of money.' ICE reports 3,500 arrests in first week of Trump’s presidency 'That's what Venezuela and other countries are doing. They're getting rid of their criminals and putting them into the United States of America,' Trump said. Deportation flights to Colombia have begun after its president caved to Trump's wishes to allow the transportation of migrants illegally in the U.S. amid the threat of tariffs and other measures. The Pentagon has moved 1,500 U.S. troops to the border, bringing the total of forces along the border to nearly 4,000. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X on Monday night: 'This is only just the beginning. We will get 100% OPERATIONAL CONTROL of our nation’s border. It is about time.' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shared images on X of U.S. soldiers and Marines at the southern border, accompanied by a message: 'Promise Made. Promise Kept.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-deportation-repeat-criminal-legally-us/	2025-01-28T08:02:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195559727.jpg?w=900
No one injured after Border Patrol, cartel shootout in Texas	(NewsNation) — U.S. Border Patrol was involved in a shootout with cartel members in the Rio Grande Valley, the Texas Department of Public Safety says. The tense moments unfolded Monday in Fronton, Texas. At around 1:40 p.m, shots were fired from the Mexican side of the border at agents. The Border Patrol agents took cover, returned fire, and called for backup. Drone footage from Texas DPS shows suspected cartel members fleeing after firing the shots. No one was injured on either side. Department of Homeland Security sources tell NewsNation the cartel members were attempting to smuggle a group across the river, but they did not make it onto U.S. soil. What is the minimum income to file this year’s tax return? An investigation into the incident is ongoing. U.S. agents are working closely with Mexican authorities. At this time, no arrests have been made. 'The State of Texas will continue to monitor the area closely and use every resource available to prevent transnational threats to our law enforcement partners and the homeland,' Texas DPS spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez said on X. Texas National Guard sent to Rio Grande Valley The Rio Grande Valley is a place notorious for cartel activity and human smuggling. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed 400 additional Texas National Guard troops to the area. They arrived in McAllen on Monday from the Texas Technical Border Force unit. The Border Force Unite was launched in 2023 as part of Texas’ operation Lone Star initiative. Border Patrol agents on the ground in the Rio Grande Valley say they welcome the additional manpower and support.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/border-patrol-cartel-shootout/	2025-01-28T07:24:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GiWjQD4XEAALF34.jpg?w=360
Trump administration freezes nearly all federal loans and grants	(The Hill) - The Trump administration late Monday directed federal agencies to pause the disbursement of loans and grants while the government conducts a review to ensure spending aligns with President Trump’s agenda. A memo issued by acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Matthew Vaeth directs federal agencies to temporarily pause 'all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.' 'This temporary pause will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities,' the memo states. The memo indicates that Social Security or Medicare benefits should not be impacted, nor should assistance that is provided directly to individuals. The pause goes into effect at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, according to the memo, which was reviewed by The Hill. OMB may grant exceptions for certain awards on a case-by-case basis, the memo states. Federal agencies are instructed to conduct a review to determine whether federal loan and grant programs are impacted by Trump’s wave of executive orders during his first week in office. Those orders were related to border security, the federal workforce, ending the 'weaponization' of government, the military and other aspects of government. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the memo. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) lambasted the move in a statement late Monday, saying the pause on federal disbursements 'blatantly disobeys the law' and expressing skepticism that it is just a temporary hold. 'Congress approved these investments and they are not optional; they are the law. These grants help people in red states and blue states, support families, help parents raise kids, and lead to stronger communities,' Schumer said. 'Donald Trump’s Administration is jeopardizing billions upon billions of community grants and financial support that help millions of people across the country,' he added. 'It will mean missed payrolls and rent payments and everything in between: chaos for everything from universities to non-profit charities.' Trump and his nominee to lead OMB, Russ Vought, have signaled they may seek to expand presidential authority over the agency. Trump has also talked about challenging the Impoundment Control Act by using presidential authority to hold back certain funding appropriated by Congress.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-freezes-federal-loans-grants/	2025-01-28T06:00:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/trump_donald_02142025_GettyImages-2195057904-e1738062162228.jpg?w=900
ICE reports 3,500 arrests in first week of Trump's presidency	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents say they made nearly 1,200 arrests Monday, setting a new record since President Donald Trump reintroduced his 'zero tolerance' policy on illegal immigration after returning to the White House last week. The surge in arrests came as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited New York City on Tuesday and as ICE operations extended across major U.S. cities, including Chicago, Miami, Phoenix and Atlanta. Raids have also been reported in Los Angeles and Denver. Noem shared a video on X showing one of the arrests with the caption, 'Criminal alien with kidnapping, assault &amp; burglary charges is now in custody' and added, 'Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets.' More than 1,500 active-duty troops at southern border Since Trump's return to the White House, ICE agents have reportedly arrested more than 3,500 undocumented migrants, with more than half occurring since raids began over the weekend. Aiding in these efforts are more than 1,500 active-duty troops along the southern border, joining some 2,500 National Guard and Army Reserve troops already deployed in the area. What's happening with ICE raids and the border under Trump? Tom Homan, Trump's 'border czar,' emphasized these efforts are just the beginning. 'President Trump's going to secure the borders as promised to the American people. We're going to enforce immigration law. So that's what we're going to do, without apology. We're on board, we're going to go forward, you're going to see it get a hell of a lot bigger in the near future,' he said. However, not everyone supports Trump's tough new immigration measures. Quaker groups have filed a lawsuit aimed at blocking ICE agents from raiding 'sensitive locations,' such as houses of worship, playgrounds and hospitals, without approval from supervisors. This marks the first legal challenge to Trump's policies from a faith-based organization. Congress targets sanctuary cities Meanwhile, members of Congress are starting to push back against local leaders who refuse to cooperate with Trump's deportation efforts. The House Oversight Committee sent letters to the mayors of Chicago, Boston, New York and Denver, requesting more information about their efforts to assist with the raids. DOJ fires prosecutors who worked on Trump criminal cases Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the committee, called for the mayors to testify before Congress next month. 'Congress must determine whether further legislation is necessary to enhance border security and public safety,' Comer said in a statement Monday. It is unclear whether the mayors will agree to appear before the committee.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ice-arrests-in-trumps-first-week/	2025-01-28T04:19:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195569259.jpg?w=900
Google Maps to rename Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America'	Google said on Monday that it will change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America' in Google Maps once it is updated in the U.S. Geographic Names System. Google Maps will also change the name of Denali in Alaska to 'Mount McKinley.' 'We’ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a long-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,' the company said in an X post. But users in other countries will see both names displayed on the map in line with a long-standing practice, the company said. Gulf of Whatnow? Trump’s geographic renaming plans leave mapmakers pondering what to do next President Donald Trump ordered the name changes the day of his inauguration last week, making good on his campaign promise. The federal government has since formally implemented the directive to rename both. The Gulf of Mexico change is new, but naming the nation’s highest peak has been a matter of debate for years. The Obama administration decided to formally name it Denali in 2015, the name that local Natives once used. Former President McKinley, for whom the mountain is once again named, never visited Alaska. His name was first used for the summit in an article written by a gold prospector in 1897 and was popularized after his 1901 assassination.

ICE causing ‘state of terror’ in Chicago: Alderman Sigcho Lopez	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's influx of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations is causing panic and hurting people in Chicago, said Byron Sigcho Lopez, the Democratic alderman for Chicago’s 25th Ward. On Sunday, Trump border czar Tom Homan and the acting deputy attorney general were in the city as ICE operations ramped up. It came just days after reports leaked of mass deportation raids planned in the sanctuary city. 'I think that to deploy the force of government against innocent people sends a chilling effect,' Sigcho Lopez told NewsNation. Dems take ‘government for granted’ on immigration: Chicago alderman '[It's] not something that a democratic president will do, but something the dictators do to bypass the constitutional rights to criminalize entire communities,' he added. Sigcho Lopez said that local businesses are reporting losses, parents aren't putting kids in school, and people are not going to hospitals or churches amid fear of ICE. He said that some 'MAGA fanatics' even harassed churchgoers in the ward. ICE now allowed to make arrests in and near churches and schools The alderman pointed to the pardoning of 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters as hypocritical, telling NewsNation that the hundreds of Oath Keepers and Proud Boys are facing less persecution than 'children who go to school.' Chicago and state officials, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have vowed to protect immigrant communities from mass deportations. Mayor Brandon Johnson shared on X: 'We’ve received reports of ICE enforcement activity in Chicago today. Please know that Chicago police were not involved. My team and I are working closely with City officials.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/ice-chicago-alderman-sigcho-lopez/	2025-01-27T15:52:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195569259.jpg?w=900
DOJ fires prosecutors who worked on Trump criminal cases	Justice Department officials fired several prosecutors who worked on President Trump's criminal cases, saying they could not 'trust' them. The move impacted at least a dozen prosecutors who worked both on Trump’s election interference case as well as another for improperly retaining records at Mar-a-Lago. Rumors about ICE raids stoke fear amid deportations 'Today, Acting Attorney General James McHenry terminated the employment of a number of DOJ officials who played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,' a DOJ official said in a statement. 'In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the President’s agenda. This action is consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.' CNN first reported the terminations. The firings come as The Wall Street Journal reported DOJ is likewise asking prosecutors who worked on the case of Jan. 6 defendants to turn over their files on those who were charged with felony obstruction under 1512(c)(2). That direction comes after the Supreme Court last year sided with a Jan. 6 defendant in determining the statute had been too broadly applied.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doj-prosecutors-trump-criminal-cases/	2025-01-27T14:00:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/doj_062724gn06_w.jpg?w=900
Bishop who enraged Trump says she was speaking from faith	(NewsNation) — Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde said she spoke from the 'foundation of her faith' and not a political perspective when she called upon President Donald Trump to have mercy for vulnerable communities during her inauguration sermon last week. 'I spoke to the president about the need for mercy, again a pretty solid Christian spiritual tenant … it feels pretty straightforward,' Budde told NewsNation's partner The Hill. 'If I were seen as partisan, I think that would be problematic, but given the way the country is divided, what I'm saying right now is perceived as partisan. 'But I'm not basing it on the Democratic Party. I'm basing it on my Christian faith and how I interpret what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ.' Who is Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop who drew Trump’s ire at prayer service? The Episcopalian bishop of Washington was thrust into the national spotlight during Trump’s first week in office after she called on him to have compassion for transgender children and migrants at a National Cathedral prayer service for the inauguration. 'I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,' she said. 'There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic, Republican, and independent families, some who fear for their lives.' Trump, who sat alongside Vice President JD Vance and both their families, appeared annoyed, looking away from Budde at several points of her direct address to him. Her plea went viral and elicited a swift rebuke from the president, who called her 'nasty in tone' and 'not compelling or smart.' Trump called Budde a 'Radical Left hard line Trump hater' on his Truth Social site and demanded an apology for 'her inappropriate statements.' Trump demands apology from bishop who requested ‘mercy’ But Budde said she has nothing to apologize for. 'People have asked if I feel like I should apologize, and that would be apologizing for my understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and I just can't do that. ... I regret the reaction in the sense that it's an example of the very thing I was talking, that we needed to address ... which is the culture of contempt and the outrage that is fueled in our country.' Budde, who is Washington's first female diocesan bishop, is no novice in calling out Trump. The bishop joined other cathedral leaders in rebuking Trump’s 'racialized rhetoric' and blaming him for inciting violence on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep him in power. Most notably, she said she was 'outraged' in 2020 after Trump staged an appearance in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is near the White House. He held up a Bible after the area had been cleared of peaceful protesters. Still, she says she would be open to a conversation with Trump to discuss their opposing opinions. ' I would welcome that. I don't think I want to do it on a social media platform. I think face to face,' she said.

Troops from across US headed to southern border	(NewsNation) — Military units from across the country are rushing to provide reinforcement along the southern border following President Donald Trump's executive order last week declaring a national emergency there. Hundreds of troops, including from Kentucky, Washington and New York, are en route to the U.S.-Mexico border. At least 300 troops landed in El Paso, Texas, over the weekend, and sources tell NewsNation that at least 500 soldiers are in California. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott also announced he will buttress efforts by sending at least 400 soldiers from the Texas Tactical Border Force to help the National Guard and Border Patrol agents. Trump’s 5 biggest moves on immigration so far Texas Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents much of Texas's southern border, said more troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. He added that Fort Bliss in El Paso will essentially be ground zero for these removal actions. While many of the units headed to the border will not have immigration jurisdiction and cannot apprehend migrants, they will have policing authority on military bases, Gonzales said. These troops will be used as a deterrence and to assist law enforcement. On his first day in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, tasking the U.S. military with aiding border security, issuing a broad ban on asylum and taking steps to restrict citizenship for children born on American soil. Trump’s Jan. 20 order instructed the Pentagon to send as many troops as necessary to obtain 'complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.' The president deployed an initial 1,500 troops in California and Texas. The show of force in California and Texas comes as deportation flights have started to Central and South America. On Friday, two U.S. military aircraft, each carrying about 80 migrants, flew from the U.S. to Guatemala, a U.S. official told reporters. 80 Guatemalans deported out of Biggs Army Airfield in Texas Multiple deportations were carried out via flight, some of which were reportedly refused by Mexico. The White House has since claimed there was a miscommunication and that Mexico has not refused any of the flights. Trump has threatened hefty tariffs on countries that refuse the deported migrants. Trump said on Sunday he would impose sweeping retaliatory measures on Colombia, including tariffs and sanctions, after the South American country turned away two U.S. military aircraft with migrants being deported. Colombia, the third largest U.S. trading partner in Latin America, swiftly responded, threatening a 50% tariff on U.S. goods.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/troops-travel-southern-border/	2025-01-27T11:14:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2192614816.jpg?w=900
Trump to reinstate service members discharged over COVID vaccine	(NewsNation) —President Trump will sign an executive order Monday allowing for the reinstatement of about 8,000 service members who were discharged during the height of the pandemic for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Under Trump's order, these service members will be reinstated with former rank, full back pay and benefits if they reenlist. The move comes as the next in a series of executive orders that Trump promised while on the campaign trail. ICE arrests 956 Sunday as nationwide raids continue From August 2021 to January 2023, the Biden administration discharged thousands of troops over their refusal to get a mandated COVID-19 shot, with limited exceptions for medical issues or religious objections. The number of service members that were discharged represented less than 1% of the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and about 2% of the army. The Pentagon allowed dismissed soldiers to reapply once the mandate was rescinded in 2023, but only 43 chose to do so, according to federal statistics. With many of these members not returning and low recruiting numbers, Trump's new Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, is hoping the new order will incentivize many of them to come back.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-service-members-discharged-covid-vaccine/	2025-01-27T10:55:57-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194910701.jpg?w=900
JD Vance challenges Catholic bishops to ‘do better’ on immigratio...	Faith is an integral part of millions of Americans' daily lives. 'One Nation Under God' is committed to reflecting America's voices, values and communities, covering stories of faith and religion, from the latest headlines to stories of hope. Subscribe here. (NewsNation) — After his first week on the job, Vice President JD Vance issued a challenge to Catholic bishops in the United States to 'do better' on the issue of immigration. He voiced his criticism during an interview with 'Face the Nation' on CBS News on Sunday. Pastor urges clergy to put aside politics and embrace scripture 'I think the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has, frankly, not been a good partner in common sense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for, and I hope, again, as a devout Catholic, that they'll do better,' Vance said. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders cracking down on illegal immigration. His administration has made its first priority the deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally who are criminals. Bishops condemned some Trump orders The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Donald Trump on issues including immigration. In a statement, Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said, 'Some provisions contained in the Executive Orders, such as those focused on the treatment of immigrants and refugees, foreign aid, expansion of the death penalty, and the environment, are deeply troubling and will have negative consequences, many of which will harm the most vulnerable among us.' Trump world descends on bishop who pleaded for ‘mercy’ The bishops conference is the governing body of Catholic leaders in the United States and coordinates and promotes Catholic activities. The body also monitors federal legislation that affects Catholic entities and the dignity of the human person. J.D.

(Photo by Saul Loeb - Pool/Getty Images) JD Vance: Focus on humanitarian issues Vice President Vance, who said he is a practicing Catholic, suggested the Catholic Church should pay closer attention to the humanitarian issues surrounding immigration, including the sex trafficking of children. 'I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?' Vance told CBS News’ Margaret Brennan. Who is Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop who drew Trump’s ire at prayer service? 'If they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement, let them talk about the children who have been sex trafficked because of the wide open border of Joe Biden,' he said. The Catholic Church teaches that richer nations have the moral duty to welcome foreigners who are seeking security and a livelihood that they cannot find in their country of origin, but it also teaches that governments have the right to enforce their laws and to protect the common good. Bishops praised some Trump orders 'We're going to enforce immigration law,' Vance said. 'We're going to protect the American people.' Pastor Lorenzo Sewell says politics and spirituality intertwined Alongside their criticism, the bishops also praised some of the president’s executive orders, including one that recognizes two sexes: 'Other provisions in the Executive Orders can be seen in a more positive light, such as recognizing the truth about each human person as male or female.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/religion/jd-vance-catholic-bishops-immigration/	2025-01-27T10:21:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2194918366.jpg?w=900
Homan defends immigration raids into middle, elementary schools	NewsNation’s Ali Bradley is hosting a panel of law enforcement experts on the border tonight at 6p/5c. Click here to watch the live Q&amp;A when it begins. Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, defended the administration's plans to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) into schools. Homan joined ABC’s 'This Week,' where he was asked about the logistics behind the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. Host Martha Raddatz asked how the administration said it will 'no longer tell ICE agents they have to avoid sensitive locations, including schools, hospitals, churches.'

Subscribe Now Your Morning Newsletter Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } 'What criminals are hiding in schools? Middle schools, elementary schools — you gonna to go into those?' Raddatz questioned. Trump has formally authorized ICE to begin arresting people in schools and churches, rescinding a guideline that prevented arrests in 'sensitive' areas. They have begun making arrests in various communities. Homan defended the practice to Raddatz and said the arrests are being made with planning. 'How many MS-13 members are the age 14-17? Many of them,' Homan said. 'So look, if it’s a national security threat, public safety threat and what, what you need to understand is that it’s case by case, name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can’t walk into a school or doctor’s office or a medical campus. No other agency is held to those standards. These are well trained officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there’s still gonna be supervisory review.' During the interview, Homan noted how expensive the deportation plans will be. He called on Congress to pass funding for the administration’s mission.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ice-schools/	2025-01-27T09:03:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP18059615938391-1-e1733323119120_abd0ec.jpg?w=900
Trump to reshape military with barrage of executive orders	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is expected to reshape the U.S. military with a raft of executive orders Monday, including banning transgender service members and ending diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs, according to the White House. The executive orders come days after Trump’s nominee to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, was sworn in as Secretary of Defense. Hegseth has vowed to restore 'the warrior ethos' to the military, which he has claimed has been weakened by 'woke issues.' Trump is set to issue an executive order abolishing all DEI programs within the armed forces as a way to 'restore merit and lethality to America’s fighting force.' This executive order directs the Pentagon’s new leader to conduct an internal review of all instances of 'race- or sex-based discrimination' based on DEI initiatives, a White House fact sheet obtained by NewsNation said. Here are all executive orders Trump signed on Day 1 In a social media post foreshadowing the upcoming announcement, Hegseth wrote on X: 'The President’s guidance (lawful orders) is clear: No more DEI at the Department of Defense. The Pentagon will comply, immediately.' The White House says this order will 'combat ideologies that seek to divide our Armed Forces by race, sex or other immutable characteristics and thus tear at cohesion and military efficacy.' A second executive order will ban transgender service members from the U.S. military. The Department of Defense will update its guidance regarding trans-identifying medical standards for military service to ensure it prioritizes 'readiness and lethality,' the White House said. 'On the battlefield, there can be no accommodation for anything less than resilience, strength, and the ability to withstand extraordinary physical demands.' According to its fact sheet, the White House argues it can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery. During this period, they are not 'physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements,' the new administration contends. Trump issued a similar ban during his first term that barred transgender troops from serving, which former President Joe Biden rescinded. In 2019 — the most recent year for which figures were available — the Department of Defense estimated that approximately 8,000 transgender individuals served on active duty in the military. The third executive order will reinstate all members of the military — active and reserve — who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Those who are reinstated will receive their former rank and full back pay with benefits. From 2021 to 2023, over 8,000 troops were discharged due to their COVID-19 vaccination status.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/trump-military-executive-orders/	2025-01-27T08:48:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Iraq_US-troops_11-11-2019_AP.jpg?w=900
Trump to huddle with House GOP at retreat in Florida	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is set to meet with top Republican leaders on his agenda this week. House GOP leaders indicated that they aim to move Trump’s legislative agenda — encompassing extension of the 2017 tax cuts, energy policy, and border policy — in a single bill through the budget reconciliation process, rather than split it into two pieces as some Republicans had wanted in hopes of delivering some Trump wins faster. Trump is expected to speak to the Republicans on Monday evening. The policy retreat is set to end Wednesday morning. Three of Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks set for hearings The meetings, taking place at the Trump National Doral just outside Miami, come a day after Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs after it denied the entry of U.S. planes carrying Colombian migrants. Shortly after, Colombia reversed its decision. Trump threatens Colombia with tariffs On Sunday, Colombia President Gustavo Petro wrote in a post on X that he was denying the entry of American planes carrying Colombian migrants into the country, stating the U.S. cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals. Hours later, Trump responded in a Truth Social post threatening 25% tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S. from Columbia, raising that to 50% after one week. Additionally, he threatened a travel ban on Columbian government officials, visa sanctions on family members of the Columbian government and enhanced customs and border protection inspections of all Columbian nationals. Senate tees up more confirmations as House GOP talks Trump agenda Almost immediately Colombia reversed its decision. The government wrote on X that Trump is providing a presidential plane for the dignified return of his fellow citizens, after turning away two U.S. military deportation flights. The U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants to Guatemala on Friday. Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserts the U.S. is committed to 'bolster America's border security.' The White House said Monday that the tariffs and sanctions are on hold and won't be signed unless Columbia fails to honor the agreement.

Rumors about ICE raids stoke fear amid deportations	NewsNation’s Ali Bradley is hosting a panel of law enforcement experts on the border tonight at 6p/5c. Click here to watch the live Q&amp;A when it begins. (NewsNation) — Mass deportations were one of President Donald Trump's main campaign promises — and now, some people are using them to spread misinformation and rumors about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. ICE agents arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants during Trump's first week in office. Two metropolitan police departments in Georgia, Forest Park and Clayton County, went on Facebook to clarify that they are not partnering with ICE. What is the minimum income to file this year’s tax return? 'We’re here to dispel that rumor and clearly state that we have NOT engaged in any activity with ICE by any means; nor have we been notified that they’re conducting business within city limits,' Forest Park's statement said. 'Furthermore, we are not targeting our Hispanic citizens or those who commute throughout the City of Forest Park.' In Durham, North Carolina, last week, a supermarket had to write a statement saying that any claims of raids at their stores are just a 'harmful prank.' These claims, Super Compare Foods wrote, were the result of people seen near their stores in uniforms and vehicles made to look like the ones used by border agents. 'What's most concerning is that these actions were carried out with clear malicious intent, aimed at spreading fear and misinformation in a time when our community is already in a fragile and sensitive climate,' the statement said. Super Compare Foods filed a report with Durham Police, and the supermarket says it will pursue legal action against the individuals responsible. Mass deportations under Trump On Sunday alone, ICE reported 956 arrests. That number follows the arrest of roughly 1,300 people by Thursday, according to numbers put out by 'border czar' Tom Homan. Arrests made in the first three days of Trump's second term represent about 1.1% of total arrests made by ICE in FY 2024. The number of arrests has gone from 310 a day to about 433 — and that number is expected to grow. Raids were reported in Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; Austin, Texas; New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; San Antonio, Texas; Miami, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska; Phoenix, Arizona and Atlanta, Georgia. Officials in 'sanctuary cities' such as Chicago have vowed to protect immigrant communities from mass deportations. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said on X that police were not involved in ICE enforcement activity in the city. 'My team and I are in close communication with city officials including the CPD,' he said. 'It is imperative that all Chicagoans know their constitutional rights and share the Know Your Rights guidance with their neighbors and community.' List: All of Trump’s executive orders on the economy How to avoid ICE scams Officials warn that scammers are posing as ICE officials and demanding money from people. To avoid them, officials say to avoid making payments over the phone or email and to remember that agents do not request financial information or money to dismiss an investigation or arrest warrant. People can report suspected ICE fraud to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General at 1-800-323-8603.

Trump's top immigration officials oversee raids in Chicago	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Top Trump administration officials, including 'border czar' Tom Homan, visited Chicago on Sunday to oversee ramped-up immigration enforcement efforts as federal agencies touted arrests nationwide. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made 956 arrests nationwide on Sunday and 286 on Saturday. While in Chicago, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said he observed immigration agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). He did not offer details on the operation, which came days after the DHS expanded immigration authority to agencies in the Department of Justice, including the DEA and ATF. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is disappointed in the results of his mass deportation efforts so far, the Washington Post reports, urging ICE to increase daily arrests to at least 1,200 to 1,500. ICE has averaged 433 daily arrests since Trump's inauguration, nearly doubling on Sunday. Dozens of alleged Tren de Aragua members arrested in Denver These targeted enforcements are happening nationwide, including in New Jersey, New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. In Denver, law enforcement officials conducted an early morning operation at a makeshift nightclub, seizing drugs, weapons and cash. Approximately 50 people who were reportedly in the U.S. illegally were taken into custody — many allegedly connected with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. 'Mama Paty' reunited with 4-year-old found alone at border 'I want a safer community. I live in this community too, and I feel like the people in the Denver metro area can wake up today and feel like they have a safer city to live in,' said DEA Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Pullen. ICE arrested five alleged Tren de Aragua members in Chicago on Sunday. Illinois' Pritzker backs 'law-abiding' undocumented migrants Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson launched a 'Know Your Rights' ad campaign across the city's public transit trains, as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called on Trump to stop going after what he called 'law-abiding' undocumented migrants. 'Violent criminals who are undocumented in this country should be deported,' Pritzker said. 'But when we're talking about undocumented people who have been living law-abiding lives and raising families in the United States, we need comprehensive immigration reform. We need to give them an opportunity to stay in this country legally.' Arrest quotas for ICE officers ‘a bad idea’: William Enyart The 'Illinois Trust Act' limits local involvement with federal immigration enforcement, meaning Chicago Police officers are blocked from cooperating with ICE agents. Homan argues ICE wouldn't need to conduct such community arrests if local law enforcement were allowed to collaborate more closely with ICE to target high-priority criminals.

Three of Trump's most controversial Cabinet picks set for hearing...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — More Senate hearings have been scheduled for President Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees, marking a significant week ahead for some of his more controversial picks. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, will have his first hearing Wednesday. Kennedy is a former Democratic presidential candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump. His nomination alarmed some concerned about his record of spreading misinformation regarding vaccines. On Thursday, Kennedy will have a second hearing before a different committee. Kash Patel, who is nominated to run the FBI, also has a hearing Thursday. Former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is Trump's choice for national intelligence director; she also has a hearing Thursday. Sources told NewsNation that Gabbard may face more issues with a smaller group of Republicans than Democrats. Hearings are not yet scheduled for all of Trump's picks, including Lori Chavez-DeRemer, nominated to lead the Department of Labor; Howard Lutnick, tapped to lead the Department of Commerce; and Linda McMahon, picked to lead the Department of Education. Vance: Tulsi Gabbard will 'restore trust' in intel Democratic senators have been scrutinizing Gabbard's past support for deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, as well as her calls to pardon national security leaker Edward Snowden. While some Republicans appear willing to consider those concerns, many continue to defend Gabbard as a proud, patriotic figure who isn't afraid to challenge the political establishment. Gabbard’s path through Intelligence Committee narrows ahead of key hearing 'I'm going to see how the hearing goes. I'm inclined to be 'yes' on everybody, but there's some questions she will be asked that I want to hear the answers to,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.'It's fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences. I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard's patriotism or her integrity,' said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.'The bureaucrats at our intelligence services have gotten completely out of control. They've been part of the weaponization of our political system, the weaponization of our justice system. We need to have good intelligence services who keep us safe, but part of that is restoring trust in those services, and we think Tulsi is the right person to do it,' said Vice President JD Vance. Overall, several Republican lawmakers told NewsNation they feel it's their responsibility to support Trump's nominees. However, some stated they will reserve judgment until hearing from the nominees. Arrest quotas for ICE officers ‘a bad idea’: William Enyart Pete Hegseth, Kristi Noem confirmed Pete Hegseth was confirmed as the nation’s defense secretary late Friday. Vance broke a 50-50 tie to narrowly seal Hegseth's confirmation. Three Republicans — Sens. Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, Susan Collins, of Maine; and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — also voted against him. While Hegseth received bipartisan pushback against his nomination, Kristi Noem was confirmed as homeland security secretary on Saturday with bipartisan support, receiving seven Democratic votes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-controversial-cabinet-picks-hearings/	2025-01-27T04:43:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/kennedy_robert_RFK_11152024_AP_AP24320339674317.jpg?w=900
Missing 12-year-old child's mom reveals he never made it to frien...	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) -- Virginia Beach Police have launched an extensive search for 12-year-old Juan Sebastian Mejia Acevedo. The boy’s mother told NewsNation affiliate WAVY that her son never reached his friend’s house on the Friday he disappeared. She said she had given him permission to visit a friend’s home to work on homework between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., but he never made it there. The Virginia State Police (VSP) issued an Amber Alert for Juan around 5:45 am Saturday. He was last seen by his parents on Mica Avenue in Virginia Beach around 9 a.m. Friday. Juan is a student at Larkspur Middle School. VBCPS did not have in-person classes on Friday. 'They thought he was home doing homework. A snow day for students here in the area. He, I think, was seen on a ring camera somewhere around 2 p.m. I think we've seen that family believed he was at a friend's house, and at around 9 p.m., when he didn't show up back home, they started to become concerned,' said Jody Saunders, Chief Communications Officer with VBPD. Human remains found in 2021 confirmed to be Cassie Sheetz 'When we got home, he was not home. We told him he could go to his friend's house from two to four, but we just thought because he wasn’t home, he was probably still at his friend's house as boys do. We went to his friend's house, spoke to the parents and the parents tell us he never came to their house,' said Jenni Acevedo, Juan’s mother. Jenni went on Facebook Live to get the word out to see if friends or family could help. That’s when several ransom requests came in. 'They made me go to a nearby Walmart and asked for money. I did not give the full amount, just part of it,' said Acevedo. Juan’s mother sent $500, and they then demanded $10,000, and she realized she was getting scammed. 'We have to treat it as a credible lead. And so that's why our federal partners are here helping us with this potential abduction, and we'll chase that all the way to its end,' said Saunders. Juan is their only child. The family is desperate to find him, and the mother believes he is still on Mica Avenue. Missing woman, 96, may be displaced due to Eaton Fire Local and federal law enforcement have been canvassing the neighborhood, using drones, knocking on doors, and on Sunday added mounted patrol. VBPD does not believe it is a recovery mission; out of caution, the marine patrol unit is searching nearby lakes and ponds. 'We also enlisted the help of some of our Hispanic Citizens Police Academy alumni to help be shoulder to shoulder with our officers, knock on doors and assist translating, if necessary,' said Saunders. According to Saunders, the family has recently moved, and VBPD is also looking at the other areas they have lived in as well as the current entire neighborhood. One neighbor who lives in the apartment complex says police have knocked on his door asking for additional information. 'They asked if I'd seen any suspicious activity around here. Cars that kind of look unfamiliar here. And I have not,' said resident Gavin Sands. VBPD has contacted ICE and confirmed that Juan is not in ICE custody. 'Our first and only priority is the safety and well-being of our community. And that comes regardless of immigration status,' said Saunders. VBPD has created an anonymous digital evidence portal where people can upload photos and videos about this case. Juan is described as: Age: 12 Height: 5’8' Weight: 105 pounds Hair Color: black Eye Color: brown Clothing: Last seen wearing a gray jacket, red hoodie, and blue pants If you have any information about this case, you can submit an anonymous tip by calling 1-888-LOCK-U-UP, downloading the P3 tips app to a mobile device, or visiting www.P3tips.com and submitting a tip.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/missing-12-year-old-virginia-beach/	2025-01-27T04:00:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-31-2.jpg?w=900
Israel lets Palestinians return to northern Gaza for the first ti...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel on Monday began allowing thousands of Palestinians to return to the heavily destroyed north of the Gaza Strip for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, in accordance with a fragile ceasefire. The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight. Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes -- even knowing that they have likely been damaged or destroyed. Many had feared Israel would make their exodus permanent, and expressed similar concerns about an idea floated by President Donald Trump to resettle large numbers of Palestinians in Egypt and Jordan. Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who had waited for three days before crossing with his family, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives. 'It’s the joy of return,' said Abu Matter, whose family was among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. 'We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.' Hamas said the return was 'a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.' The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the fighting. Israel ordered the wholescale evacuation of the north in the opening days of the war and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction of the war. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to enforce the ceasefire, and that anyone violating it or threatening Israeli forces 'will bear the full cost.' 'We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,' he wrote on the platform X. Hostage dispute rattled week-old ceasefire Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on whether the remaining hostages set to be freed in the first phase are alive or dead. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing. The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages before Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the hostage release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. That release will be in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three hostages should be released. Hamas also handed over a list of required information about the hostages to be released in the ceasefire’s six-week first phase. Starting at 7 a.m., Palestinians were allowed to cross on foot without inspection through part of the so-called Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles was to open later with an inspection mechanism, the details of which were not immediately known. A second and more difficult phase awaits Under the first phase of the ceasefire, which runs until early March, Hamas is to free a total of 33 hostages in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The militants have released seven hostages, including four female soldiers, in the current ceasefire, in exchange for more than 300 prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. The second — and far more difficult — phase of the agreement has not yet been negotiated. Hamas says it will not release the remaining 60 or so hostages unless Israel ends the war, while Netanyahu says he is still committed to destroying the militant group and ending its nearly 18-year rule over Gaza. Hamas started the war when thousands of its fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 90 hostages are still inside Gaza, and Israel believes around a third are dead. Israel’s air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have displaced around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times, and flattened entire neighborhoods. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-begins-allowing-palestinians-to-return-to-northern-gaza-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-year/	2025-01-26T22:44:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67972ba1edf379.10563631.jpeg?w=900
Arrest quotas for ICE officers 'a bad idea': William Enyart	(NewsNation) — Enacting a daily arrest quota for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would be 'asking for an abuse of their police powers,' Ret. U.S. Army Major Gen. William Enyart said. 'Anytime you put a quota on a law enforcement officer, that that's a bad idea,' Enyart told NewsNation. 'Law enforcement officers are supposed to use their discretion.' Crisis on the border: Trump’s first week tackling immigration The quotas would range from 1,200 to 1,500 people each day, The Washington Post first reported. On Sunday alone, ICE reported 956 arrests, as immigration operations were conducted in major cities like Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose and more. The push for quotas comes from Trump's displeasure with arrest numbers, according to the Post. Mexico busing deported Venezuelans away from border 'Almost all of them are good people and they work hard,' Enyart added. 'But you know, when you're put under that kind of pressure, you make mistakes.'

Mama Paty' reunited with 4-year-old found alone at border	(NewsNation) — A 4-year-old girl from Honduras who was found alone at the southern border by officials last year is back with her mother. NewsNation has followed the emotional journey since November, when U.S. immigration officials said they found the child after she was smuggled by coyotes through South America. The unnamed girl had a note with her, on it written a phone number and her mother's name, 'Mama Paty.' Her mother, who was already in the states, told NewsNation she left her child in the hands of criminal smugglers in Honduras and Mexico in hopes of being reunited. The 4-year-old was held under federal custody for a little over a month as officials worked to verify her mother's identity before the pair were finally reunited. ICE, DEA carry out deportation operations in cities across US NewsNation traveled to South Carolina to meet the happily-reunited family. 'They were endless days for me. I couldn’t sleep at night,' Paty said. 'I was just waiting for a message, a call, someone to tell me if my daughter was okay.' Both mother and daughter had previously been deported back to Honduras three years ago after crossing illegally into the United States with the help of a smuggler. Paty decided to attempt crossing into the U.S. again — but this time, without her daughter, who stayed back in Honduras with her grandparents. Mexico busing deported Venezuelans away from border Paty and her daughter are overwhelmed with joy to be finally together again here in the U.S., but also now worry that they could be removed, as the Trump administration promises to carry out largest deportation in national history. 'Everything we’ve been through would have been for nothing. All the risk my daughter took — it was a big risk since she was traveling alone — would have been for nothing,' Paty said. 'It would be devastating. If Donald Trump were to deport me, or deport both of us together.' She told NewsNation, if she were to be deported, she would bring her daughter back with her to Honduras rather than have her stay with relatives in America.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/mama-paty-border-mom/	2025-01-26T16:55:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/F1D6A8A0158F45B546FF2799CEE8C6E7.jpg?w=900
ICE, DEA carry out deportation operations in cities across US	(NewsNation) — During his first week back in office, President Donald Trump's administration carried out nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, with several operations taking place Sunday. ICE raids in multiple major U.S. cities have led to the arrests of more than 1,300 criminal migrants, Trump’s 'border czar' Tom Homan told NewsNation on Thursday. On Friday, one arrest was a convicted murderer and 10 were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, NewsNation's Ali Bradley reported. Crisis on the border: Trump’s first week tackling immigration Raids have taken place in major cities such as Boston, Denver, New York City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Miami, Washington, D.C., and Newark, N.J., according to media reports. The number of arrests in the first three days of Trump’s presidency represents about 1.1% of total arrests made by ICE in FY 2024. Here's where raids have happened Sunday. Chicago Top Trump administration officials, including 'border czar' Tom Homan and the acting deputy attorney general, visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-up immigration enforcement in the nation’s third-largest city. The DEA’s Chicago office posted pictures on X showing Bove and Homan with agents from ATF and Customs and Border Protection. The operation comes just days after reports leaked of mass deportation raids planned in the Windy City. Chicago and state officials, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have vowed to protect immigrant communities from mass deportations. Denver ICE tooki nearly 50 people into custody — including members of the Tren de Aragua gang — in an overnight raid at a 'makeshift nightclub,' according to an X post from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Rocky Mountain Division. The DEA, Homeland Security, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 'local partners' seized drugs, weapons and cash in the raid. The raid was connected to a DEA drug trafficking investigation that began several months before President Donald Trump took office during the Biden Administration, a DEA official told NewsNation local affiliate KDVR reports. Austin, Texas A series of ICE raids were conducted in Austin on Sunday, DEA sources confirmed to NewsNation local affiliate KXAN. 'The raids are underway or have been done,' said Sally Sparks, a DEA Houston Division spokesperson, said in a phone call. In an X post, the Houston DEA Division confirmed the DEA is working with Department of Justice partners, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal law enforcement partners with these efforts. New Jersey Paterson, N.J., Mayor Andre Sayegh told affiliate PIX11 that ICE agents are in the town. 'We are genuinely concerned. We are a welcoming city. Quite frankly, there has to be an appropriate procedure. If they have a warrant, we understand. If they don’t, people have to know their rights. As a matter of fact, I did get a report today that ICE was in Paterson, not too far from here,' said Mayor Sayegh. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said ICE agents raided a seafood store and detained three people on Thursday. Los Angeles An post from the Los Angeles DEA Division confirmed that the department 'participated in an operation' on Sunday that supported the Justice Department, DHS and other federal law enforcement partners with their '#immigration enforcement efforts.'

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would impose wide-ranging sanctions and impose tariffs against Colombia over its refusal to accept U.S. military aircraft with migrants being deported. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the United States would slap an emergency 25% tariff on all Colombian goods coming into the United States and would raise that to 50% in one week. © Copyright Thomson Reuters 2023.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/us-to-impose-sanctions-on-colombia-over-deportation-flights-trump/	2025-01-26T10:50:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25020613909976.jpg?w=900
A child's life in Gaza, as explained by a Middle East reporter	(NewsNation) — Waiting in line for clean water, lugging around water jugs larger than they are and hoping for a slice of bread for the entire family, children in Gaza are living a life of survival. That's how one on-the-ground reporter described the life of a child in Gaza during war -- one of devastation, medical suffering and pure survival. Middle East reporter Arwa Damon, who founded the nonprofit INARA, described what she's seen in Gaza to NewsNation on 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' on Sunday, as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached the one-week mark. The Emmy Award-winning journalist was in Gaza in December. She shared the story of a 2-year-old girl who is at risk of losing her limbs -- and life. Israel blocks thousands of Palestinians from returning to northern Gaza Urgent need for medical care FILE - The bodies of three children killed by an Israeli strike are carried for burial in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Thursday Nov. 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana, File) The girl, who doctors say has a protein C deficiency leading to blood overclotting, has known war most of her life since Hamas' attack on Gaza on Oct. 3, 2023. 'Her arms and legs are covered with gangrenous tissue. She's at a very real risk of losing her limbs and potentially losing her life,' Damon said. 'She needs an emergency medical evacuation, as do thousands of other children who are on this waiting list, but we still have not seen those starting up.' Damon, whose nonprofit provides medical and mental health care to children impacted by war and natural disasters, is calling for urgent medical evacuations. She thought that aid would be 'speedier' after the ceasefire's enactment. 'The opposite seems to have taken place,' she said. Israel said it is keeping Palestinians out of northern Gaza after a civilian hostage was not returned in last weekend's hostage-prisoner exchange. On Saturday, Hamas released four female Israeli soldiers, three of whom are a mere 20 years old and one who is 19. Israel said it was expecting the hostages to include women and children civilians. 14,000 children killed in Gaza Children play in the rubble of a destroyed building in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Mariam Dagga) Images show people living on top of rubble. 'It’s this sort of overwhelming sensation of, how does this even happen?' Damon said. And in some areas: 'It’s not even that a building has been reduced to rubble. It's actually been reduced to sand.' The Palestinian Ministry of Health estimates at least 14,000 children have been killed in Gaza. 'The medications, the treatment that (the girl) needs doesn't exist. And actually, you know, the sort of specialty care that she needs doesn't exist in Gaza,' Damon said. 'What you have is … children who get these horrific blast injuries, very complex injuries, but there isn't the needed testing.' What’s next in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire? There is only one CT scanner in all of Gaza City and no MRI machine, according to her experience. 'The other issue is that the rate of infection among injuries has been extremely high because children's bodies are so weakened due to malnutrition that their body cannot fight to heal and fight off infection at the same time,' Damon said.

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla, File) Patients often return because their wounds haven’t healed properly. And the mental wounds won’t heal for a long time, either. 'The fear of the drone and the bombs … these traumas are very deep and very, very ingrained and are something that really needs to be focused on in the future,' she said. 'We talk a lot about Gaza's physical rebuilding, but we also need to equally talk about Gaza’s psychological rebuilding.' Urgent needs include proper shelter, access to clean water and access to clean bathrooms. A bed to sleep on would seem like a luxury at this stage. Hamas releases 4 female Israeli soldiers in ceasefire deal swap 'We have to recognize that the vast majority of Gaza's children have not slept in a bed for 15 months,' Damon said. 'A number of children were being asked, ‘What's the thing you look forward to the most?’ And they were saying things like, ‘I want to sleep in a bed. I want to sleep in a room on my own. I want to be able to go to the bathroom and have a measure of privacy. I want to go back to school.’' Stability and safety are what they hope for. 'The child is sort of entrenched in this daily struggle of survival. That's what it’s like to be a child in Gaza right now.'

Dems take ‘government for granted’ on immigration: Chicago alderm...	CHICAGO (NewsNation) — Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez is blaming the city’s mayor for 'fear' and spreading 'false information' in the city’s immigrant communities following news of planned ICE raids. 'Our mayor, and others, have continuously stoked fires of fear and anxiety in neighborhoods, spreading false information that the Trump administration and ICE were coming to round people up out of churches,' Lopez said on NewsNation’s 'Morning in America.' Lopez said when he met with President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, they agreed that detaining 'criminal' migrants who entered the U.S. illegally was the chief concern. Crisis on the border: Trump’s first week tackling immigration 'They want to focus on those dangerous, undocumented, criminal migrants that are here in our communities,' said Lopez. 'When I met with (Homan) in December, that's exactly what he said.' Lopez said he is trying to limit 'collateral captures,' immigrants without a criminal record but lacking legal documents, and implored Democrats to work with the new administration. 'Many Democratic leaders refuse to show any kind of working relationship with the Trump administration, and that's only going to hurt the people that they pretend to care about,' said Lopez. Lopez compared Democrats' maneuvering on immigration to the way they handled abortion. '(Democrats) took government for granted (on abortion), and they're doing it again with immigration,' he said. Chicago Public Schools officials said Friday that ICE agents showed up at an elementary school in the city but were denied entry. After confusion, the Secret Service said it was they who visited the school, not ICE.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/raymond-lopez-ice-raids-chicago/	2025-01-26T09:27:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/snapshot-14.jpg?w=852
Ramaswamy's expected run for Ohio governor would test experienced...	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Fresh off of his unexpected departure from President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, Vivek Ramaswamy has set his sights on becoming governor of his home state. The 39-year-old biotech entrepreneur who made an unsuccessful bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination has lined up strategists with Ohio experience and plans to announce his run as soon as this week. Ramaswamy will try to follow the paths of Vice President JD Vance and Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno — two political newcomers who won Senate seats with the help of Trump's endorsement. His plans have complicated things for a deep bench of veteran Republican politicians, especially the ones who also aspire to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine. Attorney General Dave Yost announced his candidacy on Thursday. So far, Ohio voters have continued to support candidates with government experience for state-level offices, while favoring business backgrounds in their presidential and Senate picks. 'At the federal legislative level, that’s a different yardstick and standard than for governor of Ohio,' said Republican consultant Terry Casey. 'Historically, the governor's a little closer to voters — clearing highways, running prisons — than senators and members of Congress.' Ramaswamy stands to benefit from instant popularity among Trump's most ardent backers and long ties to both Vance and Moreno. He attended Trump's second inauguration and is a well-known booster of the president. Attending a recent breakfast with more than 600 state GOP activists, Ramaswamy was mobbed by people seeking to have their photos taken with him and his wife, Apoorva. Ramaswamy, who travels with his own small security detail, was again swarmed the same evening during a black-tie inaugural ball in Washington sponsored by the Ohio Republican Party. 'The question is can you bypass the 20 years' worth of political history that used to be required to run for governor,' said Ryan Stubenrauch, a Republican strategist and former senior policy adviser to DeWine. All eyes on Ramaswamy Ramaswamy is the son of Indian immigrants and a native of Cincinnati. He earned Harvard and Yale degrees before joining a hedge fund firm and leading its pharmaceutical investments. Ramaswamy launched his own venture in 2014, Roivant, specializing in buying discount patents for drugs stuck in development and resurrecting them. His portfolio is now measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars, enough to dwarf the $15 million he loaned his presidential campaign. He was raised in a Hindu-practicing home. With evangelical Christians holding sway in the Republican Party, Ramaswamy says his faith shares core principles with Christianity and he traces his abortion-rights opposition to his time at St. Xavier High School in his hometown. Ramaswamy has drawn criticism both from establishment Republicans and the party's populist pro-Trump wing. His opposition to providing weapons to Ukraine in the war with Russia bothered some Republicans. But when he urged Trump, notably in an X post that went viral, to bring in more foreign tech workers, it angered former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and other hard-line supporters of restricted immigration. When Ramaswamy arrived in Springfield, Ohio, last year to hold a town hall in the wake of false claims made by Trump and Vance that Haitian migrants there were eating people's pets, the venue couldn't hold all the people who showed up. That popularity does not always translate to those who know Ramaswamy well. Some inside and outside the Trump universe say his style can be abrasive and exhausting. Trump has made no endorsement in the developing race. Ramaswamy has long considered running for governor, according to those with knowledge of his plans. After Trump appointed him to DOGE, Ramaswamy pulled himself out of consideration for the Senate seat that came open with Vance's election as vice president. But Ramaswamy later discussed the vacancy with Trump, according to two people familiar with his plans who were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity, and then went to DeWine to ask for the appointment. The governor opted for Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, citing his extensive government experience. A spokesperson for DOGE said Ramaswamy would not participate in the cost-cutting initiative due to his plans to run for office. That leaves Musk, the world's richest person, as its sole leader. Ramaswamy has ties to Republican strategists from his campaign for the White House race, notably Ben Yoho, CEO of the Columbus-based Strategy Group. Ramaswamy is scrambling others' plans By appointing Husted to the Senate, DeWine eliminated the leading contender to follow him as governor. But no longer is it a given that the wealthy donors and key endorsers that Husted had locked up over the past six years would naturally shift to another experienced Republican — Yost or Treasurer Robert Sprague, for example. Yost, 68, is a former county prosecutor elected four times statewide — twice as auditor, twice as attorney general. Sprague, 51, has been twice elected statewide after spending years in the Ohio House and county government. Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a former state senator whose job running elections makes him among the state’s highest profile politician, has yet to announce his plans. 'This new dynamic and competition adds a layer of complexity for me,' said Ken Blackwell, a Trump loyalist who served two terms as Ohio secretary of state and whose potential endorsement would be coveted. Blackwell is a long-time Yost supporter who lives in Cincinnati and is a former mayor. Yost, in announcing his campaign, did not mention Ramaswamy, but seemed to draw a contrast with a potential rival who has played on the national stage. 'This is my heart, my home,' he said in a statement. 'I work for the people of Ohio, and I love my bosses.' But Ramaswamy isn't a total stranger to state government either. Like Moreno and Vance, his entry point was an invitation to the board of InnovateOhio, an office overseeing technology-related improvements that DeWine set up in 2018 and assigned to Husted. 'It’s pretty cool,' Husted said at a news conference announcing his Senate appointment. 'We have a vice president from Ohio who’s, like, my friend. I mean, seriously, InnovateOhio board? We had Bernie Moreno, JD Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy and me. We did all right. We got a good crew there.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-ramaswamys-expected-run-for-ohio-governor-would-test-experienced-republicans-and-tradition/	2025-01-26T08:54:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67965e7a487c95.71377238.jpeg?w=900
What is the minimum income to file this year's tax return?	(NewsNation) — This year's tax season begins Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, lasting through April 15. People filing taxes for income made in 2024 must do so by that April deadline, also known as Tax Day. Not everyone is required to file a tax return, although most Americans must do so, per Internal Revenue Service income requirements. Anyone under the age of 65 by the end of last year must file a return or else they may face penalties. When are taxes due this year? And other important dates Those filing single should file if their income is above $14,600. Couples filing together have a minimum income requirement of $29,200 ($30,750 if one spouse is over 65 years old). Anyone above the age of 65 by the end of last year has different minimum income amounts. For single filers, it's $16,550 and above; for couples, $30,750 if one spouse is under 65; and $32,300 if both spouses are over 65. However, the IRS notes people can still file taxes if their income is below those thresholds because they can still take advantage of some tax credits and may receive a refund. The IRS has other requirements, in addition to income, for tax filers.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/tax-return-minimum-income-requirement-irs/	2025-01-26T08:28:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/04/GettyImages-1139383323-3-e1713571009616.jpg?w=698
Ozempic can help other chronic health conditions: Study	(NewsNation) — GLP-1 weight loss drugs such as Ozempic are known to promote weight loss, but they have other benefits according to a new study. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Veteran Affairs St. Louis Health Care System evaluated the effects of GLP-1 drugs on more than 2 million veterans suffering from diabetes between Oct. 1, 2017, through Dec. 31, 2023. According to the research, cognitive and behavioral improvements were seen. However, there were some detractions with increased likelihood of kidney conditions and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). People with ADHD have shorter life expectancy: Study GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy are known to decrease hunger, but the findings included a decreased suicidal ideation and psychotic disorders, in addition to the risk of seizures and addiction to substances such as recreational drugs and alcohol. A decrease in the chance of Alzheimer's and dementia was also found. 'Interestingly, GLP-1RA drugs act on receptors that are expressed in brain areas involved in impulse control, reward and addiction — potentially explaining their effectiveness in curbing appetite and addiction disorders,' Al-Aly, director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at the VA St. Louis Health Care System said in the release. 'These drugs also reduce inflammation in the brain and result in weight loss; both these factors may improve brain health and explain the reduced risk of conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ozempic-help-chronic-health-conditions-study/	2025-01-26T08:15:43-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23182605436072-e1731552139952.jpg?w=800
Israel blocks thousands of Palestinians from returning to norther...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel kept thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday as it accused Hamas of violating a fragile ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released. Local health officials said Israeli forces fired on the crowds, killing two people and wounding nine. Israeli forces also opened fire in Lebanon on protesters demanding their withdrawal in line with a separate ceasefire agreement with the Hezbollah militant group, killing at least 15 people and wounding more than 80. Israel refused to withdraw by a Sunday deadline, accusing Lebanese forces of not deploying quickly enough. The Lebanese army says it cannot move into areas until Israeli troops leave. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza's population should be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, in order to 'just clean out' the war-ravaged enclave. Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians themselves have previously rejected such a scenario, fearing Israel might never allow the refugees to return. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, 'even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.' He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza 'even better than before' if Israel lifts its blockade. Under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza on foot through the so-called Netzarim corridor bisecting Gaza. Israel put the move on hold until Hamas frees a hostage who Israel said was supposed to have been released Saturday. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement. Crowds of people traveling by foot and carrying their belongings filled a main road leading to a closed Israeli checkpoint. 'We have been in agony for a year and a half,' Nadia Qasem, a woman displaced from the north said as she waited. 'Since 1 a.m. we have been waiting to return.' Fadi al-Sinwar, who was also displaced from Gaza City, said, 'the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,' referring to the Israeli hostage. 'See how valuable we are? We are worthless,' he said. Dispute and shootings test fragile ceasefire Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamas freed four young female Israeli soldiers on Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said another hostage, the female civilian Arbel Yehoud, was supposed to have been released ahead of the soldiers, and that it would not open the Netzarim corridor until she was freed. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the coming weeks. Hamas accused Israel of using the issue as a pretext to delay the return of Palestinians to their homes. In a statement, the militant group said it had informed mediators that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. The United States, Egypt and Qatar, which mediated the ceasefire, were working to address the dispute. Ending the war will be difficult The ceasefire reached earlier this month after more than a year of negotiations is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing scores of hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still being held in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half of them, were killed in the initial attack or died in captivity. The first phase of the ceasefire runs until early March and includes the release of a total of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second — and far more difficult — phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 people. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of whom were mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed since the latest ceasefire began. Israel's military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have flattened wide swaths of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned to their homes since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble where their neighborhoods once stood. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israeli-fire-kills-1-wounds-7-as-palestinians-are-kept-out-of-north-gaza-over-a-ceasefire-dispute/	2025-01-26T06:09:11-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6796426d9e6e77.84664676.jpeg?w=900
15 reported killed in Lebanon as Israeli forces remain after a wi...	MAYS AL-JABAL, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on Sunday opened fire on protesters demanding their withdrawal in line with a ceasefire agreement, killing at least 15 and injuring more than 80, Lebanese health officials reported. The dead included two women and a Lebanese army soldier, the Health Ministry said in a statement. People were reported wounded in more than a dozen villages in the border area. Demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter several villages to protest Israel’s failure to withdraw from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish its presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw. The Israeli army blamed Hezbollah for stirring up Sunday's protests. It said in a statement that its troops fired warning shots to 'remove threats in a number of areas where suspects were identified approaching.' It added that a number of suspects in proximity to Israeli troops were apprehended and were being questioned. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said in a statement addressing the people of southern Lebanon on Sunday that 'Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and I am following up on this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity.' He urged them to 'exercise self-restraint and trust in the Lebanese Armed Forces.' The Lebanese army, in a separate statement, said it was escorting civilians into some towns in the border area and called on residents to follow military instructions to ensure their safety. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whose Amal Movement party is allied with Hezbollah and who served as an interlocutor between the militant group and the U.S. during ceasefire negotiations, said that Sunday's bloodshed 'is a clear and urgent call for the international community to act immediately and compel Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territories.' An Arabic-language spokesperson for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, posted on X that Hezbollah had sent 'rioters' and is 'trying to heat up the situation to cover up its situation and status in Lebanon and the Arab world.' He called Sunday morning for residents of the border area not to attempt to return to their villages. U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and the head of mission of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro, called in a joint statement for both Israel and Lebanon to comply with their obligations under the ceasefire agreement. 'The fact is that the timelines envisaged in the November Understanding have not been met,' the statement said. 'As seen tragically this morning, conditions are not yet in place for the safe return of citizens to their villages along the Blue Line.' UNIFIL said that further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation in the area and 'prospects for stability ushered in by the cessation of hostilities and the formation of a government in Lebanon.' It called for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops, the removal of unauthorized weapons and assets south of the Litani River, the redeployment of the Lebanese army in all of south Lebanon and ensuring the safe and dignified return of displaced civilians on both sides of the Blue Line. An AP team was stranded overnight at a UNIFIL base near Mays al-Jabal after the Israeli army erected roadblocks Saturday while they were joining a patrol by peacekeepers. The journalists reported hearing gunshots and booming sounds Sunday morning from the base, and peacekeepers said that dozens of protesters had gathered nearby. In the village of Aita al Shaab, families wandered over flattened concrete structures looking for remnants of the homes they left behind. No Israeli forces were present. 'These are our houses,' said Hussein Bajouk, one of the returning residents. 'However much they destroy, we will rebuild.' Bajouk added that he is convinced that former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs in September, is really still alive. 'I don’t know how much we’re going to wait, another month or two months... but the Sayyed will come out and speak,' he said using an honorific for Nasrallah. On the other side of the border in the kibbutz of Manara, Orna Weinberg surveyed the devastation of the recent conflict on her neighbors and the Lebanese villages on the other side of the frontier. The sound of gunfire sporadically popped in the distance. 'Unfortunately, we have no way of defending our own children without harming their children,' Weinberg, 58, said. 'It’s a tragedy to all sides.' Some 112,000 Lebanese remain displaced, out of over 1 million who fled their homes during the war. —— Sewell reported from Beirut.

Democrats splintered on immigration and how to respond to Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — When Donald Trump took office in 2017 with promises to crack down on immigration, he was met by widespread protests that filled churches, airports and union halls as Democratic lawmaker vowed to fight the new Republican president at every turn. The second time around, Democrats helped send an immigration bill to his desk during his first week in office. Stinging from election losses, the Democratic Party has so far been splintered in responding to Trump's push against illegal immigration. Yet the party’s soul searching comes as the stakes could hardly be higher. The new president is acting to seal off the U.S.-Mexico border to asylum seekers and deport millions of immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. 'I think Donald Trump has painted the Democratic Party into a corner on immigration, and it’s going to take us a while to get out of the corner,' said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. 'I want us acting out of conviction about what we believe about immigration rather than out of fear.' Looking for areas of agreement with Trump On Capitol Hill, a crucial faction of Democrats are looking for places of agreement with Trump. Between the House and Senate, 58 Democrats last week voted to pass the Laken Riley Act, which requires federal authorities to detain migrants accused of theft, assaulting a police officer, or other crimes that injure or kill someone. Meanwhile, other congressional Democrats said they spent the last week addressing the fears and developing resources for those who could be deported. Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., joined a priest at Our Lady of Guadalupe church in San Diego last weekend, carrying the Eucharist from home to home because so many in the congregation feared to go outside. What the Democratic votes may mean For Republicans, the votes on the Laken Riley Act were proof that they had found a winning message — amplified and led by Trump — on illegal immigration. They are planning to continue pushing immigration legislation, as well as a roughly $100 billion package that would enable Trump to carry out his border and deportation plans. Democratic senators willing to back tougher enforcement could be crucial. It takes support from 60 senators to advance most legislation, meaning that at least a few Democrats will need to be on board. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. 'It’s a really important moment for the country. And it’s always good when the right thing is also the popular thing,' said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after the Laken Riley Act passed. It was named after a Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man who had entered the United States illegally and was allowed to stay and to pursue his immigration case. When asked about Democratic votes for the legislation, the party's leader in the House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, was circumspect. 'House Democrats are going to continue to make decisions based on what's right for the districts that we represent, and the politics will take care of themselves,' he said. Since last year, many Democrats have steadily moved to the right on border security, emphasizing the need for stricter immigration enforcement after historic numbers of migrants arrived at times under Democrat Joe Biden's presidency. What Americans think Half of U.S. adults now think increasing security at the border should be a high priority for the federal government, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Another 3 in 10 adults say it should be a moderate priority. While most Democrats oppose deporting all immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally, about 8 in 10 also favor deporting immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of a violent crime. The Biden administration prioritized for deportation those who posed a threat to national security. The Trump administration plans to go further by beginning its deportation operation with immigrants tied to crime. Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat who last year won in Arizona while Trump also carried the state, was outspoken in his support for legislation such as the Laken Riley Act. He said that he' was just reflecting the will of his constituents, including many Latino voters. 'They want sane border security, commonsense solutions, more Border Patrol, more customs officers,' Gallego said. 'They want to see bad people get deported. They want to see an opportunity for good people — to find a way for them to stay here.' The search for unity Immigration advocates are frustrated by Democrats acquiescing to Trump's tough border. They fear Trump can own the narrative around immigration. Vanessa Cárdenas, the executive director of America’s Voice advocacy group, acknowledged that it was a 'tough moment' for Democrats. But, Cárdenas added, 'They need to find their backbone and put up a fight.' After the Laken Riley Act passed, leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a Democratic group that has usually played a key role in immigration policy, met with Jeffries as their party tried to formulate a united message. The group said it would focus on action to keep mixed-status families together, protect farmworkers and advocate for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Still, the group ranges from progressive members to those who voted for the new legislation. 'We have to show we have the ability to build consensus internally,' New York Rep. Adriano Espaillat, chair of the Hispanic caucus, told The Associated Press. At a news conference the next day, Espaillat laid out the practical concerns of mass deportations, from forcing out immigrants who have contributed to the U.S. for decades to rising food prices if agricultural laborers are targeted. The event was intended to present a united front, yet as members of the caucus took turns at the microphone, their promises varied. 'We are going to be here to fight back,' said Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y. Then Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M., spoke: 'There are opportunities for us to work with Republicans, such as fighting the cartels and coyotes who traffic women and children, provide an endless supply of drugs and hurt our border communities.' __ Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-democrats-are-splintered-on-immigration-and-how-to-respond-to-trump/	2025-01-26T05:04:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6796332fe402c3.23107511.jpeg?w=900
Crisis on the border: Trump's first week tackling immigration	Don’t miss 'Crisis on the Border' Tonight at 9p/8C, only on NewsNation. To find NewsNation on your screen, click here. (NewsNation) — President Donald Trump spent his first week in office bringing the U.S.-Mexico border to the nation's center stage. Donald Trump's first border actions His first actions included signing a slew of executive orders to curtail immigration and deport unauthorized migrants already in the country. One order, signed on Day One, shut down the CBP One app, canceling all outstanding appointments made by migrants seeking visas. Others designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, attempted to end birthright citizenship and shutter the U.S. refugee program. Immigration officers are also now permitted to enter sensitive locations like schools and churches to conduct raids. White House denies reports Mexico is refusing migrant flights In his first week, the 47th president deployed an initial 1,500 troops in California and Texas, making good on his promise to involve military personnel at the border. Multiple deportations were carried out via flight, some of which were reportedly refused by Mexico. The White House has since claimed there was a miscommunication and that Mexico has not refused any of the flights. Rep. Tony Gonzalez, R-Texas, confirmed that 80 Guatemalan nationals were deported by flight at Biggs Army Airfield in his district. Secret Service says it visited Chicago elementary school, not ICE ICE arrests more than 1,000 people across US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in 10 major U.S. cities — including Boston, Denver, New York City and Newark — have led to the arrests of more than 1,300 migrants, Trump’s 'border czar' Tom Homan told NewsNation on Thursday. Of those arrested, Homan said 1,000 have criminal records. The number of arrests in the first three days of Trump’s presidency represents about 1.1% of total arrests made by ICE in FY2024. Then, there were about 310 average arrests per day. That average is now about 433 per day — a number that will likely grow.

Trump touts 'no-tax-on-tips' plan in Nevada victory lap	President Trump on Saturday touted his campaign promise for tax-free tips and thanked Nevada voters for delivering his win as he stopped for a victory lap in the battleground state that flipped red for the first time in decades in November. 'In the coming weeks, I'll be working with Congress to get a bill on my desk that cuts taxes for workers, families, small businesses, and, very importantly, keeps my promise for a thing called .... No tax on tips,' Trump said to applause at the Circa Resort and Casino, his first visit to Nevada since taking office on Monday. 'So if you're a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, or one of my caddies — I go through caddies like candy, if I play badly, I always blame my caddy — or any other worker who relies on tipped income, your tips will be 100% yours,' he continued. Florida Republican urges Trump to spare some migrants under deportation plan Trump debuted his proposal to exempt tips from federal taxes at a rally in Nevada last summer, and he has pointed to its popularity among the state’s service and hospitality workers as a big factor in his victory there. Recent polling has shown the idea has traction nationwide, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last week reintroduced a bill to that end. As he talked up the proposal, Trump quipped to the Las Vegas crowd that 'I know you didn't hear anything about this, and I'm sure it had no influence on the state, the fact that we won this crazy, massive majority, the state that hadn't been won by a Republican in decades.' When Nevada flipped red in November, Trump became the first GOP presidential candidate to win the key swing state since President George W. Bush in 2004. 'I want to come to Nevada to pay my respects because this is the only Republican win of the state in decades, and it was a very big landslide,' Trump said, adding that 'I think Republicans are going to win a lot now.' Trump’s stop in Las Vegas came after back-to-back visits in hurricane-hit North Carolina and wildfire-torn Los Angeles, capping off a busy first week back in the Oval Office. From the Nevada stage, Trump laid out some of his accomplishments, including executive action to recognize only two sexes and end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in the federal government. White House denies reports Mexico is refusing migrant flights He touted his hiring freeze affecting the Internal Revenue Service, saying 'they hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 new workers to go after you, and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border.' 'How about just no tax, period?' Trump said to the crowd, after an audience member appeared to shout the suggestion. 'You know, if the tariffs work out ... a thing like that could happen.' The president also hinted at possible territorial expansion as he hailed plans to 'drill, baby, drill,' — comments that come as he floats U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. 'The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we may be a very substantially enlarged country in the not too distant — isn't it nice to see? You know, for years, for decades, we’re the same size to the square foot, probably got smaller, actually, but we might be an enlarged country pretty soon, and one of the things we're going to be doing is: drill, baby, drill,' Trump said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-touts-no-tax-on-tips-plan-in-nevada-victory-lap/	2025-01-25T14:34:17-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP25025748210008.jpg?w=900
CIA believes COVID likely originated from a lab, but agency has l...	WASHINGTON (AP) — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has 'low confidence' in its own conclusion. The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director. The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory. Mediterranean diet improves brain memory: Study Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities. 'CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,' a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment. Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs. Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. How will federal health ‘black out’ affect bird flu response? Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario. 'The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,' Ratcliffe said in 2023. The CIA 'will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA’s assessment,' the agency spokesperson said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ap-cia-believes-covid-likely-originated-from-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-its-own-finding/	2025-01-25T12:41:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67954d6fbb08b7.80370789.jpeg?w=900
White House fires some independent inspector generals	(NewsNation) — A White House official has confirmed to NewsNation that 'some' of the independent inspectors general of major federal agencies 'have been asked to leave.' NewsNation partner The Hill reported that Trump has ousted around 17 federal watchdogs within various departments including the Department of Veteran Affairs, Defense Department, State Department, Energy Department and Housing and Urban Development. A HUD spokesperson told The Hill that Inspector General Rae Oliver Davis received notice on Friday. The Washington Post reported late Friday night that 'the White House fired the independent inspectors general of at least 14 major federal agencies in a purge that could clear the way for President Donald Trump to install loyalists in the crucial role of identifying fraud, waste and abuse in the government.' Mexico refuses US military flight deporting migrants, sources say House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig criticized Trump's move in a statement on Saturday. 'While the president has the right to replace inspector generals, the late-night firing of these independent watchdogs not only violates the law but also hampers our ability to combat waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure programs are run as Congress intended, whether its disaster assistance for farmers or nutrition programs,' she said. Craig referred to the 'midnight purge of inspector generals' as 'alarming and unprecedented.' 'These firings threaten to undermine public trust at a time when many hardworking Americans doubt whether government institutions are looking out for them and reinforce the perception that politicians get to play by a different set of rules,' she added. Senator Chuck Schumer also ripped Trump on X, saying that it 'is a glaring sign that it’s a Golden Age for corruption and abuse in government.' In an earlier statement on the platform, Schumer also said it could be a violation of federal law with 30 day-notice needed to fire inspector generals.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/white-house-fires-independent-inspector-generals/	2025-01-25T09:24:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072294.jpg?w=900
Senate confirms Noem to lead Department of Homeland Security	The Senate on Saturday approved the nomination of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), putting her at the center of an administration focused heavily on immigration. The 59-34 vote to confirm Noem capped off a relatively smooth process even as other nominees face more intense scrutiny. Six Democrats voted with Republicans to confirm Noem: Sens. John Fetterman (Pa.), Tim Kaine (Va.), Andy Kim (N.J.), Gary Peters (Mich.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.). Noem will lead one of the most sprawling agencies in government and one of particular importance in a Trump administration determined to crack down on immigration. During his first week in office, President Trump signed a number of orders on immigration, taking steps to militarize the border and crack down on many legal pathways for immigrating to the U.S. That included suspending refugee admissions and working to limit asylum — another pathway for those fleeing danger and persecution. He also sought to end birthright citizenship for children not born to U.S. citizens. While the order would apply to children of those unlawfully present, it could also impact those born to non-immigrant visas, such as those legally in the U.S. on work visas. It has already been challenged in court. The nomination is a major win for Noem, a four-term congresswoman with little national security experience but who had been vocal on border issues as governor, sending the South Dakota National Guard to the southern border. She is slated to work closely with Tom Homan, who Trump tapped as his border czar. It also solidifies her standing in MAGA circles after chatter about her serving as a potential running mate to Trump faltered amid the release of her book, in which she wrote about shooting a young dog she described as untrainable. Noem earned the backing of those on both sides of the aisle despite the role she will play in a controversial policy area. 'Kristi brings experience and commitment to her new role,' Senate Majority John Thune (R-S.D.) said on the Senate floor on Friday. 'One of the biggest challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security right now is securing our nation’s border. Four years of record breaking illegal immigration at our southern border has left our country vulnerable to a whole host of security concerns.' 'Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities, and it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security,' Thune continued. 'I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.' Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the top Democrat of the Senate Homeland and Government Affairs Committee, said he was willing to back Noem due to her commitment to handling issues on a bipartisan basis. 'During her confirmation hearing, I pressed Governor Noem to set aside partisan ideologies and to follow the facts when it comes to the threats our communities face – whether we’re talking about securing our borders, foreign and domestic terrorism, or even increasingly devastating natural disasters,' he said in a statement when Noem advanced out of committee. 'Given her openness to working on a bipartisan basis to address these and other threats to our homeland security, I voted to advance her nomination out of committee and send it to the Senate floor for consideration.' The South Dakota governor was on track for a bipartisan confirmation after the panel approved her in a 13-2 tally on Monday. Noem’s role will not just be limited to immigration. She will also oversee the numerous national security functions DHS controls, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and DHS’s Office of Intelligence Analysis. DHS also oversees the Secret Service, which has come under increasing scrutiny following two attempts on Trump’s life. The department also plays a key role in responding to cyberattacks through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Trump has also recently spoken about siphoning off another key DHS agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has come under fire as it has responded to a series of back-to-back natural disasters. The confirmation marks the fourth national security nominee the Senate has green-lighted in Trump’s first week. The upper chamber unanimously and quickly approved Marco Rubio to lead the State Department before Democrats forced Republicans to run out the clock in order to confirm John Ratcliffe and Pete Hegseth to lead the CIA and Pentagon, respectively.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/senate-confirms-noem-to-lead-department-of-homeland-security/	2025-01-25T09:03:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/IMG_5214.jpeg?w=900
Inflation isn't the only reason egg prices are soaring	(NewsNation) — The last time eggs were under $2 a dozen was January 2022, around the time the now-widespread bird flu outbreak first originated. Now, egg eaters are lucky if they can find them cheaper than $7 to $9. Avian influenza, or bird flu, has killed millions of chicken flocks across the country, which is hurting the nation's egg-laying population. This has caused a supply shortage and in turn, higher prices for consumers. Egg prices have skyrocketed, with some grocery stores running out of the food item altogether and some placing limits on the number of cartons people can buy at once. In a statement to NewsNation, Walmart said they have not put a purchase limit on eggs but acknowledged that 'supply is very tight in some areas.' Experts say it’s going to get worse before it gets better. The Department of Agriculture reports that 136 million birds have been infected by or died from the bird flu since January 2022. More than 13 million chickens have died in the last month. Rents for single-family homes 41% higher than prepandemic In some states like California, prices have reached nearly $9 a carton, up 70% since December, according to the USDA Egg Markets News Report. Last week before President Donald Trump's inauguration, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would give biotech company Moderna just under $600 million to try to accelerate a bird flu vaccine. The FDA issued an alert saying eggs are safe to eat despite the infected chickens. Also, the risk of humans contracting the disease is rare. The CDC has reported 67 human cases and one death in Louisiana. The virus is also spreading among dairy cattle in California.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/egg-prices-soaring-bird-flu/	2025-01-25T08:39:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2195557704.jpg?w=900
Missing Florida woman Jennifer Kesse's family hopeful 19 years la...	(NewsNation) — Florida woman Jennifer Kesse was last seen leaving for work in 2006. 19 years later, her family is still searching for answers, but hope remains with the involvement of state and federal agencies. On the anniversary of her disappearance, Jennifer's father Drew Kesse joined NewsNation's 'Banfield' to share how he feels her case was mishandled and explain how NASA got involved in the search. 'It’s Jennifer's time in the lineup, I guess, to either be found or not found,' Drew Kesse said. What happened to Jennifer Kesse? In 2016, 10 years after her disappearance, Jennifer was officially declared dead by the state of Florida. Since then, the Orlando Police Department handed the case files over to the family, who have now hired a private investigator, hoping for answers. They also enlisted the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is now leading the investigation. The agency announced Friday that it has conducted more than 50 interviews and reviewed tens of thousands of documents and pieces of evidence in hopes of developing new avenues to explore. Christy Giles’ husband: Hollywood producer’s defense is ‘shaky’ Florida woman Jennifer Kesse was last seen leaving for work in 2006 'FDLE, finally after 18 years, got involved, and it took them a little while to get going, but boy, they're going now,' Kesse said. 'But they are truly putting all the resources that they have towards trying to find out what happened to Jennifer, and we couldn't be more grateful. It's, been too long.' Nearly two decades ago on Jan. 24, 2006, Jennifer's day started like any other. She took a shower, got dressed, did her hair and makeup and then headed to work. But that's when things veered from the usual routine. The 24-year-old simply vanished. Her boyfriend didn't get his usual text that morning, and he couldn't reach her by phone. She didn't show up for work, which was unlike her, according to friends and family. Family of woman killed by estranged husband wants longer sentence Jennifer’s parents realized her purse, keys, phone and iPod — items she typically would take to work — were missing from her home. That was when Jennifer's parents contacted the Orlando Police Department. Soon after, Jennifer's car was found abandoned a mile away at a different apartment complex. Apartment security cameras showed images of a man parking her car around noon the day she disappeared. Because the video was so grainy, police made the rare move of reaching out to NASA for help.

(Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) NASA was able to produce a clearer image, providing a partial profile of the suspect, who wore clothing typical of a painter or some kind of worker. At the time of Jennifer's disappearance, she told her parents that workers at her building made her feel 'uncomfortable.' Once the family received the evidence from local police, they realized the lead detective hadn't been investigating. 'Come to find out, she did not write a single word for seven years,' Kesse said. 'It's a good thing that it's out of Orlando. I honestly don't think that they had the talent to do what's needed to do in a long-term missing persons case.' Evidence in Jennifer Kesse's case A witness saw Jennifer's car swerve out of the condo complex. Handprints and scratches on her car, which appeared to have been cleaned before it was found, indicate there may have been a struggle. A skeleton key for Jennifer's building had gone missing a year earlier. Physical evidence from the car includes hairs and 100 fingerprints, some of which were not identified to a person at the time. 'We do have to remember, technology has come so far since 2006. We didn't even have Google Earth in 2006. It was in beta, so we were still tapping twice on our phones for the letter B when we were texting things like that,' Kesse said. 'So, it's come a long way. Unfortunately, it just didn't help Jennifer at the time.' The family remains hopeful despite the decadeslong delays. 'This is what we live with, and we move forward every day because we have unconditional love for Jennifer,' Kesse said. 'We're just not going to give up until we find her.'

Hegseth says Pentagon will 'put America first' as sec. of defense	(NewsNation) — Pete Hegseth praised Jesus, President Donald Trump and his wife Jennifer for his Senate-confirmed position as Secretary of Defense. After being sworn in, Hegseth thanked those of greatest importance to him before saying it is 'the honor of a lifetime to serve under [the president].' Hegseth added, 'We will put America first, we will bring peace through strength. [At the Pentagon], we will restore the warrior ethos in everything that we do, rebuild our military and reestablish deterrence.' Vice President JD Vance's tiebreaking vote allowed for Hegseth's nomination to go through, despite tough grilling from legislators during the confirmation process. 'We don't want to fight wars, we want to deter them and we want to end them responsibly,' Hegseth said. 'But, if we need to fight them, we're going to bring overwhelming and decisive force to close with and destroy the enemy, and bring our boys home.' Democratic states weigh more support for immigrants as Trump administration cracks down His children and wife joined him on stage as Vance swore him in. 'I have to say a few words of appreciation, first, of course, to the President of the United States for nominating a person who is respected and adorned by the war fighters,' Vance said. 'I also want to say thank you to my Senate colleagues. It turns out we couldn't spare one.' Trump praised the Senate's decision. He wrote on Truth Social late Friday, 'Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense.' On Saturday before the swearing-in, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, showed his support. 'Congratulations to Pete Hegseth on being confirmed as Secretary of Defense,' Turner said in a statement. 'As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I look forward to working with Secretary Hegseth on rebuilding our military and its readiness to meet the challenges posed by our adversaries.' Former Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposed Hegseth's appointment, voting no on Friday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-congratulates-hegseth-secretary-of-defense/	2025-01-25T08:01:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Pete-Hegseth-e1731682598233.jpg?w=900
Mexico refuses US military flight deporting migrants, sources say	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Mexico has refused a request from President Donald Trump's administration to allow a U.S. military aircraft deporting migrants to land in the country, a U.S. official and a Mexican official told Reuters. U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants, to Guatemala on Friday. The government was not able to move ahead with a plan to have a C-17 transport aircraft land in Mexico, however, after the country denied permission. A U.S. official and a Mexican official confirmed the decision, which was first reported by NBC News. Mexico's foreign ministry, in a statement late on Friday, said the country had a 'very great relationship' with the U.S. and cooperated on issues such as immigration. 'When it comes to repatriations, we will always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms,' the ministry said. Secret Service says it visited Chicago elementary school, not ICE The Mexican official did not give a reason for the denial of permission to land, while the foreign ministry did not mention the incident. Trump's administration earlier this week announced it was re-launching the program known as 'Remain in Mexico,' which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their cases in the United States were resolved. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday such a move would require the country receiving the asylum-seekers to agree, and that Mexico had not done so. The U.S. State Department and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S.-Mexico relations have come into sharp focus since Trump started his second term on Monday with the declaration of a national emergency along the two nations' shared border. He has ordered 1,500 additional U.S. troops there so far, and officials have said thousands more could deploy soon. The president has declared Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations, renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and threatened an across-the-board 25% duty on Mexican goods beginning in February. Sheinbaum has sought to avoid escalating the situation and expressed openness toward accommodating Mexican nationals who are returned. Colorado hotline sees increased ICE raid reports around Denver But the leftist leader has also said she does not agree with mass deportations and that Mexican immigrants are vital to the U.S. economy. The use of U.S. military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon's response to Trump's national emergency declaration on Monday. In the past, U.S. military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. This was the first time in recent memory that U.S. military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one U.S. official said. The Pentagon has said that the U.S. military would provide flights to deport more than 5,000 immigrants held by U.S. authorities in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California. Guatemala also on Friday received a third flight of about 80 deported migrants on a chartered commercial aircraft, Guatemalan authorities told Reuters.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/mexico-refuses-us-flight-deporting-migrants/	2025-01-25T06:21:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-2172480608.jpg?w=900
Trump's 5 biggest moves on immigration so far	President Trump released a flurry of immigration actions this week, signing a series of orders targeting the border and ramping up enforcement. While Trump has long pledged to address illegal immigration, many of his actions targeted longstanding legal pathways. 'As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,' he said in his inaugural address. Immigration advocates describe the actions as yet another example of Trump cruelty, targeting vulnerable people while causing further unrest at the border in ways that won’t make Americans safer. Here’s a look at Trump’s five biggest moves on immigration during his first week in office: Birthright citizenship Trump signed an order on Day One to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to many noncitizen parents. It’s a move that directly counters the Constitution, which grants citizenship to anyone born in U.S. territory regardless of the status of their parents. The order generated some of the first lawsuits — and legal victories — against the Trump administration. Twenty-two different Democrat-led states sued over the order, as did groups including the American Civil Liberties Union. And a four-group band of states led by Washington scored a temporary injunction blocking the order for the next two weeks. 'I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, said during the hearing. The order was broader than just targeting children of those who may not be in the country legally. It applied to anyone in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant visa, a status that also includes those on work visas, raising numerous questions for how the children of those lawfully present would be viewed under U.S. law. Refugee program suspended Another order from Trump paused the U.S. refugee program, leaving the program under review for three months. The order calls for the Departments of Homeland Security and State to issue a report within 90 days detailing whether it’s in the nation’s interests to resume the admission of refugees. The secretaries of State and Homeland Security will submit a report every 90 days until it is found that it is appropriate to resume refugee admissions, the order states. Until then, refugee admissions will remain suspended. Though the order was not set to take effect until Monday, both agencies immediately curtailed their refugee operations. The State Department suspended refugee flights, saying it was 'coordinating with implementing partners to suspend refugee arrivals to the United States and cease processing activities.' And an email reviewed by The Hill that was sent to staffers who process refugee cases at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also directed them not to 'make any final decisions (approval, denial closure) on any refugee application.' 'The refugee program is not just a humanitarian lifeline through which the U.S. has shown global leadership. It represents the gold standard of legal immigration pathways in terms of security screening, community coordination, and mutual economic benefit,' Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, which helps resettle refugees, said in a statement when the order was first announced. Shutting down the CBP One app After Trump took office, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol suspended the CBP One App, cancelling all outstanding appointments made by migrants without visas who sought to enter the United States through legal ports of entry. CBP One was a key component of the Biden administration’s efforts to channel migrants through legal pathways to seek refuge in the United States, one they also used to bring a more orderly process at the border. Shutting down the app left in limbo those who have been waiting months just to get an appointment. It also sparked criticism from immigration advocates who said the Trump administration was targeting those who have sought to come to the U.S. through legal channels. The Trump administration this week also shut down the Safe Mobility portal, another initiative of the Biden administration that established offices across Latin America to help immigrants find legal pathways to the U.S. and dissuade them from migrating illegally. Militarizing the border Trump signed a series of orders directing increased military presence at the southern border. He signed a proclamation Monday evening declaring a national emergency at the border, a move that will mobilize additional resources to the region. The declaration will allow the Trump administration to deploy Pentagon forces and resources to help complete construction of the border wall and also allows for surveillance at the border, including the use of uncrewed aerial systems. Trump also signed an executive order directing U.S. Northern Command to draft detailed operational plans for the border. That directive came in an order declaring an 'invasion' there. The Pentagon is sending around 1,000 Army soldiers and 500 Marines to the border, building on an existing practice of relying on troops to support existing immigration agents. But the White House’s nods to the potential for more troops raises questions over whether military presence at the border could eventually violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars troops from carrying out domestic law enforcement duties. Beyond potential legal issues, immigration advocates are also concerned about having armed troops in close proximity to migrants. 'Military people are trained for a very aggressive, bellicose scenario, not necessarily for crowd control,' said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 'And so we feel that there are other types of law enforcement agencies that are trained for that, and that are best suited to be at the border, and they are already at the border.' Boasting over the border While Trump has taken a significant number of immigration actions, in some cases his team also sought to take credit for ongoing immigration enforcement actions. The White House on Friday shared an image of migrants boarding a plane, saying 'deportations have begun.' The photo was also emblazoned with the words, 'Promises made. Promises kept.' Of course, deportations never stopped under President Biden, and the statement was mocked by immigration experts. 'Are these people seriously trying to suggest the deportation flights have not already been going on?' Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, wrote on X. 'They’re lying to you. The Biden administration had already ramped up deportations from the border to a higher level than it was under the Trump admin.' The photo of migrants boarding a plane to be deported was reportedly returning a group of Guatemalan citizens, a nation that accepted hundreds of deportation flights during the Biden administration. Government accounts on Friday also sought to highlight migrants arrests, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) touting it had made 538 arrests and lodged 373 detainers as of Thursday night. However, those figures are also not a sharp departure from the levels that were under Biden, with Reichlin-Melnick saying the Trump administration was 'slap[ping] a ‘mass deportation’ sticker on the side of normal ICE operations.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trumps-5-biggest-moves-on-immigration-so-far/	2025-01-25T04:07:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Immigration-–-5-things_012425_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=900
Hamas releases 4 female Israeli soldiers in ceasefire deal swap	(NewsNation) — Another four hostages in Hamas captivity were released Saturday morning and have returned to Israel, nearly one week since the start of the ceasefire deal with Israel in the war in Gaza. This is the second round of hostages freed since the deal took effect Sunday, Jan. 19. The hostages are four female Israeli soldiers, 19-year-old Liri Albag and 20-year-olds Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, who were kidnapped on Oct. 7, 2023, in the Hamas attack that spawned the war. Agam Berger, 20, was another female soldier abducted from their unit but was not included in the deal, reports say. Ceasefire deal timeline: What officials say will happen next The four women were seen in military uniforms handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross a few minutes after 4 a.m. ET (11 a.m. local) in Gaza City. Shortly after, the Israeli military confirmed. They will be medically evaluated, transferred to hospitals and then reunited with their families.

On the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three female hostages -- Emily Damari, 28; Romi Gonen, 24; and Doron Steinbrecher, 31 -- in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. An additional 200 prisoners were set free on Saturday.

Israel and Hamas are set to swap more hostages for prisoners in a...	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel and Hamas were expected to swap more hostages for Palestinian prisoners on Saturday, the second such exchange since a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip last weekend and another test for the deal. The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the militant group. The fragile deal has so far held, quieting airstrikes and rockets and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory. When the ceasefire started Sunday, three hostages held by the militants were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. On Saturday, four hostages are expected to be freed for 200 prisoners, including 120 who are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis. They will likely be released into Gaza or sent abroad. The four Israeli soldiers, Karina Ariev, 20; Daniella Gilboa, 20; Naama Levy, 20; and Liri Albag, 19, were captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war. They were taken from Nahal Oz base near the border with Gaza when Palestinian militants overran it, killing more than 60 soldiers there. The female abductees had all served in a unit of lookouts charged with monitoring threats along the border. A fifth female soldier in their unit, Agam Berger, 20, was abducted with them but not included in the list. Israel's military issued a statement Saturday morning saying that preparations had been completed to receive the hostages and provide them medical care and personal support at the initial reception points, then transfer them to hospitals and reunite them with their families. In Gaza City's central Palestine Square, a crowd began to gather early as militants worked to cordon off an area where the hostages were expected to be handed over to the Red Cross. After the swap, Israel is expected to begin pulling back from the Netzarim corridor — an east-west road dividing Gaza in two — and allowing displaced Palestinians in the south to return to their former homes in the north for the first time since the beginning of the war. Palestinians will only be allowed to move north on foot, with vehicular traffic restricted until later in the ceasefire. What happens after the deal’s initial six-week phase is uncertain, but many hope it will lead to the end of a war that has leveled wide swaths of Gaza, displaced the vast majority of its population, and left hundreds of thousands of people at risk of famine. The conflict began with a cross-border attack led by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 others hostage. More than 100 hostages were freed in a weeklong truce the following month. But dozens have remained in captivity for over a year with no contact with the outside world. Israel believes at least a third of the more than 90 captives still inside Gaza were killed in the initial attack or died in captivity. Israel's air and ground war, one of the deadliest and most destructive in decades, has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not say how many were militants. They say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. ___ Follow coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/ap-israel-and-hamas-are-set-to-swap-more-hostages-for-prisoners-in-another-test-of-the-gaza-ceasefire/	2025-01-25T00:03:34-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/67949b5bc22859.29490535.jpeg?w=900
Trump visit is 'morale boost': CA fire official	PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. (NewsNation) — Cal Fire battalion chief Brent Pascua said President Donald Trump's visit to Southern California following wildfire devastation is a 'morale boost' for the firefighters who have been working tirelessly. 'It's not over,' Pascua said during an appearance on 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' 'I don't know what Trump can give us, but it's a morale boost.' Trump toured the damage caused by wildfires in Southern California on Friday, later expressing that the devastation is beyond what can be captured in images. Trump says the federal government is behind California ‘100%’ Trump acknowledged he had a 'very positive talk' with California Gov. Gavin Newsom once he landed in Los Angeles. He told wildfire victims and city officials the federal government is '100% behind California.' Gavin Newsom signs $2.5B bill to aid California wildfire recovery His comments came after he took an aerial and walking tour of Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood destroyed by one of the recent fires. On Thursday, Newsom signed legislation directing $2.5 billion in relief to support response and recovery efforts for Los Angeles.

Bolton: What can Pete Hegseth do in a 'tripolar nuclear world'?	(NewsNation) — Democrats missed the chance to grill Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth on topics of national security while favoring questions about his 'drinking' and 'womanizing,' said Donald Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. 'I think the way the confirmation hearing was conducted left it entirely open to the Democrats to try and make the case against Hegseth on the basis of competence, and they didn't do it,' he said. Bolton told NewsNation’s Elizabeth Vargas that Hegseth’s expertise wasn’t fully put to the test during the hearing. Pete Hegseth will be confirmed, has ‘big shoes to fill’: Clark 'What are you going to do in a tripolar nuclear world where China joins Russia and the U.S. (in terms of nuclear weapon capabilities)? So we just don't know what (Hegseth) knows or doesn't know — but we're going to find out one way or another,' Bolton said. He believes that barring an unforeseen event, Hegseth will be confirmed as secretary of defense on Friday evening. Bolton’s security detail revoked He also addressed President Donald Trump’s decision to revoke his security detail, a move that could potentially endanger the former diplomat’s life. 'I think this kind of attitude by Trump shows that what his real motivation was was entirely political,' said Bolton. 'This is part of the retribution campaign.' Trump revoked government security protection for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and Bolton, all of whom have faced threats from Iran since they took hard-line stances on the Islamic Republic during Trump's first administration. Trump signs order to declassify files on JFK, RFK and MLK Jr. assassinations Bolton, who has been targeted for assassination by Iran, said the Republic is still looking to exact revenge for the U.S. assassination of Iranian defense official Qassem Soleimani in 2020. 'President Biden back in late 2021 ordered that I receive protection,' said Bolton. 'It was ordered on the basis that the reason the Iranians were threatening to — and not just threatening, trying — to hire hitmen to assassinate me was because I carried out my official responsibilities as national security adviser.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/pete-hegseth-confirmation-john-bolton/	2025-01-24T15:47:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/hegsethpete_120924gn02_w.jpg?w=900
Pete Hegseth will be confirmed, has 'big shoes to fill': Clark	(NewsNation) — Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth 'has some big shoes to fill' if he is confirmed, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark said on 'NewsNation Now.' 'I think it's the president's choice. That's our system,' the retired four-star general said ahead of Friday's Senate vote. 'I think the senior ranks in the military will do the best they can to work with the officer or leader appointed over them,' Clark added. Bolton: What can Pete Hegseth do in a ‘tripolar nuclear world’? Hegseth, a Fox News personality and former combat veteran, faces allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive actions toward women. He's denied all allegations. Detractors of the 44-year-old nominee also point to his inexperience and the Department of Defense's massive budget as a mismatch. 'Pete Hegseth has got to prove himself,' Clark said. 'He's got to earn their respect. Having the office is one thing, but actually doing the job is another.' Trump ends federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci If confirmed, which Clark thinks is likely, what matters most for Hegseth is who he works with — preferably, those with more bureaucratic experience. 'He's got to have people around him that he trusts who do have that experience,' Clark added. 'Because you're managing a huge bit of bureaucracy ... it requires attention to detail and management skill.'
