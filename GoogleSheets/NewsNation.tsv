Vance ramps up his clout in Trump world	Vice President Vance’s clout is on the rise, taking on the role of pot stirrer at the White House and on the world stage. His attack dog role was on full display during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when Vance confronted the foreign leader, calling him disrespectful and demanding appreciation for the billions in aid the U.S. has provided the country during its war with Russia. Vance’s more aggressive stance – including his ruffling of feathers in Europe and a visit to the southern border – follows weeks of tech billionaire Elon Musk in the spotlight, who at times has even surpassed President Trump for attention. 'Vance had his best week since being nominated,' a source familiar with the thinking of the White House said. 'Solidified himself as a go-to player with Trump and MAGA world.' As vice president, Vance took a seat behind Trump in the House chamber during the joint address to Congress, joining in with GOP lawmakers to jeer Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) and advocate for Green’s removal from the chamber for interrupting Trump’s speech in protest. He then traveled to the U.S.-southern border with Cabinet officials to highlight immigration, visit with patrol agents and held a press conference to talk tariffs and the border wall alongside Gov. Greg Abbott. But Vance really stole the spotlight last Friday, when a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went off the rails as Vance answered a question by a reporter in which he suggested Zelensky engage in diplomacy with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That prompted Zelensky to read off a list of aggressions taken by Putin against his country over the last decade after he asked Vance: 'what kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about?' 'I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,' Vance said as Zelensky attempted to interrupt. 'Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.' Some Republicans who spoke to The Hill about that meeting said Vance unnecessarily enflamed the talks. But MAGA world, who has increasingly been skeptical of funding for Ukraine and align with Trump’s 'America first' agenda also found Vance’s behavior refreshing. 'By going all in on defending Trump’s agenda and taking the fight directly to opponents, he’s solidifying his role as the administration’s top enforcer. This isn’t just about loyalty—it’s about power. Every punch he throws for Trump boosts his own standing with the base, reinforcing his credentials as a true MAGA warrior,' said Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor. He added, 'let’s be clear: this isn’t just about today. Vance is staking his claim to the movement’s future, positioning himself as the heir apparent for when Trump steps off the stage.' That Oval Office spat catapulted Vance into the spotlight in ways he had not been since Trump took office in January. It has instead been Musk who has taken over the limelight of the administration, in often controversial ways over how his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has partaken in radical reforms of the federal government, including dismantling entire agencies on a whim. 'There's this sense that you got folks, Vance and Musk are examples of this, who have free license to step into the breach right, which you don't ever see,' a source close to Trump world said. 'Trump has a certain amount of tolerance for freelancing…I think Trump likes people who perform.' But Trump’s tone has seen a slight shift this week, at least when it comes to Musk. During his second Cabinet meeting, Trump insisted that his Cabinet secretaries, not Musk, take the lead in finding cuts to their respective agencies, but added the caveat that if they didn’t do what was necessary, Musk would. Tensions are also reportedly flaring between Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has reportedly been furious with Musk for weeks since his team closed down the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), according to reporting by The New York Times. Meanwhile, Trump has left Vance in a tough spot when it comes to his political future. The president wouldn’t fully back Vance to be the next leader of the Republican Party during a Fox News interview leaving many to wonder just what Trump’s strategy was there. Some observers say that’s also led Vance to increase his posture. 'He’s got a pretty long leash in a different way than Musk to be the interpreter of the MAGA doctrine,' the source close to Trump world said. 'I think Vance certainly will be more aggressive in his posture because of that. Because he does want to be the heir apparent.' Vance caught the attention of GOP senators and the White House when he successfully lobbied for Trump’s more controversial Cabinet nominees – albeit behind closed doors. Vance was credited with talking them into reaching a point where they could vote yes on now-confirmed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Vance was also tapped by Trump to oversee a potential sale of the popular app TikTok ahead of the upcoming April 5 deadline. 'Vice President Vance has taken on projects, like TikTok and helping with Senate nominations, at the explicit direction of President Trump,' a source familiar with his work told The Hill. 'President Trump clearly trusts the Vice President to take on challenging tasks.' Some senators, meanwhile, are skeptical of Vance being Trump’s heir apparent and presidential hopefuls in the upper chamber will at some point start to create their own positioning for the future, the source close to Trump World described. 'I don't think it was lost on people that when Trump was asked if Vance was his successor, he didn’t immediately embrace them,' the source said. Meanwhile, Vance is cementing his role from multiple angles to show he can be the future of the party in 2028. He even defended Trump for declining to endorse him, arguing that its too early. 'Vance isn’t there to soften Trump, he’s there to drive the entire movement forward. To Trump, Vance is the product of what he started—young, aggressive, and fully committed to its future,' said Jordan Wood, a former Trump administration communications aide.

Trump-district Democrats face risky vote on GOP spending bill	House Democrats in districts carried by President Trump are confronting a potentially risky vote next week when GOP leaders are expected to put their partisan government funding bill on the floor. If the vulnerable Democrats support the bill, they’ll defy the position of their own leadership and undermine the party’s argument that the legislation is a threat to basic public services across the country. If they oppose it, they’re sure to face Republican attacks accusing them of endorsing a government shutdown — especially if the bill fails and a shutdown does occur. To be sure, the Republicans would be in the tougher political predicament if the government is forced to shutter, since they control all levers of power in Washington and their spending bill is a go-it-alone effort that excluded Democrats from the drafting. Democrats have long portrayed Republicans as incompetent stewards of government, and a shutdown on the GOP’s watch would provide them more ammunition to make that case. Still, those details might carry less sway with voters in the 13 Trump-won districts currently represented by Democrats, who face heavier pressure to cross the aisle in the promotion of bipartisanship. It’s those regions where GOP campaign operatives are eying every opportunity to highlight controversial votes in the effort to pick off vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the 2026 midterms. Next week’s vote on government spending might be one such vote. A number of those lawmakers are already defying the GOP threats with vows to oppose the continuing resolution (CR) when it comes up for a vote. Those voices are siding with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Democratic leaders. 'We need to pass full-year spending bills negotiated through a bipartisan process, but the party in power in the House, Senate, and White House has chosen not to do so — all while President Trump and unelected Billionaire Elon Musk are shutting down legally appropriated funds,' Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said Friday in an email. 'We cannot continue to kick the can down the road. We need to come to the table together and work together in a bipartisan fashion to get our work done for the American people,' she continued. 'I would support a bill that protects the middle class, seniors, veterans, small businesses, emergency responders, farmers, growers, and producers, and our Northwest Ohio communities. I cannot in good conscience vote for legislation that puts Northwest Ohio and our people on the chopping block to pay for tax cuts for Billionaires.' Another frontline Democrat opposing the GOP strategy is Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.). Asked this week if he would support a long-term CR, the Long Island Democrat — who represents another district carried by Trump last year — didn’t hesitate at all. 'No,' he said. Still, the offices of a vast majority of the 13 Democrats in Trump-won districts did not respond Friday to requests for comment about how they’ll vote on the CR. And one of those lawmakers, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), appeared to leave the door open to supporting it. While Cuellar blasted the CR strategy and endorsed 'a bipartisan spending agreement,' he also made clear that he’s averse to shuttering the government. 'I do not support government shutdowns,' he said in an email. 'As an appropriator, it has always been my top priority to ensure American taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and effectively. I am also focused on ensuring our vital services are protected. 'It is time to get a bipartisan agreement.' The Democratic opposition could prove crucial to the fate of the legislation, since House Republicans hold just a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber, and even a few GOP defections would sink the bill if Democrats are united in opposition. The legislation, known as a continuing resolution (CR), would extend federal funding at 2024 levels through the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends on Oct. 1. The proposal is currently being crafted by House GOP leadership, and is expected for release sometime this weekend. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said he wants to vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. But the CR strategy marks a departure from the initial plan of negotiating a bipartisan deal on higher levels of spending for 2025, as outlined by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), which was approved by both parties in 2023. After Johnson abandoned those talks, Democratic leaders came out in opposition to the CR, warning that Republicans will be on their own to pass the bill. In a letter sent Friday to Democratic lawmakers, the top party leaders — Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — said the Republicans’ bill is a 'partisan' effort 'that threatens to cut funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year.' 'That is not acceptable,' the Democrats wrote. Democrats have also sought assurances that the White House would spend the money as Congress appropriates in the wake of President Trump and Elon Musk’s efforts to slash the federal bureaucracy, which has been a nonstarter for Republicans. The Democratic leaders are hoping their opposition to the CR will force Republicans back to the negotiating table, where Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, had been in bipartisan talks for months in search of an agreement on the 2025 numbers. Upping the stakes, a number of conservative Republicans have declined to commit to supporting the CR when it hits the floor next week. 'I’m open [to a CR], but like I said, I want to see what’s in it,' Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) told reporters this week. 'You can call it anything you want, I just want to see what’s in it.' Republicans, fighting to downplay their own internal divisions, are already trying to exploit the Democratic opposition. Just minutes after the Democratic leaders released their letter on Friday, the GOP’s campaign arm issued a statement attempting to shift the blame for any shutdown on the Democrats. 'House Democrats admitted they wanted a government shutdown, and now they're following through,' Mike Marinella, spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), said Friday in a statement. 'They're deliberately making our country less safe and less prosperous just to score political points.' How far that message resonates with the Democrats in Trump-won districts remains to be seen.

Buckets of chicken nixed as last meal for inmate Brad Sigmon: Att...	(NewsNation) — The South Carolina inmate who died by the rare execution method of firing squad this week requested a last meal of KFC to share with his death row neighbors, but prison officials nixed the idea, his attorney says. Instead, convicted murderer Brad Sigmon was served his own meal of Southern comfort food, according to the South Carolina Department of Corrections. It consisted of four pieces of fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy, biscuits, cheesecake and sweet tea, officials said. If Sigmon had his way, he would have shared three buckets of the original recipe KFC with his fellow death row inmates, attorney Gerald 'Bo' Hunt said in a prepared statement. Is a firing squad execution more humane than lethal injection? 'That request was denied,' he said. His final meal was served Wednesday evening, two days before Sigmon's execution. In the interim, he ate cafeteria fare, a corrections department spokesperson said. She said she could not confirm the information about the request for buckets of chicken. On Friday evening, Sigmon was restrained in a chair with a hood over his head and a target on his heart. A trio of volunteer marksmen fired simultaneously at 6 p.m. Columbia, S.C., time, and the inmate was pronounced dead three minutes later, witnesses and officials said. The 67-year-old inmate was convicted of fatally beating David and Gladys Larke, the parents of his ex-girlfriend, in 2001. Sigmon kidnapped his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint with the intent of committing a murder-suicide, but she managed to escape. According to a last statement read at his execution, Sigmon called for an end to capital punishment, saying it’s not supported by the New Testament.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/buckets-of-chicken-last-meal-firing-squad/	2025-03-08T16:33:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/chick.jpg?w=900
Trump shifts tone on Musk as tensions rise with Cabinet	President Trump is signaling a softer approach to the mass firings of federal government workers led by Elon Musk as cracks emerge between the tech billionaire and Cabinet secretaries running the agencies he’s gutting. Musk’s swift and wide-ranging cost-cutting efforts have been met with pushback from some in Washington, who have complained behind-the-scenes about the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) upending of norms. Trump’s shift in tone emerged this week when he stressed that his Cabinet secretaries take the lead on staffing choices, insisting that cuts be made with a 'scalpel' instead of a 'hatchet.' That came after a contentious meeting Thursday attended by Trump, Cabinet secretaries and Musk at the White House, which was followed by an explosive report in the New York Times about clashes between Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump blew off a question about friction between Musk and Rubio when a reporter asked him to weigh in from the Oval Office after the Times report published. But his response earlier this week stressing that his Cabinet secretaries take the lead in making what he deems appropriate cuts to federal agencies signals some potential pushback from his secretaries as to how Musk has been handling things. Still, the president left the door open for Musk to take the reins back, telling his Cabinet that if they didn’t make the right cuts, then the Tesla CEO would. 'At some level, Musk has been a little bit callous in the presentation. And then when you talk about veterans across the country, disabled vets, people like that, losing their jobs, at some point that stuff starts to take hold,' a source close to Trump world said. 'You got to execute with a little more precision and more with a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer. Now Trump may not care, right? Because they think they can win the larger victory just by doing it. It comes down to the personality base… and the personal stories,' the source said. A former Trump official suggested the president’s shift in tone was an acknowledgment of the political and legal scrutiny toward DOGE that has ramped up in recent weeks. The official noted that Thursday’s Cabinet meeting took place behind closed doors, where it could be more candid than the on-camera gathering last week that was dominated by Musk. In a clear sign of tension, Musk called out Rubio in the second meeting for not firing enough people from his department The New York Times reported. Rubio has reportedly been furious with Musk for weeks since his team closed down the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and during the spat, Musk suggested Rubio was only good for television before Trump stepped in to commend his secretary of state’s work and suggest everyone work together. When Trump was asked about the reported clash, he said, 'no clash, I was there.' 'Elon gets along great with Marco and they’re both doing a fantastic job,' he said, later adding, 'Marco has done unbelievably as Secretary of State. And Elon is a unique guy and has done a fantastic job.' Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins also reportedly said in that meeting that cuts have to be more strategic, with Trump agreeing with him. Collins, in an op-ed in The Hill, stressed the importance of supporting veterans and said his agency 'is conducting a department-wide review of its organization, operations and structure' in response to the DOGE workforce initiative from Trump. Musk wore a suit during the meeting, a subtle but noticeable change from the 'Tech Support' T-shirt and black MAGA hat he wore during a previous Cabinet meeting. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a 'great and productive meeting,' but did not directly address the reported disagreements. 'Everyone is working as one team to help President Trump deliver on his promise to make our government more efficient,' Leavitt said in a statement. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Friday expressed his support for Musk directly, as well as Trump’s 'approach' to working with him. 'The President's approach of a scalpel versus a hatchet and better coordination between Secretaries and DOGE is the right approach to revolutionizing the way our government is run. @USDOT will continue to work closely with @elonmusk,' Duffy said on X. Aside from the heat emanating from the Cabinet, the administration’s work to cut waste from the government has faced its biggest roadblocks through the courts. A coalition of unions representing federal employees sued last month over efforts to conduct mass layoffs across the government. A federal judge this week ordered the administration to release payments to contractors and nonprofits connected to USAID, which has been hardest hit by Musk’s efforts to slash spending. On Capitol Hill, Republican senators told Musk this week that his aggressive moves to shrink the federal government will need a vote by Congress, with lawmakers seemingly irked at being bypassed. Republican senators have taken particular issue with thousands of firings planned at the Department of Veterans Affairs and layoffs of federal employees that have affected veterans in particular. 'There’s a real separation between, USAID is funding a transgender puppet show in Kuwait versus we’re giving life saving medicine in Sub Saharan Africa or we’re helping children who are getting literally pouches of peanut butter not starve to death. I think even the most cynical Americans think that, okay, we have some role in that,' the source close to Trump world said. Trump’s comments also bring his public rhetoric more in line with the White House’s assertion in court filings that Musk is not the administrator of DOGE and does not have the authority to make policy decisions on his own. And, they build on an executive order Trump signed last week, directing agency leaders to work with DOGE staff and look at contracts, employee travel and other areas, as well as build a centralized system to record every payment. Despite the shifts in guidance around handling Musk, Democrats, unions and activists are expected to keep up their pushback on the billionaire’s work for Trump, including the host of Democratic attorneys generals who are plaintiffs in several lawsuits against the administration. Senate Democrats this week asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether Musk is leveraging his government position to pressure advertisers into spending more on his social media platform, X. Critics say though that putting Cabinet secretaries in charge over Musk doesn’t mean the legal issues will stop. 'Unfortunately, closing the barn door after the horse has bolted does no good,' said Norm Eisen, executive chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund, which has represented plaintiffs in a complaint that Musk’s actions are in violation of the Constitution because he is not Senate-confirmed. 'In fact, this attempted backtrack is an admission that the vast chaos that Musk and DOGE have wrought without proper approval and documentation is illegal— and so must be completely unwound.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-shifts-tone-on-musk-as-tensions-rise-with-cabinet/	2025-03-08T15:28:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/trumpdonald_muskelon_030425gn01_w.jpg?w=900
House GOP seeks spending cuts, defense increases in plan to avert...	House Republicans on Saturday unveiled a six-month stopgap government funding plan, that seeks cuts to nondefense programs while boosting funding for defense. The bill's rollout kicks off a crucial stretch for GOP leadership to lock down support ahead of Friday's shutdown deadline with a Trump-backed strategy that has drawn the ire of Democrats. The plan seeks to keep the government funded through September. While it is considered a continuing resolution (CR), Republicans say its funding levels in the 99-page bill are below those previously set as part of a bipartisan funding deal last year, as leadership has faced growing pressure from its right flank to drive a harder line on curbing government spending. Will Medicaid face cuts? How Americans could be affected Republicans say the plan would allow for moderate increases to defense funding to the tune of about $6 billion above fiscal year 2024 levels, though below levels previously agreed to for fiscal year 2025 under a bipartisan spending-limits deal struck in 2023. The bill also seeks to allow the Defense Department flexibility to start new programs and move funds around, as defense hawks have raised concerns about the military being hamstrung by a six-month funding patch without major changes. The bill will also fund already-authorized pay increases for junior enlisted military personnel. Republicans say the stopgap measure would increase funding for veterans healthcare and housing, and funds the WIC program. But overall funding for non-defense programs would decrease by about $13 billion below fiscal year 2024 levels. Republicans say the bill would also reflects a request to rescind IRS funding. House GOP leadership staff said ahead of the release that the bill was crafted in close coordination with the White House. GOP hardliners, who have long opposed CRs, have signaled they are open to supporting the Trump-backed strategy. Leland Vittert’s War Notes: Singing Into Irrelevancy 'The House and Senate have put together, under the circumstances, a very good funding Bill (‘CR’)! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week.' Trump posted on Truth Social after the bill’s release. 'We have to remain UNITED — NO DISSENT — Fight for another day when the timing is right. VERY IMPORTANT. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' he said. Democrats have come out in sharp opposition to the strategy, however. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, voiced strong criticism of the funding plan on Saturday, dubbing the measure as a 'power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people.' 'Reading the CR bill text now,' she wrote on the social platform X. 'Republicans are zeroing out the Toxic Exposures Fund (to care for veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances) on October 1. They cut $23 billion from their own bill they passed last year. You can’t make this stuff up.' Trump tariffs already costing border money, jobs Government programs have been running on stopgaps since last October, the start of fiscal year 2025. But Democratic negotiators raised a list of concerns over the potential consequences that a CR through the end of the fiscal year could pose to defense programs and military effectiveness, health care costs, pay reforms for wildland firefighters, veterans services and food assistance programs. At the same time, their Republican counterparts have sought to pin blame on Democrats over the stopgap, citing their push for assurances that the administration will spend the money as directed – which GOP leaders have panned as a nonstarter. In the last Congress, Democratic support was key for GOP leadership to pass funding measures in the House, due to the Republicans' slim majority. And given that the House GOP’s control has only narrowed in the current Congress, Republican leadership is taking a risk in pressing on with a strategy panned by Democrats as a go-it-alone approach that undercuts a bipartisan spending-limits deal struck in 2023. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said this week that Republicans are on their own to find the votes to pass the funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters earlier this week that he thinks Republicans will be able to 'pass it along party lines,' but he added that he believes 'every Democrat' should vote for the legislation. Al Green censure highlights increased appetite for retribution in House But GOP leadership will need near unanimity in their conference to pass the bill if all Democrats vote 'no.' And a small number of hardline conservatives signaled on Thursday that they still weren’t sold on the strategy, which some Republicans have griped would lock in Biden’s funding priorities. 'I'm ruminating on it,' Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told reporters on Thursday when asked how he would vote if a stopgap running through September was brought to the floor. 'I talked to the president about it,' Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) also said Thursday, after noting he hasn’t yet said he 'was on board' with the plan. 'I just got some questions. Is it truly going to be clean? Is appropriations going to add a bunch of amendments for the Pentagon?' Some hardline conservatives had warned ahead of the release that their support for the stopgap plan could be in jeopardy depending on the price tag, while pressing for offsets for any potential add-ons, including in areas like defense. At the same time, defense hawks have sounded the alarm over how defense programs would fare under the plan in recent weeks. 'The costs of deterring war pale in comparison to the costs of fighting one. If Congress is unwilling to make deterrent investments today, then discussions about urgency of looming threats — particularly the ‘pacing threat’ of China — carries little weight,' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) wrote in an op-ed published by The Washington Post days back. House Republicans are expected to take swift action on the legislation, eyeing a floor vote on the measure as soon as Tuesday.

Walmart pays back towed customer, fires towing company	PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) — Those who observed it told us. People got out of their cars at the Frederick Boulevard Walmart, went inside to shop, and by the time they came out, their cars were gone. A car would then show up, and car owners were put in that car and taken to Always Swift Towing to get their own cars — usually leaving behind $375 in cash. Back in December, Alison Copeland, a disabled driver who had a disabled placard to hang on the rearview mirror of her car, said her car was wrongly towed by Always Swift Towing, which had a contract to tow cars from the Walmart. 'As a shopper of Walmart, I no longer want to go to Walmart because I don’t know if my car is going to be gone,' Copeland said. At the time, Copeland showed NewsNation affiliate 10 On Your Side a photo of her car, the company telling her that it was keeping another car from parking in the next spot. Missing teen ‘lured’ to man’s home was killed, dismembered: St. Pete police 'This is my vehicle, and this is the right side back tire and it's crossed the line,' Copeland said, 'and they indicated that it was preventing another car from parking in the next spot.' 10 On Your Side asked her if that was true? 'No, I think they were wrong,' she said. 10 On Your Side also confronted Always Swift Towing, and though supervisors did not want to be seen, they came to WAVY to show us their pictures, which showed the tires were over the line into the next parking space. 'Why did we tow her? Because she was double-parked,' someone from the company said. 'It’s over the line.' But we pointed out to the supervisor that she was parked just over the line, and her point was that someone on the other side was over the line, which made her have to park over the line on the other side. The supervisor said what Copeland said was not true. But we asked the supervisor — she’s disabled, why not throw her a break instead of towing the car? Said an Always Swift Towing supervisor: 'We are doing what Walmart wanted us to do.' Now, Walmart doesn’t want them to come on property. Following WAVY's reporting, Copeland sent an email up the line. 'So, I decided to just send an e-mail to Walmart's CEO, their head of marketing, whomever that I could find from the CEO all the way down.' Brad Sigmon’s final conversation with his spiritual adviser 'I couldn't sleep because of this,' Copeland said. 'I wanted my money back, but I couldn't sleep, and it gave me nightmares because it just wasn't fair. And not just me. There were others that may not have had the money to get their car.' 10 On Your Side went back to Walmart to see store manager Jamie Cobb, who referred us to corporate. But in this email to Copeland, Cobb wrote: 'I recently received your request for reimbursement. ... Please come at your convenience to receive your money.' Said Copeland: 'So, I came back, back Saturday and they did give my money back in cash, $375.' Cobb also wrote how she worked to terminate the Always Swift Towing contract. 'I worked very hard to get this contract cancelled,' Cobb wrote. 'As of 12/24/24 they are no longer allowed on property.' Proof of that? Gone are the 'towing enforced signs' and 'vehicles will be impounded to Always Swift Towing.' Copeland teed off on the towing. 'I'm thinking about a civil lawsuit because I get upset about it,' Copeland said. 'I'm upset and it is much deeper than the $375, because it appears to be a target towards the handicapped.' Copeland added this on speaking out: 'Just don't give up. If you feel you've been done wrong [and] something's not right, speak up, stand up [and] don't give up, because that's why we're here. Don't give up.' She also said this about 10 On Your Side. 'I mean what you did was huge,' she said, '... and I'm really grateful. With all the people who email you, you chose me. I just felt like somebody has to stand up for what's right. And I know that, you and 10 On Your Side is all about telling what’s right.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/walmart-pays-back-towed-customer-fires-towing-company/	2025-03-08T12:36:40-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-2025-03-07T191902.079.jpg?w=900
House Republicans unveil bill to avoid shutdown and they're darin...	WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans unveiled a spending bill Saturday that would keep federal agencies funded through Sept. 30, pushing ahead with a go-it-alone strategy that seems certain to spark a major confrontation with Democrats over the contours of government spending. The 99-page bill would provide a slight boost to defense programs while trimming nondefense programs below 2024 budget year levels. That approach is likely to be a nonstarter for most Democrats who have long insisted that defense and nondefense spending move in the same direction. Congress must act by midnight Friday to avoid a partial government shutdown. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is teeing up the bill for a vote on Tuesday despite the lack of buy-in from Democrats, essentially daring them to vote against it and risk a shutdown. He also is betting that Republicans can muscle the legislation through the House largely by themselves. Normally, when it comes to keeping the government fully open for business, Republicans have had to work with Democrats to craft a bipartisan measure that both sides can support. That's because Republicans almost always lack the votes to pass spending bills on their own. Crucially, the strategy has the backing of President Donald Trump, who has shown an ability so far in his term to hold Republicans in line. Trump praised the bill, writing on X that Republicans have to 'remain UNITED — NO DISSENT — Fight for another day when the timing is right.' 'Great things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country's ‘financial house’ in order,' he said. House Republicans' leadership staff outlined the contours of the measure, saying it would allow for about $892.5 billion in defense spending and about $708 billion in nondefense spending. The defense spending is slightly above the prior year's level, but the nondefense spending, the aides said, was about $13 billion below last year. The measure also will not include funding requested by individual lawmakers for thousands of community projects around the country, often referred to as earmarks. The bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs are on auto pilot and are not regularly reviewed by Congress. The top Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Washington Sen. Patty Murray, both issued statements blasting the legislation. 'I strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution,' DeLauro said. Murray said the legislation would 'give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending — and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike.' Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the focus must be on preventing a shutdown because closures have negative consequences all across government. 'They require certain essential government employees, such as Border Patrol agents, members of our military and Coast Guard, TSA screeners, and air traffic controllers, to report to work with no certainty on when they will receive their next paycheck,' Collin said. 'We cannot allow that to occur.' Trump's request for unity appears to be having an effect. Some conservatives who almost never vote for continuing resolutions expressed much openness to one last week. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., says he has never voted for a continuing resolution, what lawmakers often call a CR, but he is on board with Johnson's effort. He says he has confidence in Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, to make a difference on the nation's debt. 'I don't like CRs,' Norman said. 'But what's the alternative? Negotiate with Democrats? No.' 'I freeze spending for six month to go identify more cuts? Somebody tell me how that's not a win in Washington,' added Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, another lawmaker who has often frequently voted against spending bills but supports the six-month continuing resolution. Republicans are also hoping that resolving this year's spending will allow them to devote their full attention to extending the individual tax cuts passed during Trump's first term and raising the nation's debt limit to avoid a catastrophic federal default. Democratic leaders are warning that the decision to move ahead without consulting them increases the prospects for a shutdown. One of their biggest concerns is the flexibility the legislation would give the Trump administration on spending. The Democratic leadership in both chambers has stressed that Republicans have the majority and are responsible for funding the government. But leaders also have been wary of saying how Democrats would vote on a continuing resolution. 'We have to wait to see what their plan is,' said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. 'We've always believed the only solution is a bipartisan solution, no matter what.' House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said earlier this week that the Democratic caucus would meet and discuss the legislation at the 'appropriate moment.' But he struck a more forceful tone Friday. Jeffries said Democrats are ready to negotiate a 'meaningful, bipartisan spending agreement that puts working people first.' But he said the 'partisan continuing resolution' threatens to cut funding for key programs, such as veterans benefits and nutritional assistance for low-income families. 'That is not acceptable,' Jeffries said. Trump has been meeting with House Republicans in an effort to win their votes on the legislation. Republicans have a 218-214 majority in the House, so if all lawmakers vote, they can afford only one defection if Democrats unite in opposition. The math gets even harder in the Senate, where at least seven Democrats would have to vote for the legislation to overcome a filibuster. And that's assuming all 53 Republicans vote for it.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-republicans-try-to-go-it-alone-on-government-funding-as-shutdown-deadline-nears/	2025-03-08T11:07:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67cc9681c02198.81790467.jpeg?w=900
Trump's Scotland golf resort vandalized by pro-Palestinian activi...	(NewsNation) — A group of pro-Palestinian activists vandalized President Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland on Saturday morning. Palestine Action claimed responsibility for the crimes, which included defacing a building, digging up greens and painting 'GAZA IS NOT 4 SALE' on a fairway. Other graffiti that read 'Free Gaza' was spotted on part of a building at Trump Turnberry. On X, the activist group issued a threat to the president. Inside hidden cartel smuggling tunnels in the Rio Grande Valley 'Whilst Trump attempts to treat Gaza as his property, he should know his own property is within reach,' the post said. According to multiple reports, Police Scotland is investigating the incident. It follows Trump's proposal to turn the war-torn Gaza Strip into a 'riviera of the Middle East.' 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,' Trump said last month, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. Two weeks ago, Trump shared an AI-generated video to Truth Social, purporting to show what the Gaza Strip looks like now and under his purview.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/trump-scotland-golf-resort-vandalized-pro-palestinian-activists/	2025-03-08T08:01:37-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-1252558896.jpg?w=900
How to pay off debt using the avalanche method	(NewsNation) — Don't let debt drown you. There are various methods for reducing credit card debt, and the first step is to find the one that works best for you. One route to consider is the avalanche method. What is the avalanche method? With this strategy, you prioritize paying off debt with the highest interest rate. Start by listing your debts from highest interest rate to lowest and then put as much money as possible toward the debt with the highest rate. Once that’s taken care of, move on to the debt with the next highest rate, and so on. How to quickly pay off debt in 2025 If one has an especially high interest rate, you may want to consider paying this one off first. 'If you have three different credit cards, one has a 30% APR (annual percentage rate), one is 20 and one is 15, you’d want to focus on paying off the 30% APR balance first because it’s the most expensive,' John Kiernan, managing editor of WalletHub, a financial services company, told NewsNation in December. You should continue making at least the minimum monthly payments on your other credit cards. Other strategies for paying off debt Another popular strategy for paying off debt is the snowball method. This approach is all about paying off the smallest balance first and building momentum. This involves prioritizing debts in order of smallest balance to largest balance. Credit card debt: Answers to frequently asked questions 'The benefit of this method is that you’ll pay off your smallest balances more quickly, which can be motivating and act as a springboard toward paying off more of your debts,' according to Experian, one of the three major credit-reporting agencies.

Brad Sigmon's final conversation with his spiritual adviser	(NewsNation) — Brad Sigmon, a South Carolina inmate executed by the firing squad, was allowed to meet with his spiritual adviser one last time Friday morning. Rev. Hilary Taylor, executive director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, spoke with Sigmon for two hours before his execution. 'When I was with Brad this morning from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., Brad and I and another spiritual adviser talked about supporting family and friends,' Taylor said on NewsNation’s 'Banfield.' 'Whereas for the people that he loved, the people that he had formed community with before his incarceration and also during his incarceration.' Sigmon chose to die by firing squad – the first inmate in the U.S. in 15 years to be executed by this method – because he was afraid of lethal injection. Lethal injections can sometimes go wrong. In the 1985 execution of Texas inmate Stephen Peter Morin, it took execution technicians nearly 45 minutes to find a suitable vein, for example. South Carolina executes inmate by firing squad 'Lethal injec­tion had the high­est rate of botched exe­cu­tions,' according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a national nonprofit that analyzes data on capital punishment. Execution methods in the U.S. include hanging, electrocution, lethal gas, lethal injection and firing squad. 'The thing that Brad was forced to do was to make an impossible decision between being injected with poison by people who are not medical doctors, being cooked alive by electric chair or having his chest blown out of, or having his heart blown out of his chest by the firing squad,' Taylor said. Sigmon, 67, was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents in 2001. At the time of the murder, Sigmon was attempting to kidnap his ex-girlfriend and confessed that he was likely going to kill her and then himself. He forced her into his car when she arrived at her parents’ home, but she jumped out of it as Sigmon drove away and escaped. Gov. Henry McMaster declined to grant clemency. He was pronounced dead at 6:08 p.m. Friday. 'I want my closing statement to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to end the death penalty,' Sigmon said in his final statement read to witnesses, according to the South Carolina Department of Corrections. Gerald 'Bo' King, chief of the Capital Habeas Unit for the Fourth Circuit, issued the following statement on behalf of Sigmon's legal team: 'Knowing that he was going to die, Brad Sigmon used his final statement to call on his fellow people of faith to end the death penalty and spare the lives of the 28 men still locked up on South Carolina’s death row.' Violent and sudden. What a firing squad execution looked like through my eyes Six inmate executions are planned over the next three weeks in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Florida using a variety of methods. Sigmon was the first South Carolina inmate to die by firing squad. 'He expressed remorse every day of his incarceration at the violence that he caused and sought to be a different person since his incarceration,' Taylor said. 'Tried to be as supportive and loving as kind as possible to everyone in his midst, whether that was his neighbors on death row, whether that was corrections officers, whether that was pen pals and family members that he was supporting from afar, emotionally and spiritually.'

Francis rests in hospital as Holy Year marches on without him, th...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis continued his recovery from double pneumonia on Saturday as the Vatican’s Holy Year proceeded without him on a weekend dedicated to the Catholic Church’s volunteers. 'The night passed quietly, the pope is resting,' said the Vatican’s early morning update. The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, enters his fourth week at Rome’s Gemelli hospital with his condition stabilized following a few bouts of acute respiratory crises. In his absence, the Vatican was going ahead with its Jubilee celebrations, the once-every-quarter-century Holy Year that is drawing pilgrims from around the world to Rome. This weekend, the Holy Year is celebrating volunteers, and many are extending their pilgrimage to pray for Francis outside the Gemelli hospital. On Sunday, one of the cardinals most closely associated with Francis' papacy, Canadian Cardinal Michael Czerny, presides over the Holy Year Mass for volunteers that Francis was supposed to have celebrated. On Friday, Francis spent 20 minutes in the Gemelli hospital chapel, praying and doing some work in between rest and respiratory and physical therapy, the Vatican said. A medical update was expected later Saturday. Francis has been using high flows of supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night. Doctors not involved in his care said after three weeks of acute care in the hospital for double pneumonia, they would have hoped to have seen improvement. While he has stabilized, they warned that he was increasingly at risk of secondary infections the longer he remains hospitalized. Additionally, Francis had episodes of acute respiratory failure earlier this week and underwent bronchoscopies to suction mucus from his lungs. 'He’s had respiratory failure and they were not able to liberate him from the hospital in the first three weeks. And therefore I think you’d say this does look concerning, perhaps more concerning than it did right at the beginning,' said Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospitals in England. Dr. Jeffrey Millstein, a clinical assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said it wasn’t shocking that Francis hadn’t improved in three weeks, and that it was encouraging he was able to breathe part of the day with just a nasal tube of high-flow oxygen. But he said that the pope's condition certainly was 'a precarious, touch and go kind of situation' and that recovery, while still possible, would be a long process. Going forward, 'I just would be looking for no new setbacks,' he said. 'I think as long as he is dealing with the current issues and he’s just making incremental progress, that would be great.' Francis was hospitalized Feb. 14 for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

South Carolina executes inmate by firing squad	(NewsNation) — South Carolina on Friday executed convicted murderer Brad Sigmon by firing squad after the death row inmate called for the end of capital punishment through a written statement that was read to witnesses. It was the first time in 15 years that a firing squad had been used in the United States, and the first time for South Carolina. Sigmon, 67, was convicted of fatally beating his ex-girlfriend's parents in 2001. The execution was carried out Friday evening about 6:05 p.m. local time after Gov. Henry McMaster declined to grant clemency to Sigmon. Witnesses at the execution in Columbia say three voluntary marksmen fired in unison at Sigmon, who was wearing a hood and strapped to a chair with a red target over his heart. He reportedly was wearing a black jumpsuit and black Crocs. This undated image provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows Brad Sigmon. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File) The inmate was pronounced dead at 6:08 p.m., said Chrysti Shain, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Corrections. She said the inmate's last statement, read to witnesses, called for the end of capital punishment. Social Security Administration offices DOGE, Elon Musk is closing 'I want my closing statement to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to end the death penalty,' Sigmon said, according to the statement. Sigmon had selected firing squad over the electric chair or lethal injection. His attorney, Gerald 'Bo' King, told NewsNation earlier that Sigmon was afraid of the electric chair and avoided lethal injection because the last three procedures in South Carolina were botched. 'So, Mr. Sigmund was in the position of having to choose between the firing squad, which has never been used in South Carolina, hasn't been used in the United States in 15 years, or the prospect of dying for over 20 minutes while strapped to a gurney, while (his) lungs fill up with fluid and blood,' King said. 'And having seen this happen with three men that he knew very well — men considered brothers — that was not a choice that he could bring himself to make.' The last time Sigmon talked to King was Thursday afternoon. He's made peace with what will happen to him, NewsNation was told. Some family members of the victims, David Larke and Gladys Gwendolyn Larke, were in attendance to watch the execution. They included the victims' grandson, Ricky Sims. 'He's going to pay for what he’s done,' Sims said to the Greenville News. 'He took away two people who would have done anything for their family. They were the rock of our family ... They didn't deserve it.' At the time of the murder, Sigmon was attempting to kidnap his ex-girlfriend and confessed that he was likely going to kill her and then himself. He forced her into his car when she arrived at her parents’ home, but she jumped out of it as Sigmon drove and escaped. How long should you keep tax return records? Friday's execution marks the sixth one that's planned over the next three weeks in America. The other states that will be carrying out these executions include Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Florida using a variety of methods including lethal injection and, in the case of Louisiana, death by suffocation from a gas chamber.

Missing teen 'lured' to man's home was killed, dismembered: St. P...	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) — The St. Petersburg Police Department announced that a teenage girl was killed by a man who 'lured' her through social media. During a Friday press conference, Chief Anthony Holloway said a witness came forward on Thursday with information about the victim, 16-year-old Miranda Corsette. Oldsmar mother charged with murdering her own baby, detectives say In their investigation, detectives learned that Miranda was met with Steven Gress, 35, through a social media app on Feb. 14.

'and to the kids also, if someone is contacting you who is not a family member please let your parents know.' After meeting Gress at his home located at 27th Avenue North, police said Miranda returned to his home the following day. Miranda remained with Gress and his 'domestic partner,' Michelle Brandes, 37, at the home until an alleged dispute on Feb. 20 over some missing jewelry, in which the teenager was beaten. According to detectives, Miranda was killed sometime between Feb. 20 and Feb. 24. Homicide victim Miranda Corsette (WFLA) Miranda was homeschooled and lived with her grandmother.

Sheriff to give update on investigation into Hackman's death	(NewsNation) — Investigators will be providing an update into the death of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, more than a week after both were found dead in their home near Santa Fe, New Mexico. There are still more questions than answers in the case, including how the couple died, how long their bodies were there and if they died at the same time. What happened to Gene Hackman? Hackman and Arakawa were found on Feb. 26, 2025, and the story has drawn widespread attention. Officials initially said there were no signs of foul play but deemed the deaths sufficiently suspicious to warrant investigation. Diddy accused of ‘forced labor’ in latest indictment Hackman, 95, and Arakawa were discovered by two maintenance workers who saw the remains through the window and called the police. Hackman was found near the kitchen and Arakawa was found in a bathroom with pills scattered nearby. One of the three dogs they owned was also found dead inside a crate. The other two dogs were found alive. The remains were decomposing and partially mummified, and that, along with evidence from Hackman's pacemaker, suggested they could have been dead for as long as several weeks. Authorities have estimated that Hackman was likely dead for nine days before the body was found, with the last event on his pacemaker recorded on Feb. 17. The couple tested negative for carbon monoxide, and a gas company found no evidence of gas leaks, ruling out carbon monoxide poisoning as a cause of death. There also did not appear to be any external injuries on the bodies, but authorities found decomposition and Arakawa's hands and feet appeared mummified, something that usually starts more than two weeks after a person dies. Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez wedding guest list: Who’s in, who’s out? Officials also initially suspected a fall as Hackman was found with his walking cane and sunglasses next to his body but later said there were no indications of injuries that would have resulted from a fall. Items taken from the home as evidence included cell phones and medication, including a thyroid medication, a medication used for high blood pressure or chest pain and Tylenol. Questions about investigation The office leading the investigation has been under intense scrutiny, especially after some discrepancies in initial statements, including an initial misidentification of the breed of the dog that had died. Another discrepancy came when the person who called 911 to report the bodies said the home was locked, and he couldn't get inside. A deputy later the caller found the front door open and investigators later said the two surviving dogs had been able to get in and out of the house through an open door.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/sheriff-update-gene-hackman/	2025-03-07T12:15:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67c03deecb2542.00148934.jpeg?w=900

The remarks, part of the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum at the University of Chicago, come after the Labor Department released the first jobs report of Trump's second term. The report shows that the U.S. added 151,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent.

Inside hidden cartel smuggling tunnels in the Rio Grande Valley	(NewsNation) — Border Patrol agents in Texas' Rio Grande Valley sector are ramping up efforts to dismantle smuggling operations. Human smugglers are becoming more sophisticated, agents said, using tunnels as part of a broader network of illegal entry points along the border. NewsNation spent time with the Border Patrol Marine Unit, whose agents serve as the first line of defense against illegal immigration and drug trafficking into the United States. The area is a common route for smugglers, who use rafts to get migrants across the river and onto U.S. soil. But they're not only using rafts — agents say smugglers have also taken their operations underground. During a recent operation along the banks of the Rio Grande, the team approached a makeshift tunnel, where smugglers had installed a pipe before agents were able to seal it off with cement. Border Patrol welcomes military assistance Agents told NewsNation the tunnel was only halfway completed and never fully operational but that it was just one of many, as smugglers along the border continually adapt their methods. A drainage system that was once used by smugglers, according to Border Patrol, was blocked off by a cage placed by agents, but officials said cartel operatives are still attempting to repurpose it. There was evidence that fresh cuts had been made — clear signs of smugglers testing weak points, agents said. Alongside this system, smugglers are also reportedly digging makeshift tunnels and constantly looking for new ways to bypass security. 'Once they start digging holes like that, you gotta be extra careful and not just look at the actual drain, but look around. And that's how we found that other one,' Cesar Hernandez of the Border Patrol Marine Unit told NewsNation. Agents later uncovered another tunnel after finding wooden planks reinforcing the walls and a wooden door, both covered with fresh brush. Border Patrol agents said they remain vigilant while searching for tunnels along the Rio Grande because smugglers work fast. One day, the area can look untouched, they said; the next, a tunnel can be found hidden under fresh brush or debris. Do ICE arrest numbers align with Trump’s mass deportation plans? The Marine Unit is one of the most dangerous jobs in Border Patrol, agents said. They told NewsNation that while the job may seem quiet on the surface, the reality is far from it. Their work never stops, they said, and they remain on high alert — because smugglers and cartel scouts are always watching. Smugglers aren't just going underground. They're still using the river too, officials said. Even with tunnels emerging, the Rio Grande remains a critical crossing point. On the Mexican side of the river, migrant camps that were once full now appear abandoned, reflecting a shift in enforcement. Border Patrol is apprehending fewer migrants, and cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico is ostensibly having an impact.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/hidden-cartel-smuggling-tunnels-border/	2025-03-07T08:12:24-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Cartel-tunnel.jpg?w=900

Linda McMahon: Federal student aid could shift to another departm...	(NewsNation) — Newly confirmed Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon believes student loans, Pell Grants and other federal aid 'might best be served in another department,' though it's unclear which that would be. 'We're looking at them all across the board, and how can they be best handled if the Department of Education, you know, does not exist,' McMahon told 'NewsNation Live' on Friday. Linda McMahon gives Education staffers their ‘final mission’ McMahon reiterated that her 'mission' of dissolving the department she's tasked with leading has not changed — but even if the department shutters, she said federal funding isn't expected to end. 'This is not a turn off the lights and walk out of the department,' McMahon said. 'It's with close consultation with Congress and looking how the needs of students can best be serviced.' Linda McMahon: Executive order doesn't change Education Department 'mission' Trump on Thursday was expected to sign an executive order asking McMahon to dissolve the agency she’s tasked with leading, though the White House later reversed course. An official told NewsNation the administration will continue to review the department in the meantime. 'The President campaigned on this. He's been crystal clear that he wants to see the Department of Education closed, and he'd like to see it done sooner rather than later,' McMahon said. 'But he understands that we need to work with Congress. There are certain things that are in statute.' List of Social Security Administration offices DOGE is closing McMahon said she feels her job is to secure the administration the 60 necessary Senate votes — and Congressional approval — to dissolve the department. 'I think my job is to convince Congress that the steps that we are taking are in the best interest of the kids,' McMahon said. The department has been on the chopping block since Trump's presidential campaign, when he advocated for giving education power to the states. Education Dept. shutdown ‘needs to be priority’: Jonathan Butcher 300+ workers took Education Department buyout: Linda McMahon The Education Department sent an email to employees Feb. 28 offering a $25,000 cash payout if they resign by Monday, March 3, at midnight. McMahon told NewsNation on Friday that 'over 300 people' accepted the payout during the four-day window. The buyouts are part of what McMahon called an 'audit' from the Department of Government Efficiency. The Elon Musk-led task force has been examining federal agencies for waste and enacting sweeping layoffs.

US employers added 151,000 jobs last month; unemployment up to 4....	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added solid 151,000 jobs last month, but the outlook is cloudy as President Donald threatens a trade war, purges the federal workforce and promises to deport millions of immigrants. The Labor Department reported Friday that hiring was up from a revised 125,000 in January. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.1%. The job market has been remarkably resilient over the past year despite high interest rates. List of Social Security Administration offices DOGE is closing 'Despite rising concerns about the health of the economy, momentum remains positive,’’ Lydia Boussour, senior economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, wrote in a commentary. Billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of federal workers was not expected to have much impact on the February jobs numbers. The Labor Department conducted its survey of employers too early in the month for the Department of Government Efficiency layoffs to show up. The American job market has remained remarkably resilient, but it has cooled from the red-hot hiring of 2021-2023. Employers added a decent average of 166,000 jobs a month last year, down from 216,000 in 2023, 380,000 in 2022 and a record 603,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from COVID-19 lockdowns. Hiring continued despite high interest rates that had been expected to tip the United States into recession. The economy’s unexpectedly strong recovery from the pandemic recession of 2020 set loose an inflationary surge that peaked in June 2022 when prices came in 9.1% higher than they’d been a year earlier. In response, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades. The economy remained sturdy despite the higher borrowing costs, thanks to strong consumer spending, big productivity gains at businesses and an influx of immigrants who eased labor shortages. Inflation came down – dropping to 2.4% in September -- allowing the Fed to reverse course and cut rates three times in 2024. The rate-cutting was expected to continue this year, but progress on inflation has stalled since summer, and the Fed has held off. Future of Gaza aid operations in limbo amid Trump funding freezes Economists expect that workers' average hourly earnings rose 0.3% last month, down from a 0.5% increase in January, a drop likely to be welcomed by the Fed — but not enough to get the central bank to cut rates at its next meeting March 18-19. In fact, Wall Street traders aren’t expecting another cut until May, and they're not especially confident about that one, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Economists say the economic outlook is growing more uncertain as Trump imposes — or threatens to impose — a series of taxes on imported goods. 'Steep tariff increases could cause adjustments in business decisions with knock-on effects on hiring and wages as business leaders navigate higher input costs and retaliatory measures,' Boussour said. 'This could lead to a more severe job slowdown, weaker income and restrained consumer spending amidst much higher inflation.’’ © Copyright 2024 Associated Press.

Diddy accused of 'forced labor' in latest indictment	(NewsNation) — U.S. prosecutors amended an existing federal indictment against Sean 'Diddy' Combs on Thursday, accusing the rapper of 'forced labor.' The move comes as Combs faces a May 5 trial on federal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty. Lawyers allege Combs forced his employees to work long hours and would threaten those who did not aid his alleged trafficking ring. Luigi Mangione, Diddy in partial lockdown at prison after ‘race riot’: Report Though no new official charges were added, the indictment details these new allegations, including forcing employees 'to work long hours with little sleep.' 'He looks forward to his day in court when it will become clear that he has never forced anyone to engage in sexual acts against their will,' Marc Agnifilo, Combs' lawyer, said in a statement to Reuters. Combs faces a slew of sexual assault allegations, some of which allegedly date back decades. Combs is being held in the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center, where Luigi Mangione, the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is also held.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/diddy-accused-forced-labor-indictment/	2025-03-07T04:21:35-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/673d1fe35bf946.05677514.jpeg?w=900
Trump says he’s 'looking at' revoking protected status for Ukrain...	President Trump said Thursday he’s looking at whether to revoke temporary protections for thousands of Ukrainians in the United States who fled that country’s war with Russia, but that no final decision has been made. 'We're not looking to hurt anybody, and we're certainly not looking to hurt them,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. 'And I'm looking at that, and there were some people that think that's appropriate, and some people don’t, and I'll be making a decision pretty soon.' Trump added that Ukrainians had 'gone through a lot.' Do ICE arrest numbers align with Trump’s mass deportation plans? Reuters reported earlier Thursday that the Trump administration planned to revoke protections for roughly 240,000 Ukrainians who had fled to the United States following Russia’s 2022 invasion. The move would lay the groundwork for those individuals to be deported. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back on the report at the time, saying no decision had been made. The Biden administration first announced it would allow Ukrainians into the country though Uniting for Ukraine, paroling migrants into the country for two years so long as they were able to secure a U.S.-based sponsor. The Biden administration also announced in January before leaving office that it was extending temporary protected status (TPS) for Ukrainians until October 2026, 'due to armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Ukraine that prevent individuals from safely returning.' The revocation of TPS for Ukrainians would be in line with the Trump administration’s broader approach to cracking down on legal pathways to enter the United States amid a widespread crackdown on immigration. The Trump administration has similarly targeted parole programs that allowed citizens of Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela into the country. White House reverses course on Education Department executive order And Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in January suspended TPS protections to roughly 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. before taking a similar move for some 520,000 Haitians. Trump has issued a flurry of executive actions suspending the refugee program and targeting other legal pathways that allow migrants to enter or remain in the country. Those actions have sparked numerous suits, including challenges to the pause in refugee admissions as well as the recission of TPS for Venezuelans.

Louisiana execution recharges debate on death by nitrogen gas	(NewsNation) — A death row inmate slated to become the first person to be put to death by nitrogen gas in Louisiana is seeking to halt the execution, citing constitutional concerns over the controversial killing method. Jessie Hoffman is set to be executed March 18, but his attorneys are asking a judge for a preliminary injunction to prevent it due to the secrecy of how the execution will be carried out. The inmate will present his arguments during a hearing on Friday in which he is expected to testify. Hoffman was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1996 rape and killing of 28-year-old Mary 'Molly' Elliot. Hoffman’s lawyers say that he was informed Feb. 20 that he will be killed using nitrogen gas, but state officials have not yet provided a detailed execution protocol, which the lawyers say is necessary to meet his constitutional rights. Will Luigi Mangione face the death penalty? 'The State wants to roll out this new gas protocol but keep it hidden from the public and even from the man they seek to kill,' Samantha Kennedy, executive director of the Promise of Justice Initiative, who is representing Hoffman, told NewsNation. 'Jessie Hoffman has a right to know how he's going to be killed, and we have a right as his attorneys to be able to determine if it's going to be a constitutional.' Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill has defended the state’s decision to utilize nitrogen hypoxia, a method used to suffocate a person by denying them oxygen and allowing them to only inhale nitrogen gas. 'On March 18, 2025, the State of Louisiana will execute Hoffman by nitrogen hypoxia for Molly’s murder. We have and will continue to vigorously defend the State’s obligation to carry out this sentence and bring justice to the family and friends of Molly Elliot,' Murrill said in a statement. Murrill told NewsNation local affiliate WVLA that she hasn’t personally spoken to the victim's family. History of nitrogen gas executions in the US The country’s first execution using nitrogen gas was carried out last year in Alabama, which has now been used to execute four people in the state. If Hoffman’s execution doesn’t get halted, Louisiana will become the second state to utilize the method on death row inmates. All of the men executed in Alabama using nitrogen shook or gasped to varying degrees on the gurney as they were being put to death, according to media witnesses, including The Associated Press. Rev. Jeff Hood, the spiritual advisor for Kenneth Smith, who was the first person to be killed using nitrogen, witnessed his execution and called it 'a slow, painful means of torture.' Smith's execution was 'the most violent thing that I have ever witnessed or engaged with,' Hood told Catholic news outlet OSV. 'It was absolutely … incredibly disturbing to see a human being suffocated to death.' Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has maintained the method as 'painless and humane.' After convicted murderer Alan Miller settled a lawsuit against Alabama over the use of nitrogen gas in 2024, Marshall stated, 'The resolution of this case confirms that Alabama’s nitrogen hypoxia system is reliable and humane.' Lethal injection, electrocution and now firing squads. A look at US execution methods Alabama's nitrogen executions prove even more how untested this method is, Kennedy said. 'It's impossible to know if somehow Louisiana Department of Corrections has fixed all the problems that happened in Alabama, where every single time they killed people with gas, it was absolutely a torturous, gruesome, horrific experience,' she said. 'Jessie Hoffman and the public have a right to know what is the process that Louisiana is engaging in, and ... if they're upholding everyone's constitutional rights.' Which states allow for the use of nitrogen gas in executions? Currently, four states allow nitrogen gas executions: Louisiana, Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi. An Arkansas bill that would allow nitrogen on death row inmates passed the state House on Tuesday and will now advance for a full vote. Louisiana had paused executions for 15 years due to an inability to secure lethal injection drugs, but with a nitrogen gas execution protocol finalized last month, the state has been eager to proceed. 'For too long, Louisiana has failed to uphold the promises made to victims of our State’s most violent crimes, but that failure of leadership by previous administrations is over,' Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement. Firing squad could become Idaho’s main execution method under a bill awaiting governor’s approval Louisiana scheduled two executions on consecutive days in March, but inmate Christopher Sepulvado, who was scheduled to be executed one day before Hoffman, died on Feb. 23 of an illness. Hoffman had initially challenged Louisiana’s lethal injection protocol in 2012 on the grounds that the method was cruel and unusual punishment. U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick dismissed the lawsuit in 2022 because the state had no executions planned but reopened the case last month, saying that the scheduled executions were 'extraordinary circumstances' that warranted more scrutiny. A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay in Dick’s ruling while it considers an opposition from Murrill.

Do ICE arrest numbers align with Trump's mass deportation plans?	(NewsNation) — Federal immigration officials boast migrant arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have jumped more than 600% under President Donald Trump, but agency data indicates that enforcement of the administration’s overall immigration mission may not be as impressive as published numbers suggest. Trump border czar Tom Homan insists the administration’s mass deportation effort is targeting 'the worst of the worst.' But of the nearly 21,000 migrants that were in ICE custody in February, just more than half had previous convictions, and many others were charged with immigration-related offenses that often do not result in removal from the United States. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem remained focused on the more than 20,000 migrant arrests ICE has made under Trump, which she said jumped 627% from the number of 'at-large' arrests made by the agency in all of 2024 under former President Joe Biden’s watch. Trump changes course and delays some tariffs on Mexico and Canada Noem claims that Trump’s border agenda is 'saving lives every day because of the actions we are taking to secure the border and deport illegal alien criminals.' But a Migration Policy Institute analyst noted that Noem’s calculations of the 627% jump included only about 30% of the 113,000 arrests that ICE made in 2024, which the MPI expert said significantly shrinks the gap between ICE arrests under Trump and Biden. A former ICE official claims such formulas highlight how the Trump administration is selectively using data to create a narrative about the federal agency’s daily work. Jason Houser, the ICE chief of staff between 2021 and 2023, told NewsNation that the 'politicization and the mass media consumption of typical ICE work' is part of the biggest shift in ICE’s new mission. Houser said ICE agents previously did their jobs quietly rather than having raids promoted on social media with Homan, Noem and celebrities like Phil McGraw in toe. Now, 'It’s all about the volume,' Houser said, adding, 'Arrests don’t equate to detained.' What migrants is ICE targeting for arrest? The nearly 20,820 migrants held by ICE in February represent about half of the 43,759 detainees in federal custody. Of those being detained by ICE and Customs and Border Protection, 52.1% do not have a criminal record, according to data released by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. ICE data shows that about 23,000 arrests have been made by the agency's immigration officers since Trump’s second term began. However, many of those being taken into custody are released because federal detention centers are at near capacity, Houser said. As ICE data shows, many of those in custody either have criminal charges pending (32%) or face 'other immigration' offenses. However, for every bed being filled by someone who may not be facing deportation, Houser said, 'a criminal is not in (a bed).' US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, along with other federal law enforcement agencies, attend a pre-enforcement meeting in Chicago, Illinois, US, on Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025. President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the largest deportation effort in US history, vowing to ultimately deport all of the foreigners living in the country without permission. Photographer: Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg via Getty Images In recent weeks, NewsNation reached out to ICE with multiple requests for comment, seeking clarification of its data and which ICE detainees are scheduled for deportation. Buoy barriers on Rio Grande have doubled in size A spokesman responded Thursday, saying that since Jan. 20, ICE has 'significantly increased' its immigration enforcement activities with additional federal agencies. To keep Americans informed of federal efforts accurately, the spokesman said, 'ICE is compiling and validating the data.' He added that moving forward, the agency will publish data monthly rather than quarterly, as has been ICE’s practice. What migrants are being held in ICE custody? As federal officials seek more detention space for migrant detainees, including at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Homan told The New York Times he could not predict the number of migrants who would be deported this year. Homan has said in other interviews that Congress needs to provide more funding to the mass deportation effort and bolster federal immigration enforcement agency budgets. 'The more money you have, the more successful we’re going to be,' Homan said. Vance urges people to leave US voluntarily before deportation As Homan waits for congressional funding, however, the administration has limited the information it releases, including to NewsNation. The agency stopped publishing daily arrest numbers under Homan’s concerns that it alerted criminal migrants where ICE may be striking next. In this handout photo provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the New York City Fugitive Operations Team, joined by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, conducted targeted enforcement operations resulting in the arrest of an illegal Dominican national on January 28 in New York City. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Getty Images) Yet other former immigration agents suggest that too much media attention is being given to arrest numbers rather than the bigger mission of removing criminal migrants. The immigration system is broken into criminal and civil administrative categories, the latter of which is often largely ignored, former Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Victor Avila said. In many cases, migrants who enter the country illegally and do not present themselves to border officials are charged with a misdemeanor offense. However, once they are deported and reenter the country, they face up to two years in prison as a second illegal entry pushes the offense to a felony, Avila said. But the former HSI agent warns that just because migrants haven’t been charged with crimes like rape or murder doesn’t meant they do not pose a threat. 'They’re committing the crime, but they haven’t committed a crime that the public can see,' Avila told NewsNation, including offenses such as using false documentation and identification cards to allow migrants to avoid law enforcement. He said that although migrants, including those who overstay their visas or ignore orders to leave the country, fall into the 'noncriminal' category, that does not mean they will face a different fate than those who get more of the national spotlight. Avila said that’s where Trump’s stern approach to border security is changing the narrative of ICE’s directives. 'That’s the difference,' Avila said. '(ICE is) not going to look the other way the way the Biden administration did and gave them a pass for being here illegally.' That's the approach being taken by Noem, who was recently part of an ICE raid in Northern Virginia. In a social media post that included video of Noem dressed in tactical gear surrounded by agents, she wrote, 'If you come to this country and break our laws, we'll hunt you down.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ice-arrests-trump-deportation-plans/	2025-03-06T14:22:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/GettyImages-1152488290-e1737689110961.jpg?w=900
Is a firing squad execution more humane than lethal injection?	(NewsNation) — For the first time in 15 years, the United States will put someone to death using a firing squad when South Carolina executes death row inmate Brad Sigmon on Friday. Sigmon chose a firing squad over lethal injection and electrocution, which are also authorized by the state, citing concerns that little is known about the drugs or process used in injections. While the method may seem barbarous, it felt the most humane to the inmate, his lawyer said. 'The fact that he ‘chose’ this, that tells you how fearful he is about this lethal injection process that’s so shrouded in secrecy,' his lawyer, Gerald 'Bo' King, told The Washington Post. Sigmon feared that the electric chair would be being 'cooked to death' and that lethal injection could cause pulmonary edema, a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs and can feel like suffocation or drowning, King told The Washington Post. FILE - This undated image provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows Brad Sigmon. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File) What is Brad Sigmon sentenced to die for? Sigmon, 67, is being executed for the 2001 killings of his ex-girlfriend’s parents at their home in Greenville County. 'I miss my momma and daddy,' Sigmon’s ex-girlfriend, Rebecca Armstrong, said of her slain parents to USA Today. 'I didn’t get to see them grow old.' The South Carolina Supreme Court rejected an 11th hour and likely last appeal to halt the execution Thursday. Condemned South Carolina killer chooses to be executed by firing squad Why did Sigmon not choose lethal injection? His main appeal to halt the execution was to gain more information about the drug South Carolina uses in lethal injections so he could have a better understanding of what to expect, King said. South Carolina has a shield law that keeps the suppliers of its lethal injection drugs, the members of the execution team and the procedure used to kill an inmate secret. FILE - This undated photo provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows the state's death chamber in Columbia, S.C., including the electric chair, right, and a firing squad chair, left. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, File) Autopsies from two inmates executed by lethal injection in South Carolina showed massive amounts of the drug pentobarbital and a considerable amount of fluid in their lungs. A defense expert testified the inmates might have struggled to breathe. Lethal injection, electrocution and now firing squads. A look at US execution methods Lawyers for the state have said fluid is often found in the lungs of prisoners killed by lethal injections, and other courts have not ruled it was cruel and unusual punishment. Other than South Carolina, five states authorize the use of firing squads, including Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah. Only Utah has utilized death by firing squad on three inmates in 1977, 1996 and 2010 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. How the firing squad execution will happen Friday’s execution will be carried out by three volunteer firing squad members using live ammunition from behind a wall about 15 feet from the inmate, according to officials. Bullet-resistant glass has been installed between the witness room and death chamber. 'The inmate will be strapped into the chair, and a hood will be placed over his head. A small aim point will be placed over his heart by a member of the execution team,' officials said. Not much is known about the people who will fire the rifles. Prison officials said they have 'completed all required training.' The information released by the state to the public gives no indication what might happen if an inmate survives the initial shots. At the 2022 trial, witnesses indicated the squad could fire again. Is the firing squad a humane or heinous method of execution? Some say the firing squad is more humane than lethal injections, which have been botched in the past. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a 2017 dissent that 'in addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.' Her comments came in the case of an Alabama inmate who asked to be executed by firing squad. A Supreme Court majority refused to hear his appeal. In her dissent, Sotomayor said lethal drugs can mask intense pain by paralyzing inmates while they are still sentient. 'What cruel irony that the method that appears most humane may turn out to be our most cruel experiment yet,' she wrote. Bryan Kohberger faces firing squad execution, Idaho victim’s dad supports Dr. James Williams, an emergency room physician, has testified on the effectiveness of the firing squad. 'There is a lot of evidence that the near-instant loss of blood pressure means no blood gets to the brainstem, and there is a rapid loss of consciousness,' he told The Marshall Project. However, Williams stresses that, just as with any other execution method, protocols must be precise to avoid mistakes. Talking about the Utah firing squad deaths, Williams said that 'when the written protocol was fully followed, none were botched, which speaks strongly to the reliability of this method.' He added that 'Utah had four loaded rifles and South Carolina will use just three, along with a blank, which should be adequate. But there’s the possibility a shooter is not adequately trained, or faulty ammunition.'

Trump’s Middle East envoy confirms direct talks with Hamas	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — White House special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff confirmed Thursday the Trump administration has been in direct talks with Hamas.

It’s the first known direct engagement between the U.S. and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. White House reverses course on Education Department executive order The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Witkoff said the U.S. would not allow Hamas to 'be a part of' any potential government formed in Gaza.

Corporations partly to blame for high egg prices: Report	(NewsNation) — Egg shortages and high prices have largely been blamed on an outbreak of bird flu, but a new watchdog report says companies are creating the crisis by price gouging their customers. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture, the price of eggs has nearly doubled in the last six weeks, with the average cost of a dozen at around $8. Bird flu, which has spread poultry and also affected dairy herds, has 'slightly reduced' egg production, but 'corporate greed has also played a major role,' a report from Food and Water Watch published Wednesday said. White House reverses course on Education Department executive order According to the report, about 10 companies control the vast majority of the eggs produced in America, and they dictate egg prices whether there's a bird flu outbreak or not. One of these companies, the Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods, increased their profits by 7.5 times over the first year of the bird flu outbreak — despite not having outbreaks in their own flocks that fiscal year, Food and Water Watch found. During that fiscal year, from June 2022 through May 2023, Cal-Maine actually sold 7% more eggs compared to FY2021. The report says Cal-Maine Foods 'commanded prices from its buyers that were much higher than needed to cover rising costs, at a time when national egg prices were skyrocketing.' 'Basically, they just raised their prices and locked up with national prices. They had no reason to,' Amanda Starbuck, research director for Food and Water Watch, said. In FY2021, Cal-Maine took in $0.15 per dozen eggs produced and sold, according to the report. It then made $1.14 per dozen eggs in FY2023, and sold over 1 billion eggs. 'That's $1 billion dollars in windfall profits that they made from the consumers having to pay more for eggs,' Starbuck said. Cal-Maine did not respond to the Associated Press' request for comment. House votes to censure Al Green for disrupting Trump speech American Egg Board President Emily Metz said prices have nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. 'I think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the reality,' American Egg Board President Emily Metz said. 'Our farmers are in the fight of their lives, period, full stop. And they’re doing everything they can to keep these birds safe.. .This is a supply challenge due to bird flu. Nothing else.' Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pushed back against criticism that the higher cost of eggs was solely the result of avian flu when she unveiled a nearly $1 billion plan to fight the current price spike. Instead, she attributed the current situation to 'the high cost of inputs, the unbelievable amount of regulation, the shutting down of our export markets.' Rollins' plan includes $500 million for biosecurity measures to 'lock the barns down' and initiatives to repopulate flocks after what she described as the depopulation of nearly 160 million birds under the Biden administration.

Newsom: Trans athletes competing in women's sports 'deeply unfair...	(NewsNation) — California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a defender of rights for the LGBTQ community, said his party was wrong in its support of transgender athletes participating in women's sports. 'I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,' Newsom said in an episode of his new podcast 'This is Gavin Newsom.' He was speaking with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who asked Newsom if he would say 'no' to men participating in women's sports. Kirk asked if Newsom would speak out against a young man who is going to win the girls' state championship in the long jump. 'I can see you are wrestling with it,' Kirk said to Newsom. NCAA transgender policy doesn’t go far enough, some athletes say 'I am not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you,' Newsom said. 'I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,' Newsom said. 'And I saw that — the last couple years, boy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize that issue at another level.' Kirk challenged Newsom over his use of the word 'weaponize.' Newsom then used the word 'highlight.' Newsom said he completely agrees 'on the issue of fairness. That is easy to call out. The fairness of it.' 'We are getting crushed on it, crushed,' Newsom said. Newsom pointed out in the podcast that he has been a front-runner for LGBTQ rights for years and has been a major supporter of marriage for same-sex couples.

Trump delays tariffs on most goods from Mexico for a month	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he has postponed 25% tariffs on most goods from Mexico for a month after a conversation with that country's president. Trump's announcement comes after his Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said tariffs on both Canada and Mexico would 'likely' be delayed. This is the second one-month postponement Trump has announced since first unveiling the import taxes in early February. The reprieve would apply to goods that are compliant with the trade agreement Trump negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term. 'We are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl,' Trump said on Truth Social. Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs threats have roiled financial markets, lowered consumer confidence, and enveloped many businesses in an uncertain atmosphere that could delay hiring and investment. Lutnick emphasized that reciprocal tariffs, in which the United States applies import taxes on countries that tariff U.S. exports, will still be implemented April 2. U.S. markets bounced of their lows for the day shortly after Lutnick spoke. Also Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated that he expects his country will be in a trade war with the United States for the foreseeable future. Trudeau said the broader month-long pause 'aligns with some of the conversations that we have been having with administration officials.' The Canadian leader said the move by the Trump administration was a 'promising sign,' but it also 'means that the tariffs remain in place and therefore our response will remain in place.' _____ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-commerce-secretary-lutnick-says-most-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-likely-to-be-delayed-a-month/	2025-03-06T08:56:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c9d05bba68f3.17268999.jpeg?w=900
House votes to censure Al Green for disrupting Trump speech	The House voted Thursday to censure Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) for his protest during President Trump’s address to Congress this week — a disruptive display that prompted his removal from the House chamber. The House adopted the measure in a largely party-line 224-198-2 vote, making Green the 28th member of the House to receive the congressional rebuke. The censure resolution dubbed Green’s display 'a breach of proper conduct.' Ten Democrats voted with Republicans in favor of the censure. Green voted 'present.' The censure vote made for a stunning scene on the House floor. When Green presented himself in the well of the House for a reading of the censure resolution — as is customary for such a rebuke — the Texas congressman, surrounded by other Democrats, began singing 'We Shall Overcome.' Republicans called for order in the chamber. After the official censure, Republican and Democratic lawmakers began shouting at one another — a symbol of the partisan politics on Capitol Hill. 'You’re next,' one Democrat exclaimed. At one point, Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) told Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), 'Al was wrong,' prompting her to respond, 'Your members do the same thing.' The punishment came less than 48 hours after Green, during Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday — the first of his second term — stood up, waved his cane in the air and yelled back at the president, interrupting his speech within the first few minutes. The protest began when Trump claimed he had a 'mandate' from the American people following November’s elections, leading Green to exclaim that the president does not have a mandate at all. At one point, the longtime Texas Democrat said Trump did not have such authority to cut Medicaid, as some Republicans eye slashes to the social safety net program. After a warning from Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and a directive to 'take your seat,' Green continued his vocal protest, prompting the Speaker to direct the sergeant-at-arms to remove him from the chamber. Republicans sang 'hey, hey, hey, goodbye,' as Green walked off the House floor. 'We take no pleasure in this,' Johnson told reporters shortly before the vote Thursday. 'I gave repeated warnings to Rep. Green to stand down and to sit down and he refused to do it, he chose to deliberately violate House rules in a manner that we think is probably unprecedented in history, interrupting the message of a president of the United States, who is an honored guest.' 'I think this expeditious vote of censure is an appropriate remedy,' he added. 'Many of our colleagues have argued it should go even further. But I hope that he will acknowledge his mistake.' A House censure is a formal reprimand taken by a vote of the House. It is considered a mark on the record of a lawmaker but does not typically carry consequences beyond having the member stand in the well of the House as the resolution detailing their transgressions is read aloud. Green has remained defiant in the wake of the protest, and in anticipation of the punishment. Minutes after his removal, he told reporters, 'It’s worth it.' And Thursday, shortly before the censure vote, Green’s official account on the social platform X said he was being penalized for standing up to Trump. 'During the 10:00 hour ET, Congressman Al Green will be censured this morning for standing up to President Trump,' the social media post read. The behavior, however, was in direct conflict with the conduct House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) urged his lawmakers to uphold. In a letter to House Democrats on Monday, the leader urged 'a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber,' signaling that decorum should be maintained. Jeffries stopped short of criticizing Green on Wednesday, defending the conduct of the 'majority' of his members. Still, however, plenty of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle found fault with Green’s display. 'Absolutely shameful,' Johnson said of Green’s display shortly after Tuesday night’s speech. 'He should be censured. It’s a spectacle that was not necessary. He’s made history in a terrible way… If they want to make a 77-year-old heckling congressman the face of their resistance, if that’s the Democrat Party, so be it.' Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), a centrist Democrat, called Green’s conduct 'boneheaded.' 'I think it was wrong,' Suozzi told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on 'The Source' on Wednesday night. 'I’m an old-school, traditional type person. I don’t like it when Republicans interrupt Democratic presidents, and I don’t like it when Democrats interrupt Republican presidents. So I just think it was a boneheaded move.'

Watch Athena lander attempt lunar landing	(NewsNation) — A lunar lander designed by Intuitive Machine is landing Thursday on the moon, where it will attempt to establish the first cellular network on the moon. There may not yet be any humans on the moon to pick up the signal, but the IM-2 Athena lander, which launched in February on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, is carrying Nokia's Lunar Surface Communication System. The mission also includes the Micro-Nova Hopper, which will explore shadowed lunar craters and test sensors that could help identify resources like water ice. Starliner astronauts avoid engaging in politics about their return The mission is part of NASA's partnership with the private industry to increase the capacity for space exploration by working with industry-driven space missions. The landing comes shortly after Blue Ghost's successful landing on the moon. NASA and the private industry's focus on the moon is part of an effort to put humans back on the lunar surface for the first time in decades and work toward establishing a long-term human presence on the moon. The ability for humans to live on the moon for extended periods is critical for launching crewed explorations deeper into our solar system, including the goal of putting humans on Mars.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/athena-moon-landing/	2025-03-06T07:35:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/moon.jpg?w=800
Mother of Abbey Gate victim says Biden ‘robbed’ family of justice	(NewsNation) — The mother of a soldier killed in the 2021 bombing at Kabul airport‘s Abbey Gate during the United States' chaotic exit from Afghanistan is 'so pleased' that a suspect in the attack has been extradited. 'If we can take one terrorist off the list of harming Americans, especially our soldiers, then that is a good day,' Paula Knauss Selph told 'Morning in America.' The Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing killed 13 American service members and at least 170 Afghan civilians. Selph's son, 23-year-old Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss, was among the victims. President Donald Trump announced the arrest of accused ISIS-Khorasan member Mohammad Sharifullah on Tuesday during a joint address to Congress. Trump expected to sign order calling for Education Department’s end White House counterterrorism chief Sebastian Gorka told NewsNation on Wednesday that Sharifullah confessed to involvement in the attack. 'When he saw my team, he knew that the freedom he had enjoyed for far too long was over, and he will die in prison,' Gorka said on NewsNation’s 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' It's a development Selph and other victims' family members have been sorely waiting for. 'As long as we're bringing justice for our men and women who wear the uniform, then we are truly doing our job as Americans,' she said. 'And I want to give kudos to the president for keeping his word to many Americans right now.' She said that while her son's life was cut short, he truly believed in his military mission: 'If he had to choose it again, I'm certain Ryan would say, 'Send me.'' Army Staff Sgt.

'Biden robbed us a little bit there, didn't he?' she said. 'His conclusion was that a photo-op was a better decision on that day with me than it was to answer questions that I really had, ' Selph recounted. A report from Republican representatives on the House Foreign Affairs Committee was released in September 2024, accusing the Biden administration of failing to see warning signs about how quickly Kabul would fall to the Taliban, as well as delaying an evacuation, NewsNation’s partner The Hill reported. Biden-era White House officials said the report cherry-picked details and didn’t place enough blame on President Donald Trump, who began the withdrawal process by signing a deal with Afghanistan’s militant Islamist Taliban in 2020. 'President (Joe) Biden faced a choice. It was between ending the war or escalating it,' then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in December 2024.

Trump expected to sign order calling for Education Department's e...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Thursday asking new Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dissolving the department, White House officials confirmed to NewsNation. Trump's order directs McMahon to 'take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure,' a draft of the order obtained by the Wall Street Journal revealed. According to the Journal's reporting, McMahon would be instructed to do whatever it takes to shutter the agency based on 'the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.' Is Social Security money going to ‘millions’ listed as old as 149? The long-promised closure of the department could have major implications on what kids learn, how schools are funded and the future of student loans for millions. Trump has previously accused the department of 'indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual and political material.' He campaigned on the idea of giving educational power to the states. White House officials said Trump will put pen to paper Thursday afternoon in the latest of more than 80 executive orders signed since his inauguration in January. Can an executive order close Department of Education? Legally, Trump does not have the power to completely eliminate the department, which the draft reportedly recognizes. Any major changes to the department would require congressional approval, but the executive order would be the president's first step in dismantling the department. Linda McMahon gives Education staffers their ‘final mission’ During her Senate confirmation hearing, McMahon told members of Congress they would be expected to go along with the president's plans. She then sent a 'final mission' message to agency staffers, promising to handle one of Trump's 'most momentous campaign promises to families' and 'send education back to the states.' What does the Department of Education do? Founded in 1979, the Department of Education primarily oversees funding for K-12 public schools and disperses student aid for college students. Funding for elementary schools and secondary schools supports economically disadvantaged school systems, USA Facts reports. The department administers two programs to support low-income students who attend college: Pell Grants and the federal student loan program. Federal Student Aid, an office of the Department of Education, is the nation's largest provider of student financial aid. The office reportedly makes postsecondary education possible for more than 9.7 million students each year. Elon Musk is hiring for DOGE. Here’s the type of people he wants to recruit In the past month, the agency has undergone major changes, with dozens of employees fired or placed on administrative leave. On Monday, the department offered some employees $25,000 to quit their jobs with an explicit threat of further layoffs. It is not clear how many staffers took the offer.

Is Social Security money going to 'millions' listed as old as 149...	(NEXSTAR) — In an apparent example of government waste, President Donald Trump drew laughs during his congressional address Tuesday when he alleged that the Social Security Administration had millions of beneficiaries well over 100 years of age. 'Three-point-five million people from age 140 to 149,' Trump said, claiming that 'money is being paid to many of them.' Perhaps even more shocking was Trump's assertion that 'one person is listed at 360 years of age,' but is it true that actual taxpayer dollars are being wasted on impossibly old recipients? As it turns out, the databases may list those people, but that does not mean they are getting paid benefits. 'The data reported in the media represent people who do not have a date of death associated with their record,' the SSA wrote. 'While these people may not be receiving benefits, it is important for the agency to maintain accurate and complete records.' Democrats disrupt, protest and wear pained expressions for Trump’s speech Part of the confusion comes from Social Security’s software system based on the COBOL programming language, which doesn’t use a specific format for dates. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization Wired first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration. Additionally, a series of reports from the SSA’s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these people were receiving benefits. The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million. As of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old. The SSA says it also crosschecks data with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to see if recipients younger than 115 and those with incomplete death reports have not used Medicare Part A or B for three or more years. SSA says it prioritizes those who are 90 or older, currently in pay status and live in the United States to verify if they are still eligible for Social Security benefits. The agency says it will reach out to those individuals to verify if they are still alive, and, if they are not, it stops payments and 'reports any suspicions of fraud to SSA’s Office of the Inspector General.'

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins: Here's how egg prices will ...	(NewsNation) — Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins unveiled a nearly $1 billion plan to address soaring egg prices caused by an ongoing bird flu outbreak while defending the Trump administration's tariff policies. 'We had a pretty massive five-point plan,' Rollins said Wednesday on NewsNation's 'CUOMO,' explaining the administration's strategy after just one week in office. PETA asks Trump to use potatoes for Easter Egg Roll as egg prices rise The plan includes $500 million for biosecurity measures to 'lock the barns down' and initiatives to repopulate flocks after what she described as the depopulation of nearly 160 million birds under the Biden administration. Egg prices rising Egg prices have nearly doubled in the last six weeks, with the average cost of a dozen cracking $8 last week, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture. The average egg price is now at $8.03 per dozen, up from a previous price of $7.74 per dozen reported in the USDA’s Egg Markets Overview on Feb. 14. Can you freeze eggs? Rollins outlined additional measures, including regulatory relief for chicken farmers, an agreement to import approximately 70 million eggs from Turkey and funding for vaccine and therapeutic research. She said vaccines were not being rushed into use without proper research. Is bird flu to blame for higher egg prices? The agriculture secretary pushed back against criticism that the current egg price spike was solely the result of avian flu, presenting a chart showing price fluctuations over 40 years. She attributed the current situation to 'the high cost of inputs, the unbelievable amount of regulation, the shutting down of our export markets.' 'The president is with our ag community,' Rollins said. 'While the next short term may be slightly unpredictable… for the long term, what the president has said is that our ag community will be more prosperous than perhaps it's been in our entire lifetime.' The industry, and most experts, squarely blame bird flu for the soaring egg prices. More than 166 million birds have been slaughtered to contain the virus. Some 30 million egg layers have been wiped out just since January, significantly disrupting egg supplies.

Kabul airport bombing suspect 'will die in prison': Sebastian Gor...	(NewsNation) — Counterterrorism Chief Sebastian Gorka told NewsNation that the suspect in the Kabul airport bombing confessed to the attack, which killed 13 American service members during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. The suspected senior planner, identified as Mohammad Sharifullah, has been taken into custody, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday. Officials accuse him of being a member of the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate, known as ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K, and say he admitted his role in that attack and others during an interview with FBI agents Sunday after being taken into custody. Use of military aircraft for deportations has stopped, source says 'When he saw my team, he knew that the freedom he had enjoyed for far too long was over, and he will die in prison,' Gorka said during a Wednesday appearance on NewsNation's 'Elizabeth Vargas Reports.' On Wednesday, senior Pakistani intelligence officers confirmed the arrest and said Sharifullah, also known as Jafar, was captured in the country’s restive southwest Balochistan province near the border with Afghanistan after multiple operations had failed to seize him. The officers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Sharifullah had joined the militant group in 2016 and was involved in numerous attacks across Afghanistan. Sharifullah is charged in federal court in Virginia with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, resulting in death. He will face a judge and be assigned a lawyer to speak on his behalf. Additional charges are possible as the case moves through the court system.

‘We don’t apologize’ for being a sanctuary city: Santa Cruz mayor	(NewsNation) — Santa Cruz Mayor Fred Keeley defended his city's sanctuary status, saying the national government 'cannot federalize local police' while clarifying his administration will not obstruct immigration enforcement operations. His comments come after mayors from sanctuary cities across the U.S. testified on Capitol Hill and defended their cities’ status in a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing Wednesday. 'We believe there's a distinction between the federal government and local government with regard to policing,' Keeley said Wednesday on 'The Hill on NewsNation.' Mayors defend sanctuary cities during combative hearing Boston’s Michelle Wu, Chicago’s Brandon Johnson, Denver’s Mike Johnston and New York City’s Eric Adams faced questions from Republicans, including committee chairman James Comer, who has vowed to hold the mayors accountable for their policies. 'We are a sanctuary city. We don’t apologize for that,' Keeley said. The Democratic mayor explained that Santa Cruz, which has maintained sanctuary city status since the mid-1980s and unanimously reaffirmed that designation last month, follows its own law enforcement priorities that may differ from federal immigration goals. 'They establish their priorities in law enforcement. We establish our priorities,' Keeley said. 'Where those align, that's just fine. Where they don't align, we are going to pursue our high priorities.' Who are the sanctuary city mayors rebuking Trump immigration orders? Keeley said that his stance isn't about obstructing federal authorities but about focusing local resources on community priorities like 'home invasions, petty crime, criminal activity involving fentanyl.' When pressed about potential contradictions in accepting federal help for certain investigations while limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Keeley pointed to a previous MS-13 gang operation where local authorities worked with federal agents because of 'shared values.' 'We had an MS-13 situation a few years ago. There was a joint federal, state, local task force for getting MS-13 out of here. No problem whatsoever,' Keeley said. The mayor also claimed that in the seven years his police chief has served, 'not one time has ICE called him and said, 'We're coming to your city. We need your help.'' Trump: ‘A new president’ has solved the border crisis What is a sanctuary city? While there’s no set definition of a 'sanctuary city,' the term generally refers to cities that limit cooperation with ICE. President Donald Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, says a rise in modern transnational criminal gangs has created an unprecedented risk, one he’s vowed to 'eradicate.' 'This is the biggest national security issue this country has seen, and we’re going to address it,' Homan said in reference to Tren de Aragua and MS-13. Supporters of sanctuary cities say they want to be welcoming landing spots for immigrants. 'That’s just who we are. We’re a city, again, that was established by a black Haitian immigrant. That is the punch. We’re responding to individuals who don’t share our values,' Chicago’s Johnson said. They also warn that victims and witnesses of crimes who are in the country illegally may be less likely to come forward if local law enforcement is cooperating with ICE.

Who are the sanctuary city mayors rebuking Trump immigration orde...	(NewsNation) — Four sanctuary city mayors were questioned by Republican lawmakers Wednesday who claimed they were guilty of harboring migrant criminals, violating federal law and possibly obstructing justice. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, New York Mayor Eric Adams, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston faced what Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Summer Lee referred to as a 'shakedown' by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The cities were common destinations for buses of migrants sent from Texas by GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, which Republican committee members said was due largely to their welcoming city policies. Men charged in deaths of 3 Chiefs fans found dead in backyard After Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, predicted in an interview with NewsNation before the nearly six-hour hearing that mayors would reverse course on their cities' sanctuary status, each of the leaders said they were committed to policies when asked by committee members if they would push for welcoming laws to be abandoned and if they would continue to shield criminal migrants from federal law enforcement. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu rejects claims of harboring criminals Boston has become the latest target of border czar Tom Homan, who warned he was coming to Boston 'and bringing hell with him.' Wu has lashed out against Homan, whom she accused Wednesday of 'lying about my city.' 'I am here to make sure that the city of Boston is safe,' Wu said. 'Others may want to bring hell. We are here to bring peace to cities everywhere.' Boston Mayor Michelle Wu speaks during a Democratic election night party in 2022, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File) The mayor disputed claims Boston is guilty of harboring migrants who have committed crimes and that the Boston Trust Act, the city ordinance that prevents local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts, is shielding criminals. Wu said that the Trump administration’s approach to locating criminal migrants is undermining public trust. She said Boston Police work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a criminal warrant has been issued for a migrant. She said when ICE issues a warrant that deems a migrant 'dangerous enough,' the city cooperates with federal agents. Mayors defend sanctuary cities during combative hearing About 54,000 migrants were sent to Boston and Massachusetts, which have spent nearly $1 billion on migrant services since 2022, according to data. Wu said the rhetoric around her city has caused people to live in fear. 'This federal administration is making hard-working, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives,' Wu said. 'A city that is scared is not a city that is safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free.' Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson defends ‘Welcoming City’ status More than 51,000 migrants have been sent to Chicago since 2022, and according to data, the city has spent more than $400 million on migrant care and services. Like the three other mayors who testified before the committee, Johnson fought back against charges that the city has harbored criminals because of its sanctuary status. As he has in the past, Johnson put the influx of migrants arriving in Chicago at Abbott’s feet.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File) The Chicago mayor repeatedly drew the ire of committee members, who accused the mayor of not directly answering questions that were meant to be answered with a 'yes' or 'no,' instead relying on prepared responses that prompted Republican committee members to chide the mayor. The attacks came from Illinois Republican committee members, including Illinois Congressman Darin LaHood, who noted Johnson’s poor approval rating and Chicago’s financial woes and the city’s murder and violent crime rates, both of which the mayor insists have dropped since he took office in 2023. U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., chided him for not having a specific dollar amount the city has spent on migrant services after Johnson said it represented 1% of the city’s budget. 'You don’t know the actual number?' Donalds said. 'No wonder you’re a bad mayor.' Billions in federal funding at stake for sanctuary cities Johnson defended the city’s 'Welcoming City' status, which has been in place since 1984, saying it promotes trust between residents and local police. He said that it also allows immigrants in the country illegally to provide information to police about unsolved crimes. He also said that the Trump administration’s mission to deport millions of migrants is affecting Chicago and its neighborhoods. 'Any actions that amplify fears of deportation make Chicago more dangerous,' Johnson said. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston won’t repeal sanctuary status Like his mayoral counterparts, Johnston answered repeated questions about Denver’s role in providing sanctuary to immigrants who entered the country illegally. That included a challenge from Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert, who asked whether Johnston would support her push to have Colorado’s sanctuary state status repealed. 'I do not believe the detainer law needs to be repealed,' he said. Johnston, in defending Denver Police, told committee members the city has honored 1,126 ICE detainer requests. The mayor said that when ICE issues an order for a migrant who is in custody to be detained, the city notifies the agency of when the migrant is set to be released. However, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pressed him on the release of Abraham Gonzalez, a suspected Venezuelan gang member who he said was in police custody for 354 days after being charged with aggravated assault, auto theft and felony menacing. Tariff trade war could raise medical costs — but not quite yet Jordan criticized Johnston for only providing ICE with an hour’s lead time before Gonzalez was set to be released. He said that during the transfer of custody, Gonzalez assaulted one of the ICE agents. Johnston responded that his office is reviewing that case while arguing that crime has gone down in his city. Since 2022, Denver has received 42,000 migrants and spent $356 million on migrant services, according to city data. New York Mayor Eric Adams accused of ‘selling out’ on immigration to avoid prosecution Despite seeing about 230,000 migrants come to New York at a cost to the city of about $6.9 billion, Adams did not face as much scrutiny from the committee as his counterparts during Wednesday’s hearing. Adams acknowledged that he had met with Homan and President Donald Trump and had discussed immigration. However, when pressed on whether his meeting with Trump at Mar-A-Lago involved conversations about the Department of Justice’s case against the New York mayor, Adams said he did not recall. Adams previously said that New York City would work with ICE at Riker’s Island, an admission that brought claims by some that the mayor had swung a deal to have federal corruption charges against him dropped. During one exchange, Adams declined to provide specific answers and only said that he had spoken about immigration in general with Trump and Homan. Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., accused Adams of 'selling out' to save himself from prosecution. 'There’s no deal,' Adams said. 'No quid pro quo. I did nothing wrong.' Adams said that more than 330 NYPD officers are assigned to work with federal joint task forces, and 70 were assigned to work with Homeland Security Investigations, the criminal arm of ICE. Adams said that New York’s sanctuary city status does not mean that New York 'will ever be a haven for violent criminals.' However, he said that immigrants, including those who entered the country illegally, pay 'billions' in taxes and contribute billions more in spending power to the city’s economy. Asked by Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene whether he would continue following sanctuary laws in New York, Adams replied, 'That policy is by law. I do not make the law. I must operate within the confines of the Constitution and the law.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/sanctuary-city-mayors-trump-immigration/	2025-03-05T16:09:13-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2202856194.jpg?w=900
Republicans need to cut Medicaid to hit budget savings target, CB...	Republicans can’t achieve their goal of slashing $2 trillion in federal spending over the next decade without cutting Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In a report released Wednesday, CBO found that the government spends $381 billion on programs other than Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that are under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. That’s a problem for House Republicans, who are looking to slash $880 billion from programs in the committee’s jurisdiction to help pay for an extension of President Trump’s tax cuts and border enforcement funding. One of the prime targets is Medicaid, the joint federal and state-funded program that provides health coverage to more than 72 million low-income Americans. Republicans see Medicaid as a program rife with fraud and abuse and have long sought to rein in its spending. CBO said that of the $381 billion, more than half is already paid for. So even if Republicans eliminate every program under Energy and Commerce other than Medicaid and CHIP, it would only be able to save a maximum of $135 billion. Republicans in the House advanced a budget resolution nearly on party lines last week calling for at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, kicking off the reconciliation process that will allow the Senate to bypass the filibuster and pass a bill with only 51 votes. Under the resolution, the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, has been tasked with identifying at least $880 billion in cuts. Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and other Republican leaders argue they are not targeting Medicaid. They say the savings will come largely from weeding out waste, fraud and abuse while also expanding work requirements for some adults receiving benefits Johnson last week in a CNN interview said that some of the steepest potential cuts, like a change that would cap federal payments based on population rather than the current open-ended entitlement, are off the table. But he left the door open to reducing the enhanced federal match for Medicaid expansion states and enthusiastically endorsed work requirements. 'This analysis from the nonpartisan CBO confirms what we’ve been saying all along: Republicans are lying about their budget,' said Rep. Brendan Boyle (Pa.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, who requested the report. 'Their plan would force the largest Medicaid cuts in American history — all to pay for more tax giveaways to billionaires. The American people deserve to know just how much pain Republicans are willing to inflict on their own constituents to reward their billionaire donors.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republicans-need-to-cut-medicaid-to-hit-budget-savings-target-cbo-finds/	2025-03-05T15:52:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Leading-Johnson_030325_AP_Julia-Demaree-Nikhinson.jpg?w=900
Is Elon Musk getting paid for DOGE? And what is his title?	(NewsNation) — During Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening, the president again contradicted his administration’s claims of who is running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In his speech, Trump again said the department is 'headed' by billionaire Elon Musk. Does Elon Musk run DOGE? The White House has offered contradictory statements on who is running the agency tasked with eliminating so-called wasteful spending in the U.S. federal government. Gas prices expected to rise as tariffs take effect The 'acting administrator' of DOGE is a low-profile executive who has expertise in health care technology and worked in the first Trump administration. The White House in late February identified Amy Gleason as the acting leader of DOGE, which has been pushing agencies to fire employees, cancel contracts and make other budget cuts. Potential conflicts of interest Although DOGE’s cuts have been championed by Musk and his associates, the White House has insisted Musk is overseeing the effort as a senior adviser to the president, not a DOGE employee. Musk, the world's richest person, does not draw a government salary and operates as a 'special government employee,' the White House has said. It has been vague on Musk's exact role in DOGE. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are introducing a pair of resolutions demanding the Trump administration turn over documents and information about Musk’s potential conflicts of interest and the firings of federal workers, according to The Associated Press. Tariff trade war could raise medical costs — but not quite yet The resolution from Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia would launch an investigation into Musk himself over potential conflicts of interest. Musk’s companies receive hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla had already received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies. Salaries at DOGE While Musk works to gut federal agencies, DOGE staffers are reportedly making six-figure salaries. Business and technology magazine Wired reports that Jeremy Lewin, who was instrumental in dismantling USAID, makes over $167,000 per year. Kyle Schutt, a software engineer working within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, takes home $195,200, according to the report. Wired reported several other DOGE staffers also receive six-figure government-funded salaries.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/is-elon-musk-getting-paid-for-doge/	2025-03-05T15:23:19-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2200924488.jpg?w=900
More Americans tapping 401(k)s to pay for financial emergencies	(NewsNation) — More Americans are raiding their retirement savings to cover emergency expenses, taking early withdrawals from their 401(k)s. A record 4.8% of account holders took hardship withdrawals last year, up from 3.6% in 2023, according to Vanguard Group, which examined data from nearly 5 million people with 401(k)-type accounts. Hardship withdrawals let savers tap their retirement funds early for an 'immediate and heavy financial need' but are widely seen as a last resort. The most common reasons for taking them are preventing foreclosure or eviction and covering medical bills. What is a 401(k) plan? Before the pandemic, about 2% of account holders took hardship withdrawals annually — less than half the latest share, according to Vanguard data. The recent uptick could signal growing financial distress, but two other factors may also be driving the increase. First, more employers are automatically enrolling workers in retirement plans, meaning the pool of those with otherwise little savings has likely grown larger. Last year, 61% of 401(k)-type plans through Vanguard automatically enrolled new hires, up from 36% in 2014. Second, Congress has made it easier to request hardship withdrawals in recent years. Federal legislation in 2018 relaxed restrictions and ended a requirement that workers must take out a loan before taking a hardship withdrawal. What happens to my 401(k) if I quit my job? 'Given that it’s now easier to request a hardship withdrawal and that automatic enrollment is helpingmore workers save for retirement, especially lower-income workers, a modest increase isn’t surprising,' Vanguard noted in the report. Generally, workers have to wait until they are 59 1/2 (or 55 in certain cases) to take 401(k) distributions penalty-free. So, those who take a hardship withdrawal before 59 1/2 have to pay a 10% early distribution tax unless an exception applies. Hardship withdrawals are also subject to income tax for those with a traditional 401(k). The other downside of a hardship withdrawal is that you can't repay the money into your 401(k) plan or move it into an individual retirement account (IRA), so the distributions permanently reduce your retirement savings. What is the rule of 55 and should you use it? For those reasons, hardship withdrawals are typically considered a last resort option, intended for those in dire situations. Vanguard's latest data is another potential warning sign that Americans are financially strained. Last year, credit card delinquencies in the U.S. reached their highest level in over a decade. More people are also falling behind on their car payments. Consumer confidence recently took a nosedive as Americans grew more worried about inflation and the possible consequences of President Donald Trump's trade war. But Vanguard's report also had good news. Average account balances were up 10% in 2024 from the year prior, reaching an all-time high of $148,200. That was due to a strong stock market and increased contribution rates. The share of plan participants who increased their savings rate in 2024 reached 45%, the highest percentage since Vanguard started tracking the metric in 2019. Vanguard concluded that the sub-5% hardship withdrawal rate suggested that participants remain 'generally resilient' and are maintaining a 'long-term approach to retirement saving.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/americans-tapping-401ks-emergencies/	2025-03-05T14:34:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-1149306445-e1741214861514.jpg?w=900
Authorities to update on 2024 deaths of 3 Kansas City Chiefs fans	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (NewsNation) — Authorities were expected to provide an update Wednesday on the investigation into the deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans who were found dead in the backyard of their friend’s home in 2024. Ricky Johnson, 38; Clayton McGeeney, 36; and David Harrington, 37, were all found dead in their friend’s Kansas City backyard on January 9, 2024. After their deaths, NewsNation local affiliate WDAF reported toxicology results revealed the men died from fentanyl-laced cocaine. Gas prices expected to rise as tariffs take effect That, however, was never confirmed by investigators. Weather records indicate the low temperature that night was around 33 degrees. One factor fueling speculation about their deaths has been that the homeowner says he didn’t know the bodies of his three longtime friends were on his back porch and in his backyard for the two days before they were found. Officer Alayna Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City Police Department, previously said that the homeowner was cooperating with the investigation.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/midwest/update-2024-deaths-chiefs-fans/	2025-03-05T12:07:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/01/65b5cf233245e3.73946802.jpeg?w=900
Gas prices expected to rise as tariffs take effect	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian imports, and that means Americans could see higher gas prices. Analysts say that states in the Northeast could be affected first and see a 20 to 40 cent increase per gallon on the price of gas. Trump said open trade has cost Americans factory jobs and that the tariffs will be a 'path to prosperity' for the country in the long run. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said with the closure of a refinery in 2019, Northeastern states rely on Canada for oil and could feel the effects of higher gas prices by mid-March. How many people over 100 receive Social Security benefits? Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas, exporting half of its supply to the U.S. in 2024. Sixty percent of U.S. crude oil imports also came from the country. The Midwest, Great Lakes and the Rockies could see anywhere between a five- to 25-cent increase per gallon in two to three weeks if tariffs stay in effect. 'If the tariffs disappear quickly, the impact may as well,' De Haan said. De Haan said gas prices are already low compared to last year because of concern over the economy regarding the impact of tariffs and that oil prices have fallen recently because of the economic duress the tariffs could bring. 'If the economy slows down, we'll see lower gas prices because Americans will buy less, spend less and travel less,' De Haan said. 'If we see a stronger economy, we see higher gas prices because of more demand.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gas-prices-rise-tariffs/	2025-03-05T10:46:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/4ff49a7cfbe04e87aa0bebb1de967c53-1-1-1-e1734435033999.jpg?w=900
Republican introduces censure resolution against Al Green	The House will vote this week on a resolution from Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) to censure Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) for his outburst at President Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Newhouse introduced the resolution and moved to force a vote on it Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Green’s disruptive protest. Because the resolution is privileged, leadership has two legislative days to move on the formal reprimand, and the House is scheduled to leave town after Thursday. The resolution reads: 'Whereas, the conduct of the Representative from Texas disrupted the proceedings of the joint address and was a breach of proper conduct; and whereas, after numerous disruptions the representative from Texas had to be removed from the chamber by the Sergeant-at-arms; Now, therefore, be it resolved that Representative Al Green be censured.' The Washington congressman’s effort has the backing of House GOP leadership, apparently winning out over two alternative measures to censure Green that were being crafted by Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) and the House Freedom Caucus, and Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas). 'I believe this is the first one outta the gate,' Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told a NOTUS reporter of Newhouse’s resolution. Newhouse acknowledged there were many people interested in leading such a resolution, but told reporters he was the first to approach the Speaker about it. And Newhouse dismissed the notion that the move was aimed at improving his relationship with Trump and his allies, given he is one of two House Republicans remaining in Congress who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. 'I don't see how that would work at all,' Newhouse said. 'This is about the House of Representatives, Congress and respecting the rules of decorum that we have.' A House censure is a formal reprimand taken by a vote of the House but does not typically carry consequences beyond having the member stand in the well of the House as the resolution detailing their transgressions is read aloud. Censure has become more common in recent years, with House Republicans in the last Congress censuring Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and then-Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.). The House issued a reprimand, a less severe rebuke than a censure, to Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) for an outburst at former President Obama’s 2009 address to Congress when he yelled, 'You lie!' Wilson’s outburst now looks tame compared to the protests that have escalated at presidential addresses. Green’s protest — and ultimate removal — played out within the first few minutes of Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, the first of his second term. When Trump was discussing the 'mandate' he received from voters in November, Green stood up and yelled back at the president, arguing he did not have a mandate to cut Medicaid. The social safety net program has emerged as a key issue this Congress, with Republicans eyeing cuts to it through their sprawling border, energy and tax cuts package. When Green started yelling at Trump, chants of 'U.S.A.' rang out on the Republican side of the chamber. Johnson, sitting on the dais next to Vice President Vance, gave Green a warning, telling him to 'take your seat.' Green, however, continued his protest, and shortly after, Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove him from the chamber. Republicans sang 'hey, hey, hey, goodbye,' as the Texas Democrat made his way off the House floor. Green later told reporters he was 'making it clear to the president that he has no mandate to cut Medicaid.' 'I have people who are very fearful. These are poor people, and they all need Medicaid in their lives when it comes to their health care,' he added. It remains unclear if any Democrats will join the GOP’s censure effort. At least one Senate Democrat criticized his behavior Tuesday night. 'I think it’s counterproductive,' Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told The Hill. 'I think to stand up and say, you know, he doesn’t have a mandate to cut Medicare, fine, but I think he — I think it went beyond decorum.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/republican-introduces-censure-resolution-against-al-green/	2025-03-05T10:45:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25064091246010-e1741142760519.jpg?w=900
40-day Target boycott begins following company's DEI diversion	(NewsNation) — Target, a private company not required to follow President Donald Trump's orders to dismiss diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, did just that in January. The Minnesota-based chain announced on Jan. 24 it was ending its hiring, supplier recruitment and promotion goals for women, members of racial minority groups, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities. Target had previously been hailed as an inclusive company, in part because of its six-figure donations to groups championing Black economic empowerment and LGBTQ+ acceptance. Dozens of Education Department staffers on leave amid Trump’s DEI purge Though it's not the only Fortune 500 company backtracking on DEI, it's facing major customer blowback and a new boycott. Target boycott: Pastor suggests dropping retailer for Lent One Atlanta-area megachurch pastor, the Rev. Jamal Bryant, asked dispirited Target shoppers to 'fast' from the retailer for the 40 days of Lent. Bryant asked participants to abstain from shopping at Target, in-person or online, and to sell personal stocks and shareholdings with Target Corporation. 'This is a fast for accountability. A fast for justice. A fast for a future where corporations do not bow to pressure at the expense of marginalized communities. As we journey through these 40 days, let us pray, reflect, and act — knowing that our collective sacrifice can bring about transformation,' the movement's website reads. Bryant and other leaders plan to meet with Target's board when the 'fast' ends on April 17 to 'assess whether we will proceed to Phase 2.' No details about a second phase have been shared yet. Target braces for Trump's tariff impact Target recorded soft sales in February and a 13% drop in stock price in the past month, a forecast likely made murkier by Trump's tariffs on top trading partners Canada and Mexico. Target said that back in 2017, 60% of its store-label products were sourced from China. The stock market is down: Are Trump’s tariffs to blame? That’s now at 30%, Target executives said. The company is on its way to reducing that number to 25% by the end of next year, the company said. Target plans to add 20 new stores this year, and it expects to add $15 billion in sales by 2030.

Border facility in Texas closing amid decline in crossings	EAGLE PASS, Texas (NewsNation) — A U.S. Customs and Border Protection migrant processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, is closing, sources told NewsNation on Wednesday. The temporary, soft-sided facility called 'Firefly,' which opened in July 2022, was originally designed to quickly process people in Border Patrol custody by providing food, shelter and processing space. The 153,300-square-foot, climate-controlled facility served the Border Patrol's Del Rio sector. It replaced a smaller structure that opened in Eagle Pass in April 2021. Similar facilities in El Paso and San Diego will remain open. Sanctuary city mayors defend policies before Congress The news comes amid Vice President JD Vance's visit to the southern border Wednesday to highlight the Trump administration’s tough immigration policies as the White House touts a sharp decline in border crossings. Illegal crossings at the border have dropped 94% compared to last year, according to Border Patrol officials, and the decline is attributed to several factors — including labeling cartel groups as terrorist organizations, boosting ICE deportations and deploying military resources for enforcement and deportation flights. Alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, Vance is expected to visit Eagle Pass, once considered a hot spot for illegal crossings. The visit comes as the White House pushes its 'whole of government' approach, coordinating efforts between the departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Justice.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/migrant-shelter-closing-texas-border/	2025-03-05T08:30:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/52214238210_bc77c0ef05_o.jpg?w=900
Border retailers brace for economic hardships from new tariffs	McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) -- Milly Chirino owns three retail shops in the downtown business district of this border town. She sells shoes, handbags, clothes and other wares and she says most of her items are imported from China and will be subject to new tariffs. Border businesses, residents begin to feel pain of Trump’s tariffs President Donald Trump on Tuesday implemented 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on goods from China. Shoes, handbags and other items are sold at Millys in downtown McAllen, Texas. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report Photos) 'It is going to affect as far as the pricing,' Chirino told Border Report on Tuesday. But she also put an optimistic spin on the tariffs, saying that consumers who buy from retailers, like her, who buy in bulk, will feel less economic effects from the tariffs, rather than those who buy directly from companies within those countries. 'Maybe they will start buying more local,' she said. Suresh Mansinghani, aka 'The Perfume King,' has operated his perfume shop here for 42 years. He says he has enough stockpiled supplies that he won't need to order from China or Mexico for a couple of months, and that means his customers won't see any price increases for a while. Downtown shops line the streets in the border town of McAllen, Texas. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report) He is one of 13 perfume shops on a single block in this downtown shopping district that is just north of the Rio Grande and the northern Mexican city of Reynosa. He says most of his competitors also stockpile their goods, as do his suppliers, and he isn't worried, at least for now. Border exporter worries Mexico will implement it own tariffs 'I don't think it's going to affect it, because it's going to take time for all the new merchandise to come in, and it usually takes between 30 to 60 days, so I don't expect any price increases at all. In fact, I'm dropping my prices just to entice customers to buy more,' Mansinghani said. Suresh Mansinghani, AKA 'The Perfume King,' has operated his McAllen, Texas, perfume shop for 42 years. He supports new tariffs on products from Mexico. (Sandra Sanchez/Border Report) He says in his decades in the perfume business, he has weathered tough times. And he doesn't see this as one to fret. 'What the local people need to know is that don't overreact. This is just a strategy that the politicians do, and we don't have any control at all. We just got to go with the flow,' he said. Several of his employees have worked for him for over 30 years. He says he had a staff meeting Tuesday morning and told them not to worry. He said business was brisk and kept coming Tuesday, despite the news. He says his retail sales so far this year are up 3% over last year 'and I had a fantastic year last year,' he said. Mansinghani says he supports the tariffs because he doesn't believe it is right that some countries place tariffs on U.S. goods, but the United States does not put tariffs on their goods.

Supreme Court denies Trump administration request to cancel $2 bi...	The Supreme Court in a 5-4 emergency ruling Wednesday refused to halt a judge’s decision ordering the Trump administration to immediately release nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments owed under existing contracts. It hands a loss to the administration in the first time that Trump’s efforts to drastically reshape federal spending, agency by agency, have reached the high court. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberals to side against the administration. Four of the court’s conservatives — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — dissented. 'Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned,' Alito wrote, joined by the three others. The Trump administration has broadly looked to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), including by firing employees and freezing its payments to contractors, sparking a wave of lawsuits. The Supreme Court’s emergency decision keeps in place a lower judge’s order enforcing his directive that the administration maintain foreign aid agreements that existed before Trump took office. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, an appointee of former President Biden, had found the Trump administration wasn’t complying with his order to resume the unpaid USAID contracts and grants. Last week, Ali demanded the funds be released by the end of the following day. 'Given that the deadline in the challenged order has now passed, and in light of the ongoing preliminary injunction proceedings, the District Court should clarify what obligations the Government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines,' the Supreme Court’s unsigned order reads. The Justice Department quickly went to the Supreme Court after Ali’s order, warning the administration couldn’t comply so rapidly and asking for an emergency intervention. 'The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,' the Justice Department wrote in court filings. 'The government is undertaking substantial efforts to review payment requests and release payments. Officials at the highest levels of government are engaged on this matter.' Chief Justice John Roberts received the request by default, just hours before last week’s midnight deadline. He issued a brief delay until the court could hear from both sides. Now that it has, the full court denied the administration’s motion, refusing to maintain the freeze on the funding. The group of USAID contractors suing warned they will soon shutter without access to the funds. They urged the justices to deny the government’s application, saying the judge acted within his 'sound discretion.' 'The government comes to this Court with an emergency of its own making,' their attorneys wrote.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/supreme-court-denies-trump-administration-request-to-cancel-2-billion-in-foreign-aid/	2025-03-05T06:37:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25064076627793-e1741140755989_ae2499.jpg?w=900
Tariff trade war could raise medical costs — but not quite yet	(NewsNation) — A majority of medical experts foresee at least a 10% increase in drug prices as a result of President Donald Trump's tariff standoff, a new Black Book Market Research survey found. A brewing trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico could increase the cost of medical supplies, intensify drug shortages and limit device makers' ability to import critical supplies. The full scope of tariff impacts will take some time to completely take shape, and Accreditation Council for Medical Affairs founder and CEO William Soliman tells NewsNation that prices and future drug availability are difficult to predict. Ontario premier: Trump tariffs ‘backfired,’ inflation to hit US 'A lot of the common drugs that Americans take — your cholesterol lowering drugs, your blood thinners, your antibiotics — a lot of these drugs, a lot of their active pharmaceutical ingredients, are made in China. They're made in Canada,' Soliman said. 'You are going to see, potentially, price issues in terms of price increases and maybe potentially shortages of those generic drugs in the U.S.,' he added. About 90% of the drugs Americans consume are generic — of that percentage, a vast majority are at least partly manufactured overseas. What is causing your spring allergies and what can you do to prevent them? That includes common drugs like antibiotic Z-Pak, anticoagulant Coumadin and cancer-fighting drugs. But Soliman said patients shouldn't panic just yet. There's likely a 12- to 18-month stockpile for many drugs, he said, so there should be no immediate issue with supply chain shortages when it comes to generic medications. Name-brand drugs, however, could see significant problems when it comes to availability in the future, Soliman said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/tariff-trade-war-medical-costs/	2025-03-05T05:40:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Mucinex-Tylenol-Cold-and-Flu-Dayquil.png?w=900
Vance to visit southern border to highlight immigration crackdown	EAGLE PASS, Texas (NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance will visit the U.S. southern border on Wednesday to highlight the administration's tough immigration policies as the White House touts a sharp decline in border crossings. Border security is a top priority for President Donald Trump, and Vance's trip marks the highest-ranking official from the administration to visit the border since he took office six weeks ago. Alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, Vance will tour a federal immigration processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, once considered a hotspot for illegal crossings. This visit comes as the White House pushes its 'whole of government' approach, coordinating efforts between the departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Justice. Trump touts decline in illegal border crossings Illegal crossings at the southern border have reportedly dropped 94% compared to last year, according to Border Patrol officials, and the decline is attributed to several factors — including labeling cartel groups as terrorist organizations, boosting ICE deportations and deploying military resources for enforcement and deportation flights. A year ago, there was an average of 4,800 migrant encounters daily, officials said; that number has now reportedly dropped to less than 300. Areas like Eagle Pass and Del Rio in South Texas that once saw thousands of illegal crossings under the Biden administration now reportedly average less than 50 encounters per day. Pentagon sending combat troops to southern border Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said February marked the 'lowest month in recorded history for (migrant) encounters at our border.' She reposted Trump’s social media post that said there were 8,326 apprehensions of undocumented immigrants by Border Patrol agents at the U.S.-Mexico border in February. 'My first full month in Office, had the LOWEST number of illegal immigrants trying to enter our Country in History – BY FAR!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. The latest Customs and Border Protection data, released in January, reports a total of 179,572 immigrant encounters by Border Patrol agents since the start of fiscal year 2025 on Oct. 1 — but that data includes more than four months of encounters under the previous administration. Trump: ‘A new president’ has solved the border crisis In January, there were 29,116 immigrant encounters on the Southwest border, CBP reported. The largest number of encounters occurred in the San Diego sector, with 6,397. The Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol reported the second-most encounters with 5,965, and the El Paso sector was third with 4,871, CBP said. The number of single adults encountered on the Southwest border so far in fiscal year 2025 has dropped 73% from the previous year, and the number of families has dropped 84%, CBP reported. Customs and Border Protection releases monthly encounter data but has not yet released February figures. Trump eyeing plan to revive Title 42 Trump is also considering reinstating Title 42, an emergency health authority that allows immigration officials to turn away migrants at the border to prevent the spread of disease. If Title 42 were renewed, officials could enact similar restrictions while citing the potential spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.

Suspect in Kabul airport bombing during Afghanistan pullout is ca...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A suspected senior planner in the suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 American service members during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan has been taken into custody and will appear Wednesday in federal court in the United States to face charges. President Donald Trump announced the arrest during his Tuesday night address to Congress, with the White House and the Justice Department subsequently identifying the suspect as Mohammad Sharifullah. Officials accuse him of being a member of the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate, known as ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K, and say he admitted his role in that attack and others during an interview with FBI agents on Sunday after being taken into custody. Senior Pakistani intelligence officers on Wednesday confirmed the arrest and said Sharifullah, also known as Jafar, was captured in the country's restive southwest Balochistan province near the border with Afghanistan after multiple operations had failed to seize him. The officers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Sharifullah had joined the militant group in 2016 and was involved in numerous attacks across Afghanistan. Sharifullah is charged in federal court in Virginia with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, resulting in death. He will face a judge on Wednesday and be assigned a lawyer to speak on his behalf. Additional charges are possible as the case moves through the court system. Trump, in his address to Congress, said he was 'pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.' The Abbey Gate bombing, in the waning days of an airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover of the country amid the withdrawal by U.S. forces from the country, occurred in August 2021 when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul’s airport. Besides 13 U.S. service members, about 170 Afghans were also killed in the attack, which triggered widespread congressional criticism and undermined public confidence in President Joe Biden’s administration. According to an FBI affidavit filed as part of the case, Sharifullah admitted under questioning to having joined ISIS-K in 2016 and to having participated in the Abbey Gate bombing by scouting a route to the airport for the bomber and communicating to other members of the militant group that the path was clear. The bomber was later identified as Abdul Rahman al-Logari, an Islamic State group militant who had been in an Afghan prison but was released by the Taliban as the group took control of the country that summer. During his FBI interrogation, Sharifullah also said he had shared firearms and weapons instructions before a March 2024 attack in Moscow that was also carried out by ISIS-K, authorities said. Sharifullah was arrested in 2019 by the U.S.-backed Afghan government at the time but escaped from prison on Aug. 15, 2021, as the Taliban took Kabul. The Pakistani officials said Sharifullah had planned the bombing from behind bars with other senior militant figures. They said he remained on the run in the border areas of Balochistan until his arrest through a joint intelligence-sharing operation between Pakistan and the U.S. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for 'acknowledging and appreciating' the country’s role in counter terrorism efforts in Afghanistan. 'We will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,' Sharif said on the social platform X. From Kabul, the Taliban chief spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid declined to comment beyond saying that the arrest 'on Pakistani soil' of an Afghan national and member of the Islamic State group shows that IS group figures 'have taken refuge and established havens' inside Pakistan. 'This issue has nothing to do with Afghanistan,' Mujahid said. The regional Islamic State affiliate is a rival group to the Afghan Taliban. Trump, a Republican, had repeatedly condemned Biden's role in the Afghanistan withdrawal on the campaign trail and blamed Biden, a Democrat, for the Abbey Gate attack. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity Tuesday night to discuss a case that had yet to be unsealed, said Sharifullah's arrest came after fresh U.S. intelligence community coordination, increased intelligence sharing and pressure on regional partners to bring those responsible for the attack to account since Trump’s swearing-in in January.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/ap-suspect-in-kabul-airport-bombing-during-afghanistan-pullout-is-caught-and-heading-to-us-trump-says/	2025-03-05T04:24:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c84306d4a1d1.76554143.jpeg?w=900
Mayors of sanctuary cities set to testify before Congress	(NewsNation) — The mayors of four major U.S. sanctuary cities are set to defend their cities' status in a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing Wednesday. Boston's Michelle Wu, Chicago's Brandon Johnson, Denver's Mike Johnston and New York City's Eric Adams will face questions from Republicans, including committee chairman James Comer, who has vowed to hold the mayors accountable for their policies. Billions in federal funding at stake for sanctuary cities In January, Comer launched an investigation into sanctuary city practices he claims put 'Americans’ lives at risk.' The hearing is slated to begin at 10 a.m. ET and is available to stream on the House's official website. What is a sanctuary city? While there's no set definition of a sanctuary city, the term generally refers to cities that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, says a rise in modern transnational criminal gangs has created an unprecedented risk — one he's vowed to 'eradicate.' 'This is the biggest national security issue this country has seen, and we're going to address it,' Homan said in reference to Tren de Aragua and MS-13. Supporters of sanctuary cities say they want to be welcoming landing spots for immigrants. 'That's just who we are. We're a city, again, that was established by a black Haitian immigrant. That is the punch. We're responding to individuals who don't share our values,' Chicago's Johnson said. They also warn that victims and witnesses of crimes who are in the country illegally may be less likely to come forward if local law enforcement is cooperating with ICE. February ‘lowest in history’ for border encounters, White House says The only one of the four mayors who seems willing to join forces with the Trump administration's effort is New York's embattled Adams, who has voiced support for rolling back policies barring city staff from working with ICE. Adams' detractors believe his leniency on the issue is an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration, which recently ordered the Department of Justice to drop the mayor's federal corruption charges. Hearing could cost sanctuary cities federal funding The four cities have struggled to manage the influx of migrants from the southern border, collectively spending billions of dollars on shelter and support services. But Wednesday's hearing could strip sanctuary cities of some federal funding. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has already sued the state of New York and the city of Chicago, alleging they have obstructed the federal government from enforcing immigration laws. Shortly after Trump took office, the Department of Justice directed federal prosecutors to investigate whether local officials should face legal action for resisting federal immigration laws. In addition to the two lawsuits, Bondi issued a memo in early February stating that sanctuary jurisdictions will not have access to federal funds from the Department of Justice. Trump talks immigration in joint address The president leaned into immigration during his address to Congress on Tuesday night, casting the decadeslong border crisis as merely a failure of Democratic leadership. 'Our friends in the Democrat party kept saying we needed new legislation, 'We must have legislation to secure the border.' But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,' Trump said. Trump added that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, 'didn't just open our borders, he flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country.' There is no evidence of Biden funding flights for migrants to enter the U.S. NewsNation's Jeff Arnold and Alicia Nieves contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/sanctuary-city-mayors-testify-congress-hearing-live/	2025-03-05T03:46:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-1.jpg?w=900
Al Green's protest at Trump speech not helping Democrats: Stirewa...	(NewsNation) — NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt said Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, trying to argue with President Donald Trump during his Congressional speech was 'not the look the Democratic Party was trying to get.' During Trump's speech, Green stood up and told Trump, 'You don’t have a mandate. ... You have no mandate to cut Medicaid.' He was immediately drowned out by people chanting 'USA' and booing. Trump: US faced ‘economic catastrophe,’ ‘inflation nightmare’ Democrats in the House of Representatives raised placards saying, '(Elon) Musk steals,' 'Save Medicaid' and 'Protect Veterans.' Stirewalt expressed confusion over their actions, saying, 'I have no idea what Democrats thought they were doing holding up those signs … If you don’t want to be there, don’t go,' he said, stating it'd be more powerful to not show up at all. 'It’s all beneath the work of a great nation,' Stirewalt added. Trump praises major government cutbacks, efficiency measures Green says getting ejected from speech was 'worth it' According to a White House pool report, Green spoke to reporters after getting escorted out of the House of Representatives chambers for protesting Trump’s speech. 'It’s worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up' to Trump, Green said. After Trump’s address, the Democratic Party gave a brief speech in response. This year’s response was delivered by Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Democrats disrupt, protest and wear pained expressions for Trump’...	House Democrats greeted President Trump’s return to Congress on Tuesday with a spirited series of disruptive protests – and a number of painful looks as they suffered through an address in which the returning president repeatedly cajoled and mocked them. All in all, it was an extraordinary display of partisan scuffling even by the standards of the polarized modern era. The clashes began just minutes into Trump’s joint address to Congress, when Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), a 77-year-old liberal from Houston, stood from his seat and heckled Trump with charges that the president’s proclaimed 'mandate' was nothing of the sort. The outburst prompted Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who was seated on the dais behind Trump, to warn Green to 'maintain decorum in the House.' When that didn’t work, he ordered Green to 'take your seat.' When that also failed, Johnson directed the House Sergeant at Arms to remove Green from the chamber. The episode seemed to pain the top Democratic leaders — Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Katherine Clark (Mass.) and Pete Aguilar (Calif.) — who have criticized Republicans for occasional outbursts during Democratic speeches, and watched with glum expressions as Green was escorted from the room. Republicans had a lighter response. They belted out a chorus of 'Hey, Hey, Hey — Goodbye.' It was the most dramatic episode of a dramatic evening, but hardly the only one. Shortly after Green’s ejection, several other Democrats stood and turned their backs on Trump to display a one-word message on the back of their shirts: 'Resist.' Then lawmakers — including Democratic Reps. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Lateefah Simon (D-Calif.) and Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) — marched out of the chamber on their own accord. Other Democrats repeatedly yelled out to protest specific remarks from Trump. One lawmaker, for instance, shouted 'Jan. 6' when Trump broached the issue of law enforcement — a reference to the 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, and the president’s recent pardon of more than 1,500 rioters. All told, the chorus of disruption made the 2009 'You lie!' outburst from Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), described with revulsion by Democrats and some Republicans at the time, seem mild by comparison. If Trump was bothered by the demonstrations, he didn’t let on. Indeed, the president delivered a gladiatorial speech that pulled no punches, offered no olive branches and doubled down on vows to advance the same assertive policies that have stirred so much controversy during his first six weeks back in power. 'America is back,' Trump boomed at the outset. 'And we are just getting started.' Trump also lobbed plenty of his own salvos across the aisle — even in his prepared remarks, where he characterized Joe Biden as the worst president in history and attacked congressional Democrats for what he considered a failure to appreciate his successes. 'I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or make them stand and smile or applause,' Trump said, looking out into the Democrats’ side of the chamber. 'These people standing right here will not clap, will not cheer.' The speech thrilled the president’s Republican supporters, who occupied one side of the House chamber. They roared their approval after each claimed victory — closing the border, eliminating foreign aid, defeating 'wokeness' — and jumped in applause at each new promise to realize the 'America First' agenda that brought him to power. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a conservative firebrand and staunch supporter of the president, stuck out from the crowd in her red hat with a proud message: 'Trump Was Right About Everything.' On the other side were Trump’s Democratic adversaries, who cast a dour shadow on the president’s triumphant return to Capitol Hill. Despite the sporadic outbursts, most sat in stoic silence through the vast majority of the address — a sea of glum faces incredulous that Trump had won a second term and horrified by the same policies the president was eulogizing from the lectern. On a milder note, a number of Democrats in the chamber held up signs throughout Trump’s speech: 'Musk Steals,' read some. 'Save Medicaid,' read others. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) held another: 'This is not normal.' And Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) carried a white board into the chamber, penning various messages to Trump throughout the address. 'No king,' she wrote at one point. There were other, more symbolic, gestures of protest, as well. Some Democratic women were decked out in white, a symbol of the suffragists who fought a century ago for women’s rights to vote. Dozens of other Democratic women were dressed in pink — a more generic symbol of protest designed to highlight Trump’s policies affecting women and families. And some members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) donned black to demonstrate against the president’s policies. Democrats are also up in arms over Trump’s recent overtures to Russia amid their ongoing invasion of Ukraine. To show solidarity with America’s democratic allies in Kyiv, a number of lawmakers wore the colors of Ukraine: blue and gold. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) was among those pro-Ukraine Democrats, who went to the chamber in a blue and gold tie. 'I give this credit to Marcy Kaptur. She bought 100 ties, and she told me to wear it,' Lynch quipped. 'So I’m doing what I’m told.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/democrats-disrupt-protest-and-wear-pained-expressions-for-trumps-speech/	2025-03-04T21:01:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/house_dems_030425gn01_w.jpg?w=900
Trump praises major government cutbacks, efficiency measures	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump claimed sweeping government efficiency gains in his congressional address, announcing immediate freezes on federal hiring, new regulations and foreign aid while highlighting what he characterized as significant waste in government spending. Trump declared an aggressive approach to government downsizing, stating, 'Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations and freeze on all foreign aid.' The president singled out specific spending programs as examples of waste, including an $8 million program promoting LGBTQI+ initiatives in Lesotho, a small African nation. Trump referenced the Department of Government Efficiency as a key driver of these changes. Rep.Slotkin giving Democratic response to Trump speech He portrayed these cuts as crucial cost-saving measures, though the program was originally initiated by Republican predecessor George W. Bush. Trump alleged 'shocking levels of incompetence' in the Social Security program, stating that government records show 4.7 million Social Security recipients aged 100-109 and 3.6 million members aged 110-119. The administration also touted withdrawals from international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations Human Rights Council, as accomplishments of streamlining government operations. The stock market is down: Is Trump's trade war to blame? The president said his administration would balance the federal budget for the first time. He antagonized Democrats by saying they appreciate the cuts but 'just don’t want to admit it.'

Trump clashes with Democrats at testy joint address	President Trump on Tuesday sparred with Democratic lawmakers during an address to a joint session of Congress that began with a congressman being escorted out of the chamber and saw other Democrats leave the room as Trump spoke. Trump spoke to lawmakers for more than one hour and 39 minutes, breaking a record for the longest such speech delivered in modern history. It included several unprecedented attacks on his predecessor, President Biden, and protests from many Democrats in the chamber. The evening began with a rare scene, when Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), a regular Trump foil, stood to heckle the president after he boasted of his election victory. 'You don’t have a mandate,' Green called out, interrupting and briefly stopping Trump’s speech. When the congressman did not relent, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) directed the Sergeant at Arms to remove Green from the chamber, drawing raucous applause from Republicans in the room. The episode appeared to please both parties. Democrats were clearly ready to protest and push back on Trump’s remarks, while Republicans reveled in the frustration of the opposing party. Several Democrats left the chamber throughout Trump’s remarks. 'I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or make them stand and smile or applaud,' Trump said looking toward their side of the chamber. 'I could find a cure to the most devastating diseases. A disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history…and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements.' 'It’s very sad. And it just shouldn't be this way,' Trump added. When Trump walked into the chamber, Rep. Stansbury (D-N.M.) held up a sign that read 'This is NOT Normal' before Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas) ripped it away and threw it in the air. Among the Democrats who left the chamber at points throughout the speech were Rep. Jasmine Crockett (Mo.), who showed off a shirt that read 'RESIST' on the way out, Rep. Maxwell Frost (Fla.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.). At one point, Trump taunted Democrats by suggesting they would vote to extend tax cuts that are set to expire later this year.'Because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office,' Trump said, gesturing to Democrats in the chamber. 'So I’m doing you a big favor by telling you that.' While arguing that the U.S. has given too much money to support Ukraine, days after a spat in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Zelensky, Trump called Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) his nickname for her: 'Pocahontas.' She responded by clapping from her seat. Trump referred to Democrats at one point with a positive tone, when he thanked them for voting for his Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Senate confirmed Rubio, a former senator, in a 99-0 vote. At other points, several Democrats held up round, black signs that read 'False,' 'Musk Steals,' 'Save Medicaid,' and 'protect veterans.' Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) held up a white board that at one point was held toward Trump and read 'start by paying your taxes.' When Trump spoke about support for law enforcement, some Democrats yelled out 'Jan. 6' to reference Trump’s pardons for rioters at the U.S. Capitol, including violent offenders who were convicted of attacking police officers that day. Then tensions were reminiscent of scenes during Trump’s previous addresses, culminating in his final State of the Union of his first term in 2020 when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ripped up her copy of Trump’s speech while behind him on the dais. The president called out former President Biden multiple times during his remarks, an unusual and rare move for a sitting president giving such an address. Trump called Biden 'the worst president in American history' while touting that migrant crossings at the southern border are down during his presidency compared to his Democratic rival. Trump then lamented that his administration inherited 'an economic nightmare' from the Biden administration and that he is fighting 'to reverse this damage.' It took Trump roughly 20 minutes to address inflation, a top concern for many voters, at which point he blamed Biden for the high price of eggs. When Trump began reiterating his unproven claims that millions of people well above the age of 100 are still receiving Social Security checks, Democrats yelled out and held up signs that said 'false' and 'lies.' Democrats also pointed to Elon Musk, who was sitting in the gallery, when Trump said 'the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.' The president also called out various actions he has taken that hit on areas Democrats support, rattling off that he has ended Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs and took steps to prevent transgender athletes from womens sports. And, the president slammed the CHIPs and Science Act, one of Biden’s signature achievements that aimed to boost domestic semiconductor production. It passed with bipartisan support and has been a boon to some Republican districts. 'Your chips act is a horrible, horrible thing,' Trump said to Democrats. 'You should get rid of the CHIP Act and whatever’s left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.' Trump also touted economic investments from major companies like Apple and SoftBank since his election – pointing to Democrats and saying that would not have been the case if Vice President Harris won in November. 'For just this one night,' Trump asked Democrats at one point, 'why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America?'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-clashes-with-democrats-at-testy-joint-address/	2025-03-04T20:46:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Trump_Dems_Address.jpg?w=900
Trump: 'A new president' has solved the border crisis	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump, during a joint address to Congress, declared his administration has launched the 'most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.' Trump noted that the Laken Riley Act, the first bill he signed after his reelection, mandated the detention of 'dangerous criminal aliens' and used the tragedy to underscore his immigration policy. Riley's mother and sister were guests of honor at the address, drawing bipartisan applause. The president said that a change in leadership, not new legislation, was the key to controlling border crossings. Rep. Slotkin giving Democratic response to Trump speech 'The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation to secure the border — but it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,' Trump told Congress. Beyond border enforcement, Trump proposed a $5 million 'gold card' citizenship pathway for wealthy investors, replacing the existing $1 million investor visa program. He said that more than 100 countries have similar programs, though some, including Spain and the U.K., have discontinued them due to concerns about housing prices and security. Trump called on Congress to expedite border funding 'without delay,' targeting House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune for immediate action. The stock market is down: Is Trump's trade war to blame? 'Joe Biden’s insane and very dangerous open border policies — they are now strongly embedded in our country but we are getting them out and getting them out fast,' Trump said, referring to migrants. Trump also signed an executive order renaming a national wildlife refuge in Texas in honor of Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed by migrants after they crossed the border illegally.

Trump's Canada tariffs 'backfired,' inflation to hit US: Ontario ...	(NewsNation) — Ontario Premier Doug Ford has threatened to cut off electricity exports to the United States following President Donald Trump’s newest tariffs. The move places a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower, 10% tariff. Supreme Court denies Trump administration request to cancel $2 billion in foreign aid 'It's absolute chaos right now,' Ford said Tuesday during an appearance on NewsNation's 'The Hill.' 'Trump ran on creating more jobs, lowering inflation. This has totally backfired. Inflation's gonna hit the American people and Canadians... This is all unnecessary.' There are a combined 380 million people in Canada and the U.S. who could face higher prices or power cuts if the trade war continues. 'Canadians love Americans': Doug Ford Ford apologized to the American people, insisting, 'We never started this.' 'I've talked to endless Americans... Canadians love Americans. They love the U.S. They look at Americans as part of the family, and so do I. And this is totally unnecessary,' Ford added, placing blame on Trump as the party responsible. Ford said cutting off electricity is the 'last step he wants to take.' Trump talks first days in office during joint address to Congress 'I do not want to do this to the Americans, but we have to retaliate when our country, our sovereignty, is at risk right now,' Ford added. 'I will do everything and use every tool in our tool kit to make sure we come to a resolution.' Who will be affected by a Canadian energy cut? Multiple regions of the U.S. will feel the heat — or lack thereof — if Canada decides to stop exporting energy. The stock market is down: Are Trump’s tariffs to blame? Oil refineries in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions rely on Canadian oil to make gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. In 2023, the U.S. imported 1.4 million barrels of Canadian crude oil daily — more than half its daily import of 2.4 million. America’s northern border has more than 35 major electricity transmission lines and 70 oil and gas pipelines, connecting the U.S. and Canada in the 'closest energy relationship in the world,' per the embassy of Canada’s official website. How much does the US rely on Canadian electricity? In some way or another, all 50 states in the U.S. receive energy or benefit from the energy relationship with Canada. 'The energy relationship between the two countries extends beyond just the trade of commodities, encompassing a variety of common, though not always identical, economic, security, and environmental priorities,' according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2024, Canada supplied 62% of American crude oil imports. Other energy exports from Canada include: Hydroelectric power Natural gas Other fossil fuels In New England, states like Maine, which are 'secluded from other regional energy infrastructure,' could face electricity cost hikes of up to $200 million per state, Heatmap News reports. The state of Vermont has partnered with Hydro-Québec to have the Canadian company provide 25% of the state’s annual energy needs through 2038. Similarly, New York has a deal for megawatt importation through 2030.

Bryan Kohberger's lawyers could cite autism to strike death penal...	(NewsNation) — Bryan Kohberger’s defense team may ask a judge to take the death penalty away as an option for their client by citing autism spectrum disorder, a sealed court filing shows. The team representing the man who is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in their off-campus house in November 2022 filed the document Monday. It states that it is a 'Motion to Strike the Death Penalty Re: Autism Spectrum Disorder.' It is not clear whether Kohberger has autism or if this is a diagnosis his attorneys are seeking. How to check your state tax refund status NewsNation has reached out to Kohberger’s defense attorney via email for comment. Kohberger is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin and Kaylee Goncalves. In court in May 2023, Kohberger did not verbalize a plea, but a judge entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf. His trial is set for August. A judge ruled in November 2024 that he is able to face the death penalty. Defense attorneys have previously asked a judge to dismiss most of the evidence in Kohberger’s case as they say it relies on a genetic investigation process they call unconstitutional. In addition, during a January hearing, Kohberger’s lawyers argued that search warrants obtained in the case were tainted by police misconduct.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/idaho-college-killings/bryan-kohbergers-lawyers-could-cite-autism-strike-death-penalty/	2025-03-04T14:50:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/AP23005699907486-e1709145194814.jpg?w=800
How Democrats will respond to Trump's Congress address	(NewsNation) — President Trump will give his first address to a joint session of a narrowly divided Congress since retaking the White House on Tuesday night. The Trump administration says the theme will be the renewal of the American dream. It comes amid sweeping cuts to the federal government. From the Republican side, there is anticipation to hear their party's president come and deliver the address. but the Democrats are likely to push back. Democrats seek to probe Musk conflicts and DOGE firings with resolutions of inquiry in the House Some have decided to skip the address altogether, while others are planning a more nuanced approach. Discussion of former federal government workers who have been fired being brought in as guests. There is a possibility of a more vocal protest inside the chamber while President Trump is speaking, despite Democratic leadership having cautioned against it. 'The last thing I'm concerned about as we are looking at the dismantling of government, taking away people's health care, veteran benefits is the decorum of the House Democrats,' Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., House Minority Whip told NewsNation. 'Our focus is on the American people and fighting for what they need.' Earlier this week, the leader of the Democratic House caucus, Hakeem Jeffries, sent a 'Dear colleague' letter to all of his members, noting that he and his leadership team are going to be in the chamber. 'To make clear to the nation that there is a strong opposition party ready, willing and able to serve as a check and balance on the excesses of the administration,' he wrote. Trump to pull funding from schools allowing ‘illegal’ protests 'It is important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber.' Republican lawmakers want to see President Trump stick to the things that got him elected, such as attempting to reduce prices, reduce crime, handle the border and make America strong again overseas. 'If he delivers in those areas, he'll be very successful,' Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told NewsNation. 'I worry about some of the tertiary things he's got himself involved with. They did not run on (those issues), in my view, and I think that hurts him.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/how-democrats-respond-trumps-congress-address/	2025-03-04T14:31:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201498755.jpg?w=900

Diddy, Luigi Mangione in partial lockdown at prison after 'race r...	(NewsNation) — The Metropolitan Detention Center, the prison where Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Luigi Mangione are being held, is partially locked down due to a 'race riot.' 'Phones are probably shut down... you'll basically be on your bed all day,' Gene Borello, a former Mob enforcer and MDC inmate, told NewsNation. Why is Diddy and Luigi Mangione's prison locked down? According to the Daily Mail, a 'race riot' involving over 40 inmates caused this lockdown. The jail is on what is called a 'modified operation,' which means 23-hour lockdowns for all inmates. This includes Diddy and Mangione. Tariffs on Canada, Mexico take effect, as China takes aim at US farm exports 'There's no movement in the building... Just get your meals, and that's it,' Borello told NewsNation. Officials with the Federal Bureau of Prison confirmed to DailyMail.com that 'multiple' inmates 'were observed fighting' at the Brooklyn facility on February 22. Federal Bureau of Prison officials told the Daily Mail that 'multiple' inmates were found fighting at the prison on Feb. 22. They also said that inmates did sustain injuries, however, no jail employees were injured. It has been reported that Combs and Mangione were not part of the riot.

'I've seen it go on for a month... it's a security risk,' Borello said Sean 'Diddy' Combs case Combs is currently awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He is also facing other sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by Tony Buzbee. Buzbee says his firm is representing over 150 people, both men and women, who have accused Combs of sexual abuse and exploitation.

Combs' lawyers are now saying that his federal indictment is based on a 'racist' law. One lawsuit was withdrawn against Diddy and rapper Jay-Z that claimed a woman was raped by them when she was 13 years old. The court documents did not explain why the Alabama woman withdrew the lawsuit. Luigi Mangione case Mangione is currently awaiting trial for the killing of Brian Thompson, the former UnitedHealthcare CEO. Mangione allegedly arrived in New York City days before the shooting. Police said that on the morning of the shooting, Mangione was fully masked and wearing a hood before shooting Thompson near the Hilton Hotel. Thompson was shot in the back and the leg and later pronounced dead at a local hospital. After searching for days, Mangione was arrested by police at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was denied bail in December and pleaded not guilty in the case. He allegedly wrote a manifesto that talked about the insurance industry. 'Frankly, these parasites had it coming,' the manifesto stated. It also spoke directly to the federal agents in the case.

Canada may halt electricity exports to US over Trump tariffs	(NewsNation) — Ontario Premier Doug Ford has threatened to cut off electricity exports to the United States following President Donald Trump's newest tariffs. 'If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything — including cut off their energy with a smile on my face,' Ford told reporters at a mining convention in downtown Toronto, the Toronto Sun reported. Trump enacted a 25% tariff on imports from our northern neighbor on Tuesday, making good on his campaign promises to make other North American countries pay for perceived failures in border security. But beyond the political posturing are a combined 380 million people in Canada and the U.S. who could face higher prices or power cuts if this trade war intensifies. Does US rely on Canadian electricity? The United States and Canada have had a symbiotic energy relationship for nearly six decades. America's northern border is home to more than 35 major electricity transmission lines and 70 oil and gas pipelines, connecting the countries in the 'closest energy relationship in the world,' per the embassy of Canada's official website. As of 2021, Canadian energy exports to the United States totaled $112 billion — conversely, the U.S. imported $25 billion in energy to Canada. Car prices could jump by $12K under Trump’s new tariffs: Report In 2024, Canada supplied 62% of American crude oil imports. Other energy exports from Canada include hydroelectric power, natural gas and other fossil fuels. 'The energy relationship between the two countries extends beyond just the trade of commodities, encompassing a variety of common, though not always identical, economic, security, and environmental priorities,' according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In some way, shape or form, all 50 states get energy or benefit from the U.S.-Canada energy trade. Can Canada cut off electricity to the US? Yes, Canada can make good on Ford's promise — though it'll take more than his threats to enact tariffs or pull the plug altogether. It will take federal government approval for Ontario or any province to retaliate against Trump, experts told CNN back in 2024 when Trump and Ford first floated their warnings. Who will be affected by a Canadian energy cut? Nearly every region of the country will feel the heat — or lack thereof — if Canada decides to stop exporting energy. Oil refineries in the Midwest and Great Lakes region rely on that oil to make gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. In 2023, the U.S. imported 1.4 million barrels of Canadian crude oil each day — more than half its daily import of 2.4 million. In New England, states like Maine, which are 'secluded from other regional energy infrastructure,' could face electricity cost hikes of up to $200 million per state, Heatmap News reports. The state of Vermont has partnered with Hydro-Québec to have the Canadian company provide 25% of the state's annual energy needs through 2038. Similarly, New York has a deal for megawatt importation through 2030. Both deals could easily fall apart if Ford's threats come to fruition, leaving much of the northeast scrambling for a new source. What would happen if Canada stops exporting energy to US? If Canada does shutter its energy exports to the U.S., Trump and his administration will have to buy from a pricier source, shift power across the country or create more energy facilities in-house. Integrity Energy, one of the largest commercial energy brokerages in the nation, warns this could 'single-handedly impact power reliability and costs in many states along the Northern border and throughout the Midwest.' The Ohio-based enterprise forecasts a jump in both gas prices and energy rates, especially for states in the northeast like Maine, which is 'secluded from other regional energy infrastructure.' Trump trade war intensifies as tariffs go into place RJ Johnston, research director at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told CNN in December that he doesn't 'see much vulnerability' for America in this situation. He argues that the U.S. has abundant electricity resources and that any energy scramble would likely be temporary. 'Even in an extended outage, the US has the ability to add more generation capacity in a relatively short period of time,' Johnston said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/canada-energy-us-tariffs/	2025-03-04T10:27:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6764336d9706f7.97046770.jpeg?w=900
Here are the White House guests for Trump's address	(The Hill) -- The White House on Tuesday unveiled the list of guests who will sit with first lady Melania Trump at the Capitol during President Donald Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress. Fifteen individuals will sit with the first lady, with the invited individuals intended to highlight Trump's accomplishments six weeks into his second term and, in particular, his administration's priorities around immigration. Trump trade war intensifies as tariffs go into place The White House invited Allyson and Lauren Phillips, who are the mother and sister of Laken Riley. Riley was a college student who was killed roughly a year ago in Athens, Georgia, by a Venezuelan migrant who had been arrested for shoplifting ahead of the attack and paroled in the U.S. Her death became a rallying cry for Trump on the campaign trail. The president and first lady will also host Alexis Nungaray, whose 12-year-old daughter, Jocelyn, was killed by two individuals who entered the country illegally. Also sitting with the first lady will be Roberto Ortiz, who has served as a Border Patrol agent for nearly a decade. The White House also invited Marc Fogel and his mother, Malphine. Fogel was released from Russia last month as part of an exchange brokered by the Trump administration. Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania, had been detained for more than three years in a Russian prison. House Republicans advised to avoid in-person town halls amid protests Two White House guests will highlight Trump’s executive actions to ban transgender athletes from women’s sports and to restrict access to gender-affirming care. The first lady will host Payton McNabb, a former high school volleyball player who said she sustained a concussion after a transgender athlete spiked a ball that hit her head. Melania Trump will also host January Littlejohn, who sued a Florida school board alleging officials 'socially transitioned her daughter to a different sexual identity without January and her husband’s knowledge or permission.' Other guests include the family of Corey Comperatore, who was killed during an assassination attempt at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July; Stephanie Diller, the widow of New York police officer Jonathan Diller, who was killed last March at a traffic stop, and Jeff Denard, a steel plant worker from Alabama. 5 things to watch as Trump delivers joint address to Congress Two guests will highlight the first lady’s initiatives specifically. There is Elliston Berry, a 15-year-old who was the victim of deepfake images. Melania Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Monday for a roundtable on deepfakes and revenge porn legislation. There is also Haley Ferguson, a college student who benefitted from an initiative championed by the first lady to assist foster children.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine wants peace, shows gratitude to US	(NewsNation) — Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants peace in a social media post Tuesday morning. Despite a tense exchange with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Friday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is 'ready to come to the negotiating table' to bring 'lasting peace.' Zelenskyy also expressed a willingness to collaborate with Trump. 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,' he said. 'We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.' Tariffs on Canada, Mexico take effect, as China takes aim at US farm exports Trump called for Zelenskyy to show greater appreciation for the United States on Monday, something the Ukrainian president addressed in his post. 'We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,' Zelenskyy said. 'And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins,' he said. 'We are grateful for this. Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right. We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive.' Zelenskyy added that Ukraine is ready to sign a rare minerals agreement. Trump pauses aid to Ukraine amid clash with Zelensky Vance told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that, should Ukraine be willing to negotiate, 'everything is on the table.' 'The president is still committed to the mineral deal,' Vance added. 'I think we’ve heard some positive things, but not yet, of course, a signature from our friends in Ukraine,' Vance said. 'But look, the mineral deal is a very important part of the president’s policy.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/zelenskyy-ukraine-peace-gratitude/	2025-03-04T09:10:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830748.jpg?w=900
Starliner astronauts avoid engaging in politics about their retur...	(NewsNation) — Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, along with astronaut Nick Hague, will speak to the media ahead of their scheduled return. The crew said they support political leaders and when it comes to being the subject of political discussions, noted that there is information about the situation politicians may not have and likewise, there is political information they are not privy to while in orbit. When it comes to looking ahead, Williams said one of the difficult issues is having family members who know they are coming home but still have no firm date to expect them back. Blue Ghost has first completely successful private lunar landing Williams also answered a question about her dogs, two labrador retrievers, noting that at least they can't tell time but said she was looking forward to returning to them soon. She also expressed sorrow that it could be her last trip to the ISS and indicated she might leave a personal object on board, though she declined to say what it would be, suggesting the next crew would have to find it. The pair will be using generic spacesuits on the return since they were not Earthside to get fitted for custom ones. Unlike the usual suits, they won't be emblazoned with their names though Wilmore joked that they have Sharpies on the ISS and so his suit might have a name after all. He also joked that life in space is great, since all his aches and pains disappear without gravity. Wilmore and Williams initially blasted off for what was expected to be a roughly two-week mission on the International Space Station. However, Boeing's Starliner capsule experienced multiple issues on the journey, including numerous helium leaks in the service capsule and difficulty with thrusters when docking. After evaluation, NASA determined it was unsafe for Starliner to make a crewed return. The capsule made an autonomous journey back to Earth, with Wilmore and Williams embarking on an extended stay on ISS. The pair have pushed back against media and political characterizations that they are 'stranded,' saying they are enjoying the opportunity to spend many months on the ISS. The two are scheduled to return with NASA's Crew-9 mission, currently estimated to return at the end of March. Teacher’s art featured in the International Space Station President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have attempted to take credit for returning the astronauts on a SpaceX capsule, but NASA began making plans to use a SpaceX vehicle for the return last fall. Crew-10 could launch as early as Mar. 12. Once it docks, there will be a brief handover period and then Wilmore and Williams will return with the Crew-9 mission crew.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/starliner-astronauts-press-return/	2025-03-04T08:53:12-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/Quiz-astronauts_060524_AP_Chris-OMeara-e1734531090665.jpg?w=800
Car prices could jump by $12K under Trump's new tariffs: Report	(NewsNation) — The cost of some new cars could jump by $12,000 due to President Donald Trump's newly enacted tariffs on top trade partners China, Canada and Mexico, a new automotive consultant study found. On Tuesday, 25% tariffs were placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 20% tariff was placed on those from China. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower, 10% tariff. Michigan-based automotive consultant Anderson Economic Group's latest data points to these levies as potential price drivers, Bloomberg first reported. What are tariffs, and why did Trump enact them? Analysis shows the cost of building a crossover utility vehicle will rise by at least $4,000, with electric vehicles seeing a three-fold increase of $12,000. That's on top of already high prices due to inflation, with the average new car transaction last month ringing in at $49,740, per Kelley Blue Book. Which automakers will feel biggest impact from Trump's tariffs? According to new Edmunds data, 48.6% of all new vehicles sold through February were built in the United States. Another 17.4% were built in Mexico, 7.4% in Canada and 26.5% elsewhere. Some automakers rely on our North American neighbors more than others. Nearly half, 45%, of Volkswagen's vehicles are built in Mexico, followed by Nissan (35%) and GM (28%). Roughly one-fourth of new Hondas sold in America come from Canada. 'In the short term, automakers will need to pull every available lever to minimize disruptions and soften the immediate impact, but there’s no escaping the fact that higher costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers,' Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights, said in a statement. Chipotle will absorb tariff-related cost increases, CEO says Other makes and models that could see massive price shifts include the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and the Ford Bronco Sport SUV, multiple outlets report. Pricier production will directly impact customers and potentially hurt sales, Patrick Anderson, CEO of AEG, told Bloomberg. 'That kind of cost increase will lead directly — and I expect almost immediately — to a decline in sales of the models that have the biggest trade impacts,' Anderson said. What impact do Trump's tariffs have on the economy? The automotive industry is just one that will likely feel the burn from Trump's tariffs and subsequent international retaliation. Americans could see higher prices on a range of goods the U.S. imports from its top three trading partners, including vehicles, fruits and vegetables, smartphones, toys, laptops and even fuel at the pump. A 2024 paper by a group of top economists looked at Trump’s 2018 tariffs and found that 'import tariffs on foreign goods neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment in newly-protected sectors.' However, retaliatory tariffs had 'clear negative impacts,' primarily in agriculture. NewsNation's Andrew Dorn and the Associated Press contributed to this report.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/car-prices-trump-tariff-impact-economy/	2025-03-04T08:32:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/6643cc87d66e99.19875148.jpeg?w=900
5 things to watch as Trump delivers joint address to Congress	President Trump will head to the Capitol on Tuesday for the first joint address of his second term emboldened by a month of mass federal agency slashing, shocking foreign policy moves and a dizzying array of executive actions that have disrupted Washington and beyond. Trump will show off such prowess before a joint session of Congress in the House chamber, where his Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court justices, House and Senate lawmakers, and perhaps the controversial Elon Musk prepare to be his live audience. The president is expected to tout his sweeping efforts to reshape the government, crack down on immigration and reorient U.S. foreign policy on the heels of an Oval Office spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Here are five things to watch for in his prime-time speech. Musk and DOGE The White House has yet to say whether Musk will be in attendance, and if so where he will sit, but Musk has joined Trump both in the Oval Office and at his first Cabinet meeting, where he spoke at length, sometimes for longer than Trump. Musk has been put in charge of spending cuts and worker firings within the federal government that the administration says has so far totaled in the billions of dollars. Trump has floated the idea that 20 percent of that could go to taxpayers and another 20 percent toward paying down U.S. debt, but some budget hawks want the deficit taken care of before rebates are sent out. Trump also has to defend the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Musk despite widespread controversy over the manner in which agencies have been slashed and workers fired on the spot, sometimes over one-line emails. Some Republicans have faced pushback at town halls in recent weeks over the cuts the billionaire tech executive has implemented. There’s also ongoing concerns from Democrats and some Republicans about the scope of the cuts that DOGE is implementing, especially as the team has overhauled the work of the U.S. Agency for International Development and targeted the critical work of the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Aviation Administration, among other departments. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats are bringing fired federal workers to the speech to highlight their opposition to DOGE’s sweeping cuts. What Trump will say about Ukraine The speech comes right on the heels of Trump on Monday night pausing aid to Ukraine in an about-face of U.S. foreign policy amid his public clash with Zelensky starting in the Oval Office late last week. Trump also called off peace talks with Zelensky but said Monday that a minerals deal was not completely off the table. Trump’s remarks may provide more clarity on the path forward for U.S. policy toward Ukraine. 'We’re making a speech — you probably heard about it — tomorrow night. So I’ll let you know tomorrow night,' Trump told reporters Monday when asked about discussions around Ukraine. The president said a proposed deal for the U.S. to invest in Ukraine’s critical mineral supply was still possible, but that Zelensky 'should be more appreciative' if he wants to restart talks. Some Republicans have in recent days suggested Zelensky was not the right leader for Kyiv moving forward, while Democrats have warned the Trump administration is playing into Russia’s hands. Trump on Monday doubled down on criticizing Zelensky, bashing him for saying that a deal to end the war is 'is still very, very far away.' Zelensky later said 'we need real peace' and insisted on security guarantees, adding 'it is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive.' New agenda items The news out of the second Trump administration keeps coming at a frenetic pace, but Trump on Tuesday will have perhaps his biggest prime-time audience since retaking office. Trump has used his time before cameras at the White House to make major announcements on tariffs, immigration and foreign policy, including when he stunned the world with his unexpected plan for a U.S. takeover of Gaza and an Oval Office fight with Zelensky that he said would make 'great television.' Trump may find more opportunities for fireworks from the dais, particularly those regarding how he plans to advance his legislative agenda, which he has suggested could be done in one or two sweeping packages involving tax cut extensions, border funding and energy investments. 'Tomorrow night will be big. I will tell it like it is,' Trump posted Monday on Truth Social. The day before the speech, Trump announced additional tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico will now go into effect the day of his address and that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will make a $100 billion investment in U.S. chip manufacturing plants. How Democrats respond Trump has had limited interactions with Democrats on Capitol Hill since taking office, meeting with bipartisan governors at the White House but largely avoiding Democratic members of Congress. That is set to change on Tuesday, with many Democrats slated to attend Trump’s speech. All eyes will be on whether Democrats jeer or heckle Trump or conduct some type of silent protest. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) famously ripped up her copy of Trump’s State of the Union address in 2020 to show her displeasure with his speech. Democratic women have also attended previous of Trump's State of the Union addresses wearing all white to symbolize women’s rights and suffrage. Trump has taken jabs at former President Biden in various comments to the media since taking office and could use the address as another opportunity to criticize his predecessor, leading to more fireworks. Still, joint addresses to Congress have typically contained some type of outreach to the other party to work on behalf of the American people. Biden used his joint addresses to advocate for issues that he said should be bipartisan, such as care for veterans and addressing the opioid epidemic. In Trump’s case, much of it will come down to whether he and his team view the speech as an opportunity to broaden his appeal, or another chance to double down on the mandate he has claimed in the wake of the 2024 election. Shutdown threat looms Trump will speak to lawmakers 10 days before a government funding deadline that could lead to a shutdown if no agreement is reached. The potential for a shutdown has been overshadowed in the early weeks of Trump’s term by the president’s own actions, as well as congressional Republicans’ efforts to get moving on his agenda. Trump last week publicly backed a 'clean, temporary government funding bill,' urging lawmakers to pass a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded through September. The question is whether Trump can get Republicans unified around that idea. Some Republicans have called for incorporating spending cuts into any funding measure after DOGE identified various contracts it deemed wasteful. Including DOGE cuts in appropriations, however, would spark outcry from Democrats and almost certainly lead to a government shutdown. The narrow margin in the House leaves little wiggle room for Republicans, and Trump may use his speech to urge lawmakers to avoid a worst-case scenario of a messy shutdown.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/5-things-to-watch-as-trump-delivers-joint-address-to-congress/	2025-03-04T08:04:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Top-Trump_012125_AP_Julia-Demaree-Nikhinson.jpg?w=900
Trump trade war intensifies as tariffs go into place	(The Hill) -- Americans awoke on Tuesday morning to an intensifying trade war, as President Donald Trump’s newest tariffs on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports were imposed and those countries quickly moved to retaliate. The Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico and a new 10 percent tariff on imports from China. In retaliation, Canada hit the U.S. with 25 percent tariffs on $30 billion in goods just after midnight, though it did not specify which products were included. 'Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said late Monday in a statement. 'While we urge the U.S. administration to reconsider their tariffs, Canada remains firm in standing up for our economy, our jobs, our workers, and for a fair deal,' the outgoing prime minister added. How to watch Trump address to Congress Mexico is expected to announce tariffs on U.S. products later today. China said Tuesday it would impose 15 percent tariffs on imports of chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from the U.S., as well as 10 percent tariffs on imports of sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafoods, fruits vegetables and dairy products, according to The Associated Press. Also on Tuesday, Beijing added 15 U.S. companies to its unreliable entities list, which could potentially bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. 'China has decided to include 15 U.S. entities that endanger China’s national security and interests in the export control list, prohibiting the export of dual-use items to them,' the Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Trump has threatened but then pulled back from tariffs previously, but in this case followed through with his vows despite a severely negative reaction from stock markets. The S&amp;P 500 dipped by 1.76 percent on Monday, the biggest loss since December last year. The Dow Jones also fell by nearly 650 points. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.64 percent as Nvidia stock dropped by nearly 9 percent. Ford and General Motors stocks also fell on Monday. The president is set to address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening when he will be expected to defend his trade actions. Trump said on Monday that 'vast amounts of fentanyl got poured into our country' mostly through Mexico and from China and suggested to car manufacturers to build factories in the U.S. to successfully sidestep the levies. 'So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,' he added. 5 things to watch as Trump delivers joint address to Congress In hitting Canada and Mexico with tariffs, Trump has argued he is both seeking to crack down on fentanyl illegally entering the country and seeking to make fair a trade system he says penalizes the United States. But Canada and Mexico argue they are taking steps to prevent illegal drugs from crossing the border and that Trump’s actions punish longtime U.S. allies even as they violate previous trade deals. It is unclear where the trade war will head next, though Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday he is prepared to cut off electricity exports to the U.S. if Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods go through. 'If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything — including cut off their energy with a smile on my face,' Ford told reporters at a mining convention in downtown Toronto, the Toronto Sun reported.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-trade-war-intensifies-as-tariffs-go-into-place/	2025-03-04T08:03:45-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/AP25063244073051-e1741095130908.jpg?w=800
Designated survivor' is Veterans Affairs Sec. Doug Collins	(NewsNation) — House and Senate lawmakers, U.S. Supreme Court justices, Cabinet members and invited guests will attend President Donald Trump's joint session address to Congress on Tuesday — except for one pivotal person. A 'designated survivor' is a Cabinet member chosen by the president to stay behind during speeches like the State of the Union, leaving the United States with a leader in case of a catastrophic event. NewsNation has learned that Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins will be Trump's 'designated survivor.' Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., announced he was selected by Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries as the 'designated survivor' for the Democratic side. Originating in the 1950s as a Cold War-era policy, assigning a designated survivor is an 'obscure but important ritual' for joint-session events, according to the National Constitution Center. Trump to deliver high-stakes address to joint session of Congress Who is Trump's designated survivor? Typically, the name of the designated survivor is revealed just before, or even during, the address. Like the president, the designated survivor has to meet a few requirements — they must be at least 35 years old and a natural-born U.S. citizen. All members of Trump’s Cabinet meet both requirements. Previous designated survivors include: 2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona 2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh 2022: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo 2021: No one, since the pandemic did not allow all members of Congress to gather 2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt 2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry Previous designated survivor describes experience as 'sobering' In 2007, President George W. Bush selected then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to be his designated survivor for the State of the Union. Gonzales told NewsNation in 2024 he received no special training to prepare him for the position but that he was given two options for passing the time. 'The option I chose was to put me in an airplane during the State of the Union,' Gonzales said. 'I just felt perhaps it would be kind of cool to fly around as the president gave the State of the Union.' Congress eyes probe, reforms in response to aircraft tragedy When he arrived at Joint Base Andrews, officials from every major department and agency appeared with the necessary documents to advise him in case of disaster. 'President Bush gave his State of the Union, and it was at that point in time where I suddenly realized, ‘Oh, my gosh, if something happened back at the Capitol, then conceivably, I would become president of the United States,'' Gonzalez said. 'It is a sobering thought, quite frankly.' When is Trump's speech? Trump will go to Capitol Hill with first lady Melania Trump tonight, with remarks slated to begin just after 9 p.m. ET — mere hours after he paused aid to Ukraine and enacted hefty tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico.

Congress to hold hearing on air traffic staffing, FAA infrastruct...	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — A House subcommittee will hear testimony Tuesday on U.S. air traffic control staffing shortages and technology and infrastructure woes faced by the Federal Aviation Administration. Airlines for America, the nation's largest airline industry trade group, has reported a shortage of about 3,500 air traffic controllers affecting airports nationwide. Lawmakers will discuss 'the critical need to invest in modernizing and adequately staffing the current system' and will hear from labor leaders, aviation safety experts and the CEO of Airlines for America. The hearing begins at 10 a.m. ET. FAA probing 'false alarms' at DC airport The hearing comes amid mounting scrutiny following several recent aviation incidents, including a near-collision last week at Chicago's Midway International Airport involving a Southwest Airlines jet and a Jan. 29 crash at Washington-Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people after an American Airlines regional jet collided with an Army helicopter. US tariffs on Canada, Mexico take effect The FAA is also investigating false collision alerts issued to pilots while attempting to land at Reagan National Airport over the weekend, though no other aircraft were nearby. It is unclear why the alerts went out, the FAA said. To address staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a hiring surge, with a 30% increase in starting salaries for those who attend the FAA academy. He noted the average starting salary is more than $160,000 per year. NewsNation travel editor Peter Greenberg said the shortage of air traffic controllers dates back to 1981, when former President Ronald Reagan fired striking air traffic controllers and replaced them with military controllers. 'There was no provision by the FAA to understand retirement and rehiring, and they’ve never been able to catch up. So the fact that they’re 3,500 controllers short has been going on for four decades,' he said. Greenberg added that three U.S. air traffic control centers are operating under 85% staffing, forcing controllers into mandatory overtime, which is problematic. FAA OKs SpaceX test launch Special government employee Elon Musk has called for retired air traffic controllers to return to work amid growing concerns over conflicts of interest as the Department of Government Efficiency attempts to overhaul the FAA. Senate negotiators look at dueling options to avert government shutdown The FAA has cleared Musk's SpaceX for another test launch, weeks after a Starship explosion during a January test flight, despite the company failing to complete a mandatory investigation into the incident. SpaceX was chosen to help upgrade the FAA's air traffic control system, leading some Democrats, such as Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., to accuse Musk of 'trying to interfere' with the U.S. air traffic control system. While the FAA recently fired 350 staff members as part of a downsizing effort, Duffy asserts that none were air traffic controllers.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/congress-hearing-air-traffic-faa-staffing/	2025-03-04T04:37:59-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/dca-e1738868011805.jpg?w=800
Trump to deliver high-stakes address to joint session of Congress	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump plans to review his first weeks in office and discuss the future of at least three major topics in Tuesday's joint address to Congress. A White House official tells NewsNation that Trump’s address will focus on 'the renewal of the American Dream' and hinge on four main tenets: First month in office The economy Conflicts abroad Immigration Trump said on social media he intends to 'tell it like it is.' 'In his Joint Address to Congress, President Trump will celebrate his extraordinarily successful first month in office while outlining his bold, ambitious, and common sense vision for the future,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

More than just lawmakers will attend Tuesday's event. In addition, members of the U.S. Supreme Court and Trump's Cabinet will be in attendance. The president typically invites guests to view the address from the balcony above the House floor, next to the first lady. One such guest is January Littlejohn, a self-described 'mom fighting to protect children and families from the harms of gender ideology,' Leavitt announced on social media. Littlejohn claims she 'saved' her daughter from a school that tried to help her young daughter socially transition — changing name, pronouns and appearance. Trump has addressed the topic during his campaign and in the Oval Office, attempting to withhold federal funds from institutions that provide gender-affirming care for minors, among other executive orders. The first lady has also invited more than a dozen 'everyday Americans' to attend Tuesday’s address. Notable attendees include the family of Corey Comperatore, the fire chief killed during the July 13, 2024, attempt on Trump’s life, and Alexis Nungaray, whose daughter Jocelyn was sexually assaulted and killed by two Venezuelan nationals who were in the U.S. illegally. Senate negotiators look at dueling options to avert government shutdown And lawmakers aren't going to Trump's address alone — each gets to bring a guest. More than a dozen Democrats are inviting recently fired federal workers, multiple media outlets reported. Just last week, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged rank-and-file lawmakers to issue those invitations. Another confirmed guest is Jennifer Hegseth, wife of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who will be attending with Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn. Is Trump's speech a ‘State of the Union’ address? Technically, a State of the Union address is usually delivered in January or February, and it covers both the previous year's accomplishments and the upcoming year's plan. Since Trump has only been in office six weeks, Tuesday's event will be simply a joint address to Congress. Tariffs an ‘expensive game to play’: Powerteam International CEO According to the American Presidency Project, the impact of these first-year speeches should be considered to have the same heft as the State of the Union addresses that follow in subsequent years. And, just like the State of the Union address, the opposing party gives a brief speech in response, which, like the president’s remarks, is televised. This year’s speech will be delivered by Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

Tariffs on Canada, Mexico take effect, as China takes aim at US f...	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s long-threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect Tuesday, putting global markets on edge and setting up costly retaliations by the United States’ North American allies. Starting just past midnight, imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. The 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%, and Beijing retaliated Tuesday with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would slap tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. Mexico didn't immediately detail any retaliatory measures. Here’s what tariffs are and how they work The U.S. president's moves raised fears of higher inflation and the prospect of a devastating trade war even as he promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity. He has shown a willingness to buck the warnings of mainstream economists and put his own public approval on the line, believing that tariffs can fix what ails the country. 'It’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,' Trump said Monday at the White House. 'And now we’re using them.' The Canada and Mexico tariffs were supposed to begin in February, but Trump agreed to a 30-day suspension to negotiate further with the two largest U.S. trading partners. The stated reason for the tariffs is to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and both countries say they've made progress on those issues. But Trump has also said the tariffs will only come down if the U.S. trade imbalance closes, a process unlikely to be settled on a political timeline. The tariffs may be short-lived if the U.S. economy suffers. But Trump could also impose more tariffs on the European Union, India, computer chips, autos and pharmaceutical drugs. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he’ll do next. 'It’s chaotic, especially compared to the way we saw tariffs rolled out in the first (Trump) administration,' said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. 'It’s unpredictable. We don’t know, in fact, what the president will do.’’ China slaps extra tariffs of up to 15% on imports of major US farm exports, adds trade curbs Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs, and even some Republican senators raised alarms. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’s 'very concerned' about the tariffs going into effect because of her state’s proximity to Canada. 'Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,' Collins said, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. The world economy is now caught in the fog of what appears to be a trade war. Even after Trump announced Monday that the tariffs were going forward, Canadian officials were still in touch with their U.S. counterparts. 'The dialogue will continue, but we are ready to respond,' Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said in Ottawa as he went into a special Cabinet meeting on U.S.-Canada relations. 'There are still discussions taking place.' Shortly after Blair spoke, Trudeau said Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $155 billion Canadian ($107 billion U.S.) worth of American goods, starting with tariffs on $30 billion Canadian ($21 billion U.S.) worth of goods immediately and on the remaining amount on American products in three weeks. 'Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,' Trudeau said. Tariffs an ‘expensive game to play’: Powerteam International CEO The White House would like to see a drop in seizures of fentanyl inside the United States, not just on the northern and southern borders. Administration officials say that seizures of fentanyl last month in everywhere from Louisiana to New Jersey had ties to foreign cartels. Damon Pike, technical practice leader for customs and trade services at the tax and consulting firm BDO, suggested the responses of other countries could escalate trade tensions and possibly increase the economic pressure points. 'Canada has their list ready,' Pike said. 'The EU has their list ready. It’s going to be tit for tat.’’ The Trump administration has suggested inflation will not be as bad as economists claim, saying tariffs can motivate foreign companies to open factories in the United States. On Monday, Trump announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the computer chipmaker, would be investing $100 billion in domestic production. Still, it can take time to relocate factories spread across the world and train workers with the skills they need. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be 'crippling' for the toy industry, as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China. 'There’s a sophistication of manufacturing, of the tooling,' he said. 'There’s a lot of handcrafting that is part of these toys that a lot of people don’t understand … the face painting, the face masks, the hair weaving, the hair braiding, the cut and sew for plush to get it to look just so. All of that are very high hands, skilled labor that has been passed through generations in the supply chain that exists with China.' For a president who has promised quick results, Ahearn added a note of caution about how quickly U.S. factories could match their Chinese rivals. 'That can’t be replicated overnight,' he said. Gillies reported from Toronto.

O'Reilly: Trump avoiding Putin criticism to negotiate peace deal	(NewsNation) — Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says President Donald Trump is deliberately avoiding criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a calculated strategy to secure a peace deal in Ukraine. 'Trump knows that Putin is never going to stop murdering people, unless Putin can walk away with some kind of victory, some kind of saving face,' O'Reilly said Monday on NewsNation's 'On Balance.' 'That's why Trump isn't attacking him. That's why Trump even patronizes him to a certain extent, not condemning him.' O'Reilly said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fails to understand basic negotiation tactics, saying 'a 10-year-old would' recognize that 'if your enemy is more powerful than you, and you want the enemy to stop murdering your people, you have to make some accommodations.' Paul Manafort: Peace is not in Zelenskyy’s interest O'Reilly's comments followed Trump's contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy, and Monday's announcement that the Trump administration is halting U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine. 'Zelenskyy is going to lose some territory' at war's end, O'Reilly said. Despite criticizing Zelenskyy for being 'in way over his head,' O'Reilly defended the Ukrainian president's intentions, saying, 'I believe that Zelensky wants the best for his country. He's just out of his league. He doesn't understand the danger that surrounds him.' O'Reilly concluded by expressing optimism that Trump would eventually secure a deal, though he acknowledged Democrats would likely criticize any agreement reached.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/oreilly-trump-avoiding-putin-criticism-to-negotiate-peace-deal/	2025-03-03T19:39:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-5.jpg?w=900
Paul Manafort: Peace is not in Zelenskyy's interest	(NewsNation) — Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'survives by having a country at war' after a contentious Oval Office meeting between the two presidents. 'Zelenskyy is imperial,' Manafort told NewsNation's 'CUOMO' on Monday. 'His office has expired. He's a martial law president, and that's fine. I mean, that's a legitimate position to be in, but his popularity in Ukraine is not very high.' Manafort, who previously advised former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, said Zelenskyy has political motivations for prolonging the conflict. Trump pauses aid to Ukraine amid clash with Zelensky 'I'm not saying he likes war, but he survives by having a country at war, and so it's in his interest to find ways to stop the fighting, but not necessarily reach peace right away, until he can get strengthened politically,' Manafort said. His comments come after Friday's Oval Office photo op where Trump berated Zelenskyy in front of cameras, calling him 'disrespectful' after the Ukrainian leader pressed Vice President JD Vance on diplomatic solutions with Russia. According to Manafort, Trump had developed a peace plan that included European partners and a peacekeeping force. He said Zelenskyy was warned it 'probably was not a good idea' to come to Washington but insisted on the visit. Second email to federal workers comes with caveat Manafort alleged Democratic lawmakers met with Zelenskyy before the White House meeting and 'got him all juiced up,' saying they 'weren't looking for peace, they were looking for political issue.' When asked about Trump pulling all aid to Ukraine, Manafort described it as 'purely a pressure tactic' rather than a genuine threat. 'Putin is ready to come to the table,' Manafort said, adding that Trump 'has a plan' for negotiations. The Friday meeting was originally scheduled to discuss an agreement for U.S. access to critical minerals in Ukraine, which Trump has argued would boost the Ukrainian economy and help recoup U.S. aid to Ukraine. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, following its annexation of Crimea in 2014.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/paul-manafort-peace-zelenskyy/	2025-03-03T18:49:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-3.jpg?w=900

How law enforcement targets migrants on ‘smuggler’s highway’	(NewsNation) — As President Donald Trump ramps up border enforcement, smugglers are becoming more creative and aggressively utilizing minibuses to transport people illegally into the country on what's been called the 'smuggler's highway.' The highway stretch on Interstate 10 in Arizona was targeted under a special operation by the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, which says migrants have become more aggressive in the weeks since Trump took office. Sheriffs told NewsNation they've had more 'hot pursuits' on the smuggler's highway in recent weeks. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines Deputies say under the Biden administration, migrants who were caught would pull over knowing that they weren't going to be locked up and deported, but now, they keep driving out of fear. One migrant told deputies he paid $8,000 for his minibus ticket to cross illegally, while another was found crossing with more than $140,000 in cash. The money was wrapped in small bags, and the man carrying it couldn't explain how he got it. Law enforcement said the money likely came from drugs or that the man was a smuggler and had been paid by some of the migrants in cash.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/law-enforcement-migrants-smugglers-highway/	2025-03-03T15:25:22-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/entinborderteaseVO_mp4_WGNX3826_446_mp4_00.00.21.23.jpg?w=900
New York City reports measles cases, raising public health concer...	NEW YORK (PIX11) -- A highly contagious illness that can cause pneumonia, swelling of the brain, miscarriage, and even death, has been reported in New York City. Measles is a highly contagious virus that can infect up to 90% of unvaccinated people who come in close proximity to an infected person, according to the New York City Department of Health. RFK Jr. calls for measles vaccinations as cases spread In 2024, New York State reported 15 cases, 14 of which were in New York City. The biggest outbreak in New York City over the last decade was in 2019 with 605 confirmed cases. In addition to the two confirmed cases in New York City, several measles cases were recently reported in New Jersey. In one case, a patient who was unvaccinated traveled outside of the U.S. and became sick with the illness after returning home to New Jersey, according to the state department of health. Two other unvaccinated people contracted the highly contagious illness from the first patient, the New Jersey health department said. Mexicans warned not to travel to Texas over measles What is measles? It’s a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes, or coughs. It most commonly affects kids. Measles first infects the respiratory tract, and then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes, and a rash. Measles is one of the world’s most contagious viruses. Here’s what to know and how to avoid it The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees, according to the CDC. There’s no specific treatment for measles, but health officials say that people who have had measles once cannot get it again. Close Thank you for signing up! Subscribe to more newsletters here.

Mexico says US guns fuel cartels, Supreme Court to weigh in	(NewsNation) — The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday on whether the country of Mexico can proceed with a lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers, accusing them of fueling violence caused by drug cartels that use American firearms. For the first time, the case asks the nation’s highest court to consider the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. The law was passed in 2005, and gives immunity to gun makers so they can’t be held liable for injuries caused by criminal misuse of their weapons. The case came to the Supreme Court on the same day President Donald Trump put into effect tariffs on Mexico to put pressure on the nation to stop fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration. Trump says 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports will start Tuesday, with ‘no room’ for delay The outcome of the case could have significant impacts in the U.S. depending on how the court rules, Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law, told NewsNation. 'I don't think this is going to sort of cut off these types of lawsuits, but depending on how the court decides and what language majority opinion uses, it could make lower courts a little bit more skeptical of these claims across the board,' he said. In 2019, the Supreme Court declined to consider a gun manufacturer's argument that PLCAA prohibited the families of the Sandy Hook school shooting victims from suing. But this ruling could make that harder if the court rules more broadly, Willinger said. Why is Mexico suing US gun companies? Mexico filed a $10 billion suit against leading U.S. gun manufacturers in 2021 over allegations that their practices facilitated illegal gun trafficking to Mexican drug cartels, causing violence and bloodshed in the nation. In its filing, the government of Mexico stated that it has only one gun store, issues less than 50 gun permits a year and that about 70% of all guns recovered from Mexican crime scenes come from the US. Mexico argues the companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market. The defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith &amp; Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. Prices rose along border ahead of Trump’s tariffs — now disruption looms They 'deliberately sell their guns through dealers who are known to disproportionately sell firearms that are recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. They provide these red-flag dealers with the firearms that Petitioners know cartels prefer, designing and marketing those firearms in ways they know cater to the cartels. They embrace distribution practices they know enable these red-flag dealers to illegally sell to cartel traffickers. And they intentionally do all this to boost their bottom lines,' Mexico wrote in one of its filings. The gun companies say Mexico has not shown the industry has purposely done anything to allow the weapons to be used by cartels and is trying to 'bully' gunmakers into adopting gun-control measures. Those companies argued that the lawsuit was barred by the PLCAA, which prohibits certain lawsuits against gun manufacturers. 'When the manufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply puts its product in the general stream of commerce, the aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that business with broadly policing every bad actor who may pick up its products downstream,' they wrote in filings. How did the lower courts rule? The lawsuit was initially dismissed by a district court that cited legal protections for gun makers from damages resulting from criminal use of firearms. The First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that while the PLCAA does apply to lawsuits by foreign governments for harm suffered abroad, Mexico’s lawsuit falls within the law’s 'predicate exception,' which allows lawsuits when gun companies knowingly broke the law. The gun makers are asking the Supreme Court to undo the appeal court ruling. Man claiming cartel ties arrested after interstate shooting: Police 'Mexico has extinguished its constitutional arms right and now seeks to extinguish America’s,' the National Rifle Association told the Supreme Court. 'I suspect that the court is going to side with the gun manufacturers here,' Willinger said, adding that it was primarily an inference from the fact that the court decided to take the case at this early stage. 'If the justices were sympathetic to Mexico's allegations, they would look at this and say ‘we want to give the trial court a chance to see what Mexico brings forward,’ but the fact that they didn't signals that they likely have issues with the appeals court ruling,' he said. What are the implications of the case for Americans? The words used by the court will be crucial, Willinger said. The families of the Sandy Hook victims were able to sue a gun company under an exception to PLCAA, eventually settling with the manufacturer that made shooter Adam Lanza’s assault weapon for $73 million in 2022. While the violations alleged were different in the Sandy Hook case, a broad court opinion on PLCAA and how important it is could have caused cases like Sandy Hook from moving forward, he said. 'To the extent that the court is more focused on the nature of the violation, like aiding and abetting illegal sales and to what extent a gun manufacturer can be liable even when they don't know, that could have a big impact on domestic litigation because the issue in those cases is often the same,' he said.

Trump's change in rhetoric signals push for peace: James Jeffrey	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump's change in rhetoric signals an inevitable peace deal, according to James Jeffrey, a former ambassador and deputy national security adviser. Trump addressed Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a media conference Tuesday. 'I just think he should be more appreciative,' Trump said of Zelenskyy. 'Because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin. We've given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us because, as you know, that's right there.' Jeffrey said Trump's comments signify a shift back to the messaging of a peace deal, which he spoke about early in his meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday before tensions increased. Trump announces $100B semiconductor investment from Taiwan 'The problem is that Zelenskyy is not really sure he wants to do a deal,' Jeffrey said. 'Zelenskyy was raising issues [on Friday] that are nonstarters with President Trump, and frankly, they're nonstarters with the Russians. So that led to the irritation. Now, people are trying to work this out. 'European pledge to support Zelenskyy is helpful, but Zelenskyy knows, or should know, Europeans alone cannot either deliver enough weapons and other financial support or negotiate with Russia.' Trump said peace talks could resume when Zelenskyy showed greater gratitude to the United States and told reporters he didn't think a deal was dead. Earlier in the day, the president took umbrage with Zeleskyy's comments that the end of the war was 'still very, very far away.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/trump-rhetoric-push-peace/	2025-03-03T14:09:39-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Trump-and-Putin-0221202.jpg?w=900
Trump: 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effec...	President Trump said Monday that the 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico will officially go into effect Tuesday, announcing there is no room for dealmaking to delay them again. 'The tariffs, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow,' he said, adding there’s 'no room left for Mexico or Canada' to make a deal before midnight. Trump had warned last week that the tariffs will go forward after he delayed them for a month following conversations with the Canadian and Mexican leaders, during which they agreed to action to address the flow of drugs at the border. Trump said Monday that 'vast amounts of fentanyl got poured into our country' largely through Mexico and from China, and he encouraged car manufacturers to build plants in the U.S. to avoid the upcoming tariffs. 'So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,' Trump said Monday. The president also announced that reciprocal tariffs will start April 2, which will cover imports from all nations that levy import taxes on U.S. goods. 'Reciprocal tariffs start on April 2. And I wanted to make it April 1, but I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to go April Fool's Day, because that … costs a lot of money … so we're going April 2,' Trump quipped. Trump said on Truth Social earlier Monday that tariffs on 'external' agricultural products will be imposed early April. 'To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!' he said. The stock market took a hit after Trump's announcements on tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 700 points after Trump's announcement. The president also suggested Monday that the 10 percent tariffs on China could increase to 20 percent. When Trump delayed the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he had imposed a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports over the issue of fentanyl production, and China responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/trump-25-percent-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-will-go-into-effect-tuesday/	2025-03-03T13:21:05-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/Trump_SouthLawn_02282025.jpg?w=900
RFK Jr. calls for measles vaccinations as cases spread	(NewsNation) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, urged people to consider getting vaccinated as measles cases have been reported in 10 states, with the outbreak now spreading to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 'All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,' Kennedy said in an op-ed at Fox Digital. The New Jersey Department of Health issued an alert Friday confirming its third case of measles in the state. An unvaccinated person from Bergen County contracted measles after returning from a trip overseas and spread it to two other people. Mexicans warned not to travel to Texas over measles Two measles cases have been confirmed in New York City, and one case has been confirmed in the state of Pennsylvania. Last week, Texas health officials announced an infected child had died, becoming the first registered measles death in the U.S. in a decade. The outbreak in the state has infected more than 140 people. Measles cases have also been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Mexico and Rhode Island. What is causing your spring allergies and what can you do to prevent them? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a total of 164 measles cases across the country. Measles is an extremely contagious airborne disease. It spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes and can cause severe illness and even death. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Anyone not vaccinated against measles is at risk. Young children and pregnant women are at a higher risk of severe complications. The best way to prevent measles is by getting vaccinated against it. The MMR vaccine is most effective at two doses and provides lifelong protection.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/rfk-jr-measles-cases-northeast/	2025-03-03T13:16:25-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/RFK_041024_Photo_Getty_0a28db-e1732303765297.png?w=800
JD Vance's role in Zelenskyy clash puts spotlight on VP	(NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance played a noticeable role in the escalation of tension during a combative meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. Vance's vocal involvement was among several noteworthy moments and led to mixed reactions. The vice president received praise from supporters of the GOP for defending the Trump administration and criticism from supporters of the Democratic party. Once Vance truly inserted himself into the conversation, calling for diplomacy for Russia, the temperature between the leaders rose. Texas border officials using drones to stop smugglers A Trump administration official told NewsNation that the president and vice president 'were totally on the same page' and Trump 'was happy with how the vice president jumped in.' The vice president in those kinds of settings, in the Oval Office, typically does not interject the way that Vice President Vance did. For the first month of this administration, Elon Musk has largely been the most visible right-hand man for President Trump. It remains to be seen if Vance will continue to be a staunchly vocal defender of the Trump administration. Education Department offers $25K for staffers to quit Many Democrat lawmakers are very concerned about the state of a potential peace deal, and many of them have blamed President Trump and Vance specifically. Most of the discourse in Washington falls along party lines. Republicans have been very defensive of Vance and Trump, saying that they were defending American values and that Zelenskyy was disrespectful in the Oval Office.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jd-vances-zelenskyy-clash-spotlight/	2025-03-03T10:47:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2201827007.jpg?w=900
Live: Trump makes investment announcement	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is making an investment announcement Monday afternoon. The White House did not release any other information on the announcement, but the Wall Street Journal reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. intends to invest $100 billion into chip manufacturing in the U.S. over the next four years. The announcement comes just ahead of Trump's first address to Congress in his second term.

Education Department offers $25K for staffers to quit	(The Hill) -- The Education Department sent out an email to staffers on Friday saying if they quit by Monday at midnight, they will receive a $25,000 cash payout. A department official confirmed the email, which warned of significant layoffs in the near future, to The Hill. The email, first reported by Politico, was sent by Jacqueline Clay, a chief human capital officer, giving employees until 11:59 p.m. on Monday to make a decision. RFK Jr. says Texas measles outbreak a ‘call to action’ 'This is a one time offer in advance of a very significant Reduction in Force for the US Department of Education,' Clay said. The department did not answer when asked how many staffers have accepted the offer so far. Some employees are ineligible for the payout such as those who have not yet been employed at the department for three years, those who have recently received a bonus or other award or those who got a student loan repayment benefit in the last three years. Clay said the payout would be 'the equivalent of severance pay or $25,000, whichever is less.' The offer comes after the department has already put dozens of employees on administrative leave as the Trump administration eyes moves to shut it down completely. $2 bills: Why does the US still print the rarely used currency? While complete elimination of the Education Department would take an act of Congress, it seems the agency will be slashed in other ways, as almost one billion dollars in contracts have been canceled. The email also comes the same day Linda McMahon, President Donald Trump’s pick for Education secretary, is set to be confirmed by the Senate. The former World Wrestling Entertainment head laid out in her confirmation hearing that she would like to see certain programs from the Department of Education move to other federal agencies. 'President Trump believes that the bureaucracy in Washington should be abolished so that we can return education to the states, where it belongs,' McMahon wrote to Democratic senators. 'I wholeheartedly support and agree with this mission.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/education-department-staffer-payout/	2025-03-03T09:23:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/ed-e1739188791590.jpg?w=800
Texas border officials using drones to stop smugglers	(NewsNation) — The Texas Department of Public Safety is employing cutting-edge technology to turn the tide on border-smuggling operations: drones. NewsNation exclusively joined DPS officials on the Lone Star State's border in the small town of Roma, Texas. Separated from Mexico by the Rio Grande, the area is a hotbed for cartels looking to move people or drugs across the border. Texas state trooper Sgt. Guadalupe Casarez was one of the officials using drones to monitor potential smuggling activity along the river. From Roma, Casarez said he can see cartel scouts patrolling the border on foot, in vehicles and in the air — using their own drones to spot Border Patrol agents and troopers — as they look for landing points for the small rafts carrying migrants into the United States. Elite US border unit trains daily to pursue dangerous intruders One cartel guide had no idea that Casarez's eye in the sky could see his every move. He brought two migrants from the bushes and made a run into a residential neighborhood. 'It’s an overall operation for them on their side,' Casarez said, explaining the process and planning needed to get people into the U.S. without detection. The migrants believed they had made it into the U.S. undetected by authorities, and the smuggler thought his job was finished. But Texas troopers operating the drones had already called back to Border Patrol agents patrolling nearby — and the pursuit was on. Border patrol agents rushed to the scene and arrested a female migrant. Agents then quickly jumped into the bushes, attempting to chase down the cartel guide and a male migrant who were making a run for it. The guide and the male migrant could be seen jumping into a raft, where another cartel scout was waiting to paddle them back to Mexico. Texas troopers, US Border Patrol team up to squash smuggling Drones like the ones used in this operation are equipped with heat sensors and play a crucial role in border security, Casarez said. Troopers also place game cameras in strategic areas to catch smugglers, using motion alerts to pinpoint where they need to deploy. Cartel scouts have taken to stealing the surveillance cameras and returning to Mexico before law enforcement can arrive. Texas DPS partners with U.S. Border Patrol agents and members of the Texas National Guard to try and track migrants that immigration officials characterize as 'gotaways.' In most cases, the Texas DPS works to determine if it can file state charges against those they encounter and charge them with smuggling people across the border. In other cases, U.S. Border Patrol officials file federal charges for human smuggling. The agencies also work together to stop the flow of illegal drugs being moved across the U.S.-Mexico border.

(NewsNation) — Nicholas Enrich, acting assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, was fired after sending a memo about the agency's failure to implement 'lifesaving humanitarian assistance.' Two USAID sources told NewsNation that Enrich, in a six-page letter to the entire agency, said Secretary of State Marco tried to unfreeze several pools of funding that he found to be critical aid. Rubio, on Jan.28, issued a temporary waiver to the pause on foreign assistance referenced in Trump's executive order on 'Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid,' the memo said. Second email to federal workers comes with caveat However, Enrich wrote, Rubio was overruled and ran into bureaucratic hurdles. Political leadership at USAID, the State Department and the Department of Government Efficiency created obstacles to prevent implementation of his waiver, the memo said. The sources said Enrich was let go shortly after the document was sent out and that they found the timing of this troubling and not coincidental. The prevailing feeling within USAID, the sources said, is that Enrich was let go as retribution. USAID funding cut Notices were sent out en masse last week stating that over 90% of USAID’s contracts for humanitarian and development work around the world were being terminated, per an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press. The Trump administration has outlined plans to cut some $60 billion in funding. Projects that were closed, according to the AP, include treating tens of thousands of malnourished children in Congo; food assistance in Ethiopia to more than 1 million people; and a program distributing bed nets and medication to prevent malaria in Senegal. Claims about USAID funding are spreading online. Many are not based on facts USAID staffers were told last week that Trump administration officials would be firing 1,600 employees and placing all but a fraction of employees on administrative leave, NewsNation partner The Hill reported. On Wednesday, USAID employees were given 15 minutes to collect their belongings from their offices.

Dane Paulson was reported missing from his family's Siletz, Oregon, home around 4:25 p.m. He had been playing in the yard out of his parents' sight. The Lincoln County Sheriff's Office launched a search of the property and surrounding areas using foot searchers and drones with thermal imaging equipment. Florida police search for missing 17-year-old from St. Pete The search continued Sunday with dogs and watercraft at the nearby Siletz River. Around 300 people were involved in the search, which had covered 382 areas and 283 miles as of Sunday evening. A vehicle seen near the home was found and is no longer a point of interest, according to the sheriff's office. The office said an Amber Alert was not issued because the case doesn't meet the criteria and that there is no evidence so far suggesting criminal actions. The office described the toddler as friendly and fearless, comfortable around strangers and water, but unable to swim.

Trump administration ramps up attacks as Zelenskyy thanks US	(NewsNation) — The Oval Office spat between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is raising serious questions about the future of the U.S.-Ukraine alliance. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said there is a rift in the relationship and accused Zelenskyy of standing against freedom. 'Many of these European countries who are coming to Zelenskyy's side as he walked out of the White House saying basically that they are going to support him in continuing this war, and that they don't stand with us around these fundamental values of freedom,' Gabbard said on 'Fox News Sunday.' National security adviser Mike Waltz and House Speaker Mike Johnson have also joined a growing chorus of Republicans who think Ukraine might be better off finding a new leader. 'Something has to change. Either he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,' Johnson told NBC's 'Meet the Press' on Sunday. GOP lawmakers divided on Trump-Zelenskyy feud But some Republican lawmakers, such as Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have dissented from their party's approval of Friday's meeting. On Saturday, Murkowski lamented the situation on social media: 'I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.' Lankford, R-Okla., said it was inappropriate for senators to call for Zelenskyy to resign and predicted that such a move would 'spiral Ukraine into chaos right now.' UK prime minister won’t cancel Trump visit after Zelenskyy meeting On the heels of the tense clash in the Oval Office, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly paused all U.S. Cyber Command actions against Russia indefinitely — including possible digital offensives by the Pentagon. This comes as Moscow celebrates the White House's position. A Kremlin spokesperson said the Trump administration's new approach aligns with Russia's vision. Zelenskyy thanks US after Trump altercation For his part, Zelenskyy seems to be trying to get things back on track. During a summit with European leaders in London over the weekend, Zelenskyy recommitted to signing a rare earth minerals deal with the U.S. That deal was originally meant to go public during Friday's White House visit. Ukrainian president thanks Trump, US on X day after heated meeting Zelenskyy also stressed Ukraine's gratitude to the U.S., writing on social media Sunday: 'We are very grateful to the United States for all the support. I’m thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion.' UK summit drafts peace plan for Ukraine At Saturday's summit, European leaders bolstered support for Ukraine and drafted a ceasefire plan for presentation to the U.S. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also promised a $2 billion deal to fund air-defense missiles for Ukraine. 'Because my reaction was we have to bridge this, we have to find a way that we can all work together because in the end we’ve had three years of bloody conflict now, we need to get to that lasting peace,' Starmer told the BBC. Early chatter of a peace deal involves a temporary truce lasting around one month, but how soon that deal could come — and if it will include security guarantees — remains uncertain.

Illinois man accused of deadly mass shooting at July 4th parade f...	WAUKEGAN, Ill (AP) — The trial of a suburban Chicago man accused of a mass shooting at a 2022 Independence Day parade that killed seven people and wounded dozens more is set to begin Monday. Robert Crimo III faces 21 counts of first-degree murder, three counts for each person killed, as well as 48 counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors dropped the less serious 48 counts of aggravated battery before jury selection last week. The road to the trial has been bumpy, with delays partly due to Crimo’s unpredictability, including his rejection of a plea deal that even surprised his attorneys. As potential jurors were questioned last week, he sporadically appeared in court, at times refusing to leave his jail cell. Authorities alleged Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds assembled for the annual Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Chicago. Prosecutors have submitted thousands of pages of evidence, as well as hours of a videotaped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old has since pleaded not guilty. His defense attorneys have declined comment ahead of the trial, which is expected to last about a month. His father, Robert Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct and served less than two months in jail. He has attended his son’s hearings, sometimes making eye contact with him during court. He declined to discuss the case in detail ahead of the trial. 'As a parent, I love my son very much,' he said. 'And Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know.' Prosecutors plan to call multiple law enforcement officers and survivors of the shooting to testify. They also will show videos of Crimo’s statements to police. Some of the videos already have been shown in court as prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to have them thrown out. Crimo’s erratic behavior has contributed to court delays. He fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself, then abruptly reversed himself. In June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, he arrived at the court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal. Residents in the wealthy Highland Park community of roughly 30,000 set along Lake Michigan have mourned the losses deeply. Some potential jurors were excused because of their connections to the case. City leaders canceled the usual parade in 2023, opting for a 'community walk.' The parade was reinstated last year on a different route and with a memorial for the victims. 'Our community is once again reminded of the immense pain and trauma caused by the Highland Park shooting,' Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said in a statement ahead of jury selection. 'Our hearts remain with the victims, their families, and all those whose lives were forever changed by that devastating day.' The victims killed in the shooting included Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35. Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/ap-illinois-man-accused-of-deadly-mass-shooting-at-july-4th-parade-faces-trial-3-years-after-attack/	2025-03-02T21:06:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c53a167a5d52.97467677.jpeg?w=900
Francis off mechanical ventilation entirely, signaling he's overc...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis remained in stable condition and didn’t need any mechanical ventilation Sunday, the Vatican said. It was a sign that he had overcome the possible complications from a respiratory crisis Friday and that his breathing function overall was improving as he recovers from pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope did continue to receive high-flow supplemental oxygen after Friday’s coughing episode, which sparked fears of a new lung infection. Doctors in their late Sunday update said Francis remained stable but again referred to the complexity of his overall condition and kept his prognosis at guarded, meaning he wasn’t out of danger. Francis, who has been in the hospital since Feb. 14, rested, prayed in his private chapel and participated in Mass after a morning visit from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra. The content of their talks wasn't known, but even when at the Vatican, Francis meets at least weekly with them. He again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance from the hospital. Instead, the Vatican distributed a message written by the pope from Gemelli Hospital in which he thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers, and prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere. 'From here, war appears even more absurd,' Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days. Francis said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere. 'I feel in my heart the ‘blessing’ that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,' Francis said in the text. 'At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.' Signs point to a recovery Many signs indicated he was improving, especially after a respiratory crisis on Friday afternoon that resulted in him inhaling vomit during a coughing fit and raising the possibility of new infection. Doctors aspirated the vomit and put him on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that pumps oxygen into the lungs. He used the ventilation on Saturday, alternating it with just supplemental oxygen, and by Sunday no longer needed it. Doctors also reported he had no fever or raised white blood cell levels, which would have indicated his body was fighting a new infection. The doctors had said they needed 24 to 48 hours after Friday's coughing episode to determine if there were any negative impacts on Francis' overall condition. The passage of time and positive reports Sunday suggested he had overcome the episode successfully. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs. Prayers continued to pour in Francis’ hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome from all over. Many have added a pilgrimage destination to their itineraries so they can pray for Francis at the Gemelli hospital, which is around a 20-minute drive from the Vatican, longer in rush hour or on public transport. The Rev. Riccardo Fumagalli had accompanied a group of young people from Milan to Rome for the Jubilee and would have attended Francis' Angelus prayer in St. Peter's Square on Sunday if he had delivered it as usual. Instead, they went to Gemelli. 'It seemed good to us to come here to express our closeness, especially of these teenagers, to be close to the Holy Father to pray for him, to pray for this moment of illness,' he said. Cancer patient Antonino Cacace was also arriving Sunday at Gemelli from Milan for his own treatment, saying he has to undergo surgery in the coming days and was counting on Francis' prayers. 'I am glad the pope is giving me help,' he said. 'I am on the ninth (floor) and he is on the 10th (floor). I hope to meet him and see him,' he said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Sanctuary city mayors to testify before House Oversight Committee	(NewsNation) — Four Democratic mayors from sanctuary cities are set to testify Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee in what observers expect will be a contentious hearing focused on immigration policies. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu will appear as the Trump administration intensifies its mass deportation efforts, putting sanctuary city policies under increased scrutiny. The four cities have struggled to manage the influx of migrants from the southern border, collectively spending billions of dollars on shelter and support services. Pentagon sending combat troops to southern border Republican committee members are expected to criticize the mayors for not cooperating with federal immigration authorities, likely citing crimes allegedly committed by migrants and questioning whether the mayors are adequately protecting their constituents. Mayor Adams may face less criticism from Republicans after recently meeting with Trump's border czar Tom Homan and agreeing to assist federal authorities in apprehending undocumented migrants with criminal records in New York City. However, Adams' cooperation comes after the Justice Department moved to drop corruption and bribery charges against him, raising questions about potential political motivations. Adams has denied any quid pro quo, stating he is 'not beholden to the Trump administration' but is 'just doing what he thinks is right.' Meanwhile, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced his candidacy for New York City mayor, planning a rally in lower Manhattan where he is expected to receive his first labor endorsement from the Carpenters' Union. Extradition of 29 capos shows Mexico 'can do more' A recent poll conducted by NewsNation affiliate WPIX, Emerson College and The Hill shows Cuomo leading in the Democratic primary race despite the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation as governor in 2021. Critics are organizing counter-demonstrations to remind voters of the accusations made against Cuomo by nearly a dozen women. During the early pandemic, Cuomo had a complex relationship with then-President Trump, occasionally cooperating with the administration but also publicly challenging federal policies when he disagreed with them.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/sanctuary-city-mayors-house-committee/	2025-03-02T16:41:09-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot-1.jpg?w=900
Private lunar lander Blue Ghost aces moon touchdown with a specia...	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions. Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon’s northeastern edge of the near side. Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away. 'You all stuck the landing. We’re on the moon,' Firefly’s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported. An upright and stable landing makes Firefly — a startup founded a decade ago — the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space. Two other companies’ landers are hot on Blue Ghost’s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week. Blue Ghost — named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies — had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company. Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It’s the third mission under NASA’s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade. Firefly’s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium. The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down. It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust — a scourge for NASA’s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment. On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers. The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business. Another lander — a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines — is due to land on the moon Thursday. It’s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That’s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over. Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972. A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023. The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades. NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox. 'It really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,' Fox said. Unlike NASA’s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim. Kim said everything went like clockwork. 'We got some moon dust on our boots,' Kim said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Trump announces US crypto reserve	President Trump announced Sunday that the U.S. would be creating a crypto reserve, to boost the growing industry. 'A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,' Trump posted to Truth Social. Trump said he will make the United States the 'Crypto Capital of the World.' His announcement comes just after the White House announced it would be welcoming cryptocurrency industry professionals on March 7 in a first-of-its-kind summit. Attendees will include founders, CEOs and investors from the industry. Hegseth directs civilian workers of DoD to reply to OPM email One of Trump’s first executive orders said he plans to make 'responsible growth' and use of 'digital assets' and technologies to bolster the economy. Trump’s digital assets working group has a deadline of six months to submit recommendations on regulatory and legislative proposals to the president surrounding the industry. While Trump previously dismissed crypto as a scam, he’s embraced the industry throughout his most recent campaign.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/trump-announces-us-crypto-reserve/	2025-03-02T12:41:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/trumpdonald_022825gn06_w.jpg?w=900
Why Trump wants 'gold card' to replace EB-5 visa	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump has a new means of making the United States trillions of dollars. The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would be revamping the U.S. investor visa, also known as the EB-5, increasing the funds required to secure the status while dubbing the new option a 'gold card.' 'It's sort of a green card plus, and it's a path to citizenship,' Trump said this week. 'We're going to call it the 'Gold card,' and I think it's going to be very treasured. I think it's going to do very well. And we're going to start selling, hopefully in about two weeks. Now, just so you understand, if we sell a million, right? A million, that's $5 trillion.' Non-citizens can fast-track their visa status and potentially become citizens down the line for a price of $5 million. What is a golden visa, and where can you get one? While President Trump has boasted the new visa would be a boost for the economy, some experts NewsNation spoke with say Congress controls the budget and immigration policy, and so new legislation might need to be passed to overhaul the current program. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says the new gold card would replace the current EB-5 program. The EB-5 visa allows qualified investors to become eligible for green cards if they invest between 800,000 to a million dollars in a commercial enterprise and also create at least 10 jobs. The program began in the 1990s to encourage investments in rural and economically depressed areas. Matt Gordon, CEO of E3IG who advises EB-5 visa applicants, says it would be a mistake to simply replace the program. 'You're talking three, $4 billion a year for rural communities,' he told NewsNation. 'You know, we've done projects which are opioid addiction clinics.' However, Ishaan Akanna of the American Immigrant Investor Alliance, says the gold card could be a brilliant idea if implemented in conjunction with the existing EB5 visa program. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines 'There is an opportunity here to really kind of take this forward,' he said. 'I mean, 'The fact that this administration does and has claimed to support legal immigration. This is a fantastic way to do it.' President Trump said Tuesday that the gold card would not have any requirements for job creation like the EB-5 program has. And while some of the experts NewsNation spoke with argued that fewer people would be willing to pay for this kind of visa if it increases by $5 million. Trump says that Apple or other companies like it, could buy gold visas and then get highly qualified foreign workers in return.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/why-trump-gold-card-replace-eb-5-visa/	2025-03-02T08:56:03-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201498755.jpg?w=900
Elite US border unit trains daily to pursue dangerous intruders	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Border Patrol is known for securing the nation’s border, but the agency includes an elite tactical unit that is less visible. The Border Patrol Tactical Unit, or BORTAC, is comprised of highly trained agents with rapid response capabilities. NewsNation received exclusive access to BORTAC’s training facilities in El Paso, Texas, where these men and women constantly train to apprehend the most dangerous individuals, including cartel operatives, who cross illegally into the United States. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines NewsNation’s Border Correspondent Ali Bradley and Senior National Correspondent Brian Entin will give you an exclusive look at the border crisis in America and how the nation’s three borders — southern, northern and aerial — are kept safe.

'These guys are all invested, they are hand-selected to be here with the national team.' Agents who run through such exercises are striving for 'zero fail' results, explained Chris Voss, the acting commander for the Border Patrol’s Special Operations Group (SOG). At the same time, agents must adjust to changing circumstances, he adds. 'The guys are really good at it. So, it’s something we take very seriously, and we train constantly,' Voss said. The training and selection process for BORTAC agents is modeled on those used for military special forces, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Candidates must train in advanced weapons techniques and 'must demonstrate the ability to function in a team environment under stress and sleep deprivation conditions.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/elite-us-border-unit-pursue-criminals/	2025-03-01T18:07:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/snapshot.jpg?w=900
How the Coast Guard intercepts migrants entering the Florida coas...	(NewsNation) — As the Trump administration clamps down on migrant crossings, the U.S. Coast Guard has been working around the clock to secure America's so-called 'third border': the ocean off the coast of Florida. Coast Guard officers keep a close guard by flying over the coast south toward Cuba and over the Bahamas, which is a hotbed for migrant activity. NewsNation's Border Correspondent Ali Bradley and Senior National Correspondent Brian Entin will give you an exclusive look at the border crisis in America and how the nation's three borders — southern, northern and aerial — are kept safe.

Alleged smuggler extradited to US preyed on Asian, African migrants 'We are looking for a number of different things. Vessels moving in a certain direction. If they are moving southbound, that may not be an indicator. If they are moving northbound, it might give us an indication we should probably take a look,' Coast Guard Lt. Bryce Monaco tells NewsNation. 'There are also a lot of people, 20 to 30, maybe even hundreds of people. These are all indicators of what we are looking at.' When officers spot migrants, they dispatch Coast Guard cutters to intervene. The Coast Guard interdicted several migrants attempting to use the Florida coast as an inroad into the country. This includes 31 migrants packed onto a small fishing boat and two dozen Chinese migrants hiding in an engine compartment, according to the agency. While many migrants hail from nearby Cuba and Haiti, there is also a large number that come from as far as China, Coast Guard officers told NewsNation. Cartel luring chemistry students to make fentanyl: Report 'Well, we have had an 8000% increase in the number of Chinese migrants caught on the Florida coast,' Republican Florida Rep. Carlos Gimenez said. 'That is just going to increase because as enforcement becomes harder and tougher to get into the southern border, you are going to see more and more Chinese and other migrants trying to flow into Florida.' However, migrant ocean crossings are not just on the East Coast of the United States. The Coast Guard also spotted 20 migrants on a small boat 21 miles off the coast of California. 'We advise anyone that may think they want to enter the U.S. illegally. Not only are these venues illegal, but they are quite dangerous … and please do not trust these transnational organizations. These smugglers do not care about you,' Eric Rodriguez with the Coast Guard said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/coast-guard-migrants-florida-coast/	2025-03-01T17:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/GettyImages-1410153211.jpg?w=900
Texas troopers, US Border Patrol team up to squash smuggling	(NewsNation) — Patrolling the United States’ southern border remains a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week job. That is especially true in areas along the border that are used by smugglers and immigrants who enter the United States illegally to hide from U.S. border agents and other immigration officials. NewsNation's Border Correspondent Ali Bradley and Senior National Correspondent Brian Entin will give you an exclusive look at the border crisis in America and how the nation's three borders — southern, northern and aerial — are kept safe.

Use our Channel Finder here. Mexico extradites cartel figures to US amid Trump tariffs threat NewsNation was given the opportunity to ride along with troopers from the Texas Department of Public Safety along the Rio Grande Valley. The area has seen an uptick in migrants entering the United States illegally and smugglers who are looking to cash in and move people and illegal drugs across the border into the United States. Texas DPS says that smuggling networks are adapting faster, and they are making millions in the process. Even as the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally declines, Texas DPS officials are seeing a small surge in smuggling activity in the Rio Grande Valley. However, as officials try to manage that surge, one agency cannot do it alone. Texas DPS partners with U.S. Border Patrol agents and members of the Texas National Guard to try and track migrants that immigration officials characterize as 'gotaways'. In most cases, the Texas DPS works to determine if it can file state charges against those they encounter and charge them with smuggling people across the border. In other cases, U.S. Border Patrol officials file federal charges for human smuggling. Cartel that killed family should be called terror group: Relative The agencies also work together to stop the flow of illegal drugs being moved across the U.S.-Mexico border. As the effort continues to try to locate and apprehend smugglers, smuggling groups in Mexico are moving in smaller groups, searching for areas that are not being patrolled. Working in conjunction with other agencies like the U.S Border Patrol, Texas DPS relies on tools like drones to monitor what is happening on the ground along the border. 'It’s really a team effort,' Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Guadalupe Cazarez told NewsNation. 'The majority of time, our (Border Patrol) agents are processing individuals, and that’s where we come in. We try to cover that gap so that these people do not get across (the border).'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-border-patrol-team-smuggling/	2025-03-01T17:00:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Texas-DPS-car-door-1.jpg?w=876
Extradition of 29 cartel leaders shows Mexico 'can do more'	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – The extradition from Mexico of 29 drug suspects on Thursday had a special meaning for the family of an American hero, former U.S. Marshal Robert Almonte says. That’s because one of the individuals walking off the extradition flight was Rafael Caro Quintero. He was the man who allegedly ordered the abduction, torture and murder of former Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena in Guadalajara in 1985, Almonte said. Mexico sends drug lord Caro Quintero and 28 others to the US as officials meet with Trump team The slaying shocked the American public and exposed the brutality and impunity traffickers seemingly enjoy south of the border. In this March 8, 1985, file photo, U.S. Marine Corps pallbearers carry the casket holding the body of slain U.S. Drug Enforcement agent Enrique Camarena Salazar after it arrived at North Island Naval Air Station, in San Diego. Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero was only ever sentenced in Mexico for the killing of Camarena and Mexican pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar in 1985, but his gang apparently killed as many as six U.S. citizens in the western city of Guadalajara around the same time. (AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi, File) 'He did a tremendous job locating large marijuana fields and eradicating the marijuana fields with the help of a Mexican pilot,' said Almonte, who also worked as an undercover narcotics detective and is a former deputy chief of the El Paso Police Department. 'The Guadalajara cartel was very upset with Kiki Camarena because he was doing such a great job. So, Caro Quintero ordered the abduction of Kiki Camarena in broad daylight.' Forty years after the murder of US Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena, Mexico agreed to the extradition of the drug lord who allegedly had him killed. (DEA) The drug lord allegedly had the DEA agent brought to a house in the outskirts of Guadalajara. He was tortured nonstop for 36 hours until Caro Quintero allegedly had his men finish him off with a tire iron to the head. Drug lord Caro Quintero to be arraigned in NYC after being transferred from Mexico Trying to pass off the American agent and his pilot as merely missing did not work for Caro Quintero and the other leaders of the Guadalajara cartel – Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. The 29 extradited ‘narcos’ from Mexico President Ronald Reagan ordered a shut down of the U.S.-Mexico border, impatient with Camarena not being found, Almonte said. The body was located a month after the agent disappeared and was eventually returned to his family. Caro Quintero ended up in a Mexican jail through 2017. Students in Camarena’s native Calexico, California, began wearing a red ribbon to remember the agent. Three years later, Ronald and Nancy Reagan chaired the first national Red Ribbon Week to educate the country’s youth to the dangers of consuming illegal drugs. Terror designation might prompt cartels to target Americans, expert says 'Yesterday was a great day, especially for the Camarena family. They are finally seeing some long overdue justice' with Caro Quintero’s extradition, said Almonte, who keeps in touch with the Camarenas. 'He was, no doubt, a hero.' Caro Quintero on Friday made his first appearance in front of a federal judge in Brooklyn on multiple drug and weapons charges. ‘Mexico could do more' if it wanted to The extradition of Caro Quintero, two brothers who led the Zetas drug cartel, Fonseca’s nephew Vicente Carrillo Fuentes of the Juarez cartel and 25 others came amid President Donald Trump’s threat of imposing a 25% tariff on Mexican imports. Trump says Mexico can do more to stem the flow of migrants and illicit drugs like the deadly fentanyl to the United States. Almonte agrees, at least with the part about the drugs. Border Report Live: US steps up fight against cartels 'In order to eliminate the cartels, the Mexican government has to address something that is the driving force behind the cartels’ existence, and that is the corruption,' Almonte said. 'The corruption from the lowest levels of Mexican law enforcement all the way to state, military and even high-ranking officials. Not until Mexico tries to change the culture of corruption can anything change. 'Don’t get me wrong, we have our own issues with corruption here in the United States, but nowhere near to the extent they have the problem of corruption in Mexico.' Sinaloa cartel boss ‘Neon’ extradited to US, indicted along with ‘El Chapo’ Earlier this month in El Paso, federal officials arrested a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer for allegedly conspiring with a Mexican drug cartel to smuggle migrants and allow drugs to come into the country. In 2023, a U.S. Border Patrol agent in El Paso was arrested for allegedly offering to get a Salvadoran woman 'papers' in exchange for $5,000. Almonte laments that it takes threats from U.S. presidents – Reagan in 1985, Trump in 2025 – for drug lords south of the border to be arrested or extradited. He says the two governments should sit at the table and agree in good faith to go after criminals that are poisoning so many people north of the Rio Grande and killing thousands south of the border. 'We need to go after these cartels, and what’s disappointing to me is that the first thing (the Mexican government) says is 'We're a sovereign national, you can't come, you can't do anything in our country.' How about not saying that and just working together to go after the cartels and eliminate them,' Almonte said. 'Let's go after these cartels, let's eliminate them to make things better for the people in Mexico and in the United States.' Severed head, death threat prompt Tijuana’s Grupo Firme to cancel Mazatlán concert U.S. law allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty in the case of drug lords who commit or order murders while conducting organized criminal activities. But Mexico does not have a death penalty and does not allow the extradition of its citizens if they face such a punishment. Almonte believes the U.S. won't try to execute Caro Quintero but will try to ensure he will spend the rest of his life in an American prison. Border Report Live: US, Mexico put pressure on drug cartels He also opined the Trump administration will not directly attack cartel leaders even after designating them as Foreign Terrorist Organizations because he wants Mexico's cooperation. When asked what's changed in the Mexican drug trafficking scene since Camarena's killing, Almonte said cartels have multiplied and become much more brutal, if that was possible. Visit the BorderReport.com homepage for the latest exclusive stories and breaking news about issues along the U.S.-Mexico border 'They are extremely brutal killing each other off. But not only that. If you’re their enemy, if you cross them, they’re not just going to kill you, they’re going to torture you -- a horrible torture -- and then they’re going to kill you,' he said. 'And then they like to post these videos online as a warning to anybody who’s going to mess with them. You don’t want to mess with them because this is going to happen to you.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/extradition-of-29-cartel-leaders-shows-mexico-can-do-more/	2025-03-01T15:20:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/caro-quitero-2.png?w=897
Zelenskyy embraced by British prime minister a day after White Ho...	LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer embraced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday and told him he had the U.K.'s unwavering support, a day after the blowout at the White House with President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy arrived to cheers from people who had gathered outside of 10 Downing St., where Starmer gave him a hug and ushered him inside. The two leaders met on the eve of a meeting of European leaders in London. Called to discuss how European nations can defend Ukraine — and themselves — if the U.S. withdraws support, it has taken on new urgency following Trump's televised berating of Zelenskyy. 'And as you heard from the cheers on the street outside, you have full backing across the United Kingdom,' Starmer told the leader of the war-torn country. 'We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take.' Zelenskyy thanked him and the people of the U.K. for their support and friendship. After the meeting, Britain announced it was extending a 2.26 billion pound ($2.84 billion) loan to Kyiv for military procurement, with the money coming from the profits on frozen Russian assets. It's Britain's contribution to a $50 billion package of support pledged by the G-7 group of wealthy industrialized nations. Zelenskyy thanked Britain in a statement on X, saying: 'This is true justice – the one who started the war must be the one to pay.' Starmer spoke to both Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday evening after meeting Zelenskyy, the prime minister's office said. The meeting comes the day after an extraordinary diplomatic meltdown when Trump and Vice President JD Vance blasted Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on live television for not being grateful enough for U.S. support. Zelenskyy had been poised to ink a deal to give the U.S. access to mineral riches as Trump pressures Ukraine to reach a deal to end the war with Russia. But he left town without signing anything. Zelenskyy had been scheduled to meet with Starmer on Sunday before the European summit, but the timetable for their bilateral meeting was apparently sped up in the aftermath of the Washington visit.

Pentagon sending 3,000 troops to southern border: Report	(NewsNation) — The Pentagon has ordered up to 3,000 active-duty troops to the southern border as it looks to increase the United States' border sovereignty. According to the Washington Post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the orders Friday, with 2,500 to 3,000 set to be deployed, alongside Stryker combat vehicles, weighing up to 20 tons. In January, the Pentagon sent up to 1,500 active-duty troops to the border, which already had approximately 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces on hand. Crisis at the Border: On the Frontlines Per the Post, the Pentagon would largely be sending soldiers specializing in the public affairs, intelligence, and engineering sectors. They would also be joined by soldiers part of the 4th Infantry Division’s 2nd Stryker Brigade at Fort Carson, Colorado. Mexican National Guard troops are currently patrolling the border in the Tijuana area as part of Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum's pledge amid tariff negotiations with President Trump. In an hour-long special airing at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday, NewsNation will go in-depth on the state of the situation at the border – what’s working, what’s not and why law enforcement on the frontlines say they aren’t letting their guard down.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/pentagon-sending-3000-troops-southern-border/	2025-03-01T10:33:53-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/GettyImages-2197688179.jpg?w=900
Andrew Cuomo announces he’s running for NYC mayor	Editor’s Note: The video above originally aired on Feb. 7 NEW YORK CITY (PIX11) – Andrew Cuomo announced he’s running for New York City mayor in the upcoming election after months of speculation. The former New York governor will take on incumbent Mayor Eric Adams in the Democratic primary. 'We know that today our New York City is in trouble,' Cuomo said in a 17-minute announcement video posted to social media. 'These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders, or more precisely, the lack of intelligent action by many of our political leaders,' he continued. Before Cuomo entered the race, many polls showed him as an early favorite for New York City voters. A February poll by PIX11 News, Emerson College and The Hill showed Cuomo was the first choice for 33% of Democratic voters. Some 10% of voters said Adams was their first choice for mayor. Cuomo served as New York governor from 2011 to 2021, when he resigned after an independent investigation found he had sexually harassed multiple women, including state employees. His resignation also came on the heels of criticism and investigations related to his handling of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 'New York tough means New York loving, and I love New York and I love you,' Cuomo said at the time of his resignation. 'I would never want to be unhelpful in any way, and I think given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing.' He joins an already crowded pool of candidates for the June 24 primary, including Adams, City Comptroller Brad Lander, State Senators Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, State Assemblymembers Zohran Mamdani and Michael Blake and hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson. Some of the candidates, like Lander, have already taken aim at Cuomo. But Adams has been more measured in anticipation of Cuomo's candidacy. 'There's a lot of time ‘til June,' Adams said just ahead of petitions to get on the ballot being circulated in late February. 'I've talked before about Andrew Yang leading me by double digits in February [last election] and we saw what happened. We're not calling Andrew Yang mayor, we're saying Eric Adams is mayor.' Cuomo began pondering a political comeback less than a year after his resignation, as several of the more serious sexual harassment claims against him did not turn into criminal charges. And, he’s already secured the endorsement of Bronx Congressman Ritchie Torres, who said he is not interested in 'relitigating' the sexual harassment scandal in the upcoming election. 'I represent a working-class district, largely African-American and Latinos, and Andrew Cuomo has immense popularity and credibility with the people I represent, so I’m representing the preferences of the people of the Bronx,' he said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/andrew-cuomo-announces-hes-running-for-nyc-mayor/	2025-03-01T09:52:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/65b44340e0ffe9.21227874.jpeg?w=900

Proposed registry is Trump tool to criminalize migration, advocat...	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – President Trump vowed during his campaign to deport all criminal immigrants to make American communities safer. Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members have been apprehended at the border and some caught committing crimes in the interior of the country are being prosecuted. However, immigration advocates say most individuals illegally present in the country are not criminals. Their status may change if the Trump administration goes through with a proposed rule to criminally charge undocumented individuals who fail to register and allow themselves to be fingerprinted by the federal government. 'The administration is giving itself another tool to use against many immigrants, particularly the threat of criminal prosecution,' said Nayna Gupta, director of policy at the American Immigration Council. 'This will force those who came in without inspection and have had no contact with the government for years a very hard choice. They either register as required and be subject to removal or not registering to avoid mass deportation but then be subjected to criminal prosecution.' Critics blast new ‘report to deport’ order by DHS Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week announced the administration will enforce a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act compelling undocumented immigrants to leave the country voluntarily or else register with the government. Failure to register could result in a fine and jail time, she said. The publication of an administrative rule is pending. DHS urges undocumented immigrants to leave or they’ll ‘never return’ if deported On Friday, immigrant advocates said the registry paves the way for Trump to say he’s deporting criminals. 'It’s not a crime to be in the U.S. without authorization. The only people who, by virtue of their presence here are committing a crime, are folks who have been deported and came back,' said David Leopold, former president and general council of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. 'This registration is nothing but a hoax and a pretext to bootstrap criminal liability on folks who are hardworking.' A practicing immigration attorney, Leopold said he’s seeing fear not only in the undocumented community but also among those who have legal immigration status, as they could be in violation of regulations for not carrying their documents. Also, when Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) goes to apprehend criminals, they could come across other undocumented. He calls this collateral damage. 'What is a collateral? It’s a grandmother sitting on her porch when ICE comes to do an arrest. It’s someone worked all day at a meat packing plant or in the fields, comes home and ICE happens to be next door,' he said. Ocasio-Cortez asks DOJ: Am I under investigation? The advocates called on immigrants lawfully here or not to be aware of their constitutional rights. 'For first time I’m giving ‘Know Your Rights’ presentations to major boards of huge healthcare systems and also to the nonprofit community.' Leopold said. 'If we put it all together, it begins to resemble something that is not an open American cultural democracy; it becomes closer to a police state.' Visit the BorderReport.com homepage for the latest exclusive stories and breaking news about issues along the U.S.-Mexico border The advocates also expressed skepticism that immigrants faced with the dilemma of the new registration rule will opt for self-deportation. Most have been in the United States for 15 years or more and are part of 'mixed status' households with U.S.-born children or partners.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/proposed-registry-is-trump-tool-to-criminalize-migration-advocates-say/	2025-03-01T08:11:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2195569259-e1738860863526_d5f0b6.jpg?w=800
FedEx plane makes emergency landing after bird strike	(NewsNation) — A FedEx cargo plane caught fire and had to make an emergency landing at Newark Liberty International Airport. It temporarily halted traffic for around an hour after the landing occurred at 8 a.m. ET. Social media footage showed a fire on the underside of the plane as it came to land at the airport. No one was injured. Recent aviation disasters and close calls stoke fears about the safety of flying 'FedEx Flight 3609 from Newark to Indianapolis experienced a bird strike during takeoff,' a FedEx spokesperson said in a statement. 'Our crew declared an emergency and returned safely to Newark. We are thankful for the quick actions of our crew and first responders.' It follows several aviation incidents in recent weeks, most recently including a United Airlines flight making an emergency landing at Newark and smoke being reported on a Delta flight from Atlanta.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/fedex-plane-emergency-landing-bird-strike/	2025-03-01T07:38:06-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2023/10/6532f8bfbd6bf3.40405505.jpeg?w=900
Ukrainian president thanks Trump, US on X day after heated meetin...	(NewsNation) — The day after a contentious back-and-forth in the Oval Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly thanked President Donald Trump and the U.S. for its support during the three-year war. 'We are very grateful to the United States for all the support. I’m thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion,' Zelenskyy wrote on X Saturday morning. In a series of 14 posts, Zelenskyy went on to say his country's survival is in part thanks to America's help. 'America’s help has been vital in helping us survive, and I want to acknowledge that. Despite the tough dialogue, we remain strategic partners,' Zelenskyy wrote. EU’s top diplomat: ‘The free world needs a new leader’ Last week, Trump called the Ukrainian president a 'dictator without elections.' The two met Friday to discuss a deal that would give the U.S. revenue from rare earth minerals, but after a heated exchange, they canceled a joint press conference and a planned lunch. The two world leaders were also to explore the possibility of a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine with Russia. At one point, Trump raised his voice, saying, 'You’re gambling with WWIII.' Following the shouting match, Zelenskyy was told to leave by the president and other senior officials. Ukrainians won’t stop fighting, even if US pulls support: Veteran 'It’s crucial for us to have President Trump’s support. He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do,' Zelenskyy said on X. 'We are the ones living this war in Ukraine. It’s a fight for our freedom, for our very survival.' Zelenskyy said the country is ready to sign the minerals deal and to achieve peace, but it can't happen without assurance. 'Peace can only come when we know we have security guarantees, when our army is strong, and our partners are with us … but we can’t just stop fighting and not having guarantees that Putin will not return tomorrow.' 'Unprepared' Zelenskyy fumbled Trump meeting, Sean Spicer said He ended the social media thread by saying, 'We want only strong relations with America, and I really hope we will have them.' 'Insolent pig': European leaders chime in Other world leaders chimed in online on Friday. 'The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,' Russian politician Dmitry Medvedev said of Trump. The European Union's top leader, Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas, said, 'Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.' Also showing solidarity with Ukraine following the exchange were leaders of Poland, Spain, Moldova, Sweden, Latvia, Norway, Czechia, Germany and the Netherlands.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/zelenskyy-thanks-trump-on-x-day-after-heated-meeting/	2025-03-01T05:51:58-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201827238.jpg?w=900
Border czar makes the city of Boston his latest immigration targe...	BOSTON (AP) — As Mayor Michelle Wu prepares to go to Congress to defend Boston's protections of immigrant communities, the city is in a war of words with the Trump administration and Republican representatives over how much police should support deportations. President Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan teed off against Boston's police commissioner in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying there are at least nine accused 'child rapists' in jail who local authorities won't turn over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He promised to come to Boston and 'bring hell with him.' ICE public affairs didn't respond to a request for information about these cases, and Homan didn't elaborate on any travel plans. Boston isn't alone: ICE has accused state and local authorities around the country of failing to cooperate to get people charged with violent crimes deported. At Wednesday's hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Wu will be joined by the mayors of Chicago, New York and Denver, all caught in the crosshairs of what it means to be a 'sanctuary city.' A clash between federal, state and local laws ICE is empowered to enforce immigration laws nationwide but needs help from state and local authorities to achieve deportations on a large scale. It asks police and sheriffs to alert them to certain people it wants to deport and to hold them for up to 48 hours so that immigration officers have time to arrive and take custody. Sanctuary cities limit such cooperation when it involves people accused but not yet convicted of crimes, following state or local laws that prohibit turning people over to ICE merely for lacking legal permission to be in the country. 'If someone’s committed a serious offense, our position is that we want to hold them accountable,' Sussex County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said. 'What you want to do with their immigration consequences or deportation, if any, after we hold them accountable, that’s up to the federal government. That’s up to ICE.' Handing over defendants would make it harder to gain cooperation from immigrants when investigating crimes, and fail to deliver justice for the victims, Hayden argued. Will deporting defendants and witnesses make cities safer? 'We don’t want people’s fear of immigration consequences of a deportation to have a chilling effect on our ability to hold people accountable,' Hayden said. 'Even in this modern day, where we have phones and cameras and recordings and everything, we still need victims and witnesses and people to come in and testify and tell their story in order to prove a case.' Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox told WCVB-TV that police don't have authority to enforce federal immigration laws or hand over people just because they're in the country illegally — their immigration status isn't 'relevant to public safety,' he said. The Boston Trust Act, updated in 2018, allows police to cooperate with ICE on 'significant public safety, such as human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking, and cybercrimes, while refraining from involvement in civil immigration enforcement.' The city also must follow a 2017 ruling by the state's highest court, which forbids Massachusetts authorities from holding a person otherwise entitled to release from custody based solely on a federal request. How have leaders responded to the pressure? Wu, a Democrat up for reelection this year, said it was 'clueless' and 'insulting' for Homan to attack the commissioner, and that she wants Boston be a welcoming place for immigrants. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Homan's comments 'unproductive' and 'not how you engage as a member of law enforcement.' Hayden said he would welcome a 'civil conversation' about immigration but 'if you want to bring hell with you, don't bother coming. Hell is not welcome here in Boston.' Faith leaders met with the mayor and said members of their congregations now fear going to a food pantry or answering their door to receive donations. 'The fear is not for just those who are undocumented, and that’s one of the realities that we hope those in Washington will hear,' Arlene Hall, a native of Jamaica and a minister at the Deliverance Temple Worship Center in Dorchester, told reporters. 'The fear is much deeper and wider because of what is being done.' Wu's mayoral opponent, Democrat Josh Kraft, said in a statement that he supports 'removing violent criminals' but opposes mass deportations and Homan's 'inflammatory rhetoric about a city he does not know.' What could happen to cities that don't comply? An ominous video from the Republican-led committee portrays Wu and several other big city mayors as villains, with Kentucky GOP Rep. James Comer saying: 'If they are going to continue to disobey the law, then I think we should cut as much of their federal funding as we can cut.' The Trump administration has begun taking legal action, accusing Illinois, Chicago and Cook County of violating federal law by not cooperating. Lawmakers in more than 20 states are pursuing legislation against so-called sanctuary cities, The Associated Press found using the bill-tracking software Plural. And some of those communities are striking back: The Boston suburbs of Chelsea and Somerville filed suit accusing the Trump administration of violating their constitutional rights.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/ap-border-czar-makes-boston-his-latest-immigration-punching-bag/	2025-03-01T05:31:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/67c309e23d2bd8.40670527.jpeg?w=900
Pope rests after setback in recovery — a bronchial spasm requirin...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis was resting Saturday after an alarming setback in his two-week recovery from double pneumonia: Doctors had to put him on noninvasive mechanical ventilation following a coughing fit in which he inhaled vomit that needed to then be extracted. Doctors said it would take a day or two to evaluate how and if the episode impacted Francis’ overall clinical condition. His prognosis remained guarded, meaning he wasn’t out of danger. In its brief morning update Saturday, the Vatican said: 'The night has passed quietly, the pope is resting.' In the late Friday update, the Vatican said the 88-year-old suffered an 'isolated crisis of bronchial spasm,' a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit, that resulted in a 'sudden worsening of the respiratory picture.' Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange and was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said. The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome’s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs. Doctors say the episode is alarming The Vatican said the episode was different to the prolonged respiratory crisis on Feb. 22, in that it was an isolated spasm that resulted in Francis aspirating the vomit that he produced. Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episode as relayed by the Vatican was alarming and underscored Francis’ fragility and that his condition 'can turn very quickly.' 'I think this is extremely concerning, given the fact that the pope has been in the hospital now for over two weeks, and now he’s continuing to have these respiratory events and now had this aspiration event that is requiring even higher levels of support,' he told The Associated Press. 'So given his age and his fragile state and his previous lung resection, this is very concerning,' added Coleman, who is not involved in Francis’ care. Dr. William Feldman, a pulmonary specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said it was a good sign that the pope remained alert and oriented during the episode, but concurred that it marked 'a worrying turn.' 'Often we will use noninvasive ventilation as a way of trying to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation,' Feldman said. Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient’s blood gas levels improve so they can eventually go back to using oxygen alone. Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in 'critical condition,' which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they say he isn’t out of danger, given the complexity of his case. Prayers continued to pour in Late on Friday, Francis’ closest friend in the Vatican bureaucracy, Argentine Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, led the nightly prayer in St. Peter’s Square to pray for Francis’ health. With other cardinals bundled against the night chill, Fernández urged the crowd to pray not just for Francis but for others, as the pope himself would. 'Certainly it is close to the Holy Father’s heart that our prayer is not only for him, but also for all those who in this particular dramatic and suffering moment of the world bear the hard burden of war, of sickness, of poverty,' said Fernández, the Vatican’s doctrine chief. Also Friday, the Vatican published a document signed by Francis on Feb. 26 'From the Gemelli Polyclinic,' a new official tagline that showed Francis was still working from the hospital. ___ Carla K.

Sean Penn: Zelenskyy-Trump fight shouldn't eclipse Russia's crime...	(NewsNation) — American actor and director Sean Penn hopes the 'chaos' seen in Friday’s Oval Office exchange between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy won't create further division between the nations. 'Remember where we really stand, and what this is really about,' Penn implored on Friday's 'CUOMO.' He points to the people dying on the front lines in Ukraine each day, 'dying honoring the very thing we honor most, which is freedom,' and urges citizens to see through the politicians' 'personality chaos.' Graham: Trump, Zelenskyy meeting an ‘absolute, utter disaster’ On Friday, the pair of presidents met to discuss a mineral deal and the future of American aid to Ukraine. But the leaders' conversation, with some interjections from Vice President JD Vance, quickly turned sour. Trump told Zelenskyy, 'You’re not really in a good position right now' and said the leader was 'gambling with WWIII.' On X, Zelenskyy said what his country needs is peace. 'Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,' he said.

Gene Hackman, wife tested negative for carbon monoxide: Sheriff	(NewsNation) — Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, 95, and his 63-year-old wife, Betsy Arakawa, tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning and showed no external trauma, preliminary investigation results show. Hackman's pacemaker data revealed the actor's last event was on Feb. 17, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday, adding that it is a 'very good assumption' Hackman was deceased for at least 10 days. Hackman, Arakawa and their dog were all found dead at their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home on Wednesday. Gene Hackman’s death is strange: Steve Wilkos | Morning in America Authorities believe they may have been dead for some time; the cause of death has yet to be revealed. Toxicology and autopsy reports are pending, Mendoza said. Officials collected the following for 'evidentiary' purposes: Two green cellphones Two bottles of medication One bottle of OTC Tylenol Medical records 2025 monthly planner calendar Authorities reiterated Friday that there was no foul play suspected in the couple's deaths, though an earlier search warrant stated that the situation was 'suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.' Hackman's body was found in the home's entryway, and Arakawa was dead next to a space heater in a bathroom. Pills were scattered next to an open prescription bottle on the bathroom counter, according to a search warrant, The Associated Press reports.

Zelenskyy thanks Trump for visit after Oval Office clash	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked President Trump for hosting his visit to the United States on Friday despite the two leaders’ clash in the Oval Office, which led to the cancelation of further talks and a White House press conference. Zelenskyy’s post on X after the meeting thanked Trump, 'Congress, and the American people.' 'Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,' he said. But the post came after Trump called off negotiations with Zelenskyy on ending the war between Ukraine and Russia following the heated Oval Office exchange over U.S. support. The meeting, which also featured Vice President Vance, began cordially, but tensions escalated after Vance suggested a diplomatic solution could be reached with Russia to end the war. Watch full Trump, Zelenskyy exchange: ‘You’re gambling with WWIII’ Zelenskyy pointed to years of Russian President Vladimir Putin seeking to take Ukrainian territory and violating ceasefires. Vance argued that Zelenskyy had been ungrateful for U.S. support, and Trump told Zelenskyy that he is not in a position to have much leverage in talks. After the meeting, Trump posted on Truth Social that Zelenskyy is 'not ready for Peace' and that he 'disrespected' the U.S. in the Oval Office. 'He can come back when he is ready for peace,' Trump said. The two leaders had been scheduled to take part in a joint press conference and sign a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine’s supply of critical minerals. Thune says Senate will consider bill to restrict trans athletes ‘early next week’ The deal was not signed. Trump has alarmed allies and lawmakers from both parties by slamming Zelenskyy in recent weeks, calling him a 'dictator' and accusing him of doing a 'terrible job' as president of Ukraine. He also suggested Zelenskyy was responsible for starting the war, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion in 2022. But Trump had appeared to walk back his comments during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in response to a reporter’s question about if he still believed Zelenskyy was a dictator. 'Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that. Next question,' Trump said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/zelenskyy-thanks-trump-visit-clash/	2025-02-28T13:34:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25059677855899-e1740768713352.jpg?w=900
Thune says Senate will consider bill to restrict trans athletes '...	Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) says legislation to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports will go to the Senate floor 'early next week,' potentially fast-tracking a bill on an issue Republicans and President Trump made central to their campaigns. The Republican-led House approved Rep. Greg Steube’s (R-Fla.) Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in January with the help of two Texas Democrats. If the Senate, where Republicans also have the majority, votes to pass the bill, it will head to Trump’s desk, where it is almost certain to be signed into law. 'We’re going to put that on the floor early next week,' Thune said Thursday, appearing on the 'Ruthless' podcast. 'It’s an issue the House has voted on, and the president issued an executive order. What this would do is codify the executive order.' Trump’s Feb. 5 executive order aims to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports nationwide and directs the Justice Department to take immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations that allow trans student-athletes to participate in line with their gender identity. Attorney General Pam Bondi warned officials in Maine, California and Minnesota this week to comply with Trump’s order, and the Education Department opened several investigations into states, school districts and athletic associations that have refused to enforce the restrictions. The bill before the Senate next week seeks to amend Title IX, the federal civil rights law against sex discrimination, to prohibit schools from allowing transgender students to compete in athletic events 'designated for women or girls.' Similar to another Trump executive order, it defines sex as 'based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.' 'It’s unfortunate that it’s something that needs to be codified, but we’re going to make sure that the president’s EO endures over time,' Thune said Thursday, the same day he scheduled a procedural vote on the bill for Monday evening. 'My assumption is we’ll get a lot of resistance, obviously, from the Democrats,' he added. 'Clearly, there are partisan issues in our times and things that we deal with legislatively, which create sort of the deep political divide that we have, but this one, to me, it just seems like it’s common sense.' The question of whether to restrict or ban trans athletes from girls’ and women’s sports has been a politically fraught one for Democrats, who were left surprisingly flat-footed by Republican campaign ads last cycle asserting they supported 'men' in girls’ sports. Some Democrats blamed the party’s November election losses on its support for transgender rights, though voters in most exit polls said issues related to the economy and immigration drove their decision at the ballot box. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that Americans have grown more supportive of policies restricting transgender rights, including ones that require athletes to compete on sports teams that match their birth sex. The number of transgender students participating in school sports is unclear. In September, the National Federation of State High School Associations, which does not report how many student-athletes are transgender, said more than 8 million students competed in high school sports last year. Karissa Niehoff, the organization’s CEO, told The Hill an openly trans athlete has never set a national record. Charlie Baker, president of the NCAA, which barred transgender athletes from competing in women’s college sports following Trump’s executive order, told a Senate panel in December that he is aware of fewer than 10 transgender NCAA athletes. Opponents of policies that prevent trans athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports have said such restrictions will inevitably fuel speculation about whether female athletes, transgender or not, look feminine enough to compete in women’s sports without facing questions about their gender. 'Although the authors of the legislation represent themselves as serving the interests of cisgender girls and women, this legislation does not address the longstanding barriers all girls and women have faced in their pursuit of athletics,' more than 400 civil rights groups, including Advocates for Trans Equality and the Human Rights Campaign, wrote last month in a letter to Congress. 'You can sit at your desk and sign a piece of paper and make trans people’s life far more difficult than necessary but you will NEVER erase us or our joy,' middle-distance runner Nikki Hiltz, who is trans and nonbinary, wrote in an Instagram story after Trump signed the executive order on trans athletes.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/thune-says-senate-will-consider-bill-to-restrict-trans-athletes-early-next-week/	2025-02-28T12:56:48-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/thunejohn_020425gn09_w_b4639a.jpg?w=900
Zelenskyy 'weakened his hand' post tense Trump exchange: Sean Spi...	(NewsNation) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lacked diplomacy and preparation in a tense meeting with President Donald Trump, which will undoubtedly hurt him in the war against Russia, Trump’s former press secretary said. 'It went off the rails quick,' NewsNation political contributor and former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said. 'You don't come into somebody's house asking for something and then let it go off like this.' Spicer, who was a part of Trump’s first administration, attributed Zelenskyy’s demeanor during his meeting with Trump to a lack of 'preparation' and understanding of 'diplomacy.' Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday after calling his Ukrainian counterpart a 'dictator without elections' last week — and the two canceled a joint press conference after a heated exchange at a photo opportunity in the Oval Office. During the meeting, Zelenskyy told Trump that promises of peace from Vladimir Putin can’t be trusted, noting the Russian leader’s history of broken promises. Trump said Putin hasn’t broken agreements with him. Trump said Zelenskyy isn’t acting 'at all grateful' for the aid given to Ukraine from the United States for the war with Russia. Watch full Trump, Zelenskyy exchange: ‘You’re gambling with WWII At one point, Trump, raising his voice, said to Zelenskyy, 'You’re not really in a good position right now.' 'You’re gambling with WWIII,' Trump said. Vice President J.D. Vance, who was at the photo op, said it was time to try something different than what Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.

'Have you said thank you once?' Vance asked Zelenskyy.

Spicer said the interaction 'doesn't bode well before an end to this conflict.' 'Zelenskyy has lost the upper hand that he might have had in the deal,' he said, adding that the Ukraine leader should have been more thankful to Trump and the support the U.S has given the country.

Pope had coughing fit, inhaled vomit and his prognosis remains gu...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis suffered an isolated coughing fit on Friday that resulted in him inhaling vomit, requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation, the Vatican said in relaying a setback in his two-week long battle against double pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange and was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said. The development marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome’s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, resulted in a 'sudden worsening of the respiratory picture.' Doctors decided to keep Francis' prognosis as guarded and indicated they needed 24-48 hours to evaluate how and if the episode has impacted his overall clinical condition. The episode, which doctors described as an 'isolated crisis of bronchial spasm' was a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit. The longer respiratory crisis Francis suffered on Feb. 22 was a crisis in actually breathing, the Vatican said. Doctors did not resume referring to Francis in 'critical condition,' which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they have been cautious in declaring him out of danger entirely, given the complexity of his case. The Vatican has already made alternative plans for Ash Wednesday next week, making clear Francis still had a long road ahead. Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, a Vatican official and former vicar of Rome, will preside over the March 5 ceremony and procession that inaugurates the church's solemn Lenten season leading up to Easter in April. Earlier Friday, Francis had spent the morning alternating high flows of supplemental oxygen with a mask and praying in the chapel. He had breakfast, read the day's newspapers and was receiving respiratory physiotherapy, the Vatican said. The Vatican also published a document signed by Francis on Feb. 26 'From the Gemelli Polyclinic,' a new tagline that showed Francis was still working from the hospital. Prayers continued to pour i n In Mexico City, a few dozen people gathered Thursday night at the cathedral to pray for Francis’ recovery. 'He is like part of the family,' said Araceli Gutiérrez, who treasures the time she saw the pope during his trip to the country of nearly 100 million Catholics in 2016. 'That’s why we feel so concerned for him.' María Teresa Sánchez, who was visiting from Colombia with her sister, said that she has always felt close to Francis — the first Latin American pope. 'That’s like having a relative within the higher-ups, with God,' she said. 'He has done so much for religion; he’s such a humble person.' Upcoming calendar in question Given his continued hospitalization, Francis’ near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican canceled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. With Ash Wednesday now delegated to a cardinal, the next major events come during Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20. In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he curbed his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, an inspiration for young Catholics. Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity’s first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in Iznik, Turkey, to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn’t confirmed the trip. ___ Maria Hernandez contributed from Mexico City. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Biden faced 'firing squad' in reelection bid: Karine Jean-Pierre	(NewsNation) — Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shared insights about her final year in the role, reflecting on the challenges of representing former President Joe Biden during the last weeks of his reelection campaign. She criticized Democratic leaders for undermining Biden’s bid for a second term, calling it a betrayal of a 'true patriot.' Speaking at an event at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University, Jean-Pierre was asked about her experience in the three weeks leading up to Biden’s decision to drop out. She emphasized her full support for whatever choice Biden made, stating, 'It was truly his decision, and I supported that 100%.' Watch the full heated exchange between Trump, Vance, Zelenskyy Jean-Pierre emphasized that the hardest part of that period came from within the Democratic Party itself. She described it as a 'firing squad,' adding, 'I’d never seen a party do that in the way that they did, and it was hurtful and sad to see that happening, a firing squad around a person who I believe was a true patriot.' When pressed further, Jean-Pierre confirmed she was referring to Democratic leaders who openly criticized Biden, calling the situation 'shocking' and surprising given his accomplishments. She expressed disappointment that instead of uniting, the party turned on him, suggesting it hurt Biden's chances in the election. 'It was truly unfortunate, and I think it hurt us more than folks realized,' Jean-Pierre said. Reflecting on her time as press secretary, she called it 'an honor and a privilege' but admitted, 'I have not missed it at all.' She also highlighted her pride in being the longest-serving female press secretary in history.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/biden-firing-squad-reelection/	2025-02-28T10:52:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/675b903b7c1a92.49183753.jpeg?w=900
Musicians, bus driver caught with 200 pounds of cocaine	McALLEN, Texas (ValleyCentral) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested six musicians and a bus driver Monday after catching them with more than 200 pounds of cocaine. The musicians attempted to cross the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge in a white Volvo bus, according to a criminal complaint filed against them. Officers sent the bus to secondary inspection, where an X-ray revealed 'an anomaly' in the gas tank. During a search, they discovered about 80 packages of cocaine. Officers found more than 200 pounds of cocaine hidden in the tour bus. (Photo courtesy of Homeland Security Investigations via X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter.) Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, questioned the bus driver. The driver, Pedro Edgar Jauregui-Ortiz, said his passengers were part of a band. Jauregui said they frequently traveled from Monterrey, Mexico, to Houston. His story, however, didn’t add up. When pressed, Jauregui admitted he was smuggling drugs. Prince Harry’s immigration status under fire over drugs, possible lies Jauregui 'also stated that the passengers, posing as musicians who were to perform or record in Houston, was a ‘cover’ to conceal the smuggling attempt,' according to the criminal complaint. When they arrived in Houston, he would park the bus at a hotel. Someone would pick up the bus and call Jauregui 'to return back to Mexico,' according to the criminal complaint. Agents also questioned the musicians. Several claimed they had recorded music in Houston during past trips. One said he wasn’t actually a musician and just booked Uber trips for the band when they traveled to Houston. Officers found 80 packages of cocaine that weighed about 94.5 kilograms — about 208 pounds. (Photo courtesy of Homeland Security Investigations via X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter.) Federal workers may get second ‘What did you do last week?’ email A search of government databases showed the bus had started crossing the border in October 2024. The bus crossed the Hidalgo bridge in the 'early morning hours approximately every week to two weeks,' according to the criminal complaint, with Jauregui behind the wheel. After crossing the bridge, the bus would head north. It typically passed through the Falfurrias checkpoint about 90 minutes later. The bus would return to Mexico the next morning. A review of X-ray photos from previous trips 'shows that on each of the trips the same anomaly existed within the gas tank of the vehicle.' Agents charged Jauregui and the six passengers with participating in a conspiracy to import controlled substances. Court records don’t list attorneys for Jauregui or the passengers. They remained in federal custody Wednesday and couldn’t be reached for comment.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/musicians-bus-driver-200-lbs-cocaine-border/	2025-02-28T10:42:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GkuV421WoAAIBqX.jpg?w=576
Those with gender dysphoria can no longer serve in military: Pent...	(NewsNation) — A memo sent to Defense Department leaders Thursday states those with gender dysphoria are no longer eligible for military service. This document, written by Darin S. Selnick, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, states the department must identify troops who have been diagnosed with, or are being treated for, gender dysphoria by March 26. From there, the Department of Defense has 30 days to remove those troops from service. They will be honorably discharged unless their record warrants otherwise, Selnick said. Gender dysphoria, according to the Mayo Clinic, is 'a feeling of distress that can happen when a person's gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth.' Not every transgender individual experiences gender dysphoria. Should you expect a check from Elon Musk’s DOGE cuts? Military members with gender dysphoria can get a waiver 'on a case-by-case basis, provided there is a compelling Government interest in accessing the applicant that directly supports warfighting capabilities,' Selnick wrote. To get this waiver, service members have to prove they never tried to transition and demonstrate they have lived in line with their birth sex 'without clinically significant distress' for 36 months. The memo was filed as part of a lawsuit responding to President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender troops from serving in the military. Selnick, in the memo, claimed that military service by people with gender dysphoria is 'not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.' However, organizations such as the American Medical Association have said there is no 'medically valid reason,' including a gender dysphoria diagnosis, to exclude transgender people from military service. AG Pam Bondi demands ‘full’ Epstein files from FBI, vows investigation A RAND Corp. study from 2016 that was commissioned by the Pentagon found that allowing transgender people to serve demonstrated no negative effect on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness. 'This is an unconscionable ban that forces the removal of talented service members who put their lives on the line for our nation and slams the door on qualified patriots who meet every standard and want nothing more than to serve their country,' Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD, said in a statement. Transgender people have been eligible to serve in the military since 2016, but the Trump administration attempted to issue a ban in 2019, though it was reversed in 2021. 'Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve,' SPARTA Pride, an advocacy group for transgender service members, said in a statement. 'No policy will ever erase transgender Americans' contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence.'

It will rescind a mandate from the Clinton administration that required agencies and recipients of federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. While the executive order allows agencies to keep current policies and provide services in other languages, it encourages new Americans to adopt English.

Jeffrey Epstein timeline: Sex trafficking, scandals, Ghislaine Ma...	(NewsNation) — The Jeffrey Epstein case has spread across two decades now, and now there has been increasing pressure to release more information revolving around the case. Epstein was back in the headlines last summer when his accomplice and former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, looked to appeal her 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentences for helping the late financier sexually abuse teenage girls. Maxwell's appeal came months after a federal judge ordered the public disclosure of the identities of more than 150 people mentioned in a mountain of court documents related to the late financier. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell of an apparent suicide in 2019. He was awaiting trial for allegedly orchestrating a child sex trafficking ring along with Maxwell. Here is a timeline of the criminal cases against Epstein. Florida investigation launched into Epstein March 2005: Police in Palm Beach, Florida, begin investigating Epstein after the family of a 14-year-old girl reported she was molested at his mansion. Multiple underage girls, many of them high school students, would later tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages. May 2006: Palm Beach police charge Epstein with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor. The county's top prosecutor, State Attorney Barry Krischer, takes the unusual step of sending the case to a grand jury. Who has Jeffrey Epstein been linked to over the years? June 2006: The grand jury hears from only one accuser and indicts Epstein with one count of solicitation of prostitution. Accusations from other victims, many of whom were minors, are not reflected in the indictment. July 2006: The relatively minor charge draws attention, including from Palm Beach Police leaders, who slam Krischer for giving Epstein special treatment.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) 2007: Federal prosecutors prepare an indictment against Epstein. But for a year, the financier’s lawyers engaged in talks with the U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, about a plea bargain that would allow Epstein to avoid federal prosecution. Epstein’s lawyers argued that his accusers are unreliable witnesses. Bill Clinton one of the names mentioned in Epstein documents: Report June 2008: Epstein pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from a minor. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail, a year of community service and is registered as a sex offender. Under a secret arrangement, the U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute Epstein for federal crimes. Epstein served most of his sentence in a work-release program that allowed him to leave the jail during the day to go to his office and return to his cell at night. Epstein released from jail July 2009: Epstein is released from jail. For the next decade, multiple women who say they are Epstein’s victims wage a legal fight to get his federal non-prosecution agreement voided, and hold him and others liable for the abuse. Wendy Williams’ manager, son made serious money off docuseries In her lawsuits, one of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, says Epstein and then-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell set up sexual encounters with high-profile individuals starting when she was 17. This included royalty, politicians, academians, businessmen and other rich and powerful men, including Britain's Prince Andrew. All of the men denied the allegations.

January 2024: The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York confirmed that the documents will be unsealed on a rolling basis. The first batch of documents was unsealed Jan. 3. More documents were unsealed in the following days. Questions about the millionaire pedophile remain unanswered even after the release of thousands of pages of court records. The documents received a lot of attention, but they shed little new light on the financier’s habitual sexual abuse of underage girls. Metaverse rape, murder could be treated as crime: UK agency The final round of legal documents were released Jan. 9. They added few details to what was already known about Epstein’s crimes. They did not contain the explosive revelations or new identities of abusers that some had predicted. Over 50 pages from Epstein’s passport files were secured by ABC News on Jan. 16 through a public records request to the U.S. Department of State, spanning from the early 1980s to 2019. The newly obtained records show extensive travels and passport requests from Epstein. February 2024: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Feb. 29 signed a bill into law that would make more documents from the 2006 grand jury investigation into Epstein public. House Bill 117, which would become effective July 1, creates a narrowly tailored exception for a judge to order the release of the grand jury records from the 2006 investigation. Grand jury transcripts can be released, according to the new law, if the subject of the grand jury inquiry is dead; if the investigation was about sexual activity with a minor; if the testimony was previously disclosed by a court order; and if a state attorney is notified. Under the law, a judge could release the transcripts sooner than July as part of a lawsuit filed by the Palm Beach Post. In 2019, the newspaper sued the Palm Beach County state attorney and court clerk for a court order to unseal the grand jury proceedings and reveal why it returned only minimal charges. Maxwell seeks to appeal conviction March 2024: A U.S. appeals court in New York heard oral arguments on March 12 in Maxwell’s 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. Maxwell’s defense team will argue she did not receive a fair trial and didn’t testify because she was treated poorly. Grand jury records released July 2024: A Florida judge released transcripts detailing 2006 grand jury testimony that accused Epstein of sexually assaulting numerous underage teenage girls at his Palm Beach mansion. The records, which were under seal for 16 years, revealed that the Palm Beach County prosecutor, who had reinstated efforts to charge Epstein for months, painted the alleged underage victims as prostitutes, drug addicts, thieves and liars. In the transcripts, one of Epstein’s housekeepers stated that 'hundreds of girls' passed through the house, sometimes three a day. Additionally, there are audio recordings and footage of investigators interviewing some of these underage girls, who provided explicit details of their interactions with Epstein. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an order to release the files by July 1, reported the Palm Beach Post, which sued for their release in 2019. More Epstein files released to conservative influencers February 2025: The Department of Justice released files regarding Epstein to a small group of conservative influencers in February. It wasn't initially clear if these files would be released to the press more broadly. Some of those influencers were seen leaving the White House and holding binders labeled 'The Epstein Files: Phase 1.'

Federal workers may get second 'What did you do last week?' email	(NewsNation) — Thousands of federal employees may receive a second 'What did you do last week?' email from the Trump administration, which may require a response, a source confirmed to NewsNation Friday. According to The Washington Post, which first reported the news, the message is set to come from individual agencies rather than the centralized Office of Personnel Management. On Tuesday, Elon Musk gave federal workers 'another chance' to justify their recent accomplishments or risk losing their jobs. It followed an initial email asking federal employees to list five things they accomplished last week by 11:59 p.m. Monday. The directive appeared to contradict guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, which told federal departments and agencies responses were voluntary. Multiple federal agencies had instructed employees to disregard Musk’s initial email, at least temporarily. There is no word yet on how many federal workers complied with the original directive. This is a breaking news story; check back for updates.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/federal-workers-second-what-did-you-do-last-week-email/	2025-02-28T06:14:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67af2047d18f94.20394458.jpeg?w=900
Trump to meet with Zelenskyy in DC after tense exhanges	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after calling his Ukrainian counterpart a 'dictator without elections' last week. Zelenskyy, who recently said Trump is living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space,' is expected to sign a deal in which Ukraine will send revenue from its rare mineral resources to a fund jointly controlled by the United States. Trump has said this is a way for Kyiv to repay the U.S. for aid during its war with Russia. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview that the rare minerals deal could bring in more than $20 billion to the U.S., which could help pay down the deficit. Jeffrey Epstein files released to conservative influencers However, Zelenskyy wants to see security guarantees in the deal. In a Wednesday evening address, he said, 'It's important that the United States' support is not stopped.' 'Strength is needed on the path to peace,' Zelenskyy said. When asked Thursday about his relationship with Zelenskyy, Trump softened his rhetoric. 'We have a lot of respect, I have a lot of respect for him,' Trump said. 'We've given him a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely.' When pressed by a reporter about whether he would apologize for calling Zelenskyy a dictator, Trump responded: 'Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.'

AG Pam Bondi demands 'full' Epstein files from FBI, vows investig...	(NewsNation) — The U.S. Department of Justice released hundreds of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday to a small group of conservative influencers, but Attorney General Pam Bondi says there's still more to be uncovered. In a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel, Bondi demanded the release of the bureau's 'full and complete Epstein files' by 8 a.m. ET Friday. While the declassification of the records brought some support from lawmakers who had been pushing for their release for years, others were not pleased with what little new information they contained. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., posted on social media, saying, 'This is not what we or the American people asked for. Get us the information we asked for instead of leaking old info to press.' Epstein file release may renew interest in his associates: Lawyer Epstein, a defamed financier and convicted sex offender, was indicted on federal charges related to the sex trafficking of young girls in 2019. He died by suicide in his cell one month after his arrest. The more than 300 pages of newly declassified documents contained information such as Epstein’s personal contact list, flight logs for his private plane and a list of victims’ names and phone numbers. The DOJ said the records largely contain information that had already been leaked in the past but hadn't been formally released by the U.S. government. In the letter to Patel, Bondi called for an 'immediate investigation' into the FBI's alleged withholding of some files and ordered a report on the investigation's findings within two weeks. Trump flew in Epstein’s plane; campaign had ‘no idea’: Report Patel took to social media Thursday evening, promising a 'new era' for the FBI and 'no cover-ups' or 'missing documents.' He also said that 'if records have been hidden,' the bureau 'will uncover them.' It’s unclear what this could mean for other famous investigations President Donald Trump has ordered to be declassified, including files on the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Sr. and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/epstein-files-bondi-fbi-investigation/	2025-02-28T03:56:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/gettyimages-2198561415-594x594-1.jpg?w=594
Pope reaches 2-week mark at hospital with pneumonia and doctors s...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis reached the two-week mark recovery from pneumonia Friday as doctors suggested he had overcome the most critical phase of the infection while holding out on declaring him out of danger entirely. The Vatican’s early Friday update also suggested a level of normalcy and routine as the 88-year-old pope continues recovering at Rome's Gemelli Hospital. 'As in past days, the night was tranquil and the pope now is resting.' In their Thursday evening bulletin, doctors said Francis’ clinical condition had confirmed that he was improving. He was alternating the high-flow supplemental oxygen he had been receiving by a nasal tube with a mask in a sign of improved respiratory function. Additionally, he left his hospital room to go to his nearby private chapel to pray, while continuing with respiratory physiotherapy and work, the Vatican said. For the second day in a row, doctors avoided saying Francis was in critical condition, suggesting he had overcome the most acute phase of the infection. But given the complexity of his lung infection, they said 'further days of clinical stability are needed' before they revise their prognosis officially and say he is out of danger. Francis has been at Gemelli Hospital since Feb. 14 after his bronchitis worsened. He has shown steady, albeit slight improvements since a respiratory crisis and kidney trouble over the weekend sparked fears for his life. The improvements beat back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or a conclave and signaled that he was still very much in charge. Prayers continued to pour in In Mexico City, a few dozen people gathered Thursday night at the cathedral to pray for Francis’ recovery. 'He is like part of the family,' said Araceli Gutiérrez, who treasures the time she saw the pope during his trip to the country of nearly 100 million Catholics in 2016. 'That’s why we feel so concerned for him.' María Teresa Sánchez, who was visiting from Colombia with her sister, said that she has always felt close to Francis -- the first Latin American pope. 'That’s like having a relative within the higher-ups, with God,' she said. 'He has done so much for religion; he’s such a humble person.' Upcoming calendar in question Despite his improvements, Francis’ near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Ash Wednesday next week starts the Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20. In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he curbed his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, an inspiration for young Catholics. Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity’s first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in Iznik, Turkey, to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn’t confirmed the trip. ___ Maria Hernandez contributed from Mexico City. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wendy Williams exclusive: I feel like I'm in prison	(NewsNation) — Former talk show host Wendy Williams says her guardianship feels like a prison and that she suspects her guardian may be misusing her money. 'I need out of this,' Williams said during a national 'Banfield' exclusive, claiming that even her toiletries are locked away and she must ask permission to use them. 'If I want lotion, they bring me lotion. If I want to take off my nail polish ... if I want to brush my teeth and wash my face, they have to bring it to me,' she said. Epstein files released to conservative influencers Since 2022, Williams has been staying under the direction of court-appointed conservator Sabrina Morrissey. Tune in to NewsNation's 'Banfield' at 10/9c Friday to watch the Wendy Williams national TV exclusive. Wendy Williams' guardianship The former host remains under court-ordered guardianship after being diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia. In 2022, Wells Fargo initiated guardianship proceedings where Morrissey was made guardian after Williams’ show got canceled as a result of her health problems. Morrisey filed lawsuits last year against multiple parties involved in the creation of Lifetime’s controversial documentary, 'Where is Wendy Williams?' saying Williams was 'highly vulnerable and clearly incapable of consenting to be filmed, much less humiliated and exploited,' according to court documents. She described Williams as 'an acclaimed entertainer who, tragically, has been afflicted by early-onset dementia and, as a result, has become cognitively impaired and permanently incapacitated.' While she sought to block Lifetime from releasing the series, a court ruled it could be released as planned. Journalist: Wendy Williams' alleged treatment raises serious concerns Investigative journalist Diane Dimond believes the alleged handling of the situation by Williams’ guardian raises serious concerns. Ryan Reynolds’ image takes hit amid Lively-Baldoni lawsuit; costars speak out 'I believe that criminal things happen within the guardianship system all the time, and we don’t know about it because it’s such a damn secret system,' Dimond said during a previous 'Banfield' interview. Williams continues to say she is not 'cognitively impaired' and has been 'trapped' in an emotionally abusive conservatorship.

Newsom recall supporter ‘not buying’ governor’s 52% approval rati...	(NewsNation) — Actor Mel Gibson, recently named one of President Donald Trump’s special ambassadors to Hollywood, joined an effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom following the devastating and deadly Los Angeles wildfires. Randy Economy, who is spearheading the effort to recall Newsom, told NewsNation’s 'The Hill' he doesn’t believe recent polling that shows 52% of Californians approve of the governor’s performance. 'I don't agree with that poll. I just don't,' said Economy. 'I'm here on the ground. I see the pain and the anger.' Epstein files released to conservative influencers Twenty-nine people were killed in the Palisades and Eaton fires, which combined to burn over 37,000 acres and destroy thousands of homes and businesses. Newsom has said that the LA wildfires, which broke out Jan. 7 amid the strongest Santa Ana winds in years, could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. 'We deserve much more and much better, and there is absolutely no adequate excuse the governor or mayor can make for this gross mismanagement and failure to preemptively deal with what they knew was coming,' said Economy. The new recall effort is now the eighth attempt against the governor in six years. Why is Tesla stock down 25% to start the year? 'We've had one recall attempt against Governor Newsom that has hit the ballot,' said Economy. 'It's a long process to be able to get through that actual maze of bureaucracy and to get people to actually.' Economy believes his group still has a shot at booting the governor out of office. Why? 'Because of Gavin Newsom himself,' Economy said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/gavin-newsom-randy-economy-recall-effort/	2025-02-27T17:19:14-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/Gavin-Newsom-e1736783836151.jpg?w=900
Prince Harry's immigration status under fire over drugs, possible...	(NewsNation) — The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, is suing the Department of Homeland Security in an effort to get them to release Prince Harry's immigration paperwork. Harry's immigration status has recently come under fire after the Duke of Sussex admitted in a published memoir to the recreational use of marijuana, cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms. Applications for U.S. visas specifically ask about current and past drug use, and admitting to such behavior typically leads to applications being rejected. Trump says he won’t deport Prince Harry: ‘He’s got enough problems with his wife’ Prince Harry currently resides in Montecito, California, with his wife, Meghan Markle. President Trump on Prince Harry In February last year, President Donald Trump accused former President Joe Biden’s administration of 'protecting Harry,' adding that he wouldn’t do the same if he won the White House. Now, Trump said last week that he is 'not interested' in deporting Harry. 'I don’t want to do that,' Trump told the New York Post. 'I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.' Meghan Markle in ‘precarious’ position; ‘With Love, Meghan’ to debut at messy time Call for Prince Harry's immigration records Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation, joined 'The Hill on NewsNation' to discuss their efforts to obtain Harry's immigration paperwork. 'We're calling for the release of all of Prince Harry's immigration records,' he said. 'Because we believe the American people have a right to know whether or not Harry lied on his US immigration application.' The Heritage Foundation has alleged the DHS 'may have improperly granted' his visa after the royal family member disclosed personal drug use in his memoir, 'Spare.' Prince Harry saves the day (financially) with a whopping $12M settlement 'I think it's important because the application of U.S. immigration law really does matter,' Gardiner said. 'No one should be above the law, whether they're a prince or a pauper, and Prince Harry may have received preferential treatment, he may have lied on his application, and so the rule of law really does, does matter, and it applies everybody, and Prince Harry should be no exception at all.' A federal judge is set to consider the next steps in a slow-moving court case over whether to release some of Harry's immigration documents. JFK, Jeffrey Epstein files: When will they be released? Will Prince Harry get deported? Gardiner said The Heritage Foundation is just calling for the release of all the documents and did not directly address his deportation. 'If someone lies on an immigration application, that's a federal criminal offense, and normally, those individuals would be either deported or prosecuted,' he said. 'So the stakes are certainly very, very high for Prince Harry at this at this stage.'

(NewsNation) — It has been three years since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, and talks to end the war have been advancing between the United States and Europe. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House on Thursday with President Donald Trump, where Starmer made his case to Trump that U.S. involvement would be key to ensuring peace and ending the war. Giving US ownership of Ukraine’s minerals would help keep peace: Hassett Trump has called for the United Kingdom and other European nations to increase their defense spending as the U.S. has already provided billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said talks are coming together and that Trump is focused on ending the war only, leaving France and Britain in charge of leading a deterrence force in Ukraine to prevent further conflict. 'That's part of rebalancing U.S. relations with Europe so Europe is pulling more of the load,' Volker said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with Trump on Friday to sign a rare minerals deal, which Trump believes is a way for the U.S. to regain its investment in Ukraine's defense efforts.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ukraine-russia-war-us-involvement-volker/	2025-02-27T15:11:49-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201496887.jpg?w=900
NewsNation exclusive catches border smuggling operation in action	EL PASO, Texas (NewsNation) — NewsNation got a behind-the-scenes look at deterrence efforts along the U.S.-Mexico border as illegal crossings continue to plummet during the Trump administration. Our cameras were rolling when two smuggling crews attempted to breach U.S. barriers with ladders. Video shows the smugglers stashing the ladder before one of the groups retreats. Illegal crossings in the El Paso area are down to about 60 per day after once topping 2,700 per day. The Border Patrol says migrants are turning back on their own because of deterrence efforts on the U.S. side. Migrant crossings down but cartel activity evident in Rio Grande Valley It also means the cartels aren’t making the money they once did. Air interdiction agent Taylor Herring told NewsNation that the cartels are down but certainly not out for the count. 'The threat of violence is always in the back of your mind,' he said. 'But by maintaining a constant presence out here, you can pick up on those little changes and those little cues that could maybe keep you informed.' Arizona Gov. Hobbs signs order to combat drug cartels, trafficking Border Patrol agent Orlando Marrero Rubio said the job is just about upholding the oath he and his fellow agents took. 'This is what we signed up to do,' he said. 'This is the oath we took when we came into office: to protect the Constitution, protect our nation's borders, against enemies — foreign and domestic. So for us, it's a proud moment to gain operational control of our nation's borders.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/newsnation-exclusive-border-smuggling/	2025-02-27T13:22:54-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/snapshot_05f9ba.jpg?w=900
Epstein files released to conservative influencers	(NewsNation) — The Department of Justice released files regarding Jeffrey Epstein to a small group of conservative influencers Thursday. It's not clear if the files will be released to the press more broadly or if they will be available for the public to access. President Donald Trump signed an executive order early in his second term ordering the release of the files along with classified documents related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. FDA calls off meeting to choose flu vaccine strain The group of influencers was seen leaving the White House with binders labeled 'The Epstein Files: Phase 1.' Attorney General Pam Bondi teased the release of the files earlier in the day, saying there were things included in them that would make people sick. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who is heading a task force on government transparency, said her group was not given the documents and criticized the administration for the limited release. 'A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein's phonebook. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR instead of leaking old info to press,' she said on X. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking but died by suicide while in prison.

It's important to note that someone's name appearing in Epstein's files is not an indicator that they participated in sex trafficking, and the files included people who only had brief contact with the high-profile financier. Previously released files included the names of many political and Hollywood figures, including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Stephen Hawking, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Jackson, Cate Blanchett, David Copperfield and George Lucas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/epstein-files-conservative-influencers/	2025-02-27T12:00:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/03/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?w=900

(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he 'wouldn't be opposed' to using private forces to assist with deportations, but officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan are already doing a 'phenomenal' job. Trump made the remarks in the Oval Office in response to a question from NewsNation correspondent Kellie Meyer during a joint press conference with United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer. According to a report by Politico, a group of military contractors, including former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince, proposed the idea of using a network of 'processing camps' on military bases, a private fleet of 100 planes, and a 'small army' of private citizens empowered to make arrests for mass deportations to The White House. Politico writes that this would be an estimated $25 billion. However, asked about this on NewsNation's 'On Balance,' Prince denied the report. 'This is not some idea of a private army,' Prince said Tuesday. 'It was a memo generated to describe how to achieve the logistics necessary to move the millions of people that they intend to deport.'

Pope Francis continues to improve but his prognosis remains guard...	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis continued to improve from double pneumonia Thursday, the Vatican said, working from his hospital room and going to his private chapel to pray, though doctors said he needs more days of 'clinical stability' before they revise their guarded prognosis. The 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was able to begin alternating high-flow supplemental oxygen, delivered by a nasal tube, with a mask in a sign of his improved respiratory condition, the Vatican said in a late update. For the second day in a row, doctors avoided saying Francis was in critical condition. But they said that given the complexity of his lung infection, 'further days of clinical stability are needed' before they revise their prognosis and decide he is out of danger. Catholic faithful attend a nightly rosary prayer service for the health of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. (AP Photo/Mosa'ab Elshamy) Francis has been in Rome’s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened. He has shown steady, albeit slight improvements since a respiratory crisis and kidney trouble over the weekend sparked fears for his life. The improvements, as he nears the two-week mark on Friday, beat back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or conclave and signaled that he was still very much in charge. Upcoming calendar in question Nevertheless, his near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Longer term, Ash Wednesday loomed on the horizon March 5, the start of the church's Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20. In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he has had to cut back his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, as an inspiring role model for today's young Catholics. Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity's first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in what is today's Iznik, Turkey to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn't confirmed the trip. Prayers nevertheless continue Prayers for his heath continued to pour in from near and far, with a group of Mexican pilgrims in Rome for the Holy Year taking a detour to pray for Francis outside the Gemelli hospital. Lili Iparea Fernandez, from La Cruz, Mexico, had come to Rome with plans to attend Francis' Wednesday general audience this week, but it was cancelled. 'However, we firmly believe that the pope will recover because he is a very strong man,' she said Thursday outside Gemelli. 'So I invite everyone to believe firmly, with certainty, with confidence, with hope that the pope is going to be well.' Francis keeps governing while being treated By now a certain rhythm appears to have emerged from the Vatican’s updates: The pope receives treatments in the morning, including respiratory physiotherapy, receives the Eucharist and resumes work in the afternoon from his hospital room. On Thursday, the Vatican said he had gone to the chapel located down the hall in the papal suite on the 10th floor of Gemelli to pray. It was the first time since Feb. 21, before Francis' weekend respiratory crisis, that he is known to have gone to the chapel. The Vatican said Wednesday that he had appointed four new bishops and approved the creation of a new fundraising initiative to encourage donations to the Holy See, which has been enduring a financial crisis for years. Francis likely approved the bishop appointments a while back and the new norms for the fundraising entity were approved Feb. 11, before he was hospitalized. But the announcements made them official and suggested Francis was still very much in charge and governing.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-continues-to-improve-but-his-prognosis-remains-guarded-vatican/	2025-02-27T10:49:33-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Pope-vigil-1-e1740654669836.jpg?w=900

(AP) — Oscar-winner Gene Hackman, his wife and their dog were found dead in different rooms of their Santa Fe home, and they had apparently been dead for some time, according to investigators. Hackman, 95, was found dead Wednesday in a mudroom and his 63-year-old wife, Betsy Arakawa, was found dead in a bathroom next to a space heater, Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office detectives wrote in a search warrant. There was an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on a countertop near Arakawa. Denise Avila, a sheriff's office spokesperson, said there was no indication that any of them had been shot or had other types of wounds. The detective who gave the affidavit, meanwhile, called the circumstances 'suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.' Actor Gene Hackman with wife Betsy Arakawa in June 1993. (AP Photo, File) The New Mexico Gas Co. is working with the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Department in the investigation, spokesperson Tim Korte told The Associated Press. The utility tested the gas lines in and around the home after the bodies were discovered, according to the warrant. At the time, it didn't find any signs of problems. A detective noted that people exposed to gas leaks or carbon monoxide may not show signs of poisoning. Chris Ramirez, spokesperson for the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, which runs the state’s medical examiner operations, declined to comment on whether any conclusions had been reached on the cause and manner of deaths of Hackman and Arakawa. Michelle Trachtenberg, ‘Gossip Girl’ and ‘Buffy’ actress, dead at 39 The gruff-but-beloved Hackman was among the best actors of his generation, appearing as villains, heroes and antiheroes in dozens of dramas, comedies and action films from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. He routinely showed up on Hollywood lists of greatest American actors of the 20th century. He could play virtually any kind of role, from comic book villain Lex Luthor in 'Superman' to a coach finding redemption in the sentimental favorite 'Hoosiers.' Hackman was a five-time Oscar nominee who won for 'The French Connection' in 1972 and 'Unforgiven' two decades later. His death comes just four days before this year’s ceremony. Tributes quickly poured in from Hollywood. 'The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration: Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity,' director Francis Ford Coppola wrote on Instagram. Hackman met Arakawa, a classically trained pianist who grew up in Hawaii, when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, The New York Times reported in 1989. They soon moved in together, and by the end of the decade had decamped to Santa Fe. Their Southwestern-style ranch on Old Sunset Trail sits on a hill in a gated community with views of the Rocky Mountains. The 2,300 square-foot home on one acre (0.4 hectares) was built in 2000 and had an estimated market value of a little over $1 million, according to Santa Fe County property tax records. It is modest compared to the sprawling estate next door, which was valued at $7.9 million.

He then penned two by himself, concluding with 'Pursuit' in 2013, about a female police officer on the tail of a predator. In his first couple decades in New Mexico, Hackman was often seen around the historic state capital, which known as an artist enclave, tourism destination and retreat for celebrities. He served as a board member of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in the 1990s, according to the local paper, The New Mexican. In recent years, he was far less visible, though even the most mundane outings caught the attention of the press. The Independent wrote about him attending a show at the Lensic Performing Arts Center in 2018. The New York Post reported on him pumping gas, doing yard work and getting a chicken sandwich at Wendy's in 2023. Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen in the Hollywood social circuit and retired from acting about 20 years ago. His was the rare Hollywood retirement that actually lasted.

Decline in Christianity among US adults slowing: Study	(NewsNation) — The number of Americans who identify as Christian has declined over the years, but a new study from the Pew Research Center shows that may be slowing. The Religious Landscape Study found that 62% of adults identified as Christian, down from 78% when Pew conducted a similar study in 2007. Since 2019, the decline started to level off, and the number of Christian adults in the United States stayed between 60% and 64%. Catholic bishops sue Trump over refugee resettlement suspension In the different branches of Christianity in the U.S., 40% identified as Protestant, 19% identified as Catholic and 3% identified as Christian without specifying a certain denomination. Although the number is down from 58% in the 2007 survey, the number of Americans who said they pray every day has held between 44% and 46% since 2021. In the recent survey, 44% said they pray at least once a day. The survey was conducted between 2023 and 2024 and included nearly 37,000 adults in the U.S.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/religion/decline-in-christianity-among-us-adults-slowing-study/	2025-02-27T08:55:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/05/64fa4feb02e802.31942925.jpeg?w=900
Suspect arrested in Tesla vandalism, explosives case	(NewsNation) — A woman was arrested in connection to a string of vandalism incidents at a Colorado Tesla dealership believed to be directed against Tesla founder Elon Musk, according to court documents. Lucy Grace Nelson, 40, was arrested Monday in Loveland after returning to the dealership with 'additional incendiary devices' and materials used for vandalism, police said. Nelson faces several charges, including possession of an incendiary device or explosives during a felony, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit a class 3 felony. When will the Epstein and JFK files be released? Police are working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and federal charges are likely. Nelson posted bond and was released from jail Tuesday. Her next court appearance is scheduled for March 7. Police are still investigating her alleged motive. The arrest affidavit suggests a second person is involved, citing surveillance video from one of the six incidents since Jan. 29, in which the suspect seems to have a smaller build than Nelson. However, the affidavit identified Nelson as the suspect in other incidents. Footage captured someone spray-painting an obscenity believed to be aimed at Musk, while other footage captured Molotov cocktails being thrown into a row of Tesla vehicles, causing damage to four cars worth $220,000. Police reportedly found spray paint, gasoline and other materials in Nelson’s car when she was arrested. The incidents are under investigation, and the case is part of growing concerns over Musk’s influence and recent protests at Tesla storerooms across the United States.

Trump, UK's Keir Starmer to meet amid differences on Ukraine	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit the White House on Thursday in an effort to convince President Donald Trump that Ukraine and European leaders need a place at the table as the U.S. negotiates an end to the yearslong Russia-Ukraine war. The meeting follows a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, reflecting a mounting concern felt by much of Europe that Trump’s aggressive push to end the war in Ukraine signals his willingness to concede too much to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Macron called his meeting with Trump a 'turning point,' but no deal to end the war in Ukraine has been reached. Keir Starmer to raise British defense budget Trump has been calling for the U.K. and European nations to increase their spending as the U.S. has provided billions to Ukraine in military aid. Starmer on Tuesday pledged to increase the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 in hopes of persuading Trump to maintain U.S. support for Ukraine and the NATO alliance. The U.K. currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defense, and the government had previously set a 2.5% target without setting a date. Starmer told lawmakers the increase amounts to an additional 13.4 billion pounds ($17 billion) annually. He said the goal is for defense spending to increase to 3% of GDP by 2035. Marco Rubio: US-Ukraine rare minerals deal a 'tush push' away Trump has announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also visit the White House on Friday to sign a deal on rare earth minerals. Details of the agreement are vague, but what is known is that the U.S. is requesting revenue from Ukraine’s rare minerals, which are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. Trump believes this is a way for the U.S. to recoup its investment in Ukrainian defense efforts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the deal is a 'tush push' away — a reference to the Philadelphia Eagles' signature tush-push strategy. Trump floats post-war meeting with Russia's Putin Relations between the U.S. and Russia have grown closer since a meeting earlier this month in Saudi Arabia in which both nations agreed to cooperate beyond the war. Senior Russian and U.S. diplomats are meeting in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss their embassies’ operations and work toward normalizing diplomatic relations. Trump has suggested a potential face-to-face meeting with Putin in Russia after the war in Ukraine ends to discuss a potential peace deal, though he did not specify concessions.

Will the SAVE Act keep married women from voting?	(NewsNation) — Republicans in Congress have reintroduced the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, and experts are warning the law could make it harder for many Americans to vote. What is the SAVE Act? The proposed law would require Americans to prove their citizenship status by presenting specific documentation in person when they register to vote or update their voter registration. Specifically, the law would require certain documents that comply with REAL ID laws to be presented, generally a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport. Should you expect a check from Elon Musk’s DOGE cuts? Roughly half of Americans do not have a valid passport. For those who don't have a copy of their birth certificate on hand, getting a copy can take time and require paying a fee. How would the SAVE Act change voter registration? Driver's licenses, which have traditionally been used to register voters, would no longer be valid. Neither would state ID cards issued to people who can't or don't want to drive but still need ID. That would be true even if the license conforms to REAL ID standards. Military or tribal IDs would also be invalid for voter registration. The documentation would also have to be given in person, which would mean an end to voter registration by mail, online voter registration and voter registration drives. How would the SAVE Act affect married women? To register, the required documents would need to match the voter's current legal name. Trump’s ‘gold card’ can work ‘in theory’: Immigration attorney For married women who take their spouse's name (or husbands who do the same), this could present a problem if they lack a passport. When someone changes their name after getting married, they are not issued a new birth certificate. The law doesn't outright prohibit people whose names don't match from registering, but they would be required to provide additional documentation, like a marriage license, which would create more barriers to registering. How would the SAVE Act affect college students? The law would require documents to be presented in person for registration and changes, like updating a mailing address. Many young people may not have access to the documents they need. US consumer confidence drops by most since August 2021 For college students who attend school in a different city or state, this would remove the option to update their registration online or by mail and require them to travel back home to make any changes. How would the SAVE Act affect transgender Americans? Transgender voters could also face barriers to registering because many states do not allow them to get a new birth certificate with their updated name and gender. As with married women, trans people would have to provide additional legal documentation of a name change to register. The Trump administration has made changes that prohibit people from changing their gender on passports, making it harder for trans people to get one form of suitable ID, and some trans people have reported they are unable to get a passport at all. How would the SAVE Act affect rural voters? Millions of Americans who live in rural areas and rely on mail or online registration would have to register in person, potentially requiring long drives to register. Why are income-driven repayment plan applications closed? That would also affect elderly voters who are unable to drive and live in rural areas with little public transportation. Service members who rely on the ability to register or update registration by mail while deployed would also face difficulty registering to vote under the new law. How would the SAVE Act affect low-income Americans? The SAVE Act requires documents many Americans don't have on hand. Obtaining a passport or birth certificate are both processes that cost money, which creates barriers for low-income Americans who can't afford those fees.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/save-act-married-women/	2025-02-26T18:39:04-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/pexels-element-digital-1550337.jpg?w=900
Trump’s ‘gold card’ can work ‘in theory’: Immigration attorney	(NewsNation) — A San Diego-based immigration attorney tells NewsNation that President Donald Trump’s idea for a U.S. investor visa 'gold card' could work because it would function much like the existing EB5 investor visa. 'In theory, it can really work because the EB5 program works,' said Saman Nasseri. 'Now, this will just expand on it and bring bigger businesses, bigger people.' While Trump said the new system has 'never been done before, anything like this,' the broad strokes of what was announced sound similar to the existing EB5 investor program, albeit with a higher price tag. Social Security to increase monthly benefits for millions Trump said he’d like the gold card rolled out within two weeks. It’s an estimate Nasseri says isn’t impossible but has hurdles. 'It is possible that this could start in two weeks and get it going,' he said. 'But it all kind of comes down to what that vetting process looks like. The biggest thing with the EB5 process is the source of the funds. Where's the money going, and is it creating jobs?' The current program requires would-be investors to invest a little over $1 million and create at least 10 jobs, and it also puts investors on a pathway to a green card and later citizenship. It’s unclear, however, whether Trump can end the EB5 program without Congress’ blessing, as the investor program was just reauthorized in 2022.

Should you expect a check from Elon Musk's DOGE cuts?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump wants to take some of the savings that come from Elon Musk's government efficiency push and return it directly to taxpayers, but that doesn't mean you should expect a check in the mail anytime soon. Trump recently endorsed the idea — which started on social media — of sending 20% of the Department of Government Efficiency's savings back to taxpayers as a 'DOGE dividend.' 'I love it. A 20% dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening,' Trump told reporters last week. When asked how much money it could be, Trump said, 'It could be a lot. If it's 20%, we'd give back a lot of money to the taxpayer.' ‘DOGE dividend’ advisor says $5k checks are ‘reasonable’ Musk also supports the idea, likening so-called 'DOGE dividend checks' to the 'spoils of battle' in a recent interview. But that doesn't mean dividend checks are going to happen. Congress would have to authorize the plan, and so far, even Republican lawmakers have been hesitant to embrace it. It's also unclear how much money DOGE can save to return to taxpayers in the first place. Clear evidence of major savings has been scant, and budget experts doubt DOGE can reach its $2 trillion savings goal on its own. 'I don't think Americans should bet on a big DOGE dividend coming their way,' said Romina Boccia, the director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. Boccia added: 'Politicians love to provide benefits to their constituents, but when it comes to actually curtailing spending and producing deficit reduction, that is much harder to do.' Here's what to know about the DOGE dividend and how likely it is to happen. What is the 'DOGE dividend' check? The idea for a 'DOGE dividend' surfaced on social media last week when 'anti-woke' investor James Fishback posted a four-page proposal and tagged Elon Musk. Fishback suggested sending a 'tax refund check' as a form of 'restitution' that would go out to roughly '79 million tax-paying households.' Those households would receive a $5,000 check — a 20% cut of DOGE's $2 trillion in targeted savings, according to Fishback's formulation. The idea caught Musk's attention, who said he would run it by Trump, and the president has since expressed support for the proposal. Congress would have to approve the checks, and achieving the sort of payout that Fishback proposed would require Musk to hit his target of $2 trillion in spending cuts — a number that has drawn skepticism. DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for 'I think that 2 trillion is likely an overly ambitious target that DOGE by itself will not be able to accomplish,' Boccia said. Achieving that level of savings, Boccia said, would require congressional buy-in and cuts to major entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, which Trump has already taken off the table. DOGE claims it has saved an estimated $65 billion so far, citing a combination of fraud detection, canceled contracts, workforce reductions and other alleged cost-cutting measures. However, several analyses have cast doubt on DOGE's numbers, identifying errors that caused savings to be vastly overstated. A New York Times report found that the single biggest line item on the DOGE website was off by about $8 billion. 'At the moment, we cannot take DOGE at face value,' Boccia said. Fishback told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo that his plan would help DOGE reach its $2 trillion goal because citizens would be incentivized to report wasteful spending. 'Every American can step up, report fraud and abuse to DOGE directly via X, and we’ll see the savings go up, hit $2 trillion, and we’ll see the checks dispersed next summer,' Fishback said. Who would get DOGE dividend checks? In his proposal, Fishback said the checks would only go to households that pay income taxes, meaning tens of millions of lower-income Americans would miss out. An estimated 72.5 million households — roughly 40% — didn't pay federal income tax in 2022, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. For the most part, people don't pay income taxes because they have little income. About 60% of nonpayers make less than $30,000, and another 28% make between $30,000 and about $60,000, per the Tax Policy Center. Is Elon Musk right about widespread Social Security fraud? 'While some politicians imply that people somehow are cheating the system by not paying taxes, the reality is quite different. People generally don’t pay federal income tax because, well, they don’t make very much money,' Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in the report. Of those who paid no federal income tax in 2022, roughly a third were age 65 or older. That means many people who are primarily living on Social Security benefits wouldn't receive DOGE dividend checks under the current plan. Are DOGE dividend checks a good idea? Some experts think DOGE dividend checks would worsen inflation, like when COVID-era stimulus checks helped drive up prices. 'Love what DOGE is doing, but this is a bad idea. There’s no need to send 'dividend checks,'' Preston Brashers, a tax policy research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote on X. 'If the government sends out stimmy checks, inflation will come back with a vengeance,' Brashers warned. Fishback argues that DOGE dividend checks would not be inflationary because 'unlike COVID-stimulus checks which were deficit-financed,' the new round of checks would be 'exclusively funded with DOGE-driven savings.' Could Trump really return DOGE savings to taxpayers? Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, echoed that claim, insisting that the dividend checks would not be inflationary during a press briefing last week. 'Imagine if we don't spend government money, and we give it back to people. If they spend it all, then you're even,' Hassett said. Boccia said a DOGE dividend could push up inflation if the government were to borrow and fund the checks based on expected savings rather than savings that have actually materialized. Others don't think the checks will be sizeable enough to matter. 'I can’t imagine they’d be inflationary because I can’t imagine they’d be big enough,’’ Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told The Associated Press. Kamarck dismissed the DOGE dividend as 'ridiculous' and said there's not enough money to cut that would result in a big contribution to taxpayers. What do lawmakers think about the idea? A DOGE dividend check would have to be approved by Congress, and even Trump-aligned GOP lawmakers seem skeptical. House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared less than enthusiastic when asked about the idea at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week. 'Politically, that would be great for us, you know, you can send everybody a check,' Johnson said. 'But if you think about our core principles, right, fiscal responsibility is what we do as conservatives. That’s our brand.' Speaker Johnson discourages DOGE stimulus checks idea Johnson added: 'We have a $36 trillion federal debt. We have a giant deficit that we’re contending with. I think we need to pay down the credit card, right?' Senator Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he loves what Musk is doing to expose waste, fraud and abuse but pumped the breaks on a DOGE dividend. 'I’m always happy to let the American people keep more of their hard-earned money, but DOGE savings should first go toward reducing spending so that inflation doesn’t become the silent tax robbing them of their purchasing power,' Johnson wrote on X. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he’d 'want to see the details' of the plan, according to Business Insider. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, told Scripps News that eliminating the debt and curbing inflation would be her main priorities for any savings associated with DOGE. 'If there's money left after we address inflation, and the debt, and the deficit, it's always a good idea to send taxpayers their money back. But when we're $36 trillion in debt, we've dug ourselves a pretty big hole,' Lummis said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/should-you-expect-check-doge/	2025-02-26T16:37:31-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abf8d861b6a3.13913445.jpeg?w=900
JFK, Jeffrey Epstein files: When will they be released?	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his third day in office that directed the release of records related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, but those files haven't been released yet. Trump has been saying he will have classified records related to the assassination of Kennedy released since he was on the campaign trail. This executive order also called for the declassification of the assassination files of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ashley Judd backs New York bill to protect survivors, target traffickers There has been pressure to release not only these files but also those surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Pressure to release Jeffrey Epstein, JFK files In February, the FBI said it found 2,400 new records related to the assassination of Kennedy and is working on transferring those files to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the declassification process. Attorney General Pam Bondi is now being pressured to release Jeffrey Epstein's flight log for his private jet and helicopter, according to The Hill. 'The American people deserve to know exactly who was affiliated with this network. As you know, over the course of many years, Jeffrey Epstein built a heinous global sex trafficking network that caused irreparable harm to countless women,' Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said. Democrats have not said much regarding the release of these files. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, told Chris Cuomo that she wanted the Epstein and Kennedy files to be declassified. Luna said a plan should be presented this week on how to declassify these documents. 'That will lay out the process in which declassification will take place,' she said. 'We met with the National Archives today ... if everything goes as planned, these will be publicly available as soon as we get them. The American people will also be getting them.' Bondi said the files are 'sitting on her desk' and that she is reviewing them. Luna posted on X, saying, 'On Feb 11 &amp; Feb 19, house oversight sent a letter to the DOJ asking for status on releasing the Epstein files as well as JFK etc. The DOJ has not responded.' She then tagged Bondi, asking her the status of these documents. Why is there pressure to release Jeffrey Epstein, JFK files? Many are citing transparency as the reason for releasing these files. Massachusetts sanctuary cities sue Trump, Feds over funding threats Blackburn said Democrats have undercut efforts to 'crack the Epstein trafficking ring wide open.' In a post on X, Blackburn said, 'The time for transparency is now.' Another Republican senator, Mike Lee of Utah, also said on X that it is time for the American people to 'be given access to' these files, according to Yahoo News.

However, not much was learned from those unsealed documents. In February 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law that made more documents from the 2006 investigation public. Once those documents were released in July 2024, they showed that the prosecutor in the case had painted the alleged underage victims as drug addicts, liars, prostitutes and thieves. Now, it is alleged that there is a 'list of clients' of Epstein that could be released, according to Newsweek. It is rumored that this list could implicate high-profile figures in various sex crimes. JFK's assassination Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, and there are still questions about what happened. He was shot in the back of the head while traveling in a motorcade and was later pronounced dead at Parkland Hospital. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for murdering a police officer and Kennedy. However, there have been theories that suggest Oswald was a fall guy, and some withheld documents from the government have been fueling speculation that the public doesn't know everything about the 35th president's death.

(RR Auction via AP, File) Trump has said since his election campaign that he would release all remaining documents related to Kennedy's assassination. However, according to The Associated Press in November, even though there are likely many government records that haven't been released, the public should not expect profound revelations. In September 2024, previously unreleased footage showed Kennedy riding in his motorcade right before the video was auctioned off by RR Auction for $137,500. What are the theories related to JFK's assassination? In 2023, actor and director Rob Reiner, who has a podcast series named 'Who Killed JFK,' told NewsNation that he had proof there were four men involved in the assassination. A private investigator who has spent a lot of his life studying Kennedy's assassination told NewsNation he thinks there were two shooters involved. Trump pushes DOGE, tariffs at first Cabinet meeting 'One of those shots was fired too close to the other two to have come from Oswald's rifle,' Josiah Thompson said. He doesn't believe there will ever be a true answer for what happened on that day in Dallas.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/jeffrey-epstein-jfk-files-when-release/	2025-02-26T16:21:44-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2201496887.jpg?w=900
Gov. Newsom directs parole board to evaluate Menendez brothers’ c...	Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he’s ordering the California Board of Parole Hearings to closely examine whether the Menendez brothers pose a risk to public safety if released from prison right now. Newsom made the announcement on his 'This is Gavin Newsom' podcast. 'The question for the board is a rather simple one,' Newsom said during the introductory episode. 'Do Erik and Lyle Menendez pose an unreasonable risk to public safety?' Menendez brothers’ evidence suggesting sexual abuse not credible: LA County DA Public safety experts and forensic psychologists will conduct the risk assessment. According to Eytan Wallace, California Capitol reporter for Nexstar Media, the process starts with experts analyzing what led a person to commit an offense and determining whether they have done the transformational work needed—and gained the skills—to avoid repeating their mistakes. Nexstar Media is the parent company of KTLA 5. Once that’s complete, a hearing will work like a standard parole hearing, providing the District Attorney and the victims a chance to be part of the process. The risk assessment results will be available to the judge presiding over the case and Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Newsom’s announcement comes after Hochman announced that his office had issued an informal response requesting the courts deny the brothers’ habeas petition. Chances of Menendez brothers getting out of prison are slim, legal analyst says A habeas petition is a formal challenge to the legality of a conviction. It is often considered a last resort after appeals have been exhausted. If new evidence is deemed sufficient, it could eventually lead to a convict’s release. In October, former DA George Gascón announced that his office would reexamine the case in the light of new evidence, including a letter purportedly written by Erik Menendez just months before he and his brother, Lyle, killed their parents with a shotgun at their Beverly Hills home in 1989. They were 21 and 18 at the time, respectively. The letter details alleged sexual abuse committed by their father, Jose Menendez. Despite the setback from the DA’s office, Newsom has 'unilateral' power to grant the brothers clemency, which would free them immediately. Still, Newsom noted that 'there is no guarantee of outcome here.' Menendez attorney: The ’90s want their DA office back Erik and Lyle Menendez admitted to fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, after fearing their parents were about to kill them to stop people from finding out that Jose Menendez had sexually abused Erik Menendez for years. The brothers have been in prison for over 30 years after being convicted in 1996. The case has regained national attention since the release of Netflix’s 'The Menendez Brothers' film.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/menendez-brothers-parole-gavin-newsom/	2025-02-26T15:17:18-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/GettyImages-1462355302-1-e1729360247514_b1b20e_99c390.jpg?w=800

You were gentle and kind and loving, quiet and unassuming, but so powerful, and your presence was felt the minute you walked into any room. You never demanded the spotlight. You never needed to make a sound to be recognized, your heart and your talent did that as effortlessly as you artistry did. I’ve been having trouble putting the words together the last few days. The truth is I’m still in shock that such a beautiful young life has come to an end. It seems senseless and unfair. I know your family is brokenhearted as am I and everyone else who knew you. Your spirit moved on to the next phase beyond this life but I know wherever you are there is beauty and light. And the beauty and light you left here will live on forever. Rest in peace, sweet angel… 💔' Guerrero’s family set up a GoFundMe, stating, 'Currently, his family is taking care of his personal belongings and accommodations to bring him home to Houston.' The GoFundMe raised $96,000. Jesus Guerrero’s family shows appreciation After Jenner paid for Guerrero’s body to be flown to Houston (and his funeral), the family noted: 'When this go fund me was set up we created it thinking we would have to take care of all the expenses ourselves. We didn't want to burden any clients with this. Our family deeply appreciates Kylie for later offering to cover funeral expenses and offering up all her help and support. Donations raised through this fundraiser will go toward the costs associated with securing his belongings home. As well as other unexpected expenses to settle his assets. With his death being so unexpected there are many things that weren't set up for a time like this. The next several months will have many hoops we will have to jump through to ensure we honor him in the best way we can. Our mother will be taking time off to ensure that everything gets taken care of and so that she can grieve properly because a mother should never have to bury her child.'

Ryan Reynolds' image takes hit amid Lively-Baldoni lawsuit; costa...	(NewsNation) — The 'nice guy' in Hollywood may not be so nice after all. Ryan Reynolds has long enjoyed a stellar reputation as a 'good guy,' but with the advent of the 'It Ends With Us' lawsuit he and his wife, Blake Lively, brought against the movie’s producer, director and co-star, Justin Baldoni, that facade is starting to slip. Justin Baldoni's lawsuit takes on Ryan Reynolds with Blake Lively The first shot over the bow came when Baldoni, in his lawsuit against Reynolds and Lively, accused the 'Deadpool' star of becoming unhinged in a meeting. Baldoni claims Reynolds 'berated' him during a heated meeting at the couple's home, where Reynolds 'aggressively' accused Baldoni of a string of offenses against his wife, including 'fat-shaming' her. Hugh Jackman, from left, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Tammy Reynolds, and Brandon Sklenar attend the world premiere of 'It Ends with Us' at AMC Lincoln Square on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) According to the lawsuit: 'Baldoni and producers arrived eager to discuss plans for the next day's filming, prepared with their production materials. Instead, they were blindsided by Lively and Reynolds, who presented a list of grievances that were both unanticipated and troubling. 'Reynolds launched into a tirade, berating Baldoni in what Baldoni later described as a 'traumatic' encounter, stating he had 'never been spoken to like that in his life.' Michelle Trachtenberg, ‘Gossip Girl’ and ‘Buffy’ actress, dead at 39 ''When Baldoni resisted apologising for what he had not done, Reynolds became further enraged. Everyone, including the producer Lively had asked production to engage and a representative of Sony that was in attendance, left that 'meeting' in shock. The producer offered that in his 40-year career he had never seen anyone speak to someone like that.' [Reynolds denies he screamed at Baldoni].

Subscribe to her newsletter here. ‘Deadpool’ co-star says Ryan Reynolds was ‘horrifically mean’ Soon after Baldoni’s lawsuit went public, an interview with TJ Miller, Reynolds’ 'Deadpool' co-star, was unearthed. The interview, with Adam Carolla’s podcast, took place two years ago, and in it, Miller accused Reynolds of being 'horrifically mean' during a 'Deadpool 2' shoot and recalled Reynolds telling him: 'Know what's great about you, Weasel? You're not the star, but you do just enough exposition that it's funny, and then we can leave and get back to the real movie.' This image released by 20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios shows Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool/Wade Wilson, left, and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan in a scene from 'Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.' (20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios via AP) T.J. said at the time, 'Would I work with him again? No. I would not work with him again.' (Miller has since said the two have made up). And then this week, two more damaging interviews came out. Matthew Lawrence on Ryan Reynolds Matthew Lawrence, who starred with Reynolds in 'Boltneck' (1998), said Reynolds had 'creative differences' issues with the Oscar-nominated producers and directors of the movie. Lawrence, on his 'Brotherly Love Podcast,' said: '(Reynolds would) walk out — just kind of wanted to do his thing, and the producers would get really upset.' 'They even told him, ‘Ryan, this is a bad Jim Carrey impersonation. This is not what we hired you to do. You can’t impersonate somebody. You gotta do your own thing.'' This image released by FX shows Ryan Reynolds, left, and Rob McElhenney in a scene from the third season of 'Welcome to Wrexham.' (FX via AP) Reynolds was 'upset' over the criticism and would only say: 'I’m doing my thing.' In 'Boltneck,' Lawrence played a 'science nerd' named Frank Stein, who revives Reynolds’ character’s corpse after he’s killed by a pair of bullies. He claimed the producers wanted the film to mirror a sci-fi thriller like 'Donnie Darko,' but Reynolds was 'trying to ‘Deadpool'' the script. Alec Baldwin’s show ‘The Baldwins’ fails to attract audience 'There was this major pull between one of the lead actors … so that is what my experience with Ryan Reynolds was. … He obviously matured as a human being.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/ryan-reynolds-image-takes-hit-blake-lively-lawsuit/	2025-02-26T14:17:00-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/12/5095e15c60424fd7ba4a948b1dbe8f7a.jpg?w=900
Brian Laundrie's family calls Gabby Petito documentary one-sided	(NewsNation) — The family of Brian Laundrie says the new Netflix Gabby Petito documentary series is a one-sided look at the relationship of the two young adults. In a statement provided to PEOPLE by the Laundrie family’s attorney, Chris and Roberta Laundrie say the new documentary series 'American Murder: Gabby Petito' did not paint the full picture of what happened. 'The documentary was what we expected. One perspective depicted as the ‘truth’ as seen through their lens. Similar to Republicans and Democrats fighting it out lately. Hard to see through the lens of the other with all the noise and distrust.' Gabby Petito’s parents destroyed her van: ‘We had it crushed’ Petito vanished in 2021 while on a cross-country road trip with Laundrie in a converted camper van. The two became the center of a nationwide investigation after Laundrie returned home without Petito. Petito, a 22-year-old aspiring blogger, documented their journey on social media, specifically through her YouTube channel, before abruptly stopping. Gabby’s Ford Transit Connect was a regular feature in the travel reports she posted online before she disappeared in 2021. Authorities believe she was killed by Laundrie in Wyoming before he killed himself in Florida. Her body was found at a camping area in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming on Sept. 19, 2021, days after a nationwide search was launched. His body was later found near the Carlton Reserve in South Florida on Oct. 20, 2021. The Laundrie family did not participate in the documentary. Gabby Petito’s family speaks with NewsNation ahead of documentary release 'The documentary contained many inaccuracies, incorrect juxtapositions of timelines, and misstatements and omissions of fact — perhaps deliberate to capture their ‘truth’, perhaps due to simple error,' the statement issued to PEOPLE continued. The family, however, acknowledged that Brian Laundrie killed Petito. 'We all know Brian took Gabby’s life and Brian then took his own as well. Let the parents of both Gabby and Brian mourn and remember them in peace.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/gabby-petito-missing-case/brian-laundries-family-calls-gabby-petito-documentary-one-sided/	2025-02-26T14:04:26-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2022/02/brian-laundrie-1.jpg?w=900
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expected to sign minerals deal Frid...	(NewsNation) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is coming to the White House Friday, where he will sign a rare minerals deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday. Trump addressed the deal, which has been a push and pull since the start, before the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday. Details are vague but what is known is that the U.S. is requesting revenue from Ukraine's rare minerals, which are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. Trump has said this is a way for Kyiv to pay back the U.S. for aid sent for the war effort under Democratic President Joe Biden. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ 'The previous administration put us in a very bad position, but we’ve been able to make a deal where we’re going to get the money back and a lot of money in the future,' Trump said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said at a news conference early Wednesday in Kyiv that a framework of an economic deal had been reached, but it did not yet include the U.S. security guarantees his country sees as vital. The economic agreement 'may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?' Zelensky said. Zelenskyy said he expects a wide-ranging conversation with Trump. 'Today, there has been a lot of international work. Our teams are working with the United States as we prepare for negotiations this Friday,' Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X. 'Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations. I will meet with @POTUS. For me and for all of us in the world, it’s important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace. This comes during a very public feud between Zelenskyy and Trump that initially stemmed from the minerals deal. After Zelenskyy refused the initial framework, Trump called the Ukrainian president a 'dictator without elections.' Zelenskyy, in turn, said Trump is living in a 'disinformation space.' Along with the minerals deal, there's also a push to put an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump says the Europeans should provide security — not the United States. Another European leader, French President Emmanual Macron, was in Washington on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit Thursday.

Massachusetts sanctuary cities sue Trump, Feds over funding threa...	(NewsNation) — Two Massachusetts sanctuary cities have filed a lawsuit against several federal officials, including President Donald Trump, alleging the government is attempting to coerce them into the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts. The cities of Chelsea and Somerville filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging the Trump administration’s efforts and arguing that federal officials are threatening to defund local efforts to keep their communities safe. The lawsuit was filed after Trump border czar Tom Homan claimed he was 'coming to Boston and bringing hell with me.' Woman violated in exam room worries medical worker is still on duty The lawsuit, which was filed by city officials who are represented by Lawyers For Civil Rights, argues the administration’s threat of stripping sanctuary cities of federal funding violates the cities’ constitutional rights. 'Public safety is the top priority for the City of Chelsea—we cannot afford to have our residents fear reporting crimes or engaging with local law enforcement, as this undermines the safety of everyone in our community,' Chelsea City Manager Fidel Maltez said in a statement. Chelsea has been a sanctuary city since 2007 and 'is stronger because of our immigrant population, and we will not let fear or misinformation divide us,' the city manager said. Somerville has maintained its sanctuary city status since 1987 and has reaffirmed its commitment to that status three times since 2016, City Council President Judy Pineda Neufeld said. She said the federal government’s attempts to coerce city officials into betraying its immigrant neighbors are 'unconstitutional, morally unacceptable and a danger' to the full community. 'Our city’s values are clear: We will protect the dignity, safety, and rights of all of our residents, regardless of immigration status,' Pineda Neufeld said. 2 people killed by IED; cartel suspected, officials say In fiscal year 2024, Chelsea received about $14.5 million in federal funding, part of which went to education and downtown reconstruction projects. During the same time, Somerville received about $19.4 million in federal money to support a variety of community and public safety services. Those projects include roadway safety initiatives, homelessness prevention services and efforts to address and reduce youth tobacco use and alcohol consumption, the city said. The lawsuit alleges that since taking office in January, Trump’s executive orders have threatened to keep federal funding from sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration agents as part of the mass deportation effort. Homan has visited cities like Chicago, where ICE raids were conducted shortly after Trump’s inauguration, and has targeted cities that push back against federal involvement in immigration enforcement. Maltez, the Chelsea city manager, told GBH News that since Trump took office in January, the city’s downtown district has seen a decline in foot traffic. He said the city received reports of immigration agents being in local businesses. 'And honestly, it created a lot of fear in our community,' Maltez told the local television station. 'We hear from our residents almost every day about how they are scared of walking in our streets.' The lawsuit also names the Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem and the Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy as defendants. The suit argues Trump’s executive orders have said sanctuary cities will not receive DOJ funding and that the Department of Transportation will deprioritize those cities as well. An email sent from NewsNation to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment on the lawsuit was not returned. 'The President cannot use federal funding as a weapon to force local governments to undermine public safety and their values and participate in his mass deportation efforts,' Oren Sellstrom, one of the Massachusetts cities’ attorneys, said in a statement. '(The) lawsuit seeks to protect sanctuary and welcoming cities, so they can continue to make public safety decisions that are in the best interests of their residents.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/massachusetts-sanctuary-sue-trump-feds/	2025-02-26T11:25:07-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/AP18059615938391-1-e1733323119120_abd0ec.jpg?w=900

Watch live: Elon Musk attends Trump’s first Cabinet meeting	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — Elon Musk got a round of applause from President Donald Trump’s Cabinet at its first meeting Wednesday, highlighting the billionaire’s growing influence in the administration. 'We're going to start getting to be at a point where we can think in terms of balancing budgets, believe it or not, something you haven't heard in many many years decades actually,' Trump said to the cabinet. Last year the U.S. deficit almost reached $2 trillion. Trump asked Elon Musk to get up and give some remarks in the cabinet meeting. He said the U.S. cannot continue with $2 trillion deficits and huge amounts of interest on the national debt. 'This is a central' thing. Musk also disclosed he is 'getting a lot of death threats.' Musk said he thinks that there around $1 trillion in savings that can be found. 'We will make mistakes. We won't be perfect,' Musk acknowledged. 'When we make mistakes we will fix it very quickly.' DOGE subcommittee looks at US foreign aid spending 'Some disagree a little bit,' President Trump said of Musk's efforts, but said most are 'thrilled.' Some criticized Musk's presence at the meeting since his role within the administration is nebulous. He was said to be running the Department of Government Efficiency, but the Trump administration said in a legal filing he was not an employee. 'Elon is working with the Cabinet secretaries and their staff every single day to identify waste and fraud and abuse at these respective agencies,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters before the meeting. 'All of the Cabinet secretaries take the advice and direction of DOGE.' Trump won't guarantee Ukraine security The president also told reporters he would not 'make security guarantees beyond very much' for the war-torn country amid its conflict with Russia. 'We're going to have Europe do that because it's in, you know, we're talking about Europe is the next door neighbor,' Trump said. 'But we're going to make sure everything goes well and as you know we'll be making, will be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare earth [metals]. We very much need rare earth. They have great rare earth.' Mexico and Canada tariffs are still happening 'I'm not stopping the tariffs' promised for goods from Canada and Mexico, Trump said in response to a question. The 30 day pause on the promised tariffs on both countries ends Monday. The U.S. had paused the implementation of the tariffs as it talked with both countries about what it may be able to do to strengthen border enforcement and drug interdiction. Trump now says the tariffs will begin on April 2.

One person dead as Texas sees worst measles outbreak in 3 decades	(NewsNation) — The number of measles cases across the United States is on the rise, and at least one person with the disease has died in Texas. In Texas alone, the outbreak has grown to 124 cases across nine different counties. The Texas Department of State Health Services said 18 of those patients have been hospitalized. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that one person who had been hospitalized with measles died in West Texas. Officials said the death was of an unvaccinated school-aged child, NewsNation local affiliate KXAN wrote. Five of those who have contracted measles were vaccinated, and the rest either were not vaccinated or their status was unknown, according to the department. Social Security to increase monthly benefits for millions Texas health officials are saying this is the worst outbreak the state has seen in three decades. The virus has also been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is providing technical assistance, laboratory support and vaccines as needed, the agency said. What is measles? Measles is an airborne disease caused by a virus that spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It is highly contagious and can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5 years old, the CDC says. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes or a rash. Populations with high vaccination rates, above 95%, have herd immunity, meaning the disease is harder to spread, one pediatrician told NewsNation. No taxes on tips closer to reality with multiple pathways 'I don't think there is a major concern that it's going to be a pandemic like we saw in coronavirus,' said Dr. Joel 'Gator' Warsh. 'Most people are vaccinated or had measles, so the likelihood of it spreading in that way is pretty small. We've had many smaller-ish outbreaks in the last 10 or 20, years, and they generally don't get huge.' Newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has not publicly spoken about the current measles outbreak. Kennedy has been branded a vaccine skeptic, and his positions have sparked concern, particularly due to a growing vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. following the COVID-19 pandemic. Kennedy's supporters, however, say his positions only further the conversation about doing more long-term research on vaccines.

DOGE subcommittee to look at US foreign aid spending	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — The House subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency will meet Wednesday to examine U.S. foreign aid spending. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., chairwoman of the subcommittee, said the hearing comes as Americans are 'shocked' to discover how their taxpayer dollars have been spent overseas. The subcommittee has said it will 'expose egregious foreign aid spending that has undermined U.S. interests, review proposed reforms, and aid the Trump Administration’s efforts to rein in America’s bloated bureaucracy.' Social Security Administration closes Office of Transformation The hearing follows the Department of Government Efficiency's downsizing of the U.S. Agency for International Development as the Trump administration works to dismantle the agency that oversees foreign aid and development programs. Democrats are expected to question three witnesses, including Max Primorac, a Heritage Foundation research fellow who formerly served as USAID’s chief operating officer and is expected to argue that foreign aid organizations have weakened the U.S. influence. 'What I will do is show how the woke agenda harmed the American brand name. It made us synonymous with values that are rejected by most of the world,' Primorac told the Daily Signal. The hearing will begin at 11 a.m. ET. Democrats defend aid amid USAID cuts USAID is likely to be a major topic at the hearing. The agency has laid off thousands of workers and cut programs worldwide as the Trump administration continues its efforts to crack down on government spending. A source shared a message with NewsNation that was sent to employees warning them to pack up in 15 minutes and to not bring any weapons. 2 people killed, 1 injured by IED; cartel suspected, officials say USAID has seen its Washington, D.C., headquarters shuttered over the last month as thousands of its programs have collapsed worldwide. While Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have criticized USAID for wasteful spending and pushing a liberal agenda, Democrats argue agencies like USAID play a critical role in maintaining U.S. influence abroad. 'We got the best military in the world, but we also have diplomacy, and we also have our international allies, our friends,' said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. 'But also, one big tool that the U.S. has is soft power. That is, being able to provide assistance to countries ... it's in our best interest.' DOGE staffers resign over cuts Amid the turmoil at DOGE, 21 staffers resigned Tuesday in protest of the widespread cuts the agency is spearheading, refusing to comply with the downsizing effort. The employees, formerly with the U.S. Digital Services department, wrote in a letter, 'We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,' as first reported by the Associated Press. In response, Musk labeled the staffers as 'political holdovers' and claimed they would have been fired if they had not resigned. DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Federal workers 'do not deserve' a paycheck: Marjorie Taylor Greene Greene has recently come under fire for saying federal workers 'do not deserve' their paychecks. 'Those jobs are paid for by the American tax people who work real jobs, earn real income, pay federal taxes, and then pay these federal employees. Federal employees do not deserve their jobs. Federal employees do not deserve their paychecks,' she said Tuesday during a House committee meeting. Greene earns $174,000 annually as a member of Congress. Amy Gleason named interim DOGE chief Meanwhile, questions remain about the leadership of DOGE. The White House confirmed that Amy Gleason, a former U.S. Digital Services official, is the interim administrator of the agency. A recent court filing indicated that Musk is not in charge but serves as a senior advisor to the president.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-subcommittee-foreign-aid/	2025-02-26T04:41:51-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/Leading-USAID_022119_AP_Fernando-Vergara.jpg?w=900
Palm Beach, Florida hospital attack 'shouldn't have happened:' Nu...	PALM BEACH, Fla. (NewsNation) — Dr. Cindy Joseph, whose mom, nurse Leelamma Lal, was brutally attacked at a Florida hospital, said she's 'really disappointed in the system,' calling the incident preventable. Joseph told NewsNation's Ashleigh Banfield that her own experience working in health care has led her to expect the worst at times, but ultimately, she says, 'This shouldn't have happened.' US consumer confidence drops by most since August 2021 'My mom's been working there for 20+ years; she's devoted her entire career to the hospital. The fact that this happened at a health care facility which should have proper security is beyond me,' Joseph said on 'Banfield.' Suspect facing attempted murder charges after attacking Florida nurse Stephen Scantlebury is facing attempted murder charges after allegedly attacking Lal at the hospital where he was being cared for, essentially breaking every bone in Lal's face, police said. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, deputies were dispatched to an aggravated battery incident in a patient’s room at Palms West Hospital on Feb. 18. Scantlebury has been arrested and is undergoing medical clearance, NewsNation affiliate WJW reported. On Feb. 20, the sheriff’s department, in an update on social media, wrote that a hate crime enhancement had been added to the existing charge of attempted second-degree murder. New search to begin for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Reports 'Hate crime enhancements, if proven, can result in harsher penalties upon conviction. They highlight the motive behind the defendant’s actions and their broader impact on the community,' the post said. According to PEOPLE, police affidavits obtained by Florida media outlets described how Scantlebury allegedly jumped on top of his bed and then onto the nurse and attacked her. It went on to state that 'essentially every bone in the victim’s face is broken,' and additionally, the victim would likely lose the use of both of her eyes. 911 calls released after Palm Beach, Florida nurse attacked by patient 'Did he hurt someone with the scissors?' a dispatcher asked.

Who is Amy Gleason, the new DOGE acting administrator?	(NewsNation) — The White House confirmed Tuesday that Amy Gleason is serving as the acting administrator for the Department of Government Efficiency, the new agency created by President Donald Trump. A White House official said that Gleason, a former U.S. Digital Service official, now leads the department that Trump established via executive order after taking office in January. Questions about DOGE's leadership emerged after the White House stated in a court filing that Elon Musk, despite being widely reported as leading the department's cost-cutting efforts, is technically not part of the agency. According to Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, Musk is an employee of the 'White House Office' and serves as senior adviser to the president. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ What is Amy Gleason's background? Gleason has been a senior adviser at the U.S. Digital Service since January 2025, according to her LinkedIn profile. The service, created under the Obama administration to modernize government technology infrastructure, was renamed the U.S. DOGE Service after Trump's inauguration. Per her Linkedin profile, she previously worked as a digital services expert at USDS from October 2018 to December 2021, serving under both the Biden administration and during Trump's first term. According to an archived White House page, Gleason's career began in nursing before she transitioned to health care technology. The Obama administration recognized her as a 'Champion of Change' for her work improving healthcare technology, including the digitization of medical records. Before joining the federal government, Gleason served as vice president for research at the Cure JM Foundation for nearly five years. She was also co-founder, chief operating officer and chief strategy officer for CareSync, per the biography on the White House site. 21 staffers in office overtaken by DOGE resign What is DOGE doing? DOGE was created by Trump under an executive order in an effort to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures' and restructure federal agencies. More than 20 staffers who worked in the federal department overtaken by DOGE resigned Tuesday, saying they won’t use their technical skills to jeopardize Americans’ data and compromise essential government systems. Members of DOGE have been going into federal agencies, looking at their budgets and tapping into computer systems. The Associated Press recently reported that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security systems. DOGE agents also gained access to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency said this month. New York Magazine reported at least one DOGE worker has been to the Commerce Department’s Maryland headquarters, where they gained access to the agency’s IT system. In addition, DOGE took control of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s funding, locked out workers, accessed classified information and removed leadership.

2 people killed by IED; cartel suspected: Officials	(NewsNation) — A 74-year-old Texas rancher and one other person were killed and a third person was injured by what authorities said was an improvised explosive device planted by a cartel close to the U.S.-Mexico border. The rancher died near Brownsville, Texas, but was killed on the Mexican side of the border, said Sid Miller, the Texas Agriculture commissioner, in a statement Tuesday. Miller's office told NewsNation that the incident took place earlier this month. The rancher, Antonio Céspedes Saldierna, ranched on both sides of the border. Saldierna ran over an IED — which authorities suspect was planted by a drug cartel — in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Miller's office confirmed to NewsNation. The blast also killed Horacio Lopez Peña, and Lopez’s wife, Ninfa Griselda Ortega, sustained injuries and has been hospitalized. 'This shocking act of violence highlights the growing threat posed by cartel activity along our southern border,' Miller said. 'I urge all Texas farmers, ranchers, and agricultural workers who travel to Mexico or operate near the border to exercise extreme caution.' Southwest Airlines plane has near-collision with jet at Midway Airport Miller referred to the incident as 'tragic and alarming.' Miller encouraged everyone working in the agricultural industry in the Lower Rio Grande Valley to remain aware of their surroundings and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. In a separate statement, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham said these violent acts should be condemned at the highest level. She added that officials have been talking about the cartels' use of IEDs for years and warned that they threaten the safety and security of American citizens and must be brought to an end. 'Unfortunately, extreme violence, including the use of IEDs, has become more common over the last few years as cartels were emboldened by weak leadership in Washington, D.C.,' Buckingham, a Republican, said. 'I encourage all Texans to remain vigilant and cautious. Rest assured, the newly elected Trump Administration and the State of Texas will use all means necessary to bring an end to the cartel’s grip over South Texas.' Law enforcement officials in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas previously acknowledged the existence of IEDs and have warned communities along the border to exercise caution, especially in agricultural fields. Authorities indicated that the threats are linked to criminal organizations operating in the region. Miller called the Lower Rio Grande Valley a 'crucial part' of the state's agricultural industry. He said the safety of those working in the industry is of utmost importance. 'We cannot overlook the rising violence that threatens not only lives but also the security of our farms, ranches and rural communities,' Miller said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/texas-rancher-killed-ied-cartel/	2025-02-25T11:45:21-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67a15d5517b431.86435320.jpeg?w=900
Judge gives Trump administration two days to release billions of ...	WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday gave the Trump administration less than two days to release billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, saying the administration had given no sign of complying with his nearly two-week-old court order to ease its funding freeze. The lawsuit was filed by nonprofit organizations over the cutoff of foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development and State Department, which followed a Jan. 20 executive order by President Donald Trump targeting what he portrayed as wasteful programs that do not correspond to his foreign policy goals. Nonprofit groups and businesses that receive federal money for work abroad said the freeze breaks federal law and has shut down funding for even the most urgent life-saving programs abroad. Those USAID and State partners say the administration has stiffed them on billions of dollars in money already owed, forcing them to lay off tens of thousands of staffers and pushing some organizations toward financial ruin. U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali on Feb. 13 had ordered the administration at least temporarily to get funding flowing again, including to make good on its bills. Despite the order, USAID staffers and the businesses and nonprofit groups say they know of no payments that have gotten through. 'I’m not sure why I can’t get a straight answer from you on this: Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before Feb. 13,' the judge asked Indraneel Sur, the lawyer for the government. 'Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?' 'I’m not in a position to answer that,' Sur said. The case had been brought by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, representing health organizations receiving U.S. funds for work abroad. They had asked Ali to find the Trump administration in contempt of his earlier order. It’s the second time a judge has found the Trump administration did not follow a court order. U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island also found this month that the administration had not fully unfrozen federal grants and loans within the U.S., even after he blocked sweeping plans for a pause on trillions of dollars in government spending.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/ap-judge-gives-trump-administration-two-days-to-unfreeze-funds-for-us-foreign-aid/	2025-02-25T11:23:55-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67be19ba0e2ca4.37025492.jpeg?w=900

(NewsNation) — A Southwest Airlines plane and private jet almost collided at Midway Airport in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday morning. Video footage shows the Southwest plane making its way down the runway, when another aircraft comes in front of it. However, the crew of Southwest Flight 2504 initiated a 'go-round,' allowing the plane to avoid hitting the jet, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement to NewsNation. The business jet entered the runway without authorization around 8:50 a.m., the FAA said. It is now investigating. DOGE’s Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn’t been ‘stolen’ The FAA is also looking into a number of other incidents involving planes that happened this year, including the deadly collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and Black Hawk military helicopter.

A military plane crashed into the San Diego Bay; a plane crashed in Alaska and a medical jet crashed in Philadelphia in the first few weeks of 2025 as well.

Social Security Administration closes Office of Transformation	(NewsNation) — The Social Security Administration announced Monday that it closed its Office of Transformation and that employees who worked there will be put on administrative leave. In a statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek called it a 'redundant' office. 'President (Donald) Trump has mandated the Federal government eliminate wasteful and inefficient offices and the Office of Transformation was a prime example,' Dudek said. Elon Musk gives federal workers ‘another chance’ to justify jobs The Office of Transformation, according to its website, is responsible for 'strategic guidance and oversight of enterprise-wide initiatives, addressing policies, business processes and systems.' It also plans and coordinates projects involving customer service-related systems and projects. NewsNation has reached out to the Social Security Administration’s Press Office for more information, including how many employees are now on leave and what aspects of the office were wasteful. Last week, the Social Security Administration said it did an 'organizational realignment of the functions provided by its Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight. The administration said moving these functions allowed the agency to streamline layers of management; increase data sharing and 'speed the opportunities to identify fraud, waste, and abuse and implement needed solutions.' The Trump administration and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been working on cutting spending at federal agencies, as well as its workforce, through the Department of Government Efficiency Monday’s announcement by the SSA didn’t specifically mention DOGE, but Dudek did in a Feb. 19 statement after being confirmed by the Senate. He called it a 'critical part' of Trump’s agenda. DOGE has been controversial as some express concern that its cuts have gone too far and warn they could have negative effects on everyday citizens. In addition, experts have criticized DOGE by saying most of the 'savings' it has touted are driven more by ideological views than economic ones. While DOGE claims it found $55 billion in savings, touting layoffs, canceled contracts and lease renegotiations so far, a closer examination raises doubts about these numbers. On its website, DOGE lists these savings but has not provided evidence for approximately $38 billion of that — nearly 75% of its total claim, NewsNation has previously reported. Another analysis by The Associated Press showed that nearly 40% of the federal contracts the Trump administration says its canceled aren’t expected to save the government any money.

Authorities crack down on gun smuggling to cartels	(NewsNation) — As the Trump administration continues to focus on the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities are ramping up efforts to combat gun smuggling. The decision comes just after the State Department officially designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. That has raised fears of military action in Mexico and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has warned the U.S. not to invade. Meanwhile, Mexican cartels continue to rely on American firearms to supply their arsenal. Escobar: Turning bases into deportation hubs hurts military readiness These weapons are purchased and transported even through legal ports of entry before winding up in the hands of cartels. Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales, Arizona, recently seized 42 AK-47-style rifles in a cargo truck prior to the truck going through the port of entry and into Mexico. The port director there said, 'These powerful weapons were likely headed to cartels to protect their illicit fentanyl labs.' Retired Homeland Security agent Victor Avila told NewsNation that cartels use straw purchasers, individuals with clean records who can legally buy firearms, to purchase the guns and then smuggle them into Mexico. Now that cartels are officially designated as terror organizations those individuals could face harsher legal consequences. Trump to reinstate Title 42 border policy: Report 'Now you're providing weapons to a terrorist, just like if you were buying a gun for ISIS,' Avila said. 'You're now buying it for the Sinaloa Cartel, same exact thing. So those individuals can now be treated very differently.' Also in Arizona, a task force of federal and local authorities arrested two weapons smugglers, seizing nine guns and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition that were set for delivery to transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, according to Tuscon sector Border Patrol agents. Also on the border in Sonora, Mexico, officials are now discovering a scout site use for human smuggling, seizing two rifles and more than 800 rounds of ammunition. With Trump designating cartels as FTOs, Sheinbaum has fired back at the administration, saying U.S. authorities need to step up enforcement in curbing the flow of those firearms headed to Mexico. 14 indicted for alleged role in ‘prolific’ migrant smuggling operation She is now working on constitutional reforms in Mexico to expand and crack down on foreigners involved in gun smuggling. Sheinbaum says those reforms will call for the highest penalties to be applied to foreigners found guilty of gun smuggling. She's arguing that if cartels are terrorists, those supplying the weapons should be held accountable for aiding terrorism. While the majority of guns used by cartels are coming from the U.S., Avila told NewsNation that the military-grade weapons they use are still being acquired through the Mexican military.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/crack-down-gun-cartels/	2025-02-25T09:49:46-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/672e9e378cefa2.02033843.jpeg?w=900
Terror designation might prompt cartels to target Americans: Expe...	EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – The White House on Feb. 20 designated eight Latin American transnational criminal gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. They include Mexican drug cartels flooding American communities with fentanyl and other drugs, and Central and South American street gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua linked to violent acts in the United States. The designation empowers the Treasury Department and U.S. law enforcement to aggressively target financial resources these groups utilize to produce their product, wage war on each other and authorities, and terrorize civilians in their home countries. Did Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok 3 censor criticism of Trump? But it does not mean the American public will soon see the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division parachuting into mountains in Mexico or the Navy SEALs knocking down doors on cartel leaders’ mansions in Guadalajara, an international security expert says. 'You may have some advisers physically on the ground working with Mexican law enforcement, the military, army, navy, etc. But if they’re good advisers, you won’t even see them or hear about them,' said Michael Ballard, director of Intelligence for Global Guardian LLC. 'You are not going to have (an American) up front, putting the handcuffs on ‘El Mencho.’ It is going to be a Mexican security or law enforcement official doing that.' Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, aka 'El Mencho,' is the founder of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG. Nonetheless, the terror group designation and Mexico’s newfound willingness to give U.S. law enforcement more leeway south of the border will weigh heavily on the leaders of criminal organizations. It might even back them into a corner – which could pose risks for American officials and visitors to Mexico. 'You can view it as cooperation by coercion,' Ballard said of news reports, recently confirmed by the president of Mexico, of American drones flying south of the border and U.S. spy planes operating off the coast of Sinaloa. 'Twenty-five percent tariffs on exports were initially levied on Mexico and then suspended for 30 days pending more border security by the Mexican government; they agreed to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to help shore up security there.' President Claudia Sheinbaum last week emphasized the drones and U.S. planes were authorized by Mexico as part of binational cooperation. She also sent to her Congress a proposed constitutional amendment to criminalize unauthorized foreign incursions or activities in Mexico. 'The threat of tariffs seems to be a very effective kind of bargaining by the Trump administration to get what they want,' Ballard said. 'But I would guess at least for the first year, the drone flyovers, reconnaissance planes, the U.S. assistance with wiretapping, with electronic device intercepts ... that’s going to be the extent of it.' U.S. companies, visitors might get caught in the crossfire Trump’s executive order on cartels stems from statutes dating back to the 9/11 terror attacks, which the George W. Bush administration used to go after Al-Qaida. He targeted bank accounts and other property the group and its wide network of supporters used to launder money, buy weapons, vehicles and food for its operatives. 'It’s going to give FBI, DEA, CIA more levers they can pull going after shell companies and anyone helping them launder money – knowingly or unknowingly,' Ballard said. 'A lot of businesses that operate in Mexico are going to have to be very careful and scrutinize their operations to make sure they are not inadvertently breaking these new laws.' Fines are already in the books to prosecute Americans inadvertently engaging in international money laundering. The terror designation now could mean jail time, he said.

Subscribe Now Your Morning Submit if ( window.checkSizeClasses && window.checkSizeClasses instanceof Function) { window.checkSizeClasses(); } Also, the subsidiaries of American companies in Mexico occasionally have been targeted for extortion by local criminals threatening to disrupt their operations or harm their employees. From now on, giving in to those threats could be interpreted as funding a terrorist organization, Ballard said. Further, if the U.S. and Mexico begin to inflict serious damage on cartel finances or jailing many of its leaders, there’s always the risk that these groups will lash back. Worst-case scenario 'What are the cartels going to do? That is the big question everyone has,' Ballard said. 'My worst-case scenario is these cartels have a lot of money, lot of firepower, a lot of armored vehicles. [….] You could see these groups morph into an insurgency a la FARC and ELN in Colombia. Those groups started as insurgencies, as guerilla groups and used drugs to fund their militancy. You could see the same but in reverse with drug trafficking groups turn into militant groups.' More likely, if backed into a corner and laying low no longer serving a practical purpose, Mexican cartels could experience further fracturing and discard restraints on kidnappings and extortion. 'You could see some of these cartels targeting American businesspeople or travelers in a way they were previously afraid to do,' Ballard said. 'If your assets, your operations get disrupted, you may feel like, ‘What do I have to lose? The attention of U.S. is already here. We are already public enemy No. 1.’' Trump to reinstate Title 42 border policy: Report The private security expert says he has not yet seen indications that will come to pass. But Global Guardian is urging corporations and travelers to monitor the situation in Mexico. 'Be cautious, keep track of what is going on, especially if you’re traveling to cartel heavy areas. Mexico City has its share of crime but no cartels controlling street violence or trafficking. But Guadalajara sits in the CJNG area of influence. If you go there, consider extra security,' Ballard said. Tourist destinations should still be relatively safe during spring break. 'Mexico still depends to a significant degree on foreign dollars,' he said. 'If we start seeing rhetoric that they’re going to start targeting Americans, our messaging will change accordingly.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/cartels/cartels-terror-designation/	2025-02-25T08:35:38-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP21310015365861.jpg?w=900

Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., has told reporters it is increasingly likely lawmakers will need to pass a stopgap bill to keep the government funded into the fall. House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for the bill — and jokingly asking for prayers as negotiations continue. At an event in Louisiana, however, he maintained confidence that 'we're going to get everyone there.' DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Still, there are some doubts it can go forward. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., told NewsNation partner The Hill that 'there’s probably 10 (Republicans) that are really nervous about the situation.' A trio of Republicans, per The Hill, have said they will vote against the proposal. Supporters of the bill say it fulfills Trump's campaign promises and addresses his full agenda — including extending his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year. It would also provide about $300 billion in additional spending for the border and defense. However, the legislation also calls for up to $2 trillion in spending cuts, without laying out exactly what those would entail, along with a debt limit increase. The lack of detail about the potential cuts has some worried Medicaid is not off the table. Trump’s plan to end taxes on Social Security benefits would be costly 'I know the president has already indicated that he does not want to cut from beneficiaries,' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., said. 'That's important for me to hear. The speaker has said the same. But then the question remains — how do we get to that $880 billion in savings, and what does it mean for the tax cuts?' Democrats have slammed the tax cuts, saying they would only benefit the wealthy, but they have not put forward alternative legislation. Instead, they are working with the House Appropriations Committee on a bill that would temporarily avoid a government shutdown before the March 14 deadline.

Musk gives federal workers ‘another chance’ to justify jobs	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk on Monday said hundreds of thousands of federal employees have 'another chance' to justify their recent accomplishments or risk losing their jobs. 'Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination,' he wrote on social media, referring to an email asking federal employees to list five things they accomplished last week by 11:59 p.m. Monday. The directive appeared to contradict guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, which told federal departments and agencies responses were voluntary. Multiple federal agencies had instructed employees to disregard Musk's initial email, at least temporarily. There is no word yet on how many federal workers complied with the original directive. Federal workers rattled by Musk's ultimatum Musk, who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency, sent an email to hundreds of thousands of federal employees Saturday, giving them roughly 48 hours to report five specific things they had accomplished during the week prior. In a separate message posted on social media, Musk said any employee who failed to respond by the deadline — set in the email as 11:59 p.m. EST Monday — would lose their job. The OPM issued a memo Monday to federal departments and agencies, clarifying that it was not mandatory for workers to respond to the email. Could DOGE layoffs at the IRS impact your tax return? The office later clarified individual agencies must decide if they require responses and to determine the consequences of those who fail to do so. It added that agencies should consider whether the 'accomplishment bullets' should be integrated into the agency's weekly activity report. President Donald Trump signaled his support of Musk early Monday. Federal workers blast Musk-caused 'chaos' Musk’s unusual demand has faced resistance from several key U.S. agencies led by the president’s loyalists — including the FBI, State Department, Homeland Security and the Pentagon — which instructed their employees over the weekend not to comply. Lawmakers in both parties said that Musk’s mandate may be illegal, while unions are threatening to sue. Amid federal budget cuts, NewsNation has received messages from workers affected by the layoffs, with some departments letting longtime workers go. One federal worker from the Department of Health and Human Services shared an email with NewsNation they received at 5 p.m. ET Monday night. 'No HHS expectation that HHS employees respond to OPM and there is no impact to your employment with the agency if you choose not to respond,' the email read. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum However, if employees did respond, they were advised to tailor their answers as if 'malign foreign actors' might read them. A Veterans Affairs worker told NewsNation that some nurses came in on their day off Monday, bringing their children, to fill out the required bullet points. These workers were unable to access email from home due to firewall restrictions, creating anxiety about possible consequences. One VA worker expressed concern about how these changes could impact veterans’ services. 'Making efficient is one thing, shrinking and crippling is another,' the employee said. 'Ultimately, they are taking away protection and support for Americans. That is what I am most concerned about.'

Menendez brothers' evidence suggesting sexual abuse not credible:...	(NewsNation) — Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman fired back at Mark Geragos, the Menendez brothers‘ attorney, dismissing his criticism and doubling down on his rejection of new evidence in the case. 'These new pieces of evidence add nothing to the self-defense argument. They are only additional information,' Hochman said Monday during an exclusive appearance on 'Banfield.' 'To meet the rigorous standards to get a new trial, this evidence doesn't come close.' What is the new evidence in the Menendez brothers' case? Hochman told reporters the evidence featured in the brothers’ habeas corpus petition had been made public for years prior. Their lawyers filed the petition in May of 2023, asking a judge to consider evidence suggesting they were sexually abused by their father. Last week, Geragos accused Hochman of rehashing outdated prosecutorial platitudes: 'The ’90s were calling, and they wanted their DA’s office back,' he said. A hearing about the resentencing was scheduled for January but postponed until March due to the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. Menendez brothers found guilty of murder in 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The brothers have spent nearly 35 years behind bars. Erik Menendez (C) and his brother Lyle (L) are pictured, on August 12, 1991 in Beverly Hills.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) At the brothers' original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success. Since then, the brothers have had the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that, in today's world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life. Police search for leads in 1985 cold case of missing UNC student found in river One piece of evidence — a letter from Erik Menendez to his cousin Andy Cano in 1988 — claimed the brothers’ father, Jose Menendez, was sexually abusing them.

DOGE's Elon Musk to visit Fort Knox to ensure gold hasn't been 's...	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump said during his speech at the CPAC conference that Elon Musk will be reviewing Fort Knox, the depository in Kentucky for American gold reserves, to ensure that gold still exists there. 'We're going to open up the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox,' Trump said. 'I don't want to open it and the cupboards are bare.' Inside Texas DPS’ war on human, drug smuggling According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, an audit is done on Fort Knox every year, and 'all the gold is present and accounted for.' What is the Fort Knox depository? The United States Bullion Depository, located at Fort Knox in Kentucky, has stored reserves for the United States since 1937. It is also used as the Army's human resources command center and is where the largest annual training for the Army is held each summer. Fort Knox is about 35 miles south of Louisville, Kentucky, and is over 100,000 acres. It was created during World War I as Camp Knox, an artillery range named after Major General Henry Knox, according to the Kentucky Historical Society Foundation. During World War II, the Army created the Armored Force there, ordering thousands of soldiers to go to Fort Knox and be introduced to the tank. It was known as the 'Home of Cavalry and Armor' for almost 80 years, according to The Associated Press. Elon Musk’s underground digital detective reveals all to NewsNation Then, in 2005, the Armor Center and School was moved to Georgia, and the Human Resource Command Center of Excellence was created in Fort Knox. How much gold is at Fort Knox? According to the United States Mint, the amount of gold holdings at Fort Knox currently adds up to 147.3 million ounces, with half of the Treasury's stored gold being kept there. The only gold that has ever been removed was extremely small to test the purity during the regularly scheduled audits. Those samples are the only gold from Fort Knox that has been transferred to or from the depository for years. The gold's book value is currently at $42.22 per ounce. The depository has about $436 billion worth of gold, according to Forbes. However, the government says the value of gold at Fort Knox is only $6 billion. Is Fort Knox secure? The depository is seen as extremely secure, with no one person having knowledge of every single procedure to open the vault, according to The Associated Press. FORT KNOX, KY - JULY 01: A cadet wielding an M249 fires in the direction of their opposing forces near the objective while other cadets move forward in Training Area 9 during Army ROTC Cadet Summer Training on July 1, 2021 in Fort Knox, Kentucky. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) The only things that are publicly known include when the facility was built and how it was made. In 1936, the depository was made with 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel. It is heavily guarded and has only allowed visitors three separate times. One visit was on Sept. 23, 1974, when the vault was opened to journalists and a congressional delegation. Before this, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only person to access the vaults. The second visit was on Aug. 24, 2017, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and congressional representatives visited. Why is Elon Musk visiting Fort Knox? The main reason is to see if the gold is still there. Starting last week, Musk posted on X, questioning if the gold was still present: 'Who is confirming that gold wasn't stolen from Fort Knox? Maybe it's there, maybe it's not. That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it's still there.' Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum While there has been no evidence of missing gold at Fort Knox up to this point, Musk still posted on X, saying that there should be a live video walkthrough of the depository. Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday that it would be easy to have Fort Knox audited if that's what Trump wants. 'The gold was there when I visited it, and I hope nobody's moved it. I'm sure they haven't,' he added. Is this visit part of Elon Musk's DOGE initiatives? This visit doesn't seem directly related to the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) initiative to cut government spending.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-elon-musk-fort-knox-visit/	2025-02-24T14:21:01-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-515113728.jpg?w=900
Vivek Ramaswamy announces campaign for Ohio governor	(NewsNation) — Tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy launched his campaign for Ohio governor on Monday. The Cincinnati native joins Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and Heather Hill in the 2026 GOP primary race to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine. The candidates are running the former bellwether state that has shifted red in recent years, having voted for President Donald Trump in the last three elections. On Monday Trump gave Ramaswamy his 'COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT' in a Truth Social post that reads in part: 'I know him well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He's Young, Strong, and Smart!' DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for Ramaswamy has never run for public office in Ohio but is positioned to be a party favorite for the governor's seat with his connections to Trump and Vice President JD Vance, formerly an Ohio senator. Ramaswamy has already received support from many politicians including Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Ramaswamy sought the 2024 GOP nomination for president before dropping out to endorse Trump. Musk’s DOGE moves will ‘turn out more Democrats than Obama’: Carville He was later tapped to co-chair the Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk but then withdrew from the position, saying the job would hold him back from campaigning.

Could DOGE layoffs at the IRS impact your tax return?	(NewsNation) — The IRS has laid off 6,700 workers as part of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's goals with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These aren't the only federal workers that have been laid off, but one of the biggest questions Americans have right now is, 'Will the IRS layoffs impact my tax returns?' It is hard to know for sure. Adam Brewer, a tax attorney with AB Tax Law, told NewsNation that it's 'not an ideal time for layoffs.' However, he doesn't believe that it will affect many Americans, especially those who file electronically. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum These layoffs are happening as IRS employees who were involved in tax season were told earlier in February that they would not be allowed to accept the buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer-filling deadline. How could your tax return be impacted by IRS layoffs? If you file your return electronically, instead of by paper, then these layoffs might not affect your returns. 'Those taxpayers who always file by paper, I would say this is the year to cut that out,' Brewer said. 'You need to get with the times, so to speak.' Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told reporters that this could be a 'disaster for revenue.' According to the Associated Press, Williamson said, 'When you underpay and understaff the IRS, the agency doesn't have the power or the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax evaders with their high-priced lawyers.' Former President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, giving the IRS $80 billion and the ability to hire thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement. Are tax refund delays possible after IRS layoffs? Democrats from the Senate Finance Committee have warned about possible tax refund delays. In a statement, they said, 'Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement efforts.' Idaho judge unseals Bryan Kohberger closed hearing transcripts On the other hand, Brewer told NewsNation that, if you are someone who files electronically and receives your refund through direct deposit, there most likely won't be a delay. 'But, let's not take our eye off the ball. There's also a government shutdown that is possible mid-March. And so, should that happen, you know, that's really above my pay grade,' Brewer said. He also said he is more worried about the potential government shutdown causing delays.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/could-doge-layoffs-irs-impact-tax-return/	2025-02-24T09:30:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/01/6785723cca55f6.01223281.jpeg?w=900
Trump, Macron expected to discuss Russia-Ukraine war, tariffs	(NewsNation) — President Donald Trump is meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday amid uncertainty regarding the future of longstanding alliances between the United States and European countries. Trump campaigned on quickly ending the war in Ukraine and has shifted the foreign policy landscape by speaking directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin in defiance of international efforts to freeze Putin out. Trump is conducting the negotiations without input from European leadership or Ukrainian officials and set up a meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. He has also repeatedly attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling the elected leader a dictator. Federal workers sue Elon Musk over email ultimatum Trump has falsely said Ukraine started the war, when it was Russia that invaded the country in February of 2022. Trump has made unprecedented demands on other European countries, including a desire to take over Greenland, which is currently under the control of Denmark, and demanding half of Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for American support in the war and as back pay for previous assistance. He has also made demands in other areas of the world, suggesting the U.S. take over Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal. There are fears those desires could shift the geopolitical landscape and bring an end to the country's role as a leading force for global stability and as an economic and moral leader. Pentagon investigating UFO whistleblower claims 'The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,' said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations and now a professor at Northwestern University. Macron is expected to tell Trump that the U.S. and Europe should not show weakness to Russia and that how the negotiations are handled could impact future U.S. relations with China. However, Trump has long shown a level of respect and support for Putin that separates him from other Western leaders. He has often repeated Russian talking points in his campaign rallies and statements as president. Agriculture secretary will ‘do something’ about egg prices: Trump That has led to fears the European-U.S. alliance could be in jeopardy and sparked concerns of cracks in NATO with global consequences. European leaders meeting with Trump hope to shore up traditional ties and persuade Trump to include them in negotiations regarding Ukraine. Another topic likely to be addressed is Trump's plan for 'reciprocal tariffs' on goods, which his administration is expected to determine on a country-by-country basis. On Thursday, Trump is set to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Inside Texas DPS' war on human, drug smuggling	(NewsNation) — With migrant encounters continuing to trend downward on the border and President Trump pressuring Mexico to crack down on illegal immigration, the southern border isn’t seeing the thousands of migrants arriving like it did just a year ago. But that doesn't mean the crisis is over. There are still thousands of migrants in Mexico stuck in limbo after President Trump ended the CBP One Program. Now, smugglers in Mexico are capitalizing on the desperation of migrants and charging up to $18,000 to be smuggled across the Rio Grande. CBP credits Trump administration for 94% drop in border crossings NewsNation rode along with Texas State Troopers in the Rio Grande Valley, an area seeing an uptick in smuggling with migrants now trying to enter the U.S. undetected while smugglers look to make a sizeable profit. Within NewsNation's first hour with Texas Trooper Guadalupe Casarez, he received an alert from a camera showing individuals entering the U.S. illegally and attempting to hide in the brush. Border Patrol agents and Texas National Guard troops also arrived on the scene. NewsNation followed Casarez as he and BP agents cleared the brush and tracked the individuals' footsteps, eventually leading him to two Mexican nationals lying on the ground, attempting to hide from authorities. The men were handcuffed and said they planned to head to San Antonio. Instead, they could now face charges for smuggling. Border Patrol checked the two migrants closely — looking for tattoos or other signs that could link them to a gang or criminal group. Smugglers in Mexico are now moving in smaller groups, looking for areas not patrolled by Texas Troopers, the National Guard, or Border Patrol — all working together to deter smugglers. Plan for bounty hunters to pursue migrants has controls: Lawmaker In the Rio Grande Valley, Texas DPS troopers and Border Patrol are also working to stop drugs from entering the U.S. Last week, the two agencies intercepted 187 pounds of narcotics, arresting three Mexican nationals in Cameron County. The three men now face prosecution. Texas National Guard troops have arrested and processed migrants who attempted to enter near Roma, Texas, a location that has become a hotspot for migrant and drug smuggling in recent weeks. The goal for authorities here on the border is to stay one step ahead of smugglers in Mexico, who are now seeking to capitalize on the desperation of migrants still in Mexico looking for a way to enter the U.S.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/texas-dps-war-on-smuggling/	2025-02-24T08:05:30-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/Texas-DPS-mounted-1.png?w=900
Idaho judge unseals Bryan Kohberger closed hearing transcripts	(NewsNation) —Transcripts from a closed hearing conducted by attorneys representing the University of Idaho killing suspect Bryan Kohberger were unsealed by an Idaho judge Monday. Ada County Judge Steven Hippler unsealed the 175-page partially redacted transcript of several witness interviews including law enforcement. The deaths of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Gonclaves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022, shocked the small town of Moscow, Idaho. The four students were stabbed in their home, with two of their surviving roommates finding them in the morning. Initially, investigators had few leads and spent considerable time tracing the activities of the four students in the hours prior to their deaths. However, after a little over a month, police arrested Kohberger for the crimes. Kohberger, accused of killing the four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty if convicted, a judge ruled last November. Attorneys for Kohberger claimed local police detectives were too broad in the search warrant that gave them access to Kohberger’s apartment, car and electronic devices. Those searches led to the discovery of evidence that police say connects Kohberger to the killing of the four students.

Western leaders visit Kyiv and pledge military support against Ru...	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than a dozen Western leaders attended events in Ukraine on Monday marking the third anniversary of the country's war with Russia, many pledging more military aid in a conspicuous show of support for Kyiv as uncertainty deepened over the commitment of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to helping it fend off Russia’s invasion. The fourth year of fighting could be pivotal, as Trump uses his return to office last month to press for a peace deal. But Ukrainian and European officials have been rattled by his cordial approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his tough words for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. World security is at stake in talks over how the war ends, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' she told a conference in Kyiv. Some observers say Russian success in Ukraine could embolden China’s own ambitions. Just as Moscow claims that Ukraine is rightfully Russian territory, China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own. In a cascade of unwelcome developments for Kyiv, Trump has in recent days called Zelenskyy a dictator, suggested Ukraine is to blame for the war and ended Putin’s three-year diplomatic isolation by the United States. U.S. officials have also indicated to Ukraine that its hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably won’t get back the land that Russia’s army has occupied, amounting to nearly 20% of the country. Meanwhile, Putin’s troops are making steady progress on the battlefield while Ukraine is grappling with shortages of troops and weapons. Some of Ukraine’s most important backers, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the stream of dignitaries arriving by train in Kyiv. Others spoke at a conference via video link. The guests had similar messages: Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin’s ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense. Alarm bells sound in Europe as Washington changes course The shift in Washington's policy has set off alarm bells in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal and are mulling how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The changes have also placed strain on transatlantic relations. European Council President Antonio Costa on Sunday announced that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' he said in a post on social media. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are to both visit Washington this week. EU foreign ministers on Monday approved a new raft of sanctions against Russia. The measures target Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities' — usually government agencies, banks or companies. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would provide a 1 billion-euro ($1.04 billion) military systems package to Ukraine this year. Starmer said Ukrainians’ voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace,' while Trump’s intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' he said. Coming off a victory in Sunday’s German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X Monday: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. Diplomacy ramps up after record Russian drone attack On Sunday, Russia launched its biggest single drone attack of the war, pounding Ukraine with 267 drones. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she was chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Washington and Moscow draw closer U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the third anniversary was 'a grim milestone.' 'More than 12,600 civilians killed, with many more injured. Entire communities reduced to rubble. Hospitals and schools destroyed,' he said in Geneva. Russia's foreign ministry said Saturday that preparations for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin were underway, and U.S. officials have said that they had agreed with Moscow to reestablish diplomatic ties and restart economic cooperation. Kallas rejected Trump’s earlier inflammatory assertion that Zelenskyy was a dictator for not having held elections after his regular term expired last year, saying, 'Russia hasn’t had elections in 25 years.' Ukrainian law prohibits elections being held while martial law is in place, and Zelenksyy said as recently as Sunday that after martial law is lifted, 'there will be elections and people will make their choice.' ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/ap-foreign-leaders-visit-ukraines-capital-to-mark-3rd-war-anniversary/	2025-02-24T05:20:15-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67bc726ddd5989.49597104.jpeg?w=900
DOGE claims it has saved billions, but nearly 75% unaccounted for	WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — As Elon Musk and the Trump administration increase efforts to reduce the federal government workforce, critics are voicing concerns over the chaotic and seemingly random cuts being made across Washington. However, some Republicans argue this is what voters want from the administration. But as the Department of Government Efficiency announces billions in government budget cuts, the question remains: is it actually saving as much money as it claims? Some of the items listed on DOGE's public listing of the billions of dollars in purported savings don't seem to add up as the agency suggests. DOGE receipts aren't adding up DOGE claims it has found $55 billion in savings, touting layoffs, canceled contracts, lease renegotiations and fraud detection in the first month of the second Trump administration. However, a closer examination of the numbers raises doubts about these claims. The website's listing mentions USAID and the Department of Education as the two largest agencies contributing to contract savings. It even features a 'wall of receipts' showing the reported spending slashes. How much federal data has Trump really purged? Despite claiming billions of dollars in savings, DOGE has not provided evidence for approximately $38 billion of that — nearly 75% of its total claim. For example, DOGE claims to have saved $8 billion by canceling a tech support contract for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Diversity and Civil Rights. However, that contract value was worth just $8 million, with the $8 billion figure likely due to a clerical error from when the government first filed the contract. Despite apparent accounting issues, Republicans continue to voice their support for Musk and DOGE. 'I think American voters like the intensity and focus that they've seen from 30-some days of this administration — going about doing the things they told voters they were going to do. Doing the things they were elected to do,' Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said on 'FOX News Sunday.' 'When you're staring down $36 trillion in debt and counting, obviously something has to give, and I think that's what we're seeing right now. A comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government,' Rep. Mike Lawler, R-NY, said on ABC's 'This Week.' DOGE has stated it will update its savings website twice a week, so corrections could be forthcoming. Poll: Just 37% of Americans think DOGE is cutting waste Several new polls suggest Americans are growing uneasy about DOGE and its results. A poll from Emerson College and the Washington Post shows more Americans disapprove of Musk's handling of DOGE. That's in line with a Pew Research Center poll that puts Musk's favorability rating at 42%. The Washington Post found that just 37% think DOGE is cutting wasteful spending. Elon Musk responds to ‘DOGE check’ suggestion A Morning Consult Pro poll shows that number is even lower, reporting that 31% think shrinking the government should be a top priority for the administration. Musk, Trump float DOGE stimulus checks idea However, that sentiment could change if the administration's proposed plan for DOGE stimulus checks becomes a reality. The plan claims to put as much as 20% of whatever the agency cuts from the federal budget directly into Americans' pockets.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/doge-claims-saved-billions-38b-unaccounted-for/	2025-02-24T04:34:47-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/67abd7fbe34323.91974328.jpeg?w=900
Pope Francis awake, resting after 10th night in hospital	(NewsNation) — Pope Francis woke Monday morning and is resting after spending a 10th night at Gemelli Hospital in Rome, battling early signs of kidney failure, the Vatican said. 'The night went well; the Pope slept and is resting,' the Holy See Press Office said in a one-line statement Monday. The 88-year-old pontiff was hospitalized for bronchitis Feb. 14 and subsequently treated for double pneumonia. He received blood transfusions and high levels of oxygen over the weekend and remains in 'critical condition.' Pope Francis has ‘mild’ kidney failure: What is it? This hospital stay is tied for the longest hospitalization of his papacy. In 2021, Francis spent 10 days at Gemelli Hospital for a partial colon removal, according to the Associated Press. Doctors said their biggest concern now is the risk of germs that could enter his bloodstream and cause sepsis, a life-threatening infection. Medical staff said he will stay hospitalized at least through next weekend.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-10th-night-hospital/	2025-02-24T03:08:02-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/12/6766d67e66a947.38047520.jpeg?w=900
2,000 USAID staff to be cut, others put on administrative leave	The Trump administration is putting all civil servants employed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on administrative leave beginning Monday at midnight, according to a notice reviewed by The Hill. At the same time, 2,000 staff are expected to be cut from the agency in the U.S., part of a 'Reduction-in-Force,' reads the notice delivered from the Office of the Administrator. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is the acting USAID administrator, but no name is on the order. The notice comes following a federal judge on Friday refusing to renew a temporary block against the Trump administration and its intent to fire or place on 'administrative leave' thousands of employees. Musk doubles down on email ultimatum after agencies push back Following the order, hundreds of employees contracted to work with USAID were fired. In one bureau providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance, one USAID official estimated the firing of contractors cut staff by between 40 and 60 percent. 'There is no one left to do any work,' the USAID official said, requesting anonymity to protect against retaliation. The move to eliminate thousands of USAID’s workforce marks another chapter in the Trump administration’s attack on the independent agency, the primary venue for America’s distribution of lifesaving humanitarian and developmental assistance. The Trump administration first ordered all staff be put on administrative leave Feb. 2, which was initially blocked by a court order six days later. President Trump and his officials have focused on dismantling the agency in the wake of an initial blanket freeze on all U.S. foreign assistance. While Rubio said he is approving waivers to exempt lifesaving humanitarian assistance and allow that USAID work to continue, the mass reductions in staff are eliminating key roles for carrying it out. Trump delegated tech billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to root out what he and his supporters describe as wasteful and fraudulent spending and accused USAID of operating with a liberal bias. What is DOGE, and what’s it doing? The administrator’s order putting staff on administrative leave impacts all USAID staff in the U.S. and around the world. Some staff are expected to be notified by 5 p.m. Feb. 23 that they are exempt, with their positions deemed 'mission critical,' part of 'core leadership and/or specially designated programs.' The administration further is recalling overseas personnel, providing a 'voluntary Agency-funded return travel program and other benefits,' according to another notice reviewed by The Hill. In the court ruling issued Friday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols said USAID employees 'overstated' the harm those employees stood to face if put on administrative leave. 'The record now reflects that no USAID employee stationed abroad has been or imminently will be required to return to the United States within thirty days,' Nichols wrote. 'Rather, as matters presently stand, USAID employees stationed abroad have been given a choice.' The administrative leave order likely impacts the agency's civil servant workforce, staff who undergo thorough and exhaustive hiring procedures, are vetted for classified security clearances, are highly educated and experienced, and are put in the system with an expectation of decades of service. Trump suggests Musk needs to be ‘more aggressive’ One USAID official, who requested anonymity to protect against retaliation, described the past month as 'psychological torment.' While staff on administrative leave may retain access to their emails and USAID systems, they are not permitted to do work. 'If most civil servants in D.C. go back on admin leave tonight, you will have a few handfuls of civil servants left and they cannot do the work — in skill set or in numbers — of the bureau,' the USAID official said. 'We are, for now, dead. Last night and all week we lost centuries of collective experience.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/usaid-staff-cuts/	2025-02-23T15:27:10-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25053685599397-e1740253277560.jpg?w=900
Pope Francis has 'mild' kidney failure: What is it?	(NEXSTAR) — Doctors revealed Sunday that blood tests for Pope Francis, the 88-year-old pontiff who has been hospitalized since Valentine's Day after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened, show early kidney failure. Every day, roughly 360 people in the U.S. begin treatment (either dialysis or a transplant) for kidney failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A patient is considered to be experiencing kidney failure if under 15 percent of their kidney is 'working normally,' the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases says. Pope Francis remains in ‘critical condition’ with signs of early kidney failure Some of Pope Francis' blood tests showed 'initial, mild, kidney failure,' but doctors said it was under control. The Vatican did not provide any details about Pope Francis' condition or what treatment, if any, he was receiving for his kidney failure. Candles are seen near pictures of Pope Francis outside the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome, Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025, where the Pontiff is hospitalized since Feb. 14. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) There are some early warning signs of kidney failure — fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, difficulty concentrating, swelling, change in urination frequency, cramps, dry skin, and food tasting metallic among them — but they may go unnoticed early on, per the Cleveland Clinic. During kidney failure, one or both of a person's kidneys will no longer function well on their own, the Cleveland Clinic explains. In some cases, kidney failure is temporary and develops quickly. In others, it can be a long-term condition that worsens over time. Should the condition worsen, it can reach end-stage kidney disease, or ESKD. This stage, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is deadly without the proper treatment. With it, however, patients can 'have a good quality of life while [they] manage kidney failure.' While doctors did not indicate what may have caused Francis' kidney failure, the National Kidney Foundation says diabetes and high blood pressure comprise roughly two-thirds of cases. Other potential causes include various forms of kidney damage and genetic disorders. Prebiotic sodas: What are they, and why are they everywhere? Those experiencing kidney failure may be at a higher risk of experiencing heart disease, stroke, and anemia, among other complications. Francis developed anemia and, during blood transfusions on Saturday, was given hematin, a treatment designed to increase the level of hemoglobin in his blood, which in turn helps the blood carry more oxygen. Doctors reported Sunday that the therapy had been beneficial. The National Kidney Foundation notes that high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke can both cause kidney disease and occur as a result of it. There is no cure for kidney failure but treatment plans, medications, eating plans, and an active lifestyle can help those living with it, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explains. The life expectancy of someone experiencing kidney failure can vary depending on 'many things,' the American Kidney Fund says, including age and treatment plan. When will this cold winter end? NOAA releases hopeful outlook The Vatican described Francis as remaining in critical condition but alert and 'well-oriented' on Sunday, adding that he attended Mass. He had also not experienced any more respiratory crises since Saturday night but was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen. 'The complexity of the clinical picture, and the necessary wait for drug therapies to provide some feedback, dictate that the prognosis remains guarded,' Francis' doctors concluded.

ROME (AP) — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday after it was diverted due to a security issue, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA did not elaborate on what the security issue was, but said it was reported by crew aboard American Airlines Flight 292. American Airlines did not return multiple messages seeking comment. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. ROME (AP) — An American Airlines flight en route from New York to New Delhi turned around over the Caspian Sea on Sunday and landed in Rome, a spokesman with the Leonardo da Vinci International Airport said. The spokesman, Francesco Garibaldi did not give the reason for the change in flight plans. He said security checks would be performed as soon as the 199 passengers on board, plus the crew, leave the plane. An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. The airport continue to operate normally, the spokesman said.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/travel/american-airlines-flight-from-new-york-to-delhi-makes-unscheduled-landing-in-rome/	2025-02-23T09:57:41-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/AP25054621687537-e1740331890966.jpg?w=900
Surviving Hamas: The story of Keith Siegel, an Israeli American h...	(NewsNation) — Tortured, starved and holding onto life without lights or water, Keith Siegel’s story is one of survival. In Hamas captivity for 484 days during the war in Gaza, the Israeli American was released Feb. 1, along with two other hostages that day. He was the first American to be freed. Though he’s doing 'OK' now, Keith didn’t think he would live to see freedom, his wife told NewsNation's 'Morning in America with Hena Doba' Sunday morning. This undated photo provided by Hostages Family Forum shows Keith Siegel, who was abducted and brought to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. (Hostages Family Forum via AP) 'He went through so many days of torture and so many times of minutes that he didn't think that he would survive,' said Aviva Siegel, a survivor herself. American-Israeli hostage ‘born again’ after Hamas release: Father In the beginning of Keith's transition to freedom, he wanted to be alone, Aviva said, but she understood. A redeeming moment following the tragedy was meeting his grandchildren. 'They all cried. And to see my grandson that's 10 years old crying and just hugging kids and not letting go,' Aviva said. 'We are just the happiest people in Earth to have him back.' Surviving Hamas A man, identified as Keith Siegel, 64, speaks in a video released by Hamas on April 27, 2024, that appeared to show two Israeli hostages who have been held in the Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in this screen grab taken from a handout video. (Credit: Hamas Military Wing/Handout via Reuters) Hamas militants paraded him in front of a crowd, a consistent feature of the hostage releases in which some smiled and waved despite appearing physically weak. 'For the last half a year, he was lying on the mattress on the floor. And he was alone most of the time. He didn't have anybody to talk to anybody to feel that he's with somebody, just with the Arabs and with the Hamas terrorists.' He lost 50 kilograms – 110 pounds. 'We're going to bring back the hostages': Ex-Israeli PM Keith recorded a message about his experience after he was released. 'I was starved and I was tortured, both physically and emotionally,' Keith said in the video. 'When the war intensified, the terrorists who helped me treated me even worse than usual. Terrorists kicked me, spat on me and held me with no water, no light and no air to breathe.' Now that her husband is home, Aviva said she feels 'like a different person,' but she is heartbroken for the families who haven’t been reunited with their loved ones, saying captivity is like 'going through hell.' 'Nobody in this world should go through with what I went through and what Keith went through,' she said. She was held hostage for nearly two months, released long before her husband.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admonished Hamas’ actions, calling the charades 'disgraceful ceremonies.' Hamas has said it would release four hostages next week. Netanyahu’s ultimatum puts the phase-two negotiations and the fate of the remaining living hostages into question as the war drags on past 500 days. Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas’ body returned to family after ID mix-up On Saturday, six hostages were liberated in the final release of the first phase of the three-part ceasefire deal. Last week was an unexpected rollercoaster of emotions when it came to another family, the Bibases. Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas’ body was supposed to be returned last week, along with the bodies of her two sons and another hostage, Oded Lifshitz. Hamas had turned over the wrong body to Israel, now determined to be that of an unidentified Palestinian woman. Days later, Bibas' body was returned to her family. Hearing the news, 'just broke my heart ... I think it's just a slap in the face,' Aviva said. 'I didn't even think that they're able to do something so cruel. But they did.' Her message to the Israeli government: 'Get them out now. Don't even think of (causing) any problems because we need them back now. We need them back alive.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/surviving-hamas-keith-siegel-israeli-american-hostage/	2025-02-23T08:35:20-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2040411422.jpg?w=900
Musk doubles down on email ultimatum; Patel tells FBI staff to wa...	(NewsNation) — Elon Musk has reiterated the need for federal government employees to explain their weekly tasks as he and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) look to scale back operations. Musk, who was hand-picked by President Trump to examine and cut federal spending, explained why he believes it is necessary on X on Sunday. 'The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!' he said. 'In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.' Hegseth defends Trump’s firings of Pentagon leaders and says there may be more dismissals Musk announced on Saturday that civil servants will be asked to send an email explaining what they accomplished last week. Those who don’t comply will be fired, he said. Newly-appointed FBI Director Kash Patel sent a message to the FBI workforce on Saturday night telling them not to reply to the emails. 'The FBI through the Ofice of the Director, is in charge of all our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,' Patel wrote. 'When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.'	https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/elon-musk-doubles-down-fed-workers-explanation/	2025-02-23T08:10:42-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/02/GettyImages-2187754492.jpg?w=900
Trump directs ICE agents to find, deport unaccompanied migrant ch...	WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Trump administration is directing immigration agents to track down hundreds of thousands of migrant children who entered the United States without their parents, expanding the president's mass deportation effort, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo outlines an unprecedented push to target migrant children who crossed the border illegally as unaccompanied minors. It lays out four phases of implementation, beginning with a planning phase on January 27, though it did not provide a start date for enforcement operations. More than 600,000 immigrant children have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or legal guardian since 2019, according to government data, as the number of migrants caught crossing illegally reached record levels. Tens of thousands have been ordered deported over the same time frame, including more than 31,000 for missing court hearings, immigration court data show. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment about the memo and the Trump administration's plans. During his first term, Trump introduced a 'zero tolerance' policy that led to the separation of migrant children from their parents at the border. The children were sent to children's shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a government agency housed within the Department of Health and Human Services, while their parents were detained or deported. The separation of families, including babies from nursing mothers, was met with widespread international outrage. Trump halted the policy in 2018, though up to 1,000 children may still remain separated from parents, according to Lee Gelernt, the lead American Civil Liberties Union attorney in a related legal challenge. As well as enforcing immigration laws, the memo, headlined the 'Unaccompanied Alien Children Joint Initiative Field Implementation,' said the initiative aims to ensure that children are not victims of human trafficking or other forms of exploitation. The memo said the children would be served a notice to appear in immigration court or deported, if deportation orders were pending against them. In the memo, ICE said it had collected data from a number of sources on unaccompanied minors and sorted them into three priority groups, 'flight risk', 'public safety' and 'border security.' It directed agents to focus on children deemed 'flight risks' - including those ordered deported for missing court hearings and those released to sponsors who are not blood relatives. The agency uses several databases and government records to track down targets. DNA tests Under the law, migrants who have exhausted their legal options to stay can be removed, even if they are children. But the U.S. government has limited resources and typically prioritizes arresting adults with criminal records. Unaccompanied children began arriving in large numbers a decade ago due to violence and economic instability in their home countries - and U.S. immigration policies that enabled them to enter and often remain. The majority are from Central America and Mexico. Some migrated to join parents already in the United States; many traveled with family members or smugglers. From ORR custody, children are released to sponsors, usually parents or relatives, as immigration authorities weigh their cases to remain in the country. Trump's border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly claimed that some 300,000 unaccompanied children went missing during Biden's presidency and were at risk of trafficking and exploitation. Beyond initial follow-up calls, ORR was not obligated to track the whereabouts of the children after they left custody. Many are now adults or living with their parents. Individual ICE field offices will determine 'how to best locate, make contact, and serve immigration documents as appropriate for individual targets, when conducting enforcement actions,' involving unaccompanied children, the memo said. Because the children often live in households with adults without authorization to be in the United States, their addresses could also help ICE boost its overall arrest numbers. During his first administration, Trump used data gathered to vet sponsors of unaccompanied children to target them for arrests. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has taken steps to tighten vetting of sponsors. These include requiring sponsors and adult household members to submit fingerprints for background checks, according to guidance issued last week. The Trump administration has also expanded its access to ORR's database of children and their sponsors, two sources familiar with the matter said. Mellissa Harper, a former ICE official who now heads ORR, told a staff meeting on Thursday that the agency plans to use DNA tests to establish familial relationships, one of the sources said. It was unclear whether DNA tests would be used only on cases that raised a red flag, or on a routine basis. Harper said at the meeting that ICE was pursuing 247,000 tips related to fraud, trafficking and smuggling of unaccompanied minors and referring cases to the FBI for further investigation, the person said.

Pope Francis remains in 'critical condition' after blood transfus...	(NewsNation) — Pope Francis had a 'peaceful night' Saturday after receiving blood transfusions and high levels of oxygen to treat his double pneumonia, the Vatican said Sunday, but remains in 'critical condition.' Francis took to social media to express his gratitude to supporters, writing, 'I've recently received many messages of affection, and I've been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children. Thank you for your closeness, and for the consoling prayers I have received from all over the world.' The pontiff, who entered the papacy at age 76 in 2013, is being treated at Gemelli Hospital in Italy where he was initially admitted for bronchitis on Feb.14. He has missed Sunday Mass in back-to-back weeks after suffering a severe and prolonged respiratory crisis requiring oxygen. Pope Francis’ health ‘looking very serious’: Vatican reporter Though not on a ventilator, Francis is struggling to breathe and is keeping his movement limited, according to officials. Still, he remains alert, sitting upright, working and joking, though a bit more fatigued than the day before. The pope also received blood transfusions after tests revealed thrombocytopenia, a condition of abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood. Doctors said their biggest concern now is the risk of germs that could enter his bloodstream and cause sepsis, a life-threatening infection. His medical team says he's expected to return to the Vatican, which may be unsurprising, as he has said previously that the position of pope is a lifelong commitment. Tens of thousands attend funeral of late Hezbollah leader Despite his illness, Francis mentioned the war in Ukraine, saying 'Tomorrow (Feb. 23) will be the 3rd anniversary of the large-scale war against Ukraine. A pain. And shameful occasion for the whole of humanity,' going on to call for the 'gift of peace in all armed conflicts around the world.' Doctors said he will stay hospitalized at least through next weekend. A mass for the pope in his native city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, is expected at 9:15 a.m. Sunday.	https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/pope-francis-peaceful-night-blood-transfusions-pneumonia/	2025-02-23T06:40:32-08:00	https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/11/6744708927ada3.30930926.jpeg?w=900
